My predecessor, Roberto R. Roy, held the position from August 20, 2012 to June 30, 2019. During this period, the Third Set of Locks was inaugurated, as a symbol of Panamanian ingenuity and effort; proof that the Canal seeks to provide the best possible service to the country and the world. As negotiator of the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties between Panama and the United States, I am proud of the fact that the Panama Canal has become an invaluable asset for all Panamanians; as a result of the efforts of those who struggled to achieve its transference to Panamanian hands. In conjunction with the fact that it remains thriving thanks to the work and effort of the Panamanian workforce that comprise it and has managed that the interoceanic route fulfills its mission, breaking paradigms and exceeding the expectations of its builders and first administrators.

Alberto Vallarino Clément Director Director Director 8 Message from the Administrator The Panama Canal ends Fiscal Year 2019 a few months after it reaches its first 20 years under Panamanian administration, with national and international recognition for its solid institutional and corporate management model. This model has as its main axis the continuous commitment to provide a quality service to its customers; managing to strengthen the route’s value and positioning it as an increasingly competitive route at the service of international maritime trade. This is demonstrated by its operational and financial results, which confirm that the Panama Canal has fulfilled its constitutional mandate to operate in a safe, continuous, efficient and profitable manner. By sizing the impact on our country, we found that the Panama Canal contributes to national development in multiple areas such as education, culture, environmental management, water security, as well as in activities that establish the organization as a fundamental part of the national and international Ricaurte (Catín) Vásquez M. logistics cluster.

Just as the feeling of joy drove us on December 31, 1999, we are now excited about the commitment to ensure the sustainable growth of our core business; and even more, being aware that the reality of the maritime industry, which we serve, is immersed in geopolitical complexity, and therefore impacted by the contraction and expansion of trade flows of the different routes. However, maritime transport remains more efficient moving certain goods between producers and consumers.

(1) General Information The Autoridad del Canal de Panamá, (the “ACP”) is an autonomous legal entity of public law established by Article 316 of Title XIV of the Constitution of the Republic of Panama and subject to special arrangements made by the provisions of that Title, of Law No. 19 of June 11, 1997 and regulations that dictates the Board of Directors as mandated by articles 319 and 323 of the same Title. This legal framework provides, inter alia, that the administration, operation, conservation, maintenance and modernization of the Canal de Panamá (the Canal) and its related activities corresponds to the ACP exclusively. In addition, it establishes a special labor regime applicable to the ACP and its work force, as well as provides it with its own patrimony and the right to its administration. The ACP, in coordination with government entities designated by law, is also responsible for the management, maintenance, use and conservation of the water resources of the Canal watershed, including lakes and their tributary streams. As part of this responsibility, the ACP optimizes these resources through the commercialization of water, energy and surplus goods, as well as tourism related activities in the Canal. In accordance with the terms of the Torrijos-Carter Treaty signed in 1977, at noon on December 31, 1999, the Canal reverted to the Republic of Panama free of debts and liens, becoming an inalienable patrimony of the Republic of Panama, open to the peaceful and uninterrupted transit of vessels of all nations and whose use will be subject to the requirements and conditions established by the Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama, the Organic Law of the ACP and its management. The main ACP offices are located at the Administration Building No. 101, Balboa, Corregimiento de Ancón, Republic of Panama. (2) Basis of Preparation (a) Statement of Compliance The financial statements of the ACP, for the year ended September 30, 2019, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). The financial statements of the ACP, for the year ended September 30, 2019, were approved by the Board of Directors and authorized to be issued on December 12, 2019. The accompanying financial statements have been translated from Spanish into English. 11 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (2) Basis of Preparation, continued (b) Measurement Base The financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for the following items in the statement of financial position: Fair value securities with change in other comprehensive income (FVOCI) Securities available for sale and hedging instruments Reimbursement right to ACP Employees benefits (c) Functional and Presentation Currency These financial statements are presented in balboas (B/.), monetary unit of the Republic of Panama, which is at par and of free exchange with the U.S. dollar (USD $). The Republic of Panama does not issue paper currency and instead uses the U.S. dollar as legal and functional tender. The ACP's financial statements are expressed in thousands of balboas (B/.). (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies The ACP has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all the years presented in these financial statements: (a) Fair Value Measurement Fair value is the price that would be received for selling an asset or paid for transferring a liability in an orderly transaction between the main market participants on the measurement date, or in its absence, in the most advantageous market to which the ACP has access at the time. The fair value of a liability reflects the effect of a default risk. When applicable, the ACP measures the instrument´s fair value using a quoted price for that instrument in an active market. A market is considered to be active if the transactions of these assets or liabilities take place frequently and with sufficient volume and, in addition, information is provided on a continuous basis allowing prices to be set. When there is no quoted price in an active market, the ACP uses valuation techniques that maximize the use of relevant observable input data and minimize the use of unobservable input data. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all the factors that the market participants would take into account when setting the price of a transaction. The best evidence of fair value is a quoted market price in an active market. In the event that the market for a financial instrument is not considered as active, a valuation technique is used. The decision as to whether a market is active can include, but is not limited to, consideration of factors such as the magnitude and frequency of commercial activity, the availability of prices and the magnitude of offers and sales. In markets that are not active, to guarantee that the transaction price provides evidence of fair value or to determine the adjustments to the transaction prices that are necessary to measure the instrument´s fair value, additional work is required during the valuation process. 12 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued The fair value of a demand deposit is not less than the amount to be received when it becomes due, discounted from the first date in which payment may be required. The ACP recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period during which the change occurred. (b) Transactions with Related Parties All transactions with related parties are disclosed based on the established criteria in the International Accounting Standard (IAS 24)Related Party Disclosures . The ACP considers as a related party, all Government entities and any individual or legal entity that could be significantly influenced by key ACP personnel or could significantly influence key ACP personnel that participate in operational or financial decisions, or have representation from the ACP in other decision-making bodies, which may affect the preparation and results of the ACP's financial statements. This definition includes and considers as a related party, members of the board of directors and ACP´s Administration key personnel, their relatives, dependents or close persons, which include the spouse, their children or children of the spouse, or persons of analogous relationship of affectivity. (c) Revenue Recognition The ACP implemented IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers as of October 1, 2018. This new standard provides a framework that replaces the revenue recognition guide existing in IFRS and establishes a five-step model for accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers: identify the contract (s) with the customer; identify performance obligations; determine the transaction price; assign the transaction price to performance obligations to the extent that the contract covers more than one performance obligation; and recognize income when performance obligations are met. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer Depending on whether certain criteria are met, revenues are recognized: over time, in a way that represents the entity's performance; or at a certain moment in time, when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the client. The ACP adopted IFRS 15 using the method retroactively with the cumulative effect of the initial application of this standard recognized on the date of initial application. The adoption of IFRS 15 did not change the ACP revenue recognition policy. IFRS 15 applies only to the results reported for fiscal year 2019. Specific recognition criteria described below are met before the revenue is recognized: Toll Revenue Toll revenue is recognized at a specific time, when the transit service is provided through the Canal. 13 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Sale of Electric Energy and Power Revenues from the sale of electric energy and power is recognized based on contractual and physical delivery of energy and power valued at contractual rates or at prevailing spot market rates. Revenue includes unbilled amounts for electricity sales and installed capacity supplied but not liquidated at the end of each period, which are recorded at contractual rates or at estimated prices in the spot market at the end of each period. Sale of Water Revenues from the sale of water is recognized when treated water is delivered based on prices contracted with the Instituto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales (IDAAN). Services Rendered Revenue from other services that include leases of communications structures, leasing of buildings, extraction of raw water, among others, are recognized over time. The client simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity's performance. Some of the contracts include the free transfer of improvements to the ACP, an obligation that is satisfied in a moment when the concession period is over, so the income will be recognized at that time. Interests Interest earned on financial instruments measured at amortized cost and financial assets measured at fair value with changes in other comprehensive income (OCI) are recognized using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the financial instrument expected life to the carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. Interest income is included in a separate line in the income statement. (d) Transfer to Panamanian Treasury Transfer to Panamanian Treasury corresponds to net profit minus the funds required for contributions to the investment programs and for other equity reserves approved by the Board of Directors according to the ACP Organic Law. (e) Fees Paid to the Panamanian Treasury Fees paid to the Panamanian Treasury, which correspond to fees paid by the ACP in concept of per ton transit right, and public services fees, as mandated by the Panamanian Constitution, are recognized when incurred. By Constitutional mandate, the ACP is not subject to the payment of taxes, duties, tariffs, charges, rates or tribute of a national or municipal nature, with the exception of employer Panama Social Security payments, educational insurance, workmen’s compensation of employees, public service fees, and the per ton transit right of the Canal. (f) Borrowing and Bonds Issuance Costs Borrowing and bonds issuance costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time for their intended use are capitalized as part of the cost of the assets, until all or practically all activities necessary to prepare the asset for its use are completed. All other borrowing costs are recognized as expenses in the period they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interests and other costs that ACP incurs in connection with the borrowing contract. 14 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued (g) Property, Plant and Equipment The Panama Canal as an entity defined by the Panamanian Constitution, which, according to Chapter I of Law No. 19 of 1997, is the inalienable patrimony of the Panamanian nation and includes (i) the waterway itself, (ii) its anchorages, berths, and entrances, (iii) lands and marine, river and lake waters, (iv) locks, (v) auxiliary dams, and (vi) dikes and water control structures. The ACP owns Canal installations, buildings, structures and equipment that support the operation of the Panama Canal. In addition, pursuant to Article 49 of Law No. 19 of 1997, the ACP is entitled to dispose of these assets to the extent they are not necessary for the functioning of the Panama Canal. These assets include electrical power plants and water purification plants, piers and docks, dry docks, radio stations, telemetric and hydro-meteorological stations, dredge spoil areas, spillways, lighthouses, buoys and navigation aids and pipelines. Property, plant, and equipment held for use, the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, are presented in the statement of financial position at their acquisition cost or production cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment that would have occurred. Replacements and improvements of complete elements that increase the useful life of the asset or its economic capacity are accounted as property, plant, and equipment, with the respective retirement of any replaced element. When different parts of significant relative value of property, plant, and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted separately. Following the accrual principle, periodic maintenance, preservation and repair costs are recognize in the income statement when incurred: Depreciation is calculated on the cost values following a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets, with the understanding that the land on which buildings and other constructions are settled have an indefinite useful life and, therefore, are not subject to depreciation. The following estimated useful lives are used to calculate depreciation: Years Buildings Structures Equipments 3 – 15 Asphalt roads Automobiles, trucks, personal computers, servers 20 – 50 Concrete, steel Water tanks, floating piers, Locomotives, tugs, dredges, concrete streets floating cranes 75 Concrete piers, bridges, range Gates, cranes towers 100 Locks structures, dams, dry-dock 15 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Constructions in progress include all direct charges for materials, labor, research, equipment, professional fees and indirect costs related to the works. Once these works are concluded, the construction value will become part of the property, plant, and equipment and its depreciation will begin. Items of property, plant, and equipment are derecognized when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the disposal proceeds and carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement when the asset is derecognized. (h) Investment Properties Investment properties are measured at acquisition cost, including other transactional associated costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are stated by the ACP at its cost value, applying the same requirements as for property, plant, and equipment. Transfers of investment properties to properties occupied by the owner or vice versa, are made only when there is a change in the use of the asset, which has been evidenced by: The start of the occupation by the ACP, in the case of a transfer of an investment property to property, plant and equipment. The end of the occupation by ACP, in the case of transfer of property, plant, and equipment to investment property. Depreciation is calculated following a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets, with the understanding that the land on which buildings and other constructions are settled have an indefinite useful life and, therefore, are not subject to depreciation. Disbursements due to repairs and maintenance that do not meet the conditions for asset recognition are recognized as expense in the income statement when incurred. (i) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets The ACP assesses, at each reporting period date, whether there is an indication that a nonfinancial asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, the ACP estimates the asset’s recoverable amount, defined as the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. When the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable value, the asset is consider as impaired and it is adjusted to its recoverable value. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the specific risks to the asset. Determined impairment losses are recognized in the income statement of that year. (j) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash and highly liquid short term investments which their maturity are equal or less than three months since the acquisition date as of the date of the financial position. For the statement of cash flows purposes, ACP presents the cash and cash equivalents net of overdrafts, if any. 16 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued (k) Inventories Supplies and materials for operations and fuel inventories are shown at the lower of cost between its acquisition cost and its net realizable value. Inventories are valued using the average cost method based on purchase cost to suppliers, not exceeding the realizable value, net of allowance for obsolescence of supplies and materials. The ACP classifies its inventories as non-current when expected to be used or consumed in the operation after more than twelve months. (l) Provisions Provisions are recognized when the ACP has a present obligation, either legal or constructive in nature, as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation amount. The amount recognized as a provision must be the best estimate of the disbursement required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period considering the corresponding risks and uncertainties. When a provision is measured using estimated cash flow to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of such cash flow. When the recovery of some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision is expected, an account receivable is recognized if it is virtually certain that the income will be received and the amount of the account receivable can be measured with certainty. (m) Provision for marine accidents and other claims The ACP is responsible for recording the provision for marine accidents and for claims from counterparts as soon as an economic obligation with high probability derived from these events is known. For marine accidents, when an accident occurs, the ACP makes a detailed investigation in order to know the causes of the accident. Once the causes are known and, if applicable, a provision is recorded based on the estimated cost of both permanent and temporary repairs and other related costs, which the Administration determines are the responsibility of the ACP. On each date of the statement of financial position, the amount of the provision is reviewed and, if necessary, adjusted to reflect the best estimate at that time. In the case of contractors and other counterparts, when disputes arise due to the execution, interpretation or termination of a contract, it is first required that the contracting officer determine if the claim has merit and, if so, estimate the probable amount of the obligation to try to reach an agreement with the counterparty. If an agreement is not given, the contracting officer documents the result of this attempt, recognizes a provision for the amount of the obligation and the parties go through on administrative dispute resolution process agreed in the contract. In some contracts, arbitration in law is established as the jurisdictional instance for the resolution of disputes. 17 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued The ACP will make the corresponding payment of the claims whose merit is duly supported and accepted by the Authority, in its administrative stage or in the judicial stage according to Article 69 of the Organic Law or in compliance with a final decision executed by the maritime courts. In those cases in which the ACP could be liable as a result of a claim for a contract, if it contains an arbitration clause, the claim will be resolved by the mechanism and Arbitration Center established in the respective contract. If there is no arbitration clause in the contract, the case will be resolved by the Third Chamber of the Panamanian Supreme Court of Justice. (n) Employee Benefits Ninety two percent (92%) of the workforce in the ACP is represented by six bargaining units (unions) that have negotiated collective agreements which terms are periodically negotiated. During fiscal year 2016, four collective agreements were settled, the Non-professionals and the Professionals, which will be in effect until year 2019, the Board of Captains and Officials that will be in effect until year 2020, and the Pilots until the year 2021. In fiscal year 2017, two collective agreements were settled: the firemen, in effect until year 2021, and the machine engineers, until year 2020. In defined benefit plans for the voluntary retirement of employees, an actuarial liability is recognized not only for the legal obligation under the formal terms of the plan, but also for the implicit projections of constructive nature arising from expectations created by informal practices as required under IAS 19. These actuarial projections, of constructive nature, do not constitute a legal labor obligation for the ACP, nor are they provisioned. Voluntary Retirement Plans The ACP provides two unfunded defined benefit plans for voluntary retirement of employees. The cost of providing these benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gains and losses are fully recognized in the period which they occurred in the statement of comprehensive income. The liability for defined benefits comprises the present value of both, the actual and constructive obligations of defined benefits. Under IAS 19, the ACP determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liability for the period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year, taking into consideration any changes in the benefit liability during the period as a result of benefit payments. Defined Benefit Contribution Plan Retirement benefits for employees are provided through a defined contribution plan through the Caja de Seguro Social which assumes responsibility for retirement. Contributions are made based on parameters set by the Organic Law of that institution. The ACP does not assume responsibility or obligation other than the payment determined by Law. 18 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued (o) Reimbursement Right to ACP The right to reimbursement to ACP is an insurance policy in which the indemnities return to the ACP to reimburse all the benefits paid to employees as an incentive for voluntary retirement. In accordance with IAS 19, it is recognized at fair value as a separate asset when it is virtually certain that a third party will reimburse some or all of the disbursements required to settle a defined benefit obligation. Changes in the fair value of the right to reimbursement are disaggregated and recognized in the same way as for changes in the fair value of the related obligation plan. The components of defined benefit cost are recognized net of changes in the carrying amount of the right to reimbursement. The fair value of the right to reimbursement to the ACP arising from an insurance policy that exactly matches the amount and timing of some or all defined benefits payable in terms of a defined benefit plan, is considered the present value of related constructive actuarial obligation, subject to any reduction required if the reimbursement is not fully recoverable. (p) Financial Instruments The ACP has adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments issued in July 2014 with initial application date October 1, 2018. The requirements of IFRS 9 do not represent a significant change at the time of recognition or how to measure assets and liabilities, and related expenses and income. Changes in the accounting policies of the adoption of IFRS 9 have been applied retrospectively, with the exception of the following: Comparative periods have not been updated. The differences in the book values of the financial assets resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9 are recognized in the earnings available to distribute as of October 1, 2018; therefore, the information presented for 2018 does not reflect the requirements of IFRS 9 and, therefore, is not comparable with that presented for 2019 according to IFRS 9. The following evaluation was carried out on the basis of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of initial application, which consisted in determining the business model in which a financial asset is maintained. All hedging relationships designated under IAS 39 as of September 30, 2018 meet the criteria for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 as of October 1, 2018 and, consequently, are considered continuous hedging relationships. Recognition of financial instruments The ACP uses the negotiation date to record its financial instrument transactions. (q) Financial assets and liabilities Financial assets are classified at the date of initial recognition, based on the nature and purpose of the acquisition of the financial asset. Accounting policies used as of October 1, 2018: Classification and measurement Financial assets under IFRS9 In their initial recognition, financial assets are classified as measured at: amortized cost (AC) and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). 19 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Amortized Cost (AC): A financial asset is measured at amortized cost and not at fair value with changes in results if it meets both of the following conditions: The asset is maintained within a business model whose objective is to maintain assets to obtain contractual cash flows; and On specified dates, the contractual conditions of the financial asset give place, to cash flows that are only payments of principal and interest on the outstanding principal amount. Financial assets at amortized cost represent trade accounts receivable and other and bank deposits. After the initial recognition, these assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. The amortized cost is reduced by impairment losses. Interest income and impairment are recognized in the income statement. Any gain or loss on an account derecognition is recognized in the income statement. Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if both of the following conditions are met and is not measured at fair value through profit or loss: The asset is maintained within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows and sell these financial assets; and On specified dates, the contractual conditions of the financial asset give place, to cash flows that are only payments of the principal and interest on the outstanding principal amount. These financial assets are composed of debt instruments not classified as financial instruments at fair value recognized in profit and loss (FVPL) or at amortized cost and are subject to the same approval criteria as the rest of the loan portfolio. After the initial recognition, these assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Interest income calculated under the effective interest method and impairment are recognized in the income statement. Other net gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Unrealized gains or losses are reported as net increases or decreases in other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity until they are realized. 20 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Evaluation of the business model The evaluation at the portfolio level and the objective of the business model that applies to the financial instruments of these portfolios includes the following: The policies and objectives set for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice that include the management strategy to define: (i) collection of contractual interest income (ii) maintain a defined interest yield profile (iii) be able to sell at any time for liquidity needs or in order to optimize the risk / return profile of a portfolio based on interest rates, risk margins, current duration and the defined goal. The way in which the ACP senior management team and board of directors are informed about the behavior of the different portfolios; The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held in the business model) and the way in which these risks are managed; The frequency and value of sales in previous periods, the reasons for those sales and expectations about future sales activity. Evaluation of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) For the purpose of this evaluation, principal is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at the time of initial recognition. “Interest” is defined as the consideration of the value of money over time and the credit risk associated to the amount of the outstanding principal for a particular period of time and for other risks consistent with a basic loan agreement and other associated costs, as well as the profit margin. In assessing whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest, the ACP focused on the contractual terms of the instrument. This evaluation considered, among others: Contingent events that could change the amount and / or periodicity of cash flows Leverage conditions Advance payment terms and extension Terms that limit the ACP to obtain cash flows from specific assets (example, asset agreements without resources); and Characteristics that modify the considerations for the value of money over time (example, periodic review of interest rates). 21 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Accounting policies used before October 1, 2018: Classification and measurement Financial assets under IAS 39 Financial assets are classified in the following specific categories: receivables, investments held to maturity, financial assets available for sale and financial instruments designated as hedges recorded at fair value. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial asset and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Trade and other receivable Trade and other receivables are financial assets with fixed or determined payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial recognition, trade accounts receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Advances and other receivable to contractors Advances to contractors for the acquisition of physical assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are initially classified as a non-financial asset because the recovery is expected to be made through work and not with cash or another financial instrument. When these advances are expected to be settled in cash or through the execution of third-party guarantees, the ACP reclassifies the advance as a financial instrument in the account advances and other receivable to contractor, adjusted to its fair value which is determined by using a discount rate representative of the currency in which the instrument is defined, the expected term for collection and the debtor's credit risk at the time of reclassification. This adjustment is recognized as a loss in financial costs and amortized through the financial income account until the collection expected date. Investments held to maturity Consist of deposits in banks whose payments are fixed or determinable or with a fixed maturity that the ACP intends to hold until they expire. After the initial measurement, investments held to maturity are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Financial assets available for sale Consist of securities acquired with the intention of keeping them for an indefinite period of time, which can be sold in response to liquidity needs or changes in interest rates. After their initial recognition, the securities available for sale are measured at their fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the securities available for sale are directly recognized in the statement of equity until the financial assets have been written off or an impairment is being determined. At that time, the accumulated gain or loss, previously recognized in the statement of equity, is recognized in the income statement. The fair value of an investment in securities is generally determined based on the quoted market price at the date of the statement of financial position. If a reliable quoted market price is not available, the fair value of the instrument is estimated using models for price calculation or discounted cash flows techniques. 22 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Policy applicable as of October 1, 2018: Impairment of financial assets At the date of the statement of financial position, it is determined whether there is an objective evidence of impairment in the financial instruments, and it is used the reserve method to provide for losses in the financial instruments. The IFRS 9 replaces the incurred loss model in IAS 39 with an “expected credit loss (ECL) model. The new impairment model is applicable to the following financial assets: Trade and other accounts receivable Bank deposits Debt instruments The assessment of whether credit risk of a financial asset has significantly increased is one of the implemented critical judgments in the impairment model. Loss allowances are recognized for the amount equivalent to the 12-month ECL or for the residual maturity of the financial asset, whichever is the lower, in the following cases: Trade and other accounts receivable on which the credit risk has not significantly increased since its initial recognition; Investments in debt instruments, demand deposits and time deposits that are determined to reflect low credit risk at the reporting date. For all other cases, allowances are recognized at an amount equal to the assets’ lifetime ECL. The 12-month ECL is the portion of the ECL that results from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within a 12-month period after the reporting date. Measurement of the ECL The ECL is an estimated weighted probability of credit loss which is measured according to the following items: Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: the present value of all arrears of contractual cash payments (example, the difference between the cash flows owed and the cash flows that the ACP expects to receive). Impaired financial assets at the reporting date: the difference between the book value and the present value of the estimated future cash flows. 23 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Definition of impairment It is considered an impaired financial asset when: It is unlikely that the debtor will fully pay his credit obligations to the ACP, without resources from the ACP to take actions such as executing the collateral (in case they maintain it); or The debtor has delinquency of more than 90 days in any significant credit obligation. For the fixed income financial instruments the following concepts are included, among others: • Low external rating of the issuer; • Contractual payments are not made on the due date or in the stipulated period or grace period; • There is a virtual certainty of suspension of payments; • Its likely to go bankrupt or file a bankruptcy petition or similar action; • The financial asset stops trading in an active market given its financial difficulties. In assessing whether a debtor is in default, the following indicators are considered: • Qualitative (for example, breach of contractual clauses); • Quantitative (for example, delinquency status and non-payment on another obligation of the same issuer to the ACP); and The inputs used in the evaluation of whether financial assets are impaired and their importance may vary over time to reflect changes in circumstances. Significant increase in credit risk To determine whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since its initial recognition, considers reasonable and sustainable information that is relevant and available without disproportionate cost or effort, including information and analysis of a quantitative and qualitative nature based on historical experience and the expert evaluation of credit including future projections. It is considered as the main indicators of the significant increase in risk, the variations in the risk rating and the atypical increases in the credit margin or in the reference prices of the credit default swaps (CDS) of the financial instruments. Credit Risk Rating A credit risk rating is assigned to financial assets that do not have an available international credit risk rating. The ACP identifies significant increases in credit risk through the use of a quantitative model of payment default prediction that assigns a credit rating equivalent to that of Standard & Poors and the application of expert credit judgment. 24 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued For investments in debt instruments and time deposits, credit risk rating of international short-term investment from Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch Ratings and its changes are used to establish whether there is a significant increase in risk and for the PD calculation. At initial recognition a credit rating is assigned to each exposure based on available information about the debtor. Exposures will be subject to continuous monitoring, which may result in the change to a different credit risk rating. Generating the probability of default (PD) term structure Credit risk ratings are the main input to determine the PD term structure for different exposures. The PD of investments in debt instruments, deposits in banks and advances and other accounts receivable is estimated using approximates of liquid markets based on international credit risk rating of investments or deposits. Assessment of significant increase in credit risk A general framework has been established that incorporates quantitative and qualitative information to assess whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since its initial recognition. The initial framework is aligned with the internal process of the ACP for credit risk management. The criteria for determining whether the credit risk has increased significantly will vary by portfolio and will include limits based on defaults. The ACP assess whether the credit risk of a particular exposure has increased if, based on a quantitative model, the probability of expected credit loss in the remaining life increased significantly since the initial recognition. In determining the increase in credit risk, the expected credit loss in the remaining life is adjusted for changes in maturities. In certain circumstances, by using credit experts judgment and relevant historical information, the ACP may determine that an exposure has experienced a significant increase in credit risk if qualitative factors indicate so and those factors may not be fully captured by the quantitative analyzes performed periodically. The effectiveness of the criteria used to identify significant increases in credit risk is monitored through regular reviews. Inputs in the measurement of the ECL The following variables are key inputs used in measuring ECL: Probability of default (PD) Loss given default (LGD) Exposure at default (EAD) 25 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued PD is the probability of default of one year applied to the portfolio for expected losses of less than 12 months and during the lifetime for expected losses of more than 12 months. The default rates are obtained from the Bloomberg system (1-yr Default Probability) for counterparties that have a credit risk rating. For financial instruments that do not have a credit risk rating, the S&P Global Income Research and S&P Creditpro transition table is used as a source. The LGD for financial assets is the estimated loss percentage of the amount exposed in case of default. The LGD is obtained from the Bloomberg system for counterparties that have a credit risk rating. For financial instruments that do not have a credit risk rating, Bloomberg (1-yr Default Probability and Loss Given Default) are used in the same way. The EAD is the accounting balance of the principal amount and interest on financial assets at the end of the period under review. Policy applicable before October 1, 2018: Impairment of financial assets The ACP assesses whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired at each statement of financial position date. A financial asset is impaired if there is evidence that as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset, there has been a negative impact on its estimated future cash flows. Derecognition of financial assets A financial asset is derecognized only when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows from the asset have expired; or when all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred substantially. If all the risks and rewards of the property are not transferred or substantially withheld and control of the transferred asset is continued, then the interest withheld on the asset and a related liability for the amounts that it may have to pay are recognized. If substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset are retained, the financial asset continues to be recognized and a guaranteed liability is also recognized for the amount received. Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value in addition to the direct transaction costs. After initial recognition, the financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The profit or loss is recognized in the income statement when a financial liability is derecognized as well as through the amortization process. Financial liabilities include borrowings and bonds issued, trade and other payables, and other financial liabilities. Borrowings and bonds payable Borrowings and bonds payable are initially recognized at fair value at their respective contractual dates, including the costs attributable to the transaction. 26 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued After its initial recognition, these financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The amortized cost is calculated considering any premium or discount at the time of purchase and the wages or fees that belong to the effective interest rate. Trade and other payable Accounts payable do not earn interest and are booked at their face value. Other financial liabilities Heading financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date the hedge contract is entered into, and are subsequently measured to their fair value at each reporting date. The resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately, except for the effective portion of a hedging instrument for which the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. The ACP designates certain financial instruments as hedges of a transaction previously seen as highly exposed to changes in cash flows either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecasted transactions, or the foreign currency risk of firm commitments (cash flow hedge). A financial instrument with a positive fair value is recognized as a financial asset, while a financial instrument with a negative fair value is recognized as a financial liability. A financial instrument is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realized or settled within 12 months. Policy applicable as of October 1, 2018: Hedge accounting The ACP applies IFRS 9“Financial Instruments” hedge accounting rules in full. The financial instruments held for risk management purposes are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. These instruments are initially recognized at fair value at the date a hedging contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each reporting date. On initial designation of the hedge, the ACP formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), including the risk management objective and strategy in undertaking the hedge, together with the method that will be used to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The ACP makes an assessment, both at inception of the hedge relationship and on an ongoing basis, of whether the hedging instrument(s) is (are) expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged item(s) during the period for which the hedge is designated. The ACP uses financial instruments designated as hedges to manage the interest rate risks and the variability of light diesel prices used in its operations. These financial instruments contracts designated as hedges are classified as cash flow hedges. They are reported as assets or liabilities, as applicable. 27 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued In order to qualify for hedge accounting, these instruments must be considered highly effective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. Each instrument must be designated as a hedge, with documentation of the risk management objective and strategy, including identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item and the risk exposure, as well as how effectiveness will be assessed prospectively. Any ineffectiveness must be reported in current-year profit or loss. Hedge accounting relationship When the ACP enters into a hedge accounting relationship, the first requirement is that the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be expected to move in the opposite direction as a result of the change in the hedged risk. This requirement is fulfilled for the hedging relationships carried by the ACP as the underlying of the hedging instrument matches or is closely aligned with the hedged risk. The ACP makes a qualitative assessment which considers the following: a) maturity; b) nominal amount; c) cash flow dates; d) interest rate basis; and e) credit risk, Hedge ratio The hedge ratio is the relation between the amount of hedged item and the amount of the hedging instrument. For most of the hedging relationships, the hedge ratio is 1:1 as the underlying of the hedging instrument perfectly matches the designated hedged risk. For a hedging relationship with a correlation between the hedged item and the hedging instrument that is not 1:1 relationship, generally set the hedge ratio so as to adjust for the type of relation in order to improve effectiveness. Discontinuation of hedge accounting The ACP discontinues hedge accounting prospectively in the following situations: 1. It is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item. 2. The derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. 3. It is determined that designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. The ACP carries all financial instruments designated as hedges in the statement of financial position at fair value. Cash flow hedges When a financial instrument is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability that could affect profit or loss, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and recognized in profit or loss when the hedged cash flows affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss as loss on financial instruments, net. 28 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued If the cash flow hedge relationship is terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, or the hedge designation is revoked, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively and the related amounts in other comprehensive income are reclassified into profit or loss when hedged cash flows occurs. Accounting policies used before October 1, 2018 Hedge accounting The ACP designates certain financial instruments as cash flow hedges. At inception date of the hedge, the ACP documents the hedging relationship and the objective and risk management strategy to undertake the hedging transaction. The documentation shall include the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction or instrument, the nature of the hedged risk and the manner in which the effectiveness of the hedging instrument will be measured to compensate the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or the changes in the cash flows of the hedged risk. These hedges are expected to be highly effective in order to mitigate changes in cash flows. Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of financial instruments that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognized in profit or loss, within the same line of the income statement as the recognized hedged item. However, when a transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a nonfinancial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the nonfinancial asset or the non-financial liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, any gain or loss accumulated in equity is recycle from equity to the income statement. Derecognition of financial liabilities A financial liability is derecognized if it expires, cancels or fulfills the obligations of the ACP and when its conditions are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability is recognized based on the new conditions at fair value. 29 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued (r) New International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Interpretations not yet adopted At the date of the financial statements there are standards that have not yet been applied in their preparation: IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 replaces the current IAS 17 Leases standard. IFRS 16 Leases will be effective for ACP as of October 1, 2019. IFRS 16 changes the way of the lease accounting for lessees, using a unique model to account for such transactions. This unique model determines that a lessee must recognize a right-of-use asset, which represents his right to use the underlying asset, and a lease liability, which represents his obligation to make future lease payments. IFRS 16 includes exemptions for its application for short-term leases and leases in which the underlying asset is of low value. For leases recognized as financial in accordance to IAS 17, no significant impact is expected from the adoption of IFRS 16. Transition The ACP will apply IFRS 16, as of October 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. This approach establishes the following in relation to recognition and measurement: Lease Liability It will be recognized at the date of initial application for leases previously classified as operating leases. It will be measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted at the incremental borrowing rate of the ACP at the date of the initial application. Right-to-use asset It will be recognized at the date of initial application for leases previously classified as operating leases. It will be measured at an amount equivalent to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any lease payments advanced or caused in relation with that lease recognized in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of the initial application. The information presented in the financial statements for the year 2018 will not be reexpressed. The ACP has decided to apply the exemption from the standard for existing leases to give continuity to the definition of lease on the transition date. This means that it will apply IFRS 16 to all contracts concluded before October 1, 2019 and identified as leases in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 46. Preliminary Impact Assessment The ACP has evaluated the estimated impact that the initial application of IFRS 16 will have on its financial statements, based on its lease agreements. 30 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued The preliminary assessment estimates that as of October 1, 2019, the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will represent an amount of approximately B/.13,593 according to the information currently available. That is, an approximate increase of 0.09% in assets and 0.38% in debt. A slight impact on profitability indicators is expected. For the year 2020, it is estimated a decrease of B/.4,873 in the lease expense, an increase in the depreciation of B/.4,732; and an increase in interest expense of B/.229. Amendments to IFRS 9: Prepayment features with negative compensation Under IFRS 9, a debt instrument can be measured at amortized cost or to fair value through other comprehensive income, provided that the contractual cash flows are “solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding” (the SPPI criterion) and the instrument is held within the appropriate business model for that classification. The amendments to IFRS 9 clarify that a financial asset passes the SPPI criterion regardless of the event or circumstance that causes the early termination of the contract and irrespective of which party pays or receives reasonable compensation for the early termination of the contract. The modifications will be applied retroactively to the reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2019 or later, allowing early application. Amendments to IAS 19: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement The amendments to IAS 19 address the accounting when a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs during a reporting period. The amendments specify that when a plan amendment, curtailment or settlement occurs during the annual reporting period, an entity is required to: Determine current service cost for the remainder of the period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement, using the actuarial assumptions used to remeasure the net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets after that event. Determine net interest for the remainder of the period after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement using: the net defined benefit liability (asset) reflecting the benefits offered under the plan and the plan assets after that event; and the discount rate used to remeasure that net defined benefit liability (asset). The amendments also clarify that an entity first determines any past service cost, or a gain or loss on settlement, without considering the effect of the asset ceiling. This amount is recognized in profit or loss. An entity then determines the effect of the asset ceiling after the plan amendment, curtailment or settlement. Any change in that effect, excluding amounts included in the net interest, is recognized in other comprehensive income. The amendments apply to plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements occurring on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins on or after 1 January 2019, with early application permitted. These amendments will apply only to any future plan amendments, curtailments, or settlements of an entity. 31 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, continued Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle These improvements include: IAS 23 Borrowing Costs The amendments clarify that an entity treats as part of general borrowings any borrowing originally made to develop a qualifying asset when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare that asset for its intended use or sale are completed. An entity applies those amendments to borrowing costs incurred on or after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which the entity first applies those amendments. An entity applies those amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early application allowed. Since the ACP current practice is in line with these amendments, the entity does not expect any effect on its financial statements. Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty These financial statements are prepared in conformity with IFRS which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Future actual results could differ from those estimates.

In exchange, the MOP promised to pay the ACP B/.33,663. As soon as the ACP transfers the control of the facilities to the MOP, these facilities will be derecognized of the property, plant and equipment account and the corresponding profit will be recognized in the results of the year. According to the agreement, the ACP will maintain control and ownership of the land on which these facilities are built, which will be transferred to the MOP. 47 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (21) Other Liabilities, continued In June 2015, under contract No. CCO-15-001, the company Large Screen Cinema Corp. obtained the concession for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of a large-format cinema on an adjacent area of the Miraflores Visitor Center, for a period of 10 years, renewable for another period of 10 years at ACP´s option. According to the contract, once the construction phase was completed, the concessionaire transferred to the ACP the building as well as additional assets free of liens and charge. The transferred assets were recognized as Investment Property for an amount of B/.7,705 and a deferred liability was recognized, which will be amortized in a straight line during the term of the contract (10 years) to the Other Income account. As of September 30, 2019, the amortized amount of the liability (deferred income) is for B/.577, resulting in a balance of B/.7,128.

(25) Employee Benefits The constructive and formal liability of the employee benefit programs was as follows: 2019 2018 Benefit for employment retirement 381,266 331,591 In July 2012, the ACP established the Voluntary Retirement Incentive program (VRI) at the required retirement age for permanent employees and managers of the ACP. Before the establishment of the VRI, there was another program named the Labor Retirement Benefit (LRB) which continues to be active. The employee shall select between one program and the other, but in no case will be able to choose both. These programs were established for an indefinite period of time and could be suspended or modified by the Board of Directors. The LRB remains an option because it is included as such in collective bargaining agreement of the ACP, however, the probability that the employees choose the LRB is very low since the benefits provided by VRI are higher. 49 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (25) Employee Benefits, continued The requirements and criteria under the LRB are: 1) it applies to permanent employees in positions of trust and those permanent employees covered by collective bargaining agreement from the moment in which they complies with the required retirement age, according to the standards of the Caja de Seguro Social (regular and early retirement). Temporary employees, officials or permanent employees covered canal pilots’ collective agreements are not eligible, 2) eligible employees must retire from the ACP within the period of time between the age of early retirement (55 years old for women and 60 years old for men), and 60 days after the regular retirement age (57 years old for women and 62 years for men), and 3) file Termination of Employment Relationship Form at least 30 calendar days before retirement, but not beyond the date you meet the regular retirement age. The requirements and criteria under the VRI are: 1) the employee receives the benefit of VRI only if complies with 10 years of service and retires at the required age (early or regular) as may be he or she established by the Caja del Seguro Social, 2) be not less than 10 years working in the Canal; 3) the employee accepts the VRI offer, 4) the employee terminates work no later than 60 calendar days after completing the required age, 5) files the termination of employment form through voluntary resignation, and 6) the employee has no investigation initiated against him for the alleged commission of serious offenses against the ACP regulations that could result in his dismissal; and 7) have a maximum of two years of labor discontinuity so that if a license or several licenses are accepted or approved and separated from the ACP for more than two years to hold public or private positions, they will lose their eligibility to receive the VRI. The ACP contracted independent actuarial services in order to estimate the present value of the total cash flow expected to be paid by the ACP in the event that the plan is maintained through the years and to determine the accrued liability at September 30, 2019. This estimate was made using the projected unit credit method and actuarial assumptions were considered, such as: statistics for age average of personnel, frequency of dismissals, retirements, early retirements, mortality, salary increase and plan acceptance rates, among other related factors which allow to reliably estimate, in accordance with IFRS, the present value of the liability for both retirement plans. During the actuarial study, the fair value of the liability was calculated as required by the IFRS at different interest rates and at different case scenarios which included historical data provided by the ACP to the independent actuary at September 30, 2019 using a discount rate equal to the yield curve for corporate bonds with investment grade issued by companies in the United States of America (AAA, AA, A). Expenses related to the employee benefits plan are recorded in the bonus account for voluntary separation, mutual agreement or voluntary retirement, within the personal services category. 50 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (25) Employee Benefits, continued The components recognized in the statement of financial position, the income statement and statement of comprehensive income, for both retirement plans, are detailed as follows: Statement of Statement of Statement of Financial Income Comprehensive Financial Position Statement Income Position October 1, Benefit Net Benefits Actuarial September 30, 2018 costs interest paid adjustments 2019 Fair value of the benefits 331,591 27,050 8,442 31,572 45,755 381,266 The principal actuarial assumptions used are shown below: Age 2019 2018 % % Discount rate 2.9 4.1 Salary increase 3.75 3.75 Mortality Female 57 years 2.8 2.8 Male 62 years 5.9 5.9 Disability Female 57 years 1.2 1.2 Male 62 years 1.9 1.9 Following are the projected disbursements of voluntary retirement benefits expected in future years in case the plans are maintained: 2019 Maturity of the obligation: From 0 to 1 year 33,777 From 1 to 5 years 148,739 From 5 to 10 years 202,671 From 10 to 25 years 357,442 Beyond 25 years 83,284 At September 30, 2019, the average duration of the obligation for the defined benefit plans for voluntary retirement of employees (VRI/LRB) is approximately 7.72 years (2018: 7.78 years) at a discount rate of 2.9% (2018: 4.1%). 51 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (25) Employee Benefits, continued A quantitative sensitivity analysis for significant assumptions as of September 30, 2019 is as follows: Discount rate Increase of Decrease of Assumption Increase 25 bps Decrease 25 bps salary of 25 bps salary of 25 bps Sensitivity level Impact on defined benefit obligation (B/.7,588) B/.8,095 B/.7,702 (B/.7,478) Reiumbursement right to ACP The ACP contracted a reimbursement policy, in accordance with IAS 19, to cover the defined benefit plans for voluntary retirement of employees. The policy ensures the ACP reimbursement of all payments made by the ACP in respect of defined benefit plans for voluntary retirement of employees during the term of the plan as long as the ACP makes annual installments to the insurance company as a guarantee deposit equal to the probable amount that the ACP would pay during the year for the retirement benefit plans. In addition, the reimbursement policy provides protection in each year of its term against the risk that the ACP suffers any financially incapacitating event to meet payment of obligations to its employees, for any reason, including illiquidity, if occurred during the term of the policy, as long as the ACP is current in the payments of the premium and the defined benefit plans for voluntary retirement are in effect. The policy does not cover the risk of default of the ACP that could arise from internal fraud, catastrophic physical risks, nuclear war, terrorism, and epidemics, which has been estimated at 3.3% of the total insured amount. Changes in the reimbursement right to ACP during fiscal year 2019 are detailed as follows: Statement of Statement of Statement of Financial Comprehensive Financial Position Income Statement Income Position Reimbursement Reimbursements October 1, right cost Net during Actuarial September 30, 2018 of the year interest the year adjustments 2019 Reimbursement right to ACP 320,649 24,353 8,163 28,726 44,245 368,684 At September 30, 2019, the ACP paid the insurer B/.29,970 (2018: B/.27,350) in premiums of the reimbursement policy. (26) Risk Management The ACP maintains a conservative and prudent financial policy oriented to preserve its capital and generate optimal performance with low risk levels, performing various risk management activities throughout the year, including analysis, evaluation and risk mitigation. This allows management to plan and make decisions that enhance the economic contribution and operational excellence, improving the chances of achieving the strategic goals. 52 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued The ACP's capital structure consists of net debt (borrowings and bonds as detailed in notes 16 and 17), compensated by cash and bank deposit balances, other financial assets (See note 9) and equity of the enterprise (consisting of contributed capital, reserves, other equity accounts, and unappropriated retained earnings, as disclosed in notes 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively). Historically, the ACP has operated with its own resources due to the high cash levels generated by its operations, enabling it to afford its costs of operation, investment, functioning, maintenance and modernization. On December 2008 it subscribed a common term financing agreement with five development agencies, which committed to grant financings totaling B/.2,300,000 in order to partially finance the Canal Expansion Program. More recently, in September 2015, it issued bonds on the international market totaling B/.450,000 in order to partially finance the building of the bridge on the Atlantic side of the Canal.

The ACP does not present fair value for financial instruments such as short-term accounts receivables/payables because their book value reasonably approximates their fair value. Hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps are registered at their clean price, and the interest are recognized as interest payable. 56 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued Fair value measurement i.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities was to finance the Canal Expansion Program and the new bridge at the Atlantic side of the Canal. The ACP also has cash, bank deposits, operations with settlement in progress, trade and other receivables, and funds invested in short term debt instruments held until maturity. The ACP also contracts hedging instruments. The ACP is exposed to credit, market and liquidity risks. ACP’s administration monitors and manages these risks. ACP’s Treasury coordinates the access to international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks related to ACP's operations through internal risk reports, which analyze the exposures depending on their degree and magnitude. These risks include market risk (exchange risk and price risk), credit risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. Teams of specialists with the appropriate knowledge, experience and supervision perform all the activities related to risk hedging. The ACP maintains policies that provide written principles about foreign exchange risk management, interest rate risk, credit risk, and the use of hedge financial instruments and liquidity investment. The Office of the Inspector General periodically monitors the compliance with the policies and exposure limits. The ACP does not subscribe or negotiate financial instruments for speculative purposes. The ACP’s treasury quarterly updates the Board of Directors Finance Committee and follows up the risks and the implemented policies to mitigate risk exposure. The Office of the Inspector General periodically audits treasury operations, and reports to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors revises and approves the policies for managing each of the following risks: Market risk ACP’s activities are exposed primarily to financial risks due to variations of currency exchange, interest rates, and commodity prices out of its control. All ACP´s financial instruments are at fixed rate, with the exception of B/. 2,200,000 in borrowings which are at variable rate (see note 16). With the purpose of managing these risks exposures, the ACP subscribes a variety of hedge financial instruments approved by its Board of Directors based on the recommendations of the Liquidity and Hedging Committee, including: • Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of increases in interest rates. • Diesel price options/swaps to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in the price of this commodity, which is required for the Canal’s regular operations. Exchange rate risk management The ACP has established a policy to manage foreign currency risk related to its functional currency. The ACP only accepts payments in dollars of the United States of America and the investment criteria and applicable guidelines require that all deposits and investments in banks shall be in the dollars of the United States of America, or in other currencies authorized by the Board of Directors. 59 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued As of September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, the ACP does not maintain commitments in other currencies. It only maintains deposits in the currency of the United States of America. Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The interest rate risk of the cash flow and the interest rate risk of fair value consist in the fact that future cash flows and the value of a financial instrument fluctuate due to changes in market rates. ACP’s net financial cost can fluctuate as a result to unanticipated movements on interest rates.

The ACP does not account for any of its financial instruments, whether assets or liabilities, at fair value through profit or loss. Nor does it designate derivative instruments as fair value hedges. Therefore, a change in interest rate on the reporting date would not affect net income. The ACP administration performs simulations on its financial assets and liabilities in order to evaluate interest rate risk and its impact in the fair value of financial instruments. To manage interest rate risk, the ACP has defined an interval on the limits to monitor the sensitivity on its financial assets and liabilities. The interest rate impact estimation by category assumes a 100 basic points (bp) increase or reduction on the financial assets and liabilities. The following table reflects the impact of applying those interest rate variations: Net interest income sensitivity 100bp increment 100bp reduction 2019 2018 2019 2018 At the end of the year 17,647 20,554 (17,647) (20,554) Other comprehensive income sensitivity 100bp increment 100bp reduction 2019 2018 2019 2018 At the end of the year 27,977 60,953 (27,981) (60,965) Interest rate risk management The ACP is exposed to interest rate risk because it borrowed funds at fixed and variable rate and issued bonds at fixed rates. This risk is managed with the use of interest rate swap contracts. Given market conditions, hedging activities are evaluated regularly in order to consider interest rate volatility and risk tolerance, ensuring that the most conservative hedging strategies are applied. Interest rate swap contracts Starting on March 2010 the ACP established interest rate swap contracts without collateral to fix the interest rate on B/.800,000 variable rate loans. The notional amount and principal amortizations on the swap instruments coincide with the dates, disbursements and amortizations of the underlying loans: B/.200,000 were disbursed on March 1, 2010, B/.300,000 on October 29, 2010, and B/.300,000 on April 13, 2011. Semi-annual amortizations for B/.40,000 are programmed to begin on May 15, 2019 until their maturity on November 15, 2028. In March 2018 the ACP contracted interest rate swap contracts without collateral, to protect the fiscal year 2019 budget in two B/.700,000 tranches, a total of B/.1,400,000, effective as of November 15, 2018 up to November 15, 2019. 61 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued These interest rate swap contracts totaling B/.1,400,000 consider the B/.70,000 semi-annual principal amortizations starting on May 15, 2019 up to the swap maturity on November 15, 2019. According to interest rate swap contracts, the ACP agreed to swap the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on the agreed notional principal amounts. Such contracts allow the ACP to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes in the cash flow of part of the hedged floating rate debt. The fair value of interest rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by discounting future cash flows using the yield curves at the end of the period in question and the inherent credit risk in the contract, as it is explained further below. The following table details the notional principal amounts and the remaining terms of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at the end of the reporting period: Notional Effective date Maturity date 760,000 May-17-2010 Nov-15-2028 665,000 Nov-15-2018 Nov-15-2019 665,000 Nov-15-2018 Nov-15-2019 Interest rate swap, variable receipts and Average contracted Notional fixed payment fixed interest rate principal value Fair value 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Less than 1 year 2.71% 2.71% 665,000 700,000 (102) 1,415 Less than 1 year 2.75% 2.75% 665,000 700,000 (139) 1,125 5 years or more 4.67% 4.67% 760,000 800,000 (103,362) (59,884) Interest rate swaps are liquidated semi-annually. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is the 6-month LIBOR rate. The ACP will pay or receive the difference between the floating and the fixed interest rate on a net basis. All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow hedges in order to reduce the ACP’s cash flow exposure resulting from floating interest rates on borrowings. The interest rate swap contracts subscribed with ACP’s counterparties stipulate that ACP would not cover with collateral guarantees any unrealized loss generated by the periodic valuations of these financial instruments. 62 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued Asset and liability derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to occur, as well as the book value of the hedge instruments: 2019 2018 Expected cash flow Expected cash flow Book 1-6 6-12 More than Book 1-6 6-12 More than (In thousands of B/.) value Total months months 1 year value Total months months 1 year Interest rate swaps Assets 0 0 0 0 0 4,124 9,034 6,415 166 2,454 Liabilities (103,603) (115,949) (9,054) (9,783) (97,112) (59,884) (73,115) (8,802) (7,695) (56,618) Call option – Diesel Assets 1,020 0 0 0 0 2,078 2,315 1,027 1,288 0 (102,583) (115,949) (9,054) (9,783) (97,112) (53,682) (61,767) (1,360) (6,242) (54,165) The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with cash flow hedges are expected to impact profit or loss, as well as the book value of hedge instruments: 2019 2018 Expected cash flow Expected cash flow Book 1-6 6-12 More than Book 1-6 6-12 More than (In thousands of B/.) value Total Months months 1 year value Total months months 1 year Interest rate swaps Assets 0 0 0 0 0 4,124 9,034 6,415 166 2,454 Liabilities (103,603) (115,949) (9,054) (9,783 (97,112) (59,884) (73,115) (8,802) (7,695) (56,618) Call option Diesel Assets 1,020 0 0 0 0 2,078 2,315 1,027 1,288 0 (102,583) (115,949) (9,054) (9,783) (97,112) (53,682) (61,767) (1,360) (6,242) (54,165) Liquidity risk management The ACP manages the liquidity risk through continuous by monitoring its forecasted and actual cash flows, reconciling the financial asset and liability maturity profiles. Historically, the cash generated by the ACP’s operations has been enough to cover its operations and its investment program’s requirements, while generating adequate returns. In December 2008, the ACP obtained financing in order to complement the needs of the Canal Expansion Program. Subsequently, in September 2015 the ACP issued bonds in the capital markets to partially finance the new bridge across the Canal on the Atlantic Side. The credit facilities used to supply the adequate liquidity are detailed further below. 63 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued Liquidity risk tables The following table details ACP’s financial assets and liabilities grouped by their remaining maturities with respect to their contractual maturity dates: September 30, 2019 Total gross nominal amount Up to 3-6 6 months 1–5 More than Book value inputs/(outputs) 3 months months 1 year years 5 years Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 57,832 57,832 57,832 0 0 0 0 Time deposits, more than 90 days 1,543,236 1,555,307 895,832 628,602 30,883 0 0 Debt instruments FVOCI 2,770,136 2,823,797 725,749 1,084,000 1,014,049 0 0 Trade and other receivables 41,360 41,360 41,360 0 0 0 0 4,412,564 4,478,296 1,720,762 1,712,602 1,044,932 0 0 Liabilities: Borrowings 2,215,530 2,461,281 125,122 0 146,857 1,082,802 1,106,500 Bonds payable 445,199 778,656 0 11,138 11,138 78,063 678,319 Trade and other payables 166,487 166,606 166,606 0 0 0 0 2,827,216 3,406,543 291,727 11,138 157,995 1,160,865 1,784,819 Hedging instruments: Diesel call option, fixed payment and variable receipt, net 1,020 0 0 0 0 0 0 Interest rate swap, fixed payment and variable receipt, net (103,603) (115,949) (9,054) 0 (9,783) (69,468) (27,644) Total – hedge instruments (102,583) (115,949) (9,054) 0 (9,783) (69,468) (27,644) 64 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued September 30, 2018 Total gross nominal amount Up to 3-6 6 months 1–5 More than Book value inputs/(outputs) 3 months months 1 year years 5 years Assets Cash and cash equivalents 60,339 61,656 61,656 0 0 0 0 Time deposits 1,246,690 1,246,693 1,029,601 116,758 100,334 0 0 Securities available for 2,042,558 sale 2,094,170 247,324 782,487 1,064,359 0 0 Trade and other receivables 54,227 54,227 54,227 0 0 0 0 Advances and other receivables to contractors 840,111 840,111 547,959 0 0 292,152 0 4,243,925 4,296,857 1,940,767 899,245 1,164,693 292,152 0 Liabilities Borrowings 2,331,520 (2,821,312) (10,450) 0 (158,768) (1,223,819) (1,428,275) Bonds payable 444,634 (811,969) 0 (11,138) (11,138) (89,100) (700,594) Trade and other payables 219,866 (219,866) (219,866) 0 0 0 0 2,996,020 (3,853,147) (230,316) (11,138) (169,905) (1,312,919) (2,128,869) Diesel Price swap, fixed payment and variable receipt, net 2,078 2,315 409 618 1,288 0 0 Interest rate swap, fixed payment and variable receipt, net (55,760) (64,082) (2,387) 0 (7,530) (34,831) (19,334) Total (53,682) (61,767) (1,978) 618 (6,242) (34,831) (19,334) In order to finance the Canal Expansion Program for a total of B/.2,300,000, the ACP entered a Common Terms Agreement with five multilaterals credit agencies. Currently 4.3% of the debt (B/.95,000) has a fixed effective rate of 5.31%, while the remaining 95.7% (B/.2,090,000) has a variable average effective rate of 2.44%. The effective rate for the financing, calculated as a weighted average of both, its fixed and variable portions, is 2.56%. For the financing of the new bridge across the Atlantic Side of the Canal, bonds totaling B/.450,000 were issued at a fixed rate of 4.95% (effective rate of 5.14%) payable semi-annually in January and July of each year.

Maritime operations The ACP uses approximately between 10 and 14 million gallons of light diesel on its vessel transit and dredging operations. Since October 20, 2009, risk management for diesel price fluctuations is performed mainly within the fiscal year, period that is considered representative for the implementation of appropriate commercial policies. In order to manage the risk, the ACP performs specific hedging transactions covering approximately 80% of the expected volume. In august 2018, the ACP purchased a diesel swap contract to protect its fiscal year 2019 operational diesel budget for 11.1 million gallons with a monthly notional of 922,100 gallons, paying a light diesel price of B/.2.0885 per gallon and receiving the monthly average variable price, in order to hedge its operational diesel price fluctuation risk. At the end of fiscal year 2019 the registered accumulated annual fuel consumption totaled 13.6 million gallons. Energy generation The ACP generates power for the consumption of the Canal’s operations, while excess capacity is sold in the domestic electricity market. Until September 2019, the ACP consumed 24% of the power generated, while the remaining 76% was sold to the electric market. Power generated by hydroelectric and thermal plants was 22% and 78%, respectively. Thermal plant generation is exposed to fuel price volatility risk. However, this price is indexed to the energy sale rate. This indexing is defined in contractual clauses when the energy is sold under previously agreed contracts or in weekly statements when energy is not sold under contracts, namely, in the spot market. Operational fuel price risk sensitivity analysis As of September 30, 2019, the current price index for light diesel purchases made by the ACP was B/.2.08 per gallon. As of September 30, 2019 the light diesel operational expense registered a real decrease of B/.835. Credit risk management It refers to the risk that the borrower or issuer of a financial asset may not comply, completely and on time, with any payment to be made in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed upon when the obligation was acquired. To mitigate the credit risk, the liquidity investment policy set limits by industry and by issuer as a result of the categorization of the Risk Assessment System adopted by the ACP, which includes the following factors: short-term international credit risk rating, capital/leverage coverage, country risk, liquidity index, impairment, performance and credit risk. In the case of sovereign issuers, the country risk factor is the only one considered. 66 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued Counterparty risk refers to the risk of a counterparty defaulting in the payment of a security purchase transaction. The ACP does not have counterparty risk, as it buys all of its securities using the method of payment on delivery (“delivery versus payment”) through payment systems, using a custodian account. Credit risk refers to the risk that one of the parties does not comply with its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss to the ACP. To address this risk, ACP’s policies only allow depositing funds in banking institutions and financial instruments that have more than one shortterm international investment grade rating, which cannot be inferior to A-2 by Standard & Poors, P-2 by Moody’s Ratings, or F-2 by Fitch Ratings. Additionally, these policies allow for a total investment of up to seven percent of the portfolio in financial instruments that have more than one short-term international investment grade rating, which cannot be inferior to A-3 by Standard & Poors, P-3 by Moody’s Bank Deposit Ratings, or F-3 by Fitch Ratings. Credit quality analysis The tables below show the credit quality analysis of the different type of financial assets the ACP maintains, which were classified based on their international risk rating from risk rating agencies, and the impairment reserves calculated using on their 12 month expected loss of such assets: Advances and other receivables to contractors The total recovery of the advances for B/. 847,630 was received from the contractor GUPCSA as a result of the arbitration awards in favor of the ACP. The movement in the expected credit impairment loss related to the advances and other receivables to contractors is presented below: 12 month ECL Balance as of October 1, 2018, according to IAS 39 0 Adjustment in the application of IFRS 9 526 Balance as of October 1, 2018, according to IFRS 9 526 Net remeasurement of the loss provision 0 Financial assets derecognized (526) New financial assets acquired 0 Balance as of September 30, 2019 0 67 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued Trade and other receivables As of September 30, 2019, the 12 month expected loss for the trade and other receivables totaled B/.2. This provision does not contemplate credit losses related to the Panamanian Treasury, as the ACP has the right to exercise at any moment a discount from its annual payments to the Panamanian Treasury corresponding to any defaulted balance outstanding. 12 month ECL Balance as of October 1, 2018, according to IAS 39 0 Adjustment in the application of IFRS 9 37 Balance as of October 1, 2018, according to IFRS 9 37 Net remeasurement of the loss provision 0 Financial assets derecognized (37) New financial assets acquired 2 Balance as of September 30, 2019 2 The ACP considers that its accounts receivable portfolio has a low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of its counterparties. The evaluation of the account receivables expected credit loss utilized a similar approach to the one used on the debt instruments. Operations with settlement in progress As of September 30, 2019, the 12 month expected credit loss of operations with settlement in progress totaled B/.3. The ACP considers that operations with settlement in progress have a low credit risk based on the external credit ratings of its counterparties. The evaluation of the operations with settlement in progress expected credit loss utilized a similar approach to the one used on the debt instruments. 68 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (26) Risk Management, continued The movement in the expected credit impairment loss related to the operations with settlement in progress is presented below: 12 month ECL Balance as of October 1, 2018, according to IAS 39 0 Adjustment in the application of IFRS 9 0 Balance as of October 1, 2018, according to IFRS 9 0 Net remeasurement of the loss provision 0 Financial assets derecognized 0 New financial assets acquired 3 Balance as of September 30, 2019 3 Bank deposits As of September 30, 2019, 100% (2018: 100%) of the demand and time bank deposits were placed with investment grade financial institutions.

ACP’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are reviewed continuously. The credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are quarterly reviewed quarterly through the “Risk Assessment System for Banking Institutions and Financial Instruments”. The maximum limits for credit exposure in financial instruments by bank institution or issuer are assigned considering the assessment of the following weighted factors: 1. International credit risk rating 2. Capital/leverage coverage 3. Country risk 4. Liquidity index 5. Impairment 6. Performance 7. Credit risk Banking institutions and issuers are classified within three categories in the ACP’s risk system: A. Up to B/.100,000 B. Up to B/.80,000 C. Up to B/.60,000 (27) Adoption of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The adoption of IFRS 9 requires the reclassification and remeasurement of the ACP's financial assets based on established business models, and on the characteristics of the contractual cash flow of the financial asset. The main objective of the ACP's business model for investment securities is to receive contractual capital and interest flows and be able to sell at any time due to liquidity needs or due to interest rate changes. As of October 1, 2018, the classification and measurement of financial instruments held as of September 30, 2018, are as follows: Trade and other receivables measured at amortized cost under IAS 39, maintain this measurement under IFRS 9. Advances and other receivable to contractor measured at amortized cost under IAS 39, maintain this measurement under IFRS 9. Cash and cash equivalents and time deposits over 90 days that are classified as financial instruments held to maturity and measured at amortized cost under IAS 39, maintain this measurement under IFRS 9. Debt instruments classified as available for sale under IAS 39 were classified as FVOCI under IFRS 9, unless their contractual flows are not only principal and interest payments in which case they are classified as FVTPL. Derivatives held to manage risks that are measured at fair value under IAS 39, maintain this measurement under IFRS 9. 72 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the

(30) Contingent Liabilities As of September 30, 2019, two of the arbitrations filed by GUPCSA and its shareholders (other than CUSA) against the ACP under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), concluded with arbitration awards in favor of the ACP: (i) arbitration No.1 of the Cofferdam, and; ii) arbitration No.5 of the advance payments. Additionally, there are in process: (i) 2 arbitrations where the amounts claimed by GUPCSA to date total B/.1,210,296; and, (ii) 1 arbitration where the provisional amount, as set out in the Terms of Reference by GUPCSA, is between B/.1,500,000 to B/.2,000,000. The amount of these claims (which could change) will be confirmed when GUPCSA files its Statements of Claim. The foregoing constitutes the contingent liability of the ACP resulting from the claims of GUPCSA, in relation to the Third Set of Locks. This contingent liability has no provisioned funds. The following describes general information about the status of these arbitrations: The Concrete Arbitration Two of the claims, on concrete mixtures and aggregates, were denied by the ACP and subsequently submitted by GUPCSA to the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB), which, in deciding the case in December 2014, ordered the ACP to pay B/.233,234 plus interest, out of the B/.463,935 sought by GUPCSA (updated at the time of the decision). The ACP paid this amount, and subsequently paid B/.10,827 for additional costs incurred by GUPCSA after September 2014 until the concrete works were completed, in conformity with DAB No. 11 decision. Both sides then referred this dispute to arbitration in March 2015, in two separate arbitration proceedings, which resulted in a consolidated arbitration Case ICC No. 20910/ASM//JPA (C-20911/ASM//JPA). GUPCSA requested the inclusion, in this second arbitration, of Dispute 13A for B/.99,000, previously decided and rejected in its entirety in favor of the ACP by the DAB. GUPCSA and its shareholders (other than CUSA) claim from the ACP a total of B/.430,296 plus interest and the ACP, is in turn calling for the return of the amount that was paid pursuant to DAB decision in Dispute 11 for B/.244,061, Dispute 10 for B/.14,823 and Dispute 14B for B/.6,415. Likewise, the ACP claims Delay Damages (as provided for in the Contract) in an amount of B/.54,600 corresponding to 182 days. The closing hearing was held on October 12 and 13, 2019 and the Arbitration Award is expected by the beginning of the second half of 2020. 77 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (30) Contingent Liabilities, continued The Lock Gate Arbitration In December 2016, GUPCSA submitted arbitration ICC No.22465/ASM//JPA, which included disputes 15, 6 and 13C regarding the design of gates and labor cost adjustments. In July 2017, GUPCSA submitted arbitration ICC No. 22966/JPA concerning the same claims. Subsequently, both arbitrations were consolidated in the arbitration ICC No. 22465/ASM//JPA (C-22966/JPA). On October 8, 2019, the Case Management Conference was held in which the Terms of Reference (“TOR”) were signed and the procedural calendar was set. GUPCSA must present its Statement of Claim on March 16, 2020. The amount claimed as stated by GUPCSA in the TOR, amounts to B/.780,000. The Disruption and other claims arbitration In December 2016, GUPCSA submitted arbitration ICC No. 22466/ASM//JPA which, it is understood, includes all of GUPCSA's claims up to the date of Taking Over that have not already been included in arbitration, and which includes the claim for disruption (Claim 78) and some new claims that had not been the subject of the contractual dispute resolution procedure required prior to Arbitration. In July 2017, GUPCSA submitted arbitration ICC No. 22967/JPA concerning the very same claims. Subsequently, in both arbitrations, the same arbitral tribunal was constituted and arbitration ICC Case No. 22967 / JPA was consolidated with the arbitration ICC No. 22466/ASM//JPA. A second procedural hearing took place on May 2, 2019. The claims were divided into two large groups: 1 and 2, and a procedural calendar was agreed for each group. GUPCSA must present its Statements of Claim during 2020. The provisional amount claimed in this arbitration, as stated by GUPCSA in The Terms of Reference, is between B/.1,500,000 to B/.2,000,000. However, the amount will be updated by GUPCSA at the time of submission of its Statements of Claim. Others: During fiscal year 2019, the ACP received marine claims for an amount of B/.3,184. On the other hand, miscellaneous claims were received in the amount of B/.10,755. The ACP maintains to date (September 30, 2019) claims related to various construction contracts, for an amount of B/.8,690. In addition, there are six claims related to the Contract for the Construction of a Bridge across the Canal at the Atlantic side, which are compiled in a single arbitration process for an amount of B/.218,031, which includes the costs of the process. 78 AUTORIDAD DEL CANAL DE PANAMÁ (Panama, Republic of Panama) Notes to the Financial Statements (30) Contingent Liabilities, continued On November 18, 2016, the ACP learned that a bailiff (huissier de justice) in France had ordered a branch in Paris of a Bank whose parent company is in the United Kingdom, a cautionary measure on a time deposit of approximately B/.49,356 that the ACP maintained in that Bank´s branch in New York. As a result of the above, the Bank's branch in Paris accepted the order and froze the ACP monies deposited at the branch in New York. The measure imposed was based on an arbitration award issued on January 27, 2005 in favor of the plaintiff and against the Panama Transit and Land Transportation Authority and, subsidiarily, the Republic of Panama. The plaintiff alleges in its claim that the ACP was jointly and severally liable with the Republic of Panama for this obligation. The ACP, which is an autonomous legal entity with its own assets, as established by the Political Constitution of the Republic of Panama, is not part of the controversy that originated this award and is not in solidarity with the Republic of Panama; therefore, the ACP rejected the legitimacy of the precautionary measure and filed a request to lift it and requested its dissociation of the process, since ACP was not part of the dispute. On April 26, 2017, a judge issued his decision ordering the lifting of the cautionary measure, so that all of the funds subject to the injunction were released and transferred to the ACP. This decision was confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Paris, by judgment issued on May 24, 2018. On May 24, 2019, the plaintiff filed a recourse of “Cassation” before the French Court of Cassation against the decision of the Court of Appeals of Paris, so the ACP filed its opposition to such recourse. To date, it is pending that the Court of Cassation set a date for the substantiation of the opposition and then issues its decision. The notes contained herein are related to claims against the ACP, therefore, cannot and should not be considered as support or proof of acceptance of responsibility on the part of the ACP. In the opinion of the Administration and its legal counsel, the determination of these matters will not have adverse effects of a significant nature on the financial position of the ACP. (31) Events that Occurred after the Reporting Period The Board of Directors approved at its meeting on December 12, 2019, the transfer to the National Treasury of the operating and functioning economic surplus corresponding to fiscal year 2019 by the amount of B/.1,251,892.
