Environment, and Happier People 03 Climate Change Business relevance & Approach The 2nd Basic Plan for Climate Change Response was established to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to 536 million tons by 2030. South Korea is further strengthening its responsibilities as a greenhouse gas emission company through the emission trading system According to the 2030 National Greenhouse Gas Reduction Roadmap the current 3% emission allowance rate will increase to more than 10% by 2025, and incentives for companies with high reduction efficiency will be allocated relatively more emissions These institutional changes mean that the company s greenhouse gas emissions turn into institutional and manageable risks that directly impact financial performance not just uncertainties or pure regulatory risks Coway is a company that provides products and services that improve the customer s living environment and aims to actively support GHG reduction and climate change adaptation by countries and societies To this end we will actively analyze climate scenarios set clear greenhouse gas reduction targets increase energy efficiency in the workplace and reduce emissions from refrigerants Activity Recalculate medium to long term targets for climate change Promote science based target SBT for reduction methodology Business Cases Performance -50 % Voluntary carbon reduction of a Active participation in global Reduction in GHG emissions 1st Implementation of supplier in the supply chain initiatives such as CDP Carbon per sales KRW in 2020 renewable energy Solar in Disclosure Project compared to 2010 Logistics Center Climate Change Goals and Scenario Management Coway declared environmental management in 2006, recognizing that climate change and changes in the global environment have a significant impact on corporate management activities Coway has established a mid to long term goal of reducing GHG emissions up to 50% by 2020 compared to the 2010s Even though GHG emissions increased by 10.81% but GHG emissions compared to sales increase in KRW decreased by about 70% from 2010 to 2019 from 5,356 tCO2e and 0.357 tC02e 100 million KRW in 2010 to 5,935 tCO2e and 0.234 tonCO2e 100 million KRW in 2019. when the internal emission calculation standards were applied as same as those of 2010, the GHG emissions increased by 4.13% and the GHG emissions compared to sales increase was reduced by approximately 77%.) GHG Emissions and 2030 Goals GHG Emissions Compared to Sales Increase Unit tCO2e 100 million KRW Emission Unit tCO2e Scope1 Scope2 Scope3 6,397 1) 2019 target is estimated by calculating increase in energy use by 5% compared to the previous year as sales production increase 2) 2030 target is estimated by calculating increase in sales and energy use by 5% per year 3) As the scope and standards of greenhouse gas management were changed from the internal standards to national standards according to the GHG and Energy Target Management System there was a difference in reports and data from the previous year The data in this report is a revalidation of emissions from 2017 to 2019 on a national basis Coway uses energy efficiently through its GHG reduction activities and business operation efficiency We maximize energy efficiency by continuously introducing new and renewable energy solar power generation Coway installs and operates solar power at Yugu Plant 49 5KWh scale Incheon Plant 39KWh Pocheon Factory 45KWh scale and Logistics Center 48 8KWh scale Through this 3 factories and distribution centers produced about 237MWh of electricity in 2019, reducing the GHG emission by about 110 tons The energy storage system ESS introduced at the Yugu plant reduces peak loads and contributes to the distribution of energy consumption Also it has an energy cost saving effect saving approximately 120 million KRW in 2019. The LED lighting introduced in the Yugu Plant and Logistics Center improved the working environment in the workplace reduced energy costs by more than 65 million KRW in 2019 based on the logistics center and about 264 tons of GHG Science Based Target Plan Since 2020, Coway has set targets for 2030 and 2050 based on the Science Based Target initiative to respond to the new climate change system Since most of the energy relies on electric power we are setting goals that substantial reductions can be made such as the continuous installation purchase and reduction purchase of new and renewable energy To this end we changed the standard for calculating GHG emissions from our internal standard to the target system for energy and GHG in South Korea and recalculated GHG emissions in the last 3 years As soon as the external GHG emissions verification of the last 3 years is completed the targets for GHG reduction for 2030 and 2050 will be finalized and disclosed Risks and Opportunities of Climate Change Coway analyzes and discloses specific climate change risks and opportunities following the recommendations of Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures TCFD Coway s 2019 climate change risks and opportunities analysis are as follows Potential Risks from Climate Change Risk Factors Context Term Strengthened product policy and legal regulations Regulations on energy using products are strengthened by the efficient management equipment Short Term operation regulations under the Energy Use Rationalization Act Therefore the standard of energy consumption efficiency of Coway s flagship water purifier is being strengthened If Coway does not respond by developing technology to improve the energy consumption efficiency of products it will inevitably weaken its competitiveness in the market As a result it is expected that the company s operating costs such as R&D investment costs will increase Conversion costs for low carbon emission Currently R 134a refrigerant is used in the water purifier product produced by Coway The Short Term technologies international agreement is tightening regulations on the use of refrigerants that deplete the ozone layer R 12 refrigerants have already been banned from manufacturing and sales R 134a refrigerants also have a high GWP making them a regulatory risk Therefore if Coway does not develop materials and new technologies to replace R 134a refrigerant it can be a considerable risk to the water purifier business Market uncertainty In South Korea precipitation patterns are changing due to climate change Therefore the nation s Mid Term water resource management policy is expected to be strengthened due to water shortages Water is used in Coway s water purifier and it is expected that this water purifier product will be affected by national water resource management policies As a result it is expected that Coway will increase its operating expenses such as R&D and facility investment Potential Opportunity from Climate Change Opportunity Factors Context Term Access to new markets Precipitation patterns are changing due to climate change The frequency of yellow dust and fine dust Short Term is increasing due to severe drought caused by changes in precipitation patterns Due to this climate change the air purifier market has expanded to China providing Coway with a new opportunity to enter the market Business diversification opportunities Due to climate change energy consumption is increasing and the type of electricity supplied to Mid Term homes is also expected to change Coway has a platform business that is convenient to introduce new types of business or products It is predicted that new businesses or products related to climate change will provide Coway with opportunities to enter new markets Carbon Partnership with Supplier Coway s carbon partnership suppliers have also implemented reduction activities to decrease 50% of GHG emissions compared to sales increase by 2020 compared to 2010. Coway continues to support its carbon partnership suppliers to minimize energy use compared to their sales growth thereby strengthening the energy competitiveness of carbon partner suppliers striving to prevent supply chain risks related to climate change For the 2020 GHG reduction target starting from 2018, the GHG emissions compared to sales increase exceeded the mid to long term target by reducing 110% of the reduction target and 7.55% of emissions Since 2019, it has been converted to voluntary management of each supplier In 2019, GHG emissions information will be disclosed through CDP Q&A and carbon report if necessary Carbon Partner Support Status Category Participating PartnersTerm Main Contents Energy Cooperation Project of Corporate Cooperation Group 5 Companies 2019.04 ~ 2019.10 Energy diagnosis support to business sites Induce conversion to high efficiency energy In June 2014 installed 29 7KWh solar power to Coway supplier Jesung Co Ltd In July 2015 installed 29 4KWh solar power to Coway supplier ID System Co Ltd We continue to participate in the Energy Cooperation Project of the Corporate Cooperation Group from 2012 to 2019, and 39 partners are participating for 8 years GHG · Energy and Other Environment Data GHG Emissions Category Unit 2017 2018 2019 2019 Goals 2030 Goals Scope1 tCO2e 630 676 640 710 Scope2 5,162 5,349 5,224 5,616 Scope3 71 71 70 71 Total 5,863 6,096 5,935 6,397 2,982 GHG Emissions Compared to Sales Increase tCO2e 100 million KRW 0.253 0.254 0.234 0.253 0.069 1) 2019 target is estimated by calculating increase in energy use by 5% compared to the previous year as sales production increase 2) 2030 target is estimated by calculating increase in sales and energy use by 5% per year 3) As the scope and standards of greenhouse gas management were changed from the internal standards to national standards according to the GHG and Energy Target Management System there was a difference in reports and data from the previous year The data in this report is a revalidation of emissions from 2017 to 2019 on a national basis GHG Emissions by Business Site Category Unit 2017 2018 2019 Yugu Factory tCO2e 2,178 2,466 2,438 Incheon Factory 609 663 707 Pocheon Factory 375 205 218 Environmental Technology Research Center R&D Center 1,708 1,889 1,849 Cosmetic Research Institute 203 126 0 Category Unit 2017 2018 2019 Seoul Office 502 456 444 Logistics Center 287 292 279 Total 5,863 6,096 5,935 1) GHG emissions in 2019 is zero due to closure of the Cosmetic Research Institute 2) Due to changes in the scope of verification of GHG data in 2019, it differs from last year s reporting data GHG Emissions Sccording to the the Use of Refrigerant Category Unit 2017 2018 2019 R 134 Refrigerant usage in product manufacturing kg 46,580 51,230 46,360 R 600a R 436B Refrigerant usage in product manufacturing 800 5,320 4,010 R 134a in 2018 is modified as follow 49,320 → 51,230 / R 600a 3,220 → 5 320kg for R 436B Other Indirect GHG Scope 3) Emissions Category Unit 2017 2018 2019 Domestic Logistics Transportation tCO2e 5,047 5,420 5,491 Domestic logistics transport is voluntarily provided by consigned partner companies and external verification is not conducted Energy Usage Category Unit 2017 2018 2019 2019 Goals 2030 Goals Direct LPG GJ 84 41 0 Gasoline 2,423 2,533 2,587 Diesel 2,458 2,540 2,773 LNG 323 554 201 Kerosene 432 225 338 Propane 5,294 5,908 5,163 Direct Total 11,014 11,801 11,062 12,391 Indirect Electricity 106,275 110,142 107,564 Indirect Total 106,275 110,142 107,564 115,649 Total Energy Usage 117,289 121,943 118,627 128,040 64,020 Total Energy Intensity GJ Sales 5.055 5.091 4.687 5.059 1.479 1) 2019 target is estimated by calculating increase in energy use by 5% compared to the previous year as sales production increase 2) 2030 target is estimated by calculating increase in sales and energy use by 5% per year 3) As the scope and standards of greenhouse gas management were changed from the internal standards to national standards according to the GHG and Energy Target Management System there was a difference in reports and data from the previous year The data in this report is a revalidation of emissions from 2017 to 2019 on a national basis 4) The total heat generated is applied to the coefficient applied to the energy consumption calculation 5) All of Coway s business sites do not have air emission facilities Therefore they do not emit air pollutants such as nitrogen oxide NOx and sulfur oxides SOx 6) Greenhouse gas emissions are zero due to the absence of LPG vehicles among the rental vehicles in 2019.
