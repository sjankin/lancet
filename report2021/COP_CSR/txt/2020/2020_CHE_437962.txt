The business year 2019 headed into the wrong direction as costs went up and revenue decreased. Despite this, Ascom is well positioned in a very promising market both in the Healthcare and the Enterprise sector. However, faced with delivery issues, a high cost base and organizational complexity, we experienced a drop in financial performance and had to respond fast and decidedly. In August 2019, the Board of Directors decided to launch a restart at Ascom with a new leadership. Jeannine Pilloud took over the double mandate as Chairperson & CEO as of 2 August 2019. In order to lead Ascom back on the path of profitable growth, Jeannine Pilloud assumed the operational management of the Company completely a few months later. Effective as of 7 November 2019, she took over as Ascom’s CEO, supported by Dominik Maurer as the new CFO, who joined the Company in October 2019. Dr Valentin Chapero Rueda, member of the Board of Directors since 2016, was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors as of 7 November 2019. This was followed by the announcement in January 2020 of four new members for the Board of Directors who will be proposed for election at the Annual General Meeting 2020. Leaner organization with strong customer proximity In addition to the new leadership, the Board of Directors decided to implement a new Group structure as of 1 February 2020. Going forward, Ascom will focus on a lean and simple organization and strong customer proximity. A group-wide transformation project has been initiated to achieve this and is well on track. The Managing Directors of the major markets now have end-to-end responsibility for their business and report directly to the CEO. In addition, a Clinical Solutions Team has been set up on Group level in order to address and support complex clinical solutions in all relevant markets with the best-in-class experts of Ascom. Cost base to be lowered by CHF 10 to 15 million In 2019, Ascom generated net revenue of CHF 282.9 million, including a negative currency impact of about CHF 8.5 million. At constant currencies, net revenue declined by 8.5% year-over-year. Incoming orders showed a slight decline of 1.4%, while the order backlog increased by 22%, both at constant currencies. The EBITDA 2 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Letter to Shareholders decreased in 2019 to CHF 0.8 million, mainly due to the decline in revenue, the high Revenue by region cost base and one-off effects including restructuring costs of CHF 6.1 million.

Due to the very low Group profit this year, the Board of Directors proposes not to pay out a dividend for 2019 accordingly. Outlook Ascom expects 2020 to become a challenging year of transition. We have laid the foundations to achieve improvements already in 2020. We are confident that we have taken the necessary steps to allow Ascom to return to profitable growth. Note of thanks 2019 has been a very challenging year for all of us. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and the Executive Committee, we would like to thank all employees for their hard work and strong commitment. We also thank our customers, suppliers and business partners for their support. Finally, we would like to thank you, our valued shareholders, for your loyalty to Ascom. Sincerely, Dr Valentin Chapero Rueda Jeannine Pilloud Chairman of the Board CEO ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Letter to Shareholders 3 A technology company operating worldwide Ascom is a global solutions provider focused on healthcare ICT and mobile workflow solutions. The Company has a prominent international customer base and stellar solutions to meet the needs of its clients. 1,300 employees around the globe 4 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Around the world 18 operating businesses worldwide ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Around the world 5 Performance Report 2019 Ascom faced a very challenging year and delivered disappointing results in 2019. Therefore, the Board of Directors decided to launch a restart with a new leadership team and to focus on a lean and simple organization with stronger customer proximity. Review of 2019 results Ascom generated for full financial year 2019 net revenues of CHF 282.9 million, representing a decline of 8.5% at constant currencies1 (2018: CHF 318.5 million). The Company suffered from a weak demand in the OEM business (which is accounting for 7% of the total revenue), which declined by 35%. The various regions performed differently. While UK and the DACH region showed a positive development, performance in North America as well as in most of the other regions was unsatisfactory. The Healthcare sector accounted for 64% of the revenue in 2019 (2018: 63%), while the Enterprise sector was at 29% (2018: 28%) and the OEM business at 7% (2018: 9%). Recurring revenue increased to 24% compared to 21% in financial year 2018. Lower profitability Profitability was hit by the decline in revenue, the high cost base and one-off effects including restructuring costs of CHF 6.1 million in the second half of 2019. Overall, EBITDA2 was slightly positive and amounted to CHF 0.8 million (2018: CHF 39.0 million), while EBIT was negative at CHF –13.4 million (2018: CHF 26.6 million). The normalized EBITDA, adjusted for one-off effects, amounts to CHF 11.0 million with an EBITDA margin of 3.9%. Due to a positive net financial result, a positive one-off effect in particular from the divestment of the non-operating property Technologiepark Teningen (Germany) in the first half-year 2019 and a positive effect in income taxes, Ascom closed financial year 2019 with a Group profit of CHF 0.5 million (2018: CHF 21.4 million). Strong order backlog During 2019, Ascom was able to win important orders in the healthcare sector such as a large contract with a leading hospital in Singapore, an important contract with the renowned Italian Campus Bio-Medico University Hospital and a large order for Ascom Myco 3 smartphones in the UK. The Ascom Myco 3 smartphone was also listed in 2019 on the target platform for the healthcare application Epic Rover – an important strategic step. 1 Constant currencies are calculated by converting current numbers using the prior year’s average ­exchange rate. 2 Definition of EBITDA, see consolidated income statement on page 63 of this Annual Report. 6 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Performance Report In the Enterprise sector Ascom was able to secure important contracts for a power plant and a large prison in Germany. Overall, in 2019 incoming orders came to CHF 315.5 million (–1.4% at constant currencies) while the order backlog grew by 22% at constant currencies and ­increased to CHF 177.5 million, which represents a good basis for revenue growth in the first half of 2020. Cash flow and balance sheet During financial year 2019, Ascom generated a positive cash flow of CHF 2.9 million from operating activities (2018: CHF 20.0 million). The lower operating cash flow resulted primarily from the significant lower operating result and higher inventories and work in progress due to delivery issues. Cash flow from investing activities amounted to CHF 9.4 million, including CHF 16.4 million for capital expenditure, and CHF 6.9 million proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment. Cash flow from financing activities in the amount of CHF 3.9 million included mainly the dividend payment of CHF 16.2 million in April 2019 and proceeds from short-term borrowings of CHF 13.0 million. At balance sheet date of 31 December 2019, total assets amounted to CHF 214.2 million (2018: CHF 218.4 million). Cash and cash equivalents stood at CHF 18.2 million (2018: CHF 21.2 million), and inventories and work in progress increased to CHF 26.9 million (2018: CHF 19.8 million). Shareholder’s equity was at CHF 63.2 million (2018: CHF 83.2 million), and the equity ratio amounted to 29.5% (2018: 35.2%). New Group structure implemented as of 1 February 2020 The Board of Directors decided to implement a new Group structure as of 1 February 2020. Going forward, Ascom will focus on a lean and simple organization and strong customer proximity. A group-wide transformation project has been initiated to achieve this and is well on track. Already in the second half of 2019, a comprehensive cost-saving program has been initiated in order to reduce Ascom’s annual cost base by CHF 10 to 15 million. Besides targeted measures to reduce costs, various activities have been undertaken to better exploit Ascom’s market potential and increase efficiency. Ascom is confident that the necessary steps have been taken to allow the Company to return to profitable growth.

Rubriktitel ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Rubriktitel 9 Simplifying complexity The Ascom Healthcare Platform at work at Singapore’s Sengkang ­Hospitals How Ascom solutions are enabling smooth, efficient communications and workflows at 1,200-bed state-of-the-art Sengkang Hospitals. It’s one of the latest developments in Singapore’s already impressive catalogue of healthcare achievements: a healthcare campus featuring the 800-bed Sengkang General Hospital and the neighboring 400-bed Sengkang Community Hospital for rehabilitative care. Officially opened in March 2019, the two hospitals are designed to meet the complex care needs of the city-state’s ageing population. As such, a key goal of the initiative is to simplify communications across care providers particularly in the age of team-based care. Moving beyond nurse call A major challenge facing the hospitals’ designers was the sheer number of individual components needed for true patient-centric communications. Different systems for patient alerts, nurse call, workflow stations, Electronic Medical Records (EMR) integration, and so on would pose serious technical, interoperability, and administrative problems. As for ongoing support and maintenance, multiple vendors and systems mean multiple contracts – hardly a foundation for simplicity. Through Ascom’s partnership, the Sengkang facilities were able to select “We are pleased to be working with various interoperable elements from the Ascom Healthcare Platform – software, the Ascom Telligence nurse call services, hardware, handsets – and integrate them into cohesive solutions. For system… Its integration with various instance, both hospitals are equipped with Ascom Telligence, a solution that goes enterprise applications is helping beyond traditional nurse call systems. Conventional nurse call systems are reactive us achieve greater workflow coordiand time-consuming. A patient triggers a buzzer or light that summons a member nation and staff productivity.” of staff, who then walks to the patient to see what he or she requires. It’s a slow, Lee Puay Chuan clumsy method that can contribute to staff frustration, patient dissatisfaction, and Deputy Director Strategic Projects, inefficient workflows. Sengkang General Hospital Ascom Telligence, in contrast, is a Patient Response System that can send alerts and requests directly to individual nurses’ handsets and/or nursing stations. Nurses and nursing aides can speak to patients before walking to them and can receive specific requests – for water, pain medication, an extra blanket, etc. – ­directly to their handsets. For Lee Puay Chuan, Deputy Director Strategic Projects at Sengkang General Hospital, having such seamless information flows is helping the hospital achieve “greater workflow coordination and staff productivity, particularly in these current times of manpower constraints”. 10 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Healthcare Business Moreover, the interoperability of Ascom Telligence with other systems – both native and third-party – is for Francis Schmeer, Chief Sales Officer of Ascom, a great ­illustration of the Ascom Healthcare Platform in action. “The Sengkang Hospitals have Ascom Telligence and Ascom Myco smartphones working together to provide wireless nurse call functionality. Ascom Telligence workflow stations are also deployed to streamline tasks such as patient rounding, admissions and discharging, housekeeping, and bed scheduling,” says Francis Schmeer. Proven third-party interoperability One key reason why Sengkang Hospitals selected Ascom was the company’s track record in devising solutions with proven interoperability with third-party devices and systems. Various elements from the Ascom Unite Messaging Suite have for example been combined to produce a coordinated message handling platform. The result is a single view and assignment engine for a multitude of bedside alerts and enterprise systems such as EMR and the Building Management System. Francis Schmeer, however, is keen to stress that many of the most important components from the Ascom Healthcare Platform were intangible. “We provided a full range of consulting, installation, training, project, and support services… And of course we continue to provide ongoing maintenance services. After all, it is only by working and cooperating closely with customers that makes it possible for us to devise the best possible solutions. The success of the Sengkang Hospitals project testifies to that.” ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Healthcare Business 11 Turning “zero risk” from ­aspiration to reality How an Ascom Enterprise solution is helping the Guerbet Group satisfy stringent safety standards at two French production facilities The Guerbet Group is a world-leading manufacturer of contrast agents and devices for diagnostic and interventional imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Two of its facilities in France are active-ingredient manufacturing plants, and are certified as satisfying the rigorous safety standards of the EU’s Seveso Directive. To help meet those standards, Guerbet has since 2003 employed an Ascom communications and alarm notification solution for the two facilities. Prior to that date, Guerbet had used a solution from NIRA, a communications systems company acquired by Ascom. Patrick Conq, IT Project Manager at Guerbet, says: “When we were choosing a new, upgraded solution in 2003, we opted to go with Ascom, as we were reassured by their extensive experience with manufacturing industry. Moreover, Ascom could provide their ATEX-certified hardware – approved for use in explosive environments – something which is essential for our business. Ascom’s DECT devices met this criterion, and also delivered improved reliability and ease of use.” 12 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Enterprise Business A defining feature of the Ascom solution for Guerbet over the years has been its “intelligence”. This refers to the solution’s ability to orchestrate data flows; to manage in real-time the distribution of a wide variety of technical, safety, and personal alarms. Patrick Conq adds: “Our priority is the protection of isolated workers. With the Ascom solution, such users only need to use their mobile devices to send alerts in real-time to pre-defined recipients. Unanswered or unacknowledged alerts are automatically passed to colleagues until a satisfactory response is logged – something that gives us a sense of security.” Always ready, always operational The solution also features “man-down” and “no-movement” alert functions. Alarms are automatically sent should a lone worker’s handset remain stationary for too long, or if the handset senses a sudden drop. Patrick Conq explains: “It is critical, that our workers’ handsets can still raise the alarm, even when the workers themselves are physically unable, such as might happen in a fall or loss of consciousness.” Another feature of the Ascom solution is accurate locating, a function that prevents responders wasting valuable time as they react to alarms. Intelligent alarm management is also critical to equipment uptime and technical efficiency. Patrick Conq says: “One of the key benefits of the Ascom solution at our Seveso Directive-certified plants is the deep integration with equipment and process alarm systems. In fact, the Ascom solution covers 100 such alarms at the facilities, sending context-rich alerts to targeted recipients in the event of a wide range of anomalies or deviations. And as alarms and actions are logged, we also gain a basis for identifying improvement areas.” Philippe Billet, Managing Director France & Spain, says: “This sophisticated solution we’ve delivered to Guerbet Group demonstrates Ascom’s expertise to provide solutions for enterprises in critical and complex environments. Our Enterprise solutions are an important pillar for our region and the whole company and offer many opportunities in our markets.” Preparing for Industry 4.0, preparing for zero risk Guerbet and Ascom continue to cooperate closely in order to meet the former’s “Our priority is the protection of evolving safety needs. This evolution is currently influenced by the impact of the isolated workers. With the Ascom Industry 4.0 revolution – the industrial communications transformation being solution, such users only need brought about by extreme and ubiquitous connectivity between equipment, people, to use their mobile devices to send and devices. alerts in real-time to pre-defined Patrick Conq says: “DECT technology remains a strategic element for our recipients.” factories. But the industry is in the midst of change. In the very near future, it will Patrick Conq be necessary for DECT to evolve; to integrate all the features of smartphones into IT Project Manager at Guerbet our workday, in terms of both ergonomics (screen size, etc.) and features (camera, video, etc.) – all while retaining the ability to protect isolated workers. The Group’s employees expect it and we expect it to be the next step in our relationship with Ascom in moving towards a truly zero risk environment.” ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Enterprise Business 13 Sustainability Report 2019 Ascom is committed to contributing to a better world, be it through our products or how we conduct our business Sustainability is something we fully embrace, as not only does it benefit the wider “We believe corporate citizenship society, but it is also a driver for innovation and growth, core values to Ascom. and environmental stewardship Our Code of Ethical Business Conduct contains binding and worldwide prinmake for good business, therefore ciples covering all business activities in the area of anti-corruption, labor, human sustainability is an integral part rights and the environment. As a member of the UN Global Compact (Signatory of our strategy.” Level) since 2010, which includes the protection of human rights and the elimination Jeannine Pilloud, CEO Ascom of forced labor, child labor and discrimination, Ascom is highly committed to responsible business conduct. We are also committed to supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This report shows where Ascom contributes to achieving these objectives. Following SDGs are primarily concerned by Ascom’s business conduct: Good Health and Well-Being (SDG No 3), Quality Education (SDG No 4), Gender Equality (SDG No 5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG No 8), Industry Innovation and Infrastructure (SDG No 9), Reduced Inequalities (SDG No 10), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG No 12) and Climate Action (SDG No 13). Employee surveys and enhanced feedback culture As a global company, Ascom supports diversity and works to further engage groups which are traditionally underrepresented in the engineering and technology field. With the first female Chief Executive Officer of the company in place, who took ­office in mid-2019, Ascom contributes to diversity in a sector which is still poor in women on executive level. In March 2019, a Female Talent Network was created in the Nordic Region with the purpose of the individual’s personal development, creating a space for skills improvement and an opportunity to build a network in which sharing ideas and knowledge is key. More experienced female colleagues use the network to exchange their experiences and work to engage in lifting female talent within Ascom. 14 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Sustainability A key focus of the Executive Committee in 2019 was to improve internal communications after previous poll votes showed a demand for internal information sharing. Therefore, a direct communication channel (e-mail box) to the Executive Committee for questions and suggestions of employees, periodically conducted poll votes and newly initiated online pulse surveys for quick feedback to the management were introduced. Furthermore, a new global On-Boarding Bootcamp was rolled out in 2019, where new personnel gather together for three days to get to know more about Ascom and its values and to increase engagement of new employees. It has been very successful and will continue to run once every quarter. For the first time, Ascom has been appointed as a Career Company “Karriärföretag” in Sweden for 2020. Every year, the top 100 Swedish employers are recognized in order to assist students and young professionals in finding a successful and reputable employer. The panel noted that Ascom gained this award through our “great commitment to and development of employees”. Group wide General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) training Since 2013, Ascom has an active whistle-blowing reporting system in place, where all Ascom employees have access to an anonymous reporting forum as well as a compliance hotline for any instances of suspected or actual misconduct. Twelve reports were made in 2019. Appropriate actions have been taken, and the root causes have been addressed. All employees are encouraged to draw attention to any bribery, corruption or illegal activity they encounter. All reported violations are taken with the highest level of seriousness by the Executive Committee. Since the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018, Ascom has done a lot to meet the comprehensive requirements of the regulation. We have evaluated our products by means of technical reports, reviewed the data processing activities to create data processing directories and drafted new data protection contracts. In addition to this, we have amended our Privacy Policy and conducted further internal group-wide trainings on how to handle data privacy issues at Ascom. Increased renewable energy consumption Ascom’s Environmental Policy outlines our ambition to minimize our environmental impact, protect the environment and prevent pollution. Our global targets focus on our efforts and allow us to follow through with the commitments made in the policy. In addition to this, Ascom also has regional targets for the locations which are ISO 14001-certified. These targets complement and work towards our overall global targets. One target fulfilled in 2019 was to increase the share of renewable energy In 2019 our Gothenburg site usage in our operations. Since early 2019, one of Ascom’s biggest offices by square procured 100% renewable energy meters, our Gothenburg site, has procured 100% renewable energy for its operation. for its operation. Despite the energy now in use coming from cleaner sources, we still look to minimize our usage by retrofitting and promoting energy efficiency. The Gothenburg office also implemented a target on waste to landfill. This was achieved as now only 0.4% of waste generated in 2019 went to landfill, and the rest was recovered or recycled. ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Sustainability 15 Other highlights of 2019 achievements include no longer procuring single-use Carbon footprint of Ascom p ­ lastic in our Utrecht site, our largest office by number of employees, as well as seeing a 30% reduction in waste volumes.

In addition to this, we perform on-site and desktop audits on our key supplier to ensure standards are consistently upheld. Product use 33% Progress (our environmental targets) Our carbon footprint for 2019 has been calculated and is laid out below.

This information helps us to understand our most significant environmental aspects and subsequently where to focus reduction efforts for 2020. We have identified these three focus areas: 1. Energy efficiency of products Most of Ascom’s environmental impact is derived from our products, particularly in the use phase, so in 2020 we seek to further increase the energy efficiency of our products. All new generations of products must be as energy efficient or more energy efficient than the current generation of similar devices. 2. Material efficiency We look to improve the efficiency of materials used in our products and packaging by increasing the share of recycled content and making substitutions for materials which are more environmentally friendly. 16 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Sustainability 3. Business travel In our increasingly globalized world, travel has in some cases become an integral part of business. At Ascom, we recognize our environmental impact and try to reduce our air traveling. In previous years, we greatly reduced our fleet emissions by increasing the use of remote support. In Finland, for example, 93% of customer issues are now solved remotely, eliminating the need for an engineer to be sent out to the site. In 2020, we will continue to monitor this to ensure rates stay within their target percentage. Ascom’s performance is often subject to external assessment through mandatory In May 2019, Ascom was awarded audits and voluntary assessments. In May 2019, Ascom was awarded a Gold rating a Gold rating by EcoVadis. by EcoVadis, who assess companies on their Corporate Social Responsibility in global supply chains.

Mode of operation of the Board of Directors Board meetings or conference calls are held as and when necessary. In general, the CEO and CFO attend all ordinary meetings of the Board of Directors. In addition, executive sessions are held. Other members of the Executive Board as well as external experts are invited to attend meetings to address specific topics if necessary. 18 meetings (including both physical meetings and conference calls) were held in 2019. Board attendance was 99%. The ordinary meetings of the Board of Directors last one full day and strategy meetings last two days. The Chairperson of the Board acts as a liaison with the Executive Board and has regular interactions with the CEO and other members of the Executive Board. Management provides monthly reports to the Board covering the financial and operating performance of the Company. Self-evaluation of the Board of Directors Since 2005, the Board of Directors has carried out a self-evaluation at year-end based on a standardized process using a comprehensive questionnaire. The results are discussed in the first quarter in the next year, and any measures necessary for improvements are agreed and implemented as required. Committees of the Board of Directors To support the efficient and effective organization of its duties, the Board of Directors has set up a structure with two permanent committees whose primary role is to prepare materials as a basis for decisions by the Board of Directors in specialized areas. The two permanent committees are the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. The authority to make decisions lies with the Board of Directors. All members of the Board are entitled to attend any meetings of these committees. The nomination of candidates for election to the Board of Directors and the selection of candidates for appointment to the Executive Board and Executive Committee are done by the entire Board. Audit Committee Members: Jürg Fedier (Chairperson) and Christina Stercken The Board of Directors elects the members and the chairperson of the Audit Committee for a term of office of one year until the closing of the ordinary General Meeting following the election. The Audit Committee is composed of two non-executive members of the Board of Directors and generally meets four times a year (at least one meeting per quarter), although the Chairperson may convene meetings as often as business requires. Four Audit Committee meetings were held in 2019, generally lasting several hours, whereof the external auditors attended two. Committee attendance was 100%. The CEO was present in all meetings while the CFO attended three meetings of the Audit Committee. The Secretary of the Board of Directors prepares the ­meetings and records the minutes. The full Board of Directors is kept informed of the Audit Committee’s activities following each meeting, and receives a copy of the minutes. ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 29 The Audit Committee’s main activities are: ■■ Internal control ■■ Financial reporting ■■ Finance management ■■ Risk management ■■ Tax management ■■ External auditing ■■ Compliance ■■ Litigation matters Compensation Committee Members: Dr Valentin Chapero Rueda (Chairperson) and Dr Harald Deutsch According to the Articles of Association, the General Meeting elects the members of the Compensation Committee individually for a term of office of one year until the closing of the ordinary General Meeting following the election. The Compensation Committee consists of at least two and not more than three members of the Board of Directors. The Chairperson of the Compensation Committee has to be independent. He is elected by the Board of Directors. In the event that the Compensation Committee has fewer members than the number of members elected by the last General Meeting and is therefore not fully staffed, the Board of Directors elects the missing members for the remaining term. The Compensation Committee is composed of two non-executive members of the Board of Directors and is convened by the Chairperson as often as business requires. Five meetings were held in 2019. Committee attendance was 100%. The CEO attended the meetings as and when required. The Secretary of the Board of Directors prepares the meetings and records the minutes. The full Board of Directors is kept informed of the Compensation Committee’s activities following each meeting, and receives a copy of the minutes. A major task of the Compensation Committee is to prepare the resolution of the Board of Directors concerning the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and the members of the Executive Board to be approved by the ­Annual General Meeting. To fulfill its duties, the Compensation Committee may consult other persons and external consultants for support. Other main fields of work of the Compensation Committee shall consist of making recommendations to the Board of Directors in relation to: ■■ Ascom Group remuneration policies ■■ Fixing compensation models for the Board of Directors and the Top Management ■■ Implementation and monitoring of long-term incentive plans Areas of responsibility The Board of Directors has delegated the operational management of the Company and the entire Ascom Group to the CEO unless otherwise required by the law, the Articles of Association or the Organization Regulations. The CEO, ­together with the Executive Board, is responsible for the overall management of the Ascom Group. 30 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance The Board of Directors explicitly reserves the power to decide on the ­following matters: ■■ Authorizing important acquisitions and divestments ■■ Appointing and discharging members of the Executive Board and the Top Management ■■ Defining compensation models for members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board (subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting), and the Top Management ■■ Approving the budget ■■ Arranging public bonds and important framework credit agreements ■■ Substantial investments ■■ Issuing the Organization Regulations and their Annexes ■■ Defining the internal audit and submitting the proposal to the Annual ­General Meeting for election of the auditors ■■ Submitting proposals on dividends to the Annual General Meeting ■■ Issuing and implementing long-term incentive plans Information and control instruments in respect of the Executive Board/management instruments The Ascom Group’s management information system (MIS) consists of management reporting and financial consolidation. Each month, the balance sheet, income statement, incoming orders, order backlog and employee headcount for the individual companies are entered in the management reporting system. This information is based on the regulation and accounting standards and consolidated for the various Group companies and for the Group as a whole, and compared against the previous year’s figures and the current budget. The Executive Board discusses the results in detail on a monthly basis and decides on actions to be taken. Full financial consolidation (including cash flow statement) in compliance with the regulation and accounting standards is performed on a quarterly basis. Financial reports are submitted to the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Additional management instruments for monitoring management processes include strategic medium-term planning (MTP), annual planning and quarterly forecasts. A quarterly report on pending law suits is submitted to the Audit Committee. As part of Business Risk and Opportunity Management (BROM), an updated risk map for the Group is submitted to the Board of Directors on a semi-annual basis. The meetings of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee are attended by the CEO and CFO as well as, whenever necessary, by other members of Management. Internal audit The Group does not have an in-house internal audit function. The Board of Directors empowered the Audit Committee to mandate an external audit firm to carry out special focus audits, as needed. Accordingly, such internal audits are conducted from time to time as mandated by the Audit Committee. During 2019, no special focus audits have been commissioned. Internal audit fees are based on the scope of services rendered. Fees incurred in 2019 were nil (2018: nil). ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 31 Risk management As an internationally active group, Ascom is exposed to a variety of risks arising from its operations in the normal course of business. Risk management is therefore an integral part of Group Management and hence part of the business processes. Group Treasury centrally monitors financial risks (liquidity, foreign currency, interest rate, credit risks) in accordance with written guidelines. Capital risk is also monitored using defined thresholds for the debt ratio and the equity ratio. Further information on risk management can be found in note 27 to the financial statements of the Ascom Group on page 86 of this Annual Report. Internal Control System (ICS) A Board directive of 21 August 2017 and the ICS manual govern the Internal Control System (ICS). The ICS ensures the implementation of appropriate procedures and measures for the purpose of identifying and monitoring the main financial risks to which the Company is exposed. In particular, the aim of the ICS is to ensure the integrity and completeness of accounting, to provide timely and reliable financial reporting, and to prevent, minimize and identify errors and irregularities in the ­financial statements. In order to achieve these targets, Group companies in scope are determined ­annually. Hereby, it is ensured that at least 80% of the revenue and of total assets of the Group are covered. The external audit confirms the existence of the ICS in connection with the year-end audit. Additionally, external audit submits improvement suggestions on a yearly basis, which are implemented in the following year. 4.

Statutory rules regarding the principles of compensation, participation plans, loans, credits, and pension benefits are set in Articles 20b and 20c of the Articles of ­A ssociation. The rules regarding the approval of the remuneration by the Annual General Meeting are set in Article 20e. The Articles of Association are available under www.ascom.com/content/dam/ascom/ws/ready-for-use/global/corporate/ documents/corporate-gov­ernance/ascom-articles-association-en.pdf 36 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 6. SHAREHOLDERS’ PARTICIPATION RIGHTS Voting rights and protective rights Shareholders in Swiss publicly listed companies have extensive participation and protective rights governed in principle by the Swiss Code of Obligations (OR) and supplemented by the respective Company’s Articles of Association. Annual General Meeting Voting rights and representation ■■ Each share entitles the holder to one vote represented at the Annual General Meeting. There are no voting right restrictions. ■■ Each shareholder may be represented at the Annual General Meeting by a third person who is authorized as proxy in writing or by the Independent Representative. ■■ Sole proprietor companies, partnerships and legal entities may be represented persons with written authorization to act on their behalf. ■■ The Board of Directors makes the requisite arrangements to determine voting rights and to establish the results of votes and elections. Independent Representative According to the Articles of Association, the General Meeting elects an Independent Representative. The term of office of the Independent Representative ends with the closing of the ordinary General Meeting following the election of the ­Independent Representative. Re-election is admissible. If the Company has no Independent Representative, the Board of Directors designates an Independent Representative for the next General Meeting. The Independent Representative is obliged to vote the shares for which he or she received proxies in accordance with the instructions given. If he or she has not received any instructions with respect to votes, he or she abstains from voting the respective shares. The general instruction for motions contained and/or not ­contained in the invitation to vote in line with the ­motion of the Board of Directors qualifies as a valid instruction for the exercise of the voting right. The shareholders elected at the Annual General Meeting held on 10 April 2019 Franz Müller, Berne, as Independent Representative for a term of one year until the completion of the Annual General Meeting 2020, and Dr Alexander Kernen, Berne, as his deputy. Franz Müller and Dr Alexander Kernen are independent and have no further mandates for the Ascom Group. All shareholders have the possibility to register on the Nimbus platform and to give online instructions to the Independent Representative. Details of the ­electronic proxies and voting instructions to the Independent Representative are explained in the invitation to the Annual General Meeting (www.ascom.com/ Investor-­Relations/Financial-information/Annual-General-Meeting.html). Resolutions and elections The General Meeting is capable of passing resolutions regardless of the number of shares represented. Unless the law or the Articles of Association require otherwise, the General Meeting shall pass resolutions and elections with an absolute majority of the votes validly cast, whereby abstentions, blank votes and invalid votes shall not count as votes cast. The Board of Directors shall define the voting procedure. Shareholders representing registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 100,000 may request a secret ballot. This threshold corresponds to 0.5% of the votes. ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 37 According to Article 704 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the following resolutions of the General Meeting require at least two thirds of the votes represented and the absolute majority of the nominal value of shares represented to be passed: changing the Company’s purpose; creating voting shares; changing limitations on transferability of registered shares; an authorized or conditional capital increase; a capital increase out of equity, against asset contribution or for the purpose of asset takeover and the granting of special benefits; limiting or revoking of subscription rights; relocation of the Company’s registered office; dissolution of the Company. Convocation of the General Meeting The General Meeting is convened by the Board of Directors or, if needed, by the auditors. Convocation is effected no later than 30 days ­before the date of the meeting by a single announcement in the Company’s publication of record (the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce – SOGC) and by letter to the registered shareholders. Agenda In accordance with Article 699 para. 3 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, requests to place an item on the agenda must be submitted to the Board of Directors no later than 45 days before the date of the General Meeting. The party submitting such request must represent shares of at least CHF 100,000 par value. The invitation to submit agenda items is published in a single announcement in the Company’s publication organ (the SOGC). Registration in the share register All shareholders recorded in the share register as voting shareholders ten days before the date of the General Meeting are admitted to the meeting and entitled to vote. The Board of Directors is empowered to strike entries from the share register with retroactive effect to the registration date if, after consulting the parties involved, it determines that such entries have been made based on false information on the part of the acquirer. Shareholders who dispose of their shares before the General Meeting are no longer entitled to vote. Annual General Meeting 2019 21,488,286 votes or about 59.7% of the share capital were represented at the ­Annual General Meeting 2019, which was held on 10 April 2019 in Zug, Switzerland. The shareholders voted in favor of all proposals of the Board of Directors by a clear majority. All resolutions including the election of the members of the Board and the dividend proposal were approved with majorities of over 93%. 38 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 7. CHANGE OF CONTROL AND DEFENSIVE MEASURES Obligation to submit a purchase offer The Articles of Association of Ascom Holding AG contain neither an opting-out nor an opting-up clause (Article 125 Financial Market Infrastructure Act [FMIA]). Any party who acquires one-third (33 1/3%) of share capital in Ascom Holding AG is obliged under Article 135 FMIA to submit a public purchase offer for the remaining shares. Change of control clauses Contracts of employment with members of the Executive Board, other members of the Executive Committee or other members of the senior management provide for no special severance payment. The period of notice for members of the Executive Board is maximal 12 months. In the event of a takeover and a delisting of the Company, the participants of the Ascom share matching plans shall receive the same number of matching shares as they hold investment shares at the date of the publication of the delisting. 8. AUDITORS Auditors The auditors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting for a term of one year. Pricewaterhouse­Coopers AG, Zurich (formerly STG-Coopers & Lybrand Ltd), have acted as auditors since 1987. The auditor was re-elected by the Annual General Meeting held on 10 April 2019 for a term of one year until the completion of the Annual General Meeting 2020. According to the Swiss Code of Obligations, the lead auditor has to be rotated at least every seven years. Thomas Wallmer is auditor­in-charge since 2015. Auditing fee PricewaterhouseCoopers AG was paid compensation of CHF 441,000 (previous year: CHF 451,400) for services in connection with auditing the annual financial statements of Ascom Holding AG and the Group companies as well as the consolidated statements of the Ascom Group for the year ended 31 December 2019. Additional fees PricewaterhouseCoopers AG was paid additional non-audit-related fees of CHF 35,000 (2018: nil). Monitoring and control instruments As a committee of the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee evaluates the performance, fees and independence of the external auditors each year. The external auditors prepare a detailed audit report at least once a year and report in detail to the Audit Committee. The main findings and recommendations contained in the audit reports of the external auditors are then discussed in detail with the CFO. In 2019, the external auditors drew up one detailed management report in relation to the Annual Report. The external auditors attended two of the Audit ­Committee meetings held in 2019. ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 39 Each year, the Board of Directors reviews the selection of auditors in order to propose them to shareholders for appointment at the Annual General Meeting. The aim is to ensure the general independence of the auditors as well as the personal independence of the auditor-in-charge and determine their understanding of ­A scom’s business activities and the specific business risks relevant for Ascom, the nature of collaboration between the external auditors and the Audit Committee, and the manner in which support is provided for implementation of the legal provisions as well as requirements from regulation and accounting standards (Swiss GAAP FER). The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the auditors in compliance with the legal provisions in Switzerland. The Board of Directors bases the rotation cycle for the auditor-in-charge on the relevant ­provisions of the Swiss Code of Obligations, according to which the auditor-in-charge may perform this mandate for no more than seven years. The Audit Committee also examines the ratio between the fee for the annual audit and fees for additional services performed by the auditors, in order to ensure that the auditors’ independence is not impaired. For the 2019 reporting year, the Board of Directors concluded that the auditors’ independence was fully assured. 9.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE RATING The Ascom Board of Directors and Executive Committee are committed to the highest standards of good corporate governance and transparency. Ascom is ranked number 20 (2018: number 7; 2017: number 1) in corporate governance among 174 publicly listed Swiss companies according to the Corporate Governance study 2019 of zRating (www.inrate.com). The study covered the following topics: ■■ Shareholder base and capital structure ■■ Shareholders’ participation rights ■■ Composition of the board and the executive management / information policy ■■ Remuneration and participation model for the members of the Board and the Executive Management ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Corporate Governance 41 Remuneration Report Note PricewaterhouseCoopers AG as statutory auditors have audited the Remuneration Report according to Clause 17 of the Ordinance against Excessive Compensation (“OaEC”). The audit was limited to the information contained in the sections II/1 lit.a, II/2 (Table “Compensation Executive Board 2019”), II/2 lit.g, II/2 lit.h and II/3 all marked as “audited information”. I. ASCOM REMUNERATION POLICY 1. Corporate Governance as basis of the remuneration policy Remuneration is a part of Corporate Governance (see also pages 18 to 41 of the Annual Report) and Corporate Governance is a key topic for Ascom. Both the Board of Directors and the Management are committed to good Corporate Governance in order to ensure sustainable development of the Company. According to the Articles of Association, it is a major task of the Compensation Committee to prepare the resolution of the Board of Directors concerning the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors and the members of the Executive Board to be approved by the Annual General Meeting. Basic rules and regulations to be followed are set out in: ■■ Swiss Code of Obligations ■■ Ordinance against Excessive Compensation with respect to stock exchange listed companies (“OaEC”) ■■ Listing Rules of SIX Swiss Exchange (LR) ■■ Articles of Association of Ascom Holding AG (dated 15 April 2015) ■■ Organizational Regulations of Ascom Holding AG (dated 21 August 2017) ■■ Share Registration Guidelines (dated 21 August 2017) ■■ Ascom Code of Ethical Business Conduct (dated 18 February 2020) ■■ Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance The Articles of Association and the Organizational Regulations of Ascom Holding AG are available on the Company website: www.ascom.com/Investor-Relations/ Governance/Directives-and-guidelines.html 2. Remuneration principles for the Board of Directors a) Legal background According to Article 20b of the Articles of Association, the compensation of the members of the Board of Directors shall be adequate, competitive and performance-oriented and shall be set in line with the operative and strategic goals, the success of the Company, as well as the long-term interests of the shareholders. 42 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report b) Compensation structure Members of the Board of Directors receive a fee in accordance with the Remuneration Regulations (Annex to the Organization Regulations). The members of the Board of Directors receive a fixed fee without a variable component, and this fee is paid in cash. No other remuneration is paid. Members of the Board of Directors receive no severance payment. Committee work, additional meetings or special projects are not compensated with an additional fee and no attendance fees are paid out either. The fees for members of the Board of Directors are periodically reviewed as necessary and are set by the full Board of Directors subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting. The assessment of the fees is based on external and ­internal criteria (e.g. workload, request of availability). An external expert did a comprehensive benchmark study in 2017 based on the SPI Top 100 companies, based on a sizeand industry-adjusted subgroup of 22 SPI companies, and based on an individual comparison of five companies (Kudelski, Siegfried, Huber + Suhner, ­Ypsomed, U-Blox). The Board fees were adjusted in 2017 on the basis of this study. According to Article 20e of the Articles of Association, expense recovery is no compensation. The Company reimburses the members of the Board of Directors for all necessary expense, also in form of lump sum expense recoveries within the amount accepted by the tax authorities. c) Board fees The fees for the members of the Board of Directors remained unchanged since the Annual General Meeting 2017: ■■ Chairperson of the Board: Annual gross remuneration of CHF 200,000 ■■ Member of the Board: Annual gross remuneration of CHF 100,000 In addition, all Board members are encouraged to build up an investment over time of Ascom shares in the value of an annual Board compensation. d) Mandates outside the Ascom Group Article 20d of the Articles of Association defines the mandates outside the Ascom Group: ■■ Members of the Board of Directors may occupy or exercise four additional positions against compensation in the highest managing or supervising body of ­other entities that are obliged to be entered into the commercial register or a ­comparable foreign register and that are neither controlled by nor that control the Company. ■■ In addition, members of the Board of Directors may occupy or exercise five uncompensated positions in the highest managing or supervising body of such entities, whereby expense recovery is no compensation. ■■ The Chairperson of the Board of Directors may exercise a total of up to three positions in other publicly traded companies. ■■ In addition to these mandates, members of the Board of Directors may occupy or exercise not more than five positions in several different companies that form the same group of companies or positions that are held based on the instructions of the Company. The Company requires that each member of the Board discloses all activities. Based on this, all members of the Board of Directors comply with this regulation. The mandates outside the Ascom Group are listed in the Corporate Governance part (p. 28). ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report 43 As the provisions of the Articles of Association of Ascom are very restrictive, the Board of Directors recommends revising them and is proposing an amendment to be decided at the Annual General Meeting 2020. According to the benchmark with other publicly listed Swiss companies (such as Bossard, Bucher, Burckhardt Compression, Huber + Suhner, Landis + Gyr, Schaffner, Siegfried, SIG Combibloc, Tecan, Temenos, and U-Blox), it is proposed that every Board member may occupy or exercise at most four additional positions in publicly listed companies, five additional positions in non-listed companies, and ten additional positions associations and foundations including pension funds. 3. Remuneration principles for the Executive Board a) Legal background According to Article 20b of the Articles of Association, the compensation of the members of the Executive Board shall be adequate, competitive and performanceoriented and shall be set in line with the operative and strategic goals, the success of the Company, as well as the long-term interests of the shareholders. The compensation of the members of the Executive Board consists of three elements: ■■ Fixed compensation in cash ■■ Performance-related compensation as short-term incentive in cash ■■ Long-term incentive (allocation of equity securities, conversion rights or option rights) According to the Articles of Association, the Company may pay to the members of the Executive Board in addition to a fixed compensation a performance-related compensation (“short-term incentive”) in cash. The amount of such variable compensation is dependent on the qualitative and quantitative goals and parameters determined by the Board of Directors, in particular the overall result of the Company and the individual contribution of the respective member. The fixed compensation and the short-term incentive form together the target cash compensation (TCC). As a third compensation element, according to Article 20b Section 3 of the Articles of Association, the Company may also allocate, beside cash compensation, equity securities, conversion rights, option rights or other rights with equity securities as underlying to the members of the Executive Board (“long-term incentive”). In case of an allocation of equity securities, conversion rights, option rights or other rights with equity securities as underlying, the amount of the compensation is equal to the value of the securities or, respectively, the rights allocated, determined as at the time of the allocation (grant) in accordance with the accounting standards applied by the Company for its consolidated accounts. b) Current regulations According to the current statutory regulations, the amount of the performance­related compensation (short-term incentive) of a member of the Executive Board cannot exceed his fixed compensation. According to the current statutory regulations, the total value of the long-term incentive for a member of the Executive Board cannot exceed 50% of his fixed compensation. 44 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report c) New approach as from 2020 The Board of Directors targets to increase the performance-related part of the compensation of the Top Management. Thus, the Board of Directors decided to decrease for the new CEO the fixed compensation in cash while increasing the short-term incentive and the potential of the long-term incentive part effective from 2020. Moreover, the Board of Directors proposes to amend the Articles of Association and to increase the corresponding caps in Article 20b: It is proposed that the short-term incentive shall not exceed 200% of the fixed compensation and that the long-term incentive shall not exceed the fixed compensation. d) Appointment of members of the Executive Board As members of the Executive Board are considered the CEO and each further person who is explicitly appointed as such by the Board of Directors according to Article 8 of the Articles of Association. As of 31 December 2019, the Executive Board consisted of four members: ■■ Jeannine Pilloud, CEO (since 2 August 2019 [double mandate as Chairperson & CEO from 2 August 2019 to 7 November 2019]) ■■ Dominik Maurer, CFO (in charge since 10 October 2019) ■■ Claes Ödman, COO (as of 1 February 2020: COO/Head of Global Functions) ■■ Francis Schmeer, Chief Sales & Marketing Officer (as of 1 February 2020: Chief Sales Officer/Head of Rest of World). e) Determination of the remuneration of the Executive Board members The remuneration package of the members of the Executive Board consists of three parts: ■■ Base salary Fixed compensation in cash including social benefits: according to market benchmarks of the peer group (SPI companies such as Bossard, Bucher, Burckhardt Compression, Huber + Suhner, Landis + Gyr, Schaffner, Siegfried, SIG Combibloc, Tecan, Temenos, and U-Blox). ■■ Short-term incentive (performance-related variable compensation) Cash payment dependent on the quantitative goals and parameters such as net revenue and EBITDA margin as determined by the Board of Directors. The goals shall be in line with the yearly budgets of the Company. In addition, individual qualitative targets may be set. ■■ Long-term incentive (Performance Stock Units Plan) The PSU Plan foresees annual issuance of Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”) with the first allocation in 2019. One PSU represents the conditional right to receive a fraction between 0% and 200% of an Ascom share subject to the fulfillment of certain vesting conditions. Vesting of the PSUs occurs on the third anniversary of the respective date of grant. Vesting conditions are, both, the achievement of performance targets as well as an unterminated contractual relationship with the company. Performance targets are represented by equally weighted three-year net income fully diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measured against the Swiss Performance Index Extra (“SPI EXTRA”) and expressed as a percentage points difference. The award forfeits fully or partly if employment ceased before the vesting date. Furthermore, the PSU plan is subject to malus and clawback provisions. The respective plan rules provide the Board of Directors with absolute discretion to recoup (or cause the forfeiture if not yet vested or awarded) fully or partly any award under the restated financial result and/or for reasons linked to an individual’s behavior. ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report 45 According to Article 20e of the Articles of Association, expense recovery is no compensation. The Company reimburses the members of the Executive Board for all necessary expenses, also in form of car allowances and other lump sum expense recoveries within the amount accepted by the tax authorities. f) System of CEO Compensation as of 1 January 20201 Salary part Target salary CEO Long-term incentive Performance Stock Units as defined by Performance Stock Units the Board of Directors and in line with the Articles of Association (achievement of performance targets as vesting condition) Variable compensation (performance-related) Minimal variable salary: CHF 0 (as of 1 January 2020) Target variable salary: CHF 425,000 Maximal variable salary: CHF 850,000 Fixed compensation (base salary) CHF 550,000 (as of 1 January 2020) 1 The system of CEO compensation as of 1 January 2019 is set out on page 46 of the Annual Report 2018. g) Number of external mandates and functions Article 20d of the Articles of Association defines the mandates outside the Ascom Group: ■■ Members of the Executive Board may occupy or exercise – subject to the ­approval of the Board of Directors – one additional position against compensation in the highest managing or supervising body of other entities that are obliged to be ­entered into the commercial register or a comparable foreign register and that are neither controlled by nor that control the Company. ■■ In addition, members of the Executive Board may occupy or exercise three uncompensated positions in the highest managing or supervising body of such entities, whereby expense recovery is no compensation. ■■ In addition to these mandates, members of the Executive Board may occupy or exercise not more than five positions in several different companies that form the same group of companies or positions that are held based on the instructions of the Company. The mandates outside the Ascom Group of the members of the Executive Board are listed in the Corporate Governance Report (p. 33). The Board of Directors recommends revising also these provisions of the Articles of Association and is proposing to the Annual General Meeting 2020 a more ­flexible solution: According to the benchmark with other publicly listed Swiss companies (such as Bossard, Bucher, Burckhardt Compression, Huber + Suhner, Landis + Gyr, Schaffner, Siegfried, SIG Combibloc, Tecan, Temenos, and U-Blox), it is proposed that every member of the Executive Board may occupy or exercise at most – and subject to approval of the Board of Directors – one additional position in publicly listed companies, two additional positions in non-listed companies, and five additional positions in associations and foundations including pension funds. 46 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report h) Employment agreements with members of the Executive Board According to Article 20c of the Articles of Association, employment agreements with members of the Executive Board that form the basis of the compensation for the respective members are entered into for a fixed term of not more than one year or an indefinite term with a termination period of not more than 12 months as per the end of each calendar month. All members of the Executive Board comply with this regulation. i) Pension payments According to Article 20c of the Articles of Association, the members of the Executive Board receive pension payments from the occupational pension scheme in accordance with the domestic or foreign occupational welfare law or pension ­regulations applicable to them, including possible supplementary benefits. Pension payments outside the occupational pension scheme to a member of the Executive Board by the Company, an affiliate of the Company or any third party are admissible to the extent of not more than 25% of the annual total compensation of the person concerned, as far as the respective person is not affiliated to a Swiss or foreign benefit institution. 4. Approval Mechanism a) Statutory approval mechanism According to Article 20e of the Articles of Association, the General Meeting votes annually, separately and in a binding manner on the maximum total amounts proposed by the Board of Directors for: ■■ The compensation of the Board of Directors for the year of office following the ordinary General Meeting until the next ordinary General Meeting ■■ The fixed compensation of the Executive Board for the next fiscal year (1 January to 31 December) following the ordinary General Meeting ■■ The variable and other compensation of the Executive Board (including the ­allocation of equity securities, conversion rights, option rights or other rights with equity securities as underlying) for the same approval period In addition, the Board of Directors submits the remuneration report for the business year prior to the Annual General Meeting for a consultative vote. The Annual General Meeting 2019 approved in a consultative non-binding vote the Remuneration Report 2018 with a majority of 96.9%. As far as a total amount approved for the compensation of the Executive Board is insufficient to compensate members of the Executive Board appointed or promoted within the Executive Board after the respective resolution of the General Meeting until the beginning of the following Approval Period, the Company may use an additional amount pursuant to Article 19 OaEC in addition to the previously approved total compensation for the Executive Board for the respective Approval Period. Such an additional amount is only available within the following limits: for the CEO an amount which is not more than 20% higher than the compensation of its predecessor and for a member of the Executive Board an amount which is not more than 20% higher than the amount available on average for members of the Executive Board (excluding the CEO) for the Approval Period. The General Meeting does not vote on the used additional amount.

The Company paid for the COO employer contributions of CHF 34,003 (2018: CHF 32,958) to the Swedish social insurances. These contributions do neither constitute nor increase the pension benefits of the employee. According to Article 20e of the Articles of Association, expense recovery is no compensation. The Company reimburses the members of the Executive Board for all necessary expenses, also in form of car allowances and other lump sum expense recoveries within the amount accepted by the tax authorities. c) Fixed compensation The basic salaries (including social benefits) paid to the members of the Executive Board in the 2019 financial year totaled CHF 1,929,076 (2018: CHF 1,589,168). ­Adjusted for the amount paid to the former CEO and former CFO after their resignation from the Executive Board, the total amount related to the fixed compensation for the active members of the Executive Board in 2019 is CHF 1,536,058. d) Short-term incentive (performance-related variable compensation) ■■ Current regulations as of 2019 – Targets are defined at the beginning of each year in alignment with the budget targets by the Board of Directors. If all defined targets are achieved in full, the respective member of the Executive Board receives a predetermined percentage of the basic salary as a variable component (performance-related part). If the results fall short, no variable salary component is paid. In cases where the targets set are exceeded, the member of the Executive Board is paid a higher variable salary component (up to a maximum that is in line with the fixed compensation). – The CEO receives a variable salary component of 50% of his basic salary on fully achieving all targets. In cases where the targets set are exceeded, the CEO is paid a higher variable salary component (performance-related part) up to 100% of the basic salary. – The other members of the Executive Board receive a variable salary component of 40 to 50% of their basic salary on fully achieving all targets. In cases where the targets set are exceeded, they are paid a variable salary component (performance-related part) up to a maximum of 100% of their basic salaries. – Performance-related variable compensation (excluding any possible allocation of equity securities, conversion rights, option rights or other rights with equity securities as underlying) cannot exceed the fixed compensation of a member of the Executive Board. ■■ Performance-related targets 2019 The Board of Directors sets the performance targets for 2019 with the aim to incentivize profitable growth of the Group. The performance-related variable compensation for the members of the ­Executive Board in 2019 was linked to the achievement of the following measurable quantitative targets (incl. weighting): ■■ Net revenue: 55% ■■ EBITDA: 45% The defined targets were missed. Thus, two of the full-year active members of the Executive Board (COO and Chief Sales & Marketing Officer) did not receive a performance-related variable compensation. 52 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report The new CEO starting on 2 August 2019 (double mandate as Chairperson & CEO until 7 November 2019) receives as a short-term incentive 15,973 Ascom shares with a value of CHF 200,000 at grant date. The shares are blocked for a period of three years after grant. The new CFO starting on 10 October 2019 receives a short-term incentive of CHF 16,579 based on the achievement of individual targets given by the Board of Directors. The variable salary component for the active members of the Executive Board as of 31 December 2019 amounted to CHF 216,579 (excluding payments according to employment contracts for two former members of the Executive Board). In 2018, variable salary for the active members of the Executive Board was CHF 219,897. The former CEO (leaving as of 2 August 2019) received a variable payment of CHF 94,792 for the first seven months as active CEO and another payment of CHF 67,708 for the time after his resignation, both according to his employment contract. The former CFO (leaving as of 13 August 2019) received a variable payment of CHF 41,406 for the first 7.5 months as active CFO and another payment of CHF 24,844 for the time after her resignation, both according to her employment contract. e) Long-term incentive (Performance Stock Units Plan) The PSU Plan foresees annual issuance of Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”) with the first allocation in 2019. One PSU represents the conditional right to receive a fraction between 0% and 200% of an Ascom share subject to the fulfillment of certain vesting conditions. Vesting of the PSUs occurs on the third anniversary of the respective date of grant. Vesting conditions are, both, the achievement of performance targets as well as an unterminated contractual relationship with the Company. Performance targets are represented by equally weighted three-year net income fully diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measured against the Swiss Performance Index Extra (“SPI EXTRA”) and expressed as a percentage points difference. The award forfeits fully or partly if employment ceased before the vesting date. Furthermore, the PSU plan is subject to malus and clawback provisions. The respective plan rules provide the Board of Directors with absolute discretion to recoup (or cause the forfeiture if not yet vested or awarded) fully or partly any award under the restated financial result and/or for reasons linked to an individual’s behavior. The Ascom PSU Plan 2019 is running for a period of three years with a vesting date defined at 31 May 2022. The target achievement is based on two performance indicators: ■■ Three-year fully diluted weighted cumulative Earnings per Share (EPS) ■■ Ascom’s three-year Total Shareholders Return (TSR) measured relative to the SPI EXTRA Index ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report 53 The fair value of a PSU (based on the PSU Plan 2019) was calculated by an external expert and set at CHF 9.71 at grant date. On 18 June 2019, the then CEO received 33,471 PSUs with a fair value of CHF 325,000 at grant. This amount corresponds to the fair value at grant date for the whole vesting period (until 31 May 2022). However, the effective remuneration will correspond in maximum to the adjusted vesting period (pro rata temporis until the end of the working contract). The COO and the Chief Sales & Marketing Officer each received 12,358 PSUs with a fair value of CHF 120,000 at grant. No PSUs were awarded to the then CFO. f) Total compensation of the members of the Executive Board The total compensation in 2019 for all members of the Executive Board amounted to CHF 3,267,135 (2018: CHF 2,384,777). Adjusted for the amount paid to the former CEO and former CFO after their resignation from the Executive Board, the total compensation for the active members of the Executive Board in 2019 is CHF 2,716,901. g) Highest compensation The highest total remuneration within the Ascom Group was paid to the former CEO (in charge until 2 August 2019). The total remuneration paid to the former CEO in 2019 consisted of an amount of CHF 888,550 for the period as acting CEO and of an amount of CHF 388,276 paid for the period after his resignation (3 August – 31 D­ ecember 2019) according to his employment contract. The total remuneration paid to the former CEO in 2019 amounted to CHF 1,276,826 (2018: CHF 1,090,683). h) Additional payments (audited information) No members of the Executive Board received any additional payments as defined by Art. 663b bis of the Swiss Code of Obligations, nor were any payments made to parties closely related to the Executive Board. The Company granted no members of the Executive Board or closely related parties any loans nor do such loans exist. i) Severance payments (audited information) Contracts of employment with members of the Executive Board provide for no special severance payment. The period of notice for members of the Executive Board is maximal 12 months. In the event of a takeover and a delisting of the Company, the participants of the Ascom share matching plans shall receive the same number of matching shares as they hold investment shares at the date of the publication of the delisting. k) Compliance with the decisions of the Annual General Meeting 2018 The shareholders approved the following maximum amounts for future compensations at the Annual General Meeting 2018 for the then five members of the Executive Board for fiscal year 2019: ■■ CHF 2,100,000 as fixed compensation (including contributions to pension funds and other social benefits) ■■ CHF 1,700,000 as variable compensation ■■ CHF 850,000 as long-term incentive 54 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report According to Article 20e Section 3 of the Articles of Association, the Company may use an additional amount pursuant to Article 19 OaEC as far as the total amount approved for the compensation of the Executive Board is insufficient to compensate members of the Executive Board appointed after the resolution of the General Meeting until the beginning of the following Approval Period. The new CEO was appointed as of 2 August 2019. According to Article 20e Sec­tion 3 of the Articles of Association, an additional amount, which is not more than 20% higher than the compensation of its predecessor, would be available for such a case. In line with the contractual compensation of the former CEO, this additional amount would be CHF 1,950,000 in maximum. The new CFO was appointed as of 10 October 2019.

In spite of the appointment of both a new CEO and a new CFO, no additional amount according to the Articles of Association has to be decided. The total compensation paid to the Executive Board in 2019 of CHF 3,267,135 (including payments of CHF 550,234 in total made to the former CEO and to the former CFO after their resignation) is in line with the amount of CHF 4,650,000 as approved by the Annual General Meeting 2018.

These shares are blocked for period of three years after grant date. Ascom Holding AG allotted no further shares in 2019. IV. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS 1. Ascom share matching plan 2017 The Board of Directors decided in its Board Meeting of 21 August 2017 to introduce a share matching plan 2017 for the Ascom senior management as a long-term incentive. The beneficiaries had the opportunity to buy Company shares during a defined subscription period at market price as investment shares up to a certain number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company will match the investment shares with additional shares based on the fulfillment of defined employmentbased and performance-based criteria. Beneficiaries have to keep the investment shares for a period of three years in order to benefit from the plan. Beneficiaries may get up to 65% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares, provided that defined mid-term profitability targets are achieved. In addition, they get 35% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares after a three-year vesting period for free, if their employment contract with Ascom has not been terminated at this point in time. The Board of Directors linked the mid-term profitability targets to the EBITDA margin of Ascom achieved in fiscal year 2019. In order to distribute additional performance-related matching shares to the beneficiaries, Ascom must achieve at least the lower end of the pre-defined EBITDA margin target 2019. Every participant will receive the maximum of 65% of additional investment shares in case the EBITDA margin of Ascom in 2019 reaches the upper end of the pre-defined EBITDA margin target or higher. In addition, the beneficiaries (excluding members of the Executive Board) may get up to 50% of the number of their investment shares as growth-related matching shares provided that defined mid-term growth targets are achieved. In order to receive additional matching shares, the growth performance (CAGR 2019 over 2016) must achieve a certain range. Every participant will receive the maximum of 50% of additional investment shares in case the growth performance as defined reaches the upper end of this range. As a maximum, the Company will honor each investment share with 1.5 matching shares (members of the Executive Board: 1.0 matching share). 19 members of the Ascom senior management decided to participate and they purchased in total 32,956 investment shares. 1,808 investment shares were exercised or forfeited in 2018. Out of the remainder of 31,148 investment shares, 1,205 ­investment shares were exercised or forfeited in 2019. Thus, 29,943 investment shares still may qualify for matching shares. ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report 57 2. Ascom share matching plan 2018 The Board of Directors decided in its Board Meeting of 28 August 2018 to introduce a share matching plan 2018 for the Ascom senior management as a long-term incentive. The beneficiaries had the opportunity to buy Company shares during a defined subscription period at market price as investment shares up to a certain number of shares as determined by the Board of Directors. The Company will match the investment shares with additional shares based on the fulfillment of defined employment-based and performance-based criteria. Beneficiaries have to keep the investment shares for a period of three years in order to benefit from the plan. Beneficiaries may get up to 65% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares, provided that defined mid-term profitability targets are achieved. In addition, they get 35% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares after a three-year vesting period for free, if their employment contract with Ascom has not been terminated at this point in time. The Board of Directors linked the mid-term profitability targets to the EBITDA margin of Ascom achieved in fiscal year 2020. In order to distribute additional performance-related matching shares to the beneficiaries, Ascom must achieve at least the lower end of the pre-defined EBITDA margin target 2020. Every participant will receive the maximum of 65% of additional investment shares in case the ­EBITDA margin of Ascom in 2020 reaches the upper end of the pre-defined EBITDA margin target or higher. In addition, the beneficiaries may get up to 50% of the number of their investment shares as growth-related matching shares provided that defined mid-term growth targets are achieved. In order to receive additional matching shares, the growth performance (CAGR 2020 over 2017) must achieve a certain range. Every participant will receive the maximum of 50% of additional investment shares in case the growth performance as defined reaches the upper end of this range. As a maximum, the Company will honor each investment share with 1.5 matching shares. 15 members of the Ascom senior management decided to participate and they purchased in total 24,057 investment shares. 1,464 investment shares were exercised or forfeited in 2019. Thus, 22,593 investment shares still may qualify for matching shares. 3. Performance Stock Units (PSU) Plan 2019 The Board of Directors decided to introduce a different version of a long-term incentive as of 2019. To further recognize and reward members of the Executive Board (and selected senior managers) for sustainable value creation for the company and its shareholders, a new long-term incentive was developed and approved by the Board of Directors. The PSU Plan foresees annual issuance of Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”) with the first allocation in 2019. The total value of the long-term incentive for a member of the Executive Board cannot exceed 50% of the fixed compensation. One PSU represents the conditional right to receive a fraction between 0% and 200% of an Ascom share subject to the fulfillment of certain vesting conditions. Vesting of the PSUs occurs on the third anniversary of the respective date of grant. Vesting conditions are, both, the achievement of performance targets as well as an unterminated contractual relationship with the company. Performance targets are represented by equally weighted three-year net income fully diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measured against the Swiss Performance Index Extra (“SPI EXTRA”) and expressed as a percentage points difference. The award forfeits fully or partly if employment ceased before the vesting date. Furthermore, the PSU plan is subject to malus and 58 ASCOM Annual Report 2019 Remuneration Report clawback provisions. The respective plan rules provide the Board of Directors with absolute discretion to recoup (or cause the forfeiture if not yet vested or awarded) fully or partly any award under the restated financial result and/or for reasons linked to an individual’s behavior. The Ascom long-term incentive 2019 (PSU Plan 2019) is running for a period of three years with a vesting date defined at 31 May 2022. The target achievement is based on two performance indicators: ■■ Three-year fully diluted weighted cumulative Earnings per Share (EPS) ■■ Ascom’s three-year Total Shareholders Return (TSR) measured relative to the SPI EXTRA Index The fair value of a PSU (based on the PSU Plan 2019) was calculated by an external expert and set at CHF 9.71 at grant date. On 18 June 2019, the Board of Directors awarded to 51 members of the Senior Management 153,562 PSUs. Out of this number, 5,150 PSUs were forfeited during 2019. Thus, 148,412 PSUs may qualify for share conversion. 4.

These investment shares may entitle the holder to a maximum of 67,253 matching shares according to the regulations of the share matching plans. Moreover, there are 148,412 outstanding PSUs which may be converted into maximal 296,824 shares. The total of the outstanding contingent matching shares and the outstanding ­contingent conversion shares corresponds to 1.01% of the total share capital of the Company.

Ascom is headquartered in Baar (Switzerland), has operating businesses in 18 countries and employs around 1,300 people worldwide. Ascom Holding AG, the parent company of the Group, is a public limited company and its registered shares (symbol ASCN) are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich (Switzerland). 2. SUMMARY OF THE GENERAL GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES 2.1 Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Ascom Holding AG comply with Swiss law and have been prepared based on the individual financial statements of each Group company. These are based on historical cost, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and in accordance with the entire existing guidelines of Swiss GAAP FER (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles FER/FER = Fachempfehlung zur Rechnungslegung = Accounting and reporting recommendations). Furthermore, the consolidated financial statements comply with the provisions of the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange and are presented in Swiss francs (CHF). The accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies. A summary of the significant accounting policies is provided below. The closing date for the Group and the individual Group companies is 31 December. 2.2 Changes in accounting policy and disclosures During 2019, management decided to change the inventory cost method from weighted-average to FIFO (First In – First Out) cost method (see note 2.10). The aim was to simplify the internal procedures and to seek a closing value which approximates the current market value. The financial impact is not material in 2019 and 2018. There were no other changes in 2019. 2.3 Use of judgments and estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Group’s accounting policies and the r­eported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognized prospectively. 66 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies, that have the most significant effects on the consolidated financial statements and information about uncertainties related to assumptions and estimates, that have the potential risk of resulting in a significant adjustment, are included in the following notes: ■■ Note 9 – recognition of internally generated intangible assets: whether the Group has met the criteria for capitalization of internally generated development costs relating to the design and testing of new or improved products. ■■ Note 9 – measurement of intangibles: key assumptions and estimates underlying valuation and recoverability of intangible assets from acquisitions and capitalized internally generated intangible assets, including related forecasted cash flows. ■■ Note 14 – measurement of pension liabilities related to certain pension plans: key actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, future salary or pension increases and average life expectancy, as well as plan assets performance and funded status. ■■ Notes 13 and 29 – recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key a­ ssumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of net future outflow of cash, including discount rates. ■■ Note 23 – recognition and measurement of the provision for income tax and recognition of deferred income tax assets: availability of qualified future taxable profit against which tax loss carry-forwards can be used. 2.4 Consolidation The consolidated financial statements cover Ascom Holding AG and all subsidiaries over which the Group has control. Ascom controls a subsidiary when Ascom is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the subsidiary and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the subsidiary. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. Profits or losses from disposal of subsidiaries are recorded in profit or loss, including the effect of recycling of any goodwill previously offset against equity. The list of the consolidated Group companies is included in note 34. Percentages of the Group’s interest in share capital correspond to percentages in voting rights held. The Group uses the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of assets transferred, liabilities assumed and equity interests issued by the Group, including the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are capitalized and allocated to goodwill. Pursuant to a purchase price allocation, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed as well as any contingent assets and ­liabilities are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealized gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 67 2.5 Foreign currency translation All assets and liabilities of foreign entities are translated into Swiss francs (CHF), the Group’s reporting currency, at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. Income, expenses and cash flows of foreign entities are translated at average exchange rates for the year. Exchange differences arising from the reconversion of the net investment in subsidiaries in foreign functional currencies are recorded as currency translation adjustments in equity. Upon disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency translation adjustments are recognized in the income statement. Applicable exchange rates for Ascom’s major foreign currencies are as follow: Foreign currency translation CHFm ISO code Unit 31.12.2019 Average 2019 31.12.2018 Average 2018 Euro EUR 1 1.085 1.112 1.127 1.153 US dollar USD 1 0.966 0.992 0.984 0.977 Swedish krona SEK 1 0.104 0.105 0.110 0.113 Pound sterling GBP 1 1.276 1.269 1.260 1.301 Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). Goodwill and fair value adjustments from the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the rate prevailing on the acquisition date. Transactions in foreign currencies are accounted for at the average exchange rates of the prior month, as an approximation of the exchange rate at the transaction date. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in profit or loss. Such balances are converted into the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates prevailing on 31 December. 2.6 Revenue recognition Net revenue includes all sales of goods and services after deduction of any sales reductions including discounts, rebates, returns and value-added tax. Revenue from sale of goods and services is recognized on delivery to and acceptance by the customer, when significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to Ascom. Goods sold to customers include hardware and software. Services rendered to customers include consulting, commissioning and installation services as well as after-sales support, repair and maintenance services. Revenue from long-term maintenance agreements is recognized straight-line over the contract term. Revenue from fixed-price, multi-element contracts including goods and services is allocated to the separable components based on the value of the separable components. Revenue from significant customer projects is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method (PoC), if the stage of completion and expected outcome can be measured reliably. The respective calculation is based either on the units completed compared to the total number of contracted units, or if this approach is not applicable, on the costs incurred compared to the total costs to complete. 68 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2.7 Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 2.8 Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognized at their nominal value less any provision for doubtful debts, which is recognized when it becomes probable that the receivable is not fully realizable. The amount of the provision is the receivable at nominal value less the amount of the expected realization. The valuation effect is recorded in marketing and sales expenses. 2.9 Other current assets Other short-term receivables, prepayments and accrued income are stated at nominal value less impairment, if any. 2.10 Inventories and work in progress Inventories are stated at the lower of purchase or manufacturing cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less estimated cost of completion and estimated selling cost. Manufacturing cost includes direct material and production costs as well as material and production overheads. The inventory cost is determined using the FIFO (First In – First Out) cost method. Purchase discounts are treated as a purchase price reduction. Value adjustments are made for obsolete and slow-moving items. Work in progress on long-term contracts is recognized according to the stage of completion of the contract (percentage-of-completion method). Provisions are made to cover anticipated losses as soon as these are identified. 2.11 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at acquisition or production cost (i.e. historical cost) less accumulated depreciation. Land is valued at cost and is not depreciated. Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Buildings 20–40 Installations 7–10 Production equipment, measuring and test equipment, IT hardware, furniture 3–5 Tools and demo equipment 3 Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when they can be measured reliably and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with such costs will flow to the Group. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. All other repairs and maintenance are charged to profit or loss during the financial period in which they incur. All gains or losses arising from the disposal of property, plant and equipment are included in the income statement. ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 69 2.12 Intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recorded at acquisition or production cost less accumulated amortization. Customer relations are capitalized using the excessearning method for valuation of the existing customers at acquisition date. Technology and trademarks are capitalized using the relief from royalty method for valuation. The amortization charge is calculated on a straight-line basis over the period of its estimated useful e ­ conomic life as shown in the following table: Useful life in years Customer relations 10 Technology 5–7 Internally generated intangibles 3–5 Other (trademarks, licenses and software) 3–5 Intangible assets not ready for use are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill resulting from acquisitions (the excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of the acquired assets, liabilities and equity interests) is offset in equi­ ty against retained earnings at the date of acquisition. The consequences of a theoretical capitalization and amortization of goodwill are explained in note 9. If the purchase price contains contingent elements that are dependent on future results (e.g. earn-out), a liability is recognized in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on an estimate of the earn-out payment expected to be paid at the agreed future date. Changes in this estimate during the earn-out period or differences between the recorded liability and the final settlement are recorded in equity. All research costs are charged to profit or loss as incurred. Costs incurred on development projects (relating to the design, development and testing of major new products, major product improvements or software platforms and significant applications) are recognized as intangible assets, when specific criteria are fulfilled regarding technical feasibility, commitment of resources and recoverability through future economic benefits. Development costs that cannot be capitalized are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they occur. 2.13 Financial assets Financial assets mainly comprise of loans to third parties, deferred tax assets and pension assets. Loans and pension assets are initially recorded at actual value and subsequently measured at amortized cost less valuation adjustments. Information related to deferred tax assets is presented in note 2.22. 2.14 Impairment of assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment when indicators exist that the carrying amount of the asset might exceed its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset is higher than the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired to its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less disposal cost and value in use. Intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortization and are therefore tested for impairment at least once a year. As goodwill is fully offset against equity at the date of acquisition, an impairment of goodwill will not affect income, but will only be disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (refer to note 9). Impairment tests are performed based on discounted cash flows at the level of the corresponding cashgenerating units, representing the lowest level at which such assets are evaluated for recoverability. 70 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 2.15 Derivative financial instruments Due to the global nature of its activities, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. The related risk management is described in note 27. The Group may hedge expected future foreign currency cash flows by executing forward contracts. These derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value at the trade date. Where such forward contracts are linked to specific projected transactions and cash flows, the hedging is deemed to be effective and documented accordingly, with changes in the fair value of the cash flow hedges recognized in equity. The gain or loss relating to fair value changes of other forward contracts is recognized immediately in the income statement as part of the financial result, as these contracts are deemed ineffective hedges. Where these cash flow hedges related to flow of goods, the gains or losses are recorded as part of cost of sales. Gains and losses related to fair value changes of foreign currency forward contracts, which have been recognized in equity, are recycled in the income statement in the periods in which the hedged item affects gain or loss. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. 2.16 Equity Registered shares are classified as equity. Own shares, expenses for equity-settled share-based payments, realized gains or losses from disposals of own shares as well as costs relating to capital increases and decreases are recorded in equity. Dividends are charged to equity in the period in which they are approved. The share premium represents the excess of the issued share capital over its nominal value. 2.17 Borrowings and borrowing costs Borrowings are initially recorded at actual value, net of transaction costs incurred and subsequently measured at amortized cost. They include mainly bank loans and are classified as current if they are settled within 12 months, and there is no unconditional right to extend the settlement to at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. Borrowing costs directly attributable to a material acquisition, development or production of an internally generated asset, that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale (i.e. qualifying asset), are capitalized as part of the cost of the respective asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. 2.18 Pension benefit obligations There are various pension plans in existence within the Group which are individually aligned with local conditions in their respective countries. They are financed either by means of contributions to legally independent pension or insurance funds, or by recognition as liabilities in the balance sheet of the respective Group companies. An economic obligation is recognized as a liability if the requirements for the recognition of a provision are met under Swiss GAAP FER. An economic benefit is capitalized provided that the Company is entitled to such benefit in the future, for example, to offset future Group pension expenses. Freely available employer contribution reserves are capitalized. Employees of Swiss Group companies are insured as part of a multi-employer pension fund, an independent separate legal entity under Swiss Law (“Gemeinschaftsstiftung”) financed by contributions from participating employers and employees. An economical obligation or a benefit from the Swiss pension scheme is determined from the pension fund financial statements prepared on the basis of Swiss GAAP FER 26 “Accounting of Pension Plans” and recognized in the balance sheet accordingly. The provision for pension plans of foreign subsidiaries, which are not organized as independent legal entities, is determined based on the local valuation methods in effect. ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 71 2.19 Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are made when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, when it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation in the future. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognized as interest expense. For costs that are ­expected to arise in connection with site closures, the disposal of companies or business units and restructuring, provisions are made at the time of the decision of approved measures. For onerous contracts, provisions are provided if the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligation exceed the economic benefit to be received. If an outflow of resources to settle an obligation is not probable, a contingent liability is disclosed. Contingent liabilities and other off-balance sheet commitments are evaluated at each reporting date, taking into account also any guaranteed considerations from other parties (e.g. insurance coverage). 2.20 Leases A lease is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee in return for a payment, or series of payments, the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time. a) Lessee accounting Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred from the lessor to the lessee are classified as finance leases. The leased assets are carried at cost not higher than the minimal lease payments and depreciated along with other property, plant and equipment (see note 2.11). The corresponding leasing obligations are shown as liabilities. Leasing payments are allocated accordingly as either capital repayments or interest expenses. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. b) Lessor accounting When assets are leased out under a finance lease, the present value of the net minimum lease payments is recognized as a receivable under financial assets. The difference between the gross receivable (gross investment in leases) and the present value of the net minimum lease payments is recognized as unearned interest income. Each lease installment is allocated between the receivable and interest income. When assets are leased out under an operating lease, the asset is included in the balance sheet based on the nature of the asset. Operating lease income is recognized in profit or loss over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. 2.21 Share-based payments Selected members of Ascom’s senior management receive remuneration in the form of share-based remunerations pursuant to share matching plans and Performance Stock Unit (“PSU”) plans. a) Share matching plans The beneficiaries of share matching plans get the opportunity to buy company shares at market price as investment shares up to a certain amount. They have to keep the investment shares over a defined period in order to benefit from the plan. 72 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements Beneficiaries receive 35% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares after a three-year vesting period for free if they are still employed with Ascom at this point of time. As an additional performance-related part, beneficiaries may receive up to 115% of the number of their investment shares as matching shares, provided that defined mid-term profitability targets are achieved. As a maximum, the company will honor each investment share with one matching share. The cost of matching shares is measured initially at fair value at grant date, taking into consideration a deduction for the dividend yield as well as expected fluctuation of the plan participants. The initial fair value is recognized as expense over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in other capital reserves in equity (for equity-settled instruments) or in other provisions (for cashsettled instruments). Ascom revises its estimates of the number of instruments expected to vest, based on the best available estimate of the outcome of the nonmarket-vesting conditions (the Group EBITDA margin and the cumulated average growth rate of the net revenue) at the end of each reporting period, with changes recognized in personnel expenses. b) Performance Stock Unit (“PSU”) plans The PSU plan foresees annual issuance of Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”). One PSU represents the conditional right to receive a fraction between 0% and 200% of an Ascom share subject to the fulfillment of certain vesting conditions. Vesting of the PSUs occurs on the third anniversary of the respective date of grant. Vesting conditions are, both, the achievement of performance targets as well as an unterminated contractual relationship with the company. Performance targets are represented by equally weighted three-year net income fully diluted Earnings per Share (“EPS”) and three-year relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) measured against the Swiss Performance Index Extra (“SPI EXTRA”) and expressed as a percentage point difference. The award forfeits fully or partly if employment ceased before the vesting date. The cost of PSU is measured initially at fair value at grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period, together with a corresponding increase in other capital reserves in equity. As no cash settlement is foreseen, no subsequent measurement takes place. 2.22 Income tax Income tax is recorded based on the period to which it properly relates. Deferred income tax is recorded in full using the liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise on temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for Group purposes and their related tax values. The tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred income tax. Deferred income tax assets result from tax loss carry-forwards, tax credits as well as temporary valuation differences of assets and liabilities. They are recognized to the extent that realization through future taxable profits is probable. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax ­liabilities and when the deferred income tax relates to the same tax authority. 2.23 Definition of non-GAAP measures Earnings before interest and income tax (EBIT) correspond to the operating result. Earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as a subtotal ­includes EBIT before deduction of depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment as well as amortization and impairment of intangible assets. As defined, EBIT and EBITDA do not include the impact of non-operating or extraordinary results. ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 73 3. SEGMENT INFORMATION Ascom Group consists of one single business unit, the purpose of which is to use its unique product and solutions portfolio and software architecture capabilities to devise integration and mobilization solutions that provide digitalized, complete and efficient workflows for healthcare as well as for industry, security and retail sectors. Due to the unity and strategic focus of the business on healthcare ICT, the top management (Group Executive Board) and the management structure of the Ascom Group are organized by functions. The allocation of financial resources of the Group by the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Board is decided centrally and by function. Research and development of the whole range of products and solutions is carried out centrally, while sales are carried out regionally with central support. Distribution and services are managed within central global functions. Accordingly, regional sales subsidiaries are responsible for the sale and delivery of the whole range of products, services and solutions in their sales area, supported by global R & D, global Supply Chain and global Services, as well as central marketing and administrative functions. The Company’s risks and opportunities vary by region and are impacted and supported by local regulatory requirements, most notably in healthcare. Accordingly, the financial management and allocation of Company resources by the Group Executive Board is primarily based on regional market and net revenue developments. Segment reporting is therefore reflecting Ascom’s business as one single reportable segment. The allocation of incoming orders and net revenue is disclosed below based on the regional sales structure.

Provisions for employee benefit obligations include the economical pension obligations (refer to note 14) as well as provisions for other long-term employee benefits. The discount rate used in the calculation for certain foreign pension plans is the most important parameter and any changes can strongly impact the valuation of the pension liability. In 2019, the range of the ­applied discount rate varies between 0.7% and 1.9% (previous year: 1.6%–2.8%), which corresponds to local market conditions. Other provisions comprise mainly obligations arising from asserted and unasserted claims or disputes in the normal course of Ascom’s business operations, provisions for warranties, obligations arising from cash-settled share-based payments and provisions for environmental costs relating to non-operating premises. 14.

In May 2019, Ascom divested for CHF 6.9 million (EUR 6.1 million) the Technologiepark Teningen which is located north of Freiburg in Breisgau (Germany). It was a non-operating property for Ascom and let to third parties since the divestment of the former division Energy Systems in 2003. The non-operating income of CHF 8.9 million is mainly due to the profit from disposal (CHF 3.5 million) and the release of provisions for environmental costs.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES A legally independent fund provides for Swiss pensions (see note 2.18). In 2019 and 2018, no lease payments were disbursed to the Swiss pension fund for premises occupied by the Group and no administrative and facility management services (previous year: nil) were charged to the Swiss pension fund in the year under review. The Swiss pension fund did not own any Ascom shares in 2019 (previous year: nil). In 2019, there was no other transaction with related parties (previous year: nil). 27. RISK MANAGEMENT As an international company, Ascom is exposed to a variety of financial and nonfinancial risks that are directly associated with the Group’s business operations. The Group’s overall risk management is an integral part of corporate management and the long-term corporate strategy, and is correspondingly incorporated in the overall risk and control framework of our business processes and procedures. The Board of Directors of Ascom reviews the Group-wide risk assessment annually and determines suitable measures to address the risks. Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury and is ensured by the rele­vant written principles and guidelines laid down by management and approved by the Board of Directors. The Group’s financial risk capacity and appetite 86 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the various financial risk factors are defined in the treasury strategy. The treasury strategy specifies the limit architecture and thereby defines the extent to which risk exposures will be hedged, and the instruments and time frame for implementation. The treasury strategy is reviewed annually and revised, as appropriate, by the Audit Committee. Transactions without underlying core business and all forms of speculation are prohibited with rare exceptions approved by the Group CFO and by the Audit Committee where required by local circumstances. Risk management also involves centrally securing comprehensive and efficient insurance protection for the Group. 27.1 Liquidity risk The objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that sufficient financial resources are available at any point in time in order to be able to completely and timely fulfill all payment obligations of the Group and to secure working capital financing in the ordinary course of business. As part of its integral budgeting and forecasting process, Group Treasury monitors the planned liquidity position and centrally manages the procurement of loans for the Group. A description of available credit facilities and outstanding borrowings can be found in note 11. 27.2 Foreign currency risk Due to the global nature of its activities, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange gains or losses arise from transactions as well as from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies (mainly EUR, USD, SEK and GBP) if these are not the entity’s functional currency. Group Treasury is responsible for managing Group-wide foreign exchange transaction risk on an ongoing basis. Analyses of past and expected future cash flows in foreign currencies are regularly carried out which is the basis for hedging transactions. Respective forward contracts are stated at fair value. All hedging activities are carried out centrally by Group Treasury. The Group periodically reassesses its net foreign currency risk, evaluating the extent of natural foreign currency hedging achieved through ongoing development of Ascom’s businesses. ­Accordingly, Group Treasury may propose to adapt the Group’s hedging approach. The Group has certain investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk. These types of translation risk are currently not hedged. The currency-related sensitivity of the Group at year-end is shown in the following table: CHFm Reasonable Impact Impact Reasonable Impact Impact shift on net result on equity shift on net result on equity 31.12.2019 31.12.2019 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 31.12.2018 31.12.2018 EUR/CHF +/− 15% −/+ 1.6 −/+ 9.4 +/− 15% −/+ 3.8 −/+ 9.8 USD/CHF +/− 15% +/− 2.4 +/− 3.4 +/− 15% +/− 1.3 +/− 0.5 SEK/CHF +/− 15% +/− 0.4 +/− 9.6 +/− 15% −/+ 0.3 +/− 8.3 GBP/CHF +/− 15% +/− 0.2 +/− 0.3 +/− 15% +/− 0.0 +/− 0.1 EUR/SEK +/− 15% +/− 0.1 +/− 0.1 +/− 15% +/− 0.0 +/− 0.0 USD/SEK +/− 15% +/− 0.0 +/− 0.0 +/− 15% +/− 0.1 +/− 0.1 27.3 Interest rate risk Every interest position is subject to either a cash flow interest risk (associated with floating-rate positions) or a market value risk (from fixed-interest positions). The revolving multi-currency loan ­facility of the Group (see note 11) is the main interest rate risk position in the balance sheet of Ascom. This risk is currently offset with cash surpluses. Accordingly, interest rate risk is currently not hedged. Financing and related interest are managed centrally by Group Treasury. ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 87 27.4 Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposure to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk may result in a financial loss if one party in a transaction is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations. It is Ascom’s objective to limit the impact of a default. Credit risk of financial counterparties is managed centrally by Group Treasury. Each Group company is responsible for analyzing the credit risk for each of their new customers and managing the quality of their trade receivables on an ongoing basis. 27.5 Capital risk The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for the shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimally leveraged capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. Ascom aims to maintain a stable investment grade rating level as perceived by bank partners and debt investors. For its capital management, the Group monitors the following ratios: CHFm 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Net debt/(cash) including outstanding bank guarantees 1 26.1 3.4 EBITDA 0.8 39.0 Debt service ratio 32.6 0.1 Total assets 214.2 218.4 Shareholders’ equity 63.2 83.2 Equity ratio 29.5% 38.1% 1 Borrowings and outstanding bank guarantees less cash and cash equivalents. At 31 December 2019, outstanding bank guarantees amounted to CHF 4.3 million (previous year: CHF 4.6 million). Due to non-recurring costs, mainly driven by the restructuring costs for the implementation of a new Group structure for Ascom as of 1 February 2020, the financial covenants were missed as of 31 December 2019. However, the two lending banks have provided a waiver to remedy the situation and the facility will continue to run as contracted (see note 31). 28. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Foreign currencies are purchased and forward contracts are entered into at Group level as an economic hedge against foreign currency risk. The open contracts comprise the following forward contracts in various currencies: CHFm 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Contract volume 16.1 34.1 Positive fair value 1 0.2 0.5 Negative fair value 2 0.1 0.4 1 Refer to note 5. 2 Refer to note 12. 88 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements Breakdown by currency (CHFm) 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 EUR/CHF 8.0 16.6 SEK/CHF 8.1 17.5 Total 16.1 34.1 29. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a) Lease commitments – Group as lessee The future minimum payments under non-cancellable lease obligations fall due as follows: CHFm Operating leases 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Within 12 months 5.5 5.6 Between 1 and 5 years 5.4 8.2 Later – – Total 10.9 13.8 b) Lease commitments – Group as lessor The future minimum lease receivables under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: CHFm Operating leases 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Within 12 months – 0.9 Between 1 and 5 years – 0.4 Later – – Total – 1.3 c) Contingencies Ascom is exposed to a multitude of legal risks internationally in the normal course of business. These relate particularly to risks associated with product liability, patent law, tax law, competition law and executed business acquisitions and disposal. The Company has indemnified certain purchasers of divested businesses for potential claims arising from the operations of the divested businesses. There are currently no ongoing proceedings in relation to such indemnification. Some Group companies are involved in legal proceedings. The results of currently pending and threatened law suits cannot be predicted with certainty which means that decisions of courts or other authorities can cause expenses that have significant consequences for the business and on future results. Wherever a reliable estimate of the financial consequences of a past event is possible and an outflow of resources is more likely than not, a corresponding provision is made. At 31 December 2019, contingent liabilities amount to CHF 3.8 million (previous year: CHF 4.0 million). There is no indication that these liabilities will lead to fulfillment payments. ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 89 30. PLEDGED ASSETS At 31 December 2019, property, plant and equipment with a total carrying amount of CHF 2.1 million (previous year: CHF 2.2 million), financial assets of CHF 0.1 million (previous year: nil), and cash and cash equivalents with a total carrying amount of CHF 0.2 million (previous year: CHF 0.2 million), were pledged. 31. EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE Group refinancing The Group is in the process of finalizing suitable refinancing and expects to execute new cash and guarantee lines in advance of the expiration date of the existing credit facilities. Since the balance sheet date, no other subsequent adjusting events have occurred that impact the 2019 consolidated financial statements. 32. PROPOSAL OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS For the year ended 31 December 2019, the Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting on 15 April 2020 no distribution of dividends. In 2019, a total dividend of CHF 16.2 million was distributed to the shareholders of Ascom Holding AG. 33. TIME OF RELEASE FOR PUBLICATION The Board of Directors approved the 2019 consolidated financial statements on 27 February 2020 and authorized them for publication at the media conference on 5 March 2020. 90 ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Notes to the consolidated financial statements 34.

Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance that the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. Overall Group materiality CHF 1'120’000 How we determined it 5% of adjusted 3 year average profit / loss before tax Rationale for the materiality benchWe chose adjusted 3 year average profit / loss before tax as the benchmark mark applied because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which the performance of the Group is most commonly measured, and it is a generally accepted benchmark. The average of 3 years reflects the volatility of the results in the past years. The benchmark average profit / loss before taxes, is adjusted for one-off items. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF 110’000 identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the Group operates. The Group is structured as a “one company” functional organization. The Group financial statements are a consolidation of over 20 reporting units. We identified 5 reporting units that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information. To obtain appropriate coverage over all material financial statement line items, we identified 2 additional reporting units that, in our view, required specified audit procedures over significant balances and transactions including revenue. For the remaining reporting units, we performed other procedures to test or assess that there were no significant risks of material misstatement in these reporting units in relation to the Group financial statements. To ensure sufficient and appropriate involvement of the Group team, we held conference calls with selected component teams responsible for full scope audits during the different phases of the work. We discussed the risks identified and challenged the audit approach in significant risk areas relevant to those reporting units. Furthermore, we obtained a memorandum of examination from all full scope component teams and assessed the results and impact on the Group financial statements and challenged their conclusions. Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. 3 Ascom Holding AG | Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting ASCOM Financial statements 2019 Group Report of the statutory auditor on the consolidated financial statements 93 Sales and Revenue recognition (multi-element contracts) Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter As described in note 2.6 “Revenue recognition” the consoliWe obtained an understanding of the processes and interdated financial statements include revenues from multi-elenal controls around revenue recognition for multi-element ment contracts including the sale of goods and the rendercontracts and tested key controls in place to assess the aping of services.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with Swiss GAAP FER and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

Our audit opinion aims to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall materiality for the financial statements as a whole as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole. Overall materiality CHF 1'800'000 How we determined it 0.5% of net assets Rationale for the materiality benchWe chose net assets as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark applied mark against which the performance of the entity is most commonly measured, and is a generally accepted benchmark. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements above CHF180'000 identified during our audit as well as any misstatements below that amount which, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Audit scope We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where subjective judgements were made; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Report on key audit matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter. 3 Ascom Holding AG | Report of the statutory auditor to the General Meeting ASCOM Financial statements 2019 ASCOM Holding AG Report of the statutory auditor on the financial statements 105 Valuation of investments in Group companies Key audit matter How our audit addressed the key audit matter As at 31 December 2019, investments in Group companies We performed the following audit procedures: of Ascom Holding AG amounted to CHF 404m.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.
