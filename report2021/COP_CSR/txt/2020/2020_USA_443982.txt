Section 3: Environment 3.0 OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT As an organization, SRI is in a unique position to help clients reach their sustainability goals and realize business value of sustainability by auditing to sustainability management system standards, and through its sister company, 3R Sustainability, by consulting in the built and corporate sustainability environments. With SRI’s global presence, hundreds of companies across the world are better able to meet their own goals relating to environmental impact, ethical conduct, human rights, labor, transparent supply chain, quality, energy management, and health and safety. As a certification body, SRI provides assessment and verification of standards such as, 26000 (Guidance on Social Responsibility), which provides a framework to guide companies on goals related to Corporate Social Responsibility, and AA1000 Accountability Assurance standard, which ensures that sustainability has been addressed within a company’s management system. These are comprehensive frameworks that help companies manage their impacts and achieve progress toward their sustainability goals. This integration of sustainability and social responsibility into management systems begins to shift the business's purpose from a shareholder focus to one that addresses the triple bottom line of environment, society, and governance (ESG). Outside of its clients, SRI tracks, manages, and attempts to reduce emissions from auditor and other business travel. SRI's Sustainability Team regularly meets to discuss relevant topics and propose ideas to help improve the entire organization's environmental footprint. Whether highlighting co-workers' sustainable actions, creating challenges to reduce personal waste, or even developing new expense reports to better track emissions related to travel and hotel stays, SRI encourages and welcomes ideas from its innovative employees.

The 3R office was awarded LEED-Gold Commercial Interior status and will serve as a standard for all new SRI office spaces. The headquarters has implemented many of the same energy efficiency specifications. Both offices have applied a number of programs to reduce waste, increase compost, and buy local. SRI eliminated plastic bottles and paper plates, reduced the number of times the dishwasher runs per day, and removed all processed sugars from the company snack room to promote healthier eating choices. SRI’s largest environmental impact is auditor travel to client facilities and travel to offsite training. On-site inspection has been a mandatory part of the audit process, therefore complete elimination of greenhouse gas emissions is currently unattainable. However, the Scheduling Department reduces environmental impact by scheduling local auditors to nearby client sites when possible. The benefits include lower travel costs for the client, improved work/life satisfaction of the auditor, and reduced impact on the environment. SRI is also working across the industry to incorporate virtual, computer-assisted audit technology (CAAT) to conduct partial or full audits, when possible, to drive change across the industry and make a substantial impact on reducing carbon emissions. In the past, 100% of training was offered at locations around the country, with nearly all participants traveling to the training event. This year, client-site training was offered, which greatly reduced the number of participants who needed to travel. Approximately 60% of training is now done at a client site, so the trainer is the only individual traveling. The impact in 2019 alone, was equivalent to the environmental ‘savings’ of roughly 600 participants who were able to attend training locally without travel. The target is for 100% of training to be offered on-site or online by 2021. COPYRIGHT 2020 © SRI QUALITY SYSTEM REGISTRAR 2019 CSR REPORT. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

ACTION PLAN SRI’s first step in assessing material impacts was to calculate baseline GHG emissions (tons) and energy usage (kWh), in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and EPA standards. Information is tracked and collected for reporting (see Appendix VI for calculations). In addition to a 10% reduction target for 2020 for Scope 2 and 3 Emissions, SRI aims to offset another 10% through client and direct purchases of Renewable Energy Certificates. To address Scope 2 Emissions: Sustainable Purchasing Policy implemented in 2019: This ensures the most sustainable products are being considered and purchased for office supplies, luncheons, electronics etc, prioritizing local vendors to reduce emissions and support the local economy. Sustainability Team Trainings: Held throughout the year, these trainings highlight and teach SRI employees actions that they can take in the office and at home to reduce emissions. To address Scope 3 Emissions: “Path to Net Zero Emissions”: A program started in 2019 that details opportunities to reduce emissions related to auditor and training travel. SRI will also evaluate the opportunity to offer carbon offsets for purchase by clients who have their own carbon reduction commitment. In the future, SRI plans to offer the option on customer invoices to offset the environmental impact of a company’s audit or training, which will be used to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates (REC’s). Waste Diversion/Reduction: SRI recycles unused goods or donates to local charities. A waste audit was performed in 2018 to set a baseline for waste diversion to allow the company to take action to set goals for continuing reduction. Waste audits are scheduled to be conducted every 2 years. Transit Passes: SRI offers to pay for a transit pass, in lieu of a parking permit, for its employees, to encourage use of public transportation and reduce emissions related to employee commute.

The UN Global Compact works together with the SDGs to push companies to “align strategies and operations with universal principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption, and take actions that advance societal goals.” SRI has identified five of the 17 SDGs, which the organization strongly supports through daily operations and best practices. These five SDGs are #3 Good Health and Well-being, #5 Gender Equality, #12 Responsible Production and Consumption, #13 Climate Action, and #17 Partnerships for the Goals. At SRI, good health and well-being have always been priorities within the workplace in order to attract and retain the best talent. A health and wellness committee is responsible for making fresh fruits and vegetables accessible in the office, afternoon walks, activity competitions, and afternoon tea once a week. SRI knows that a company is successful when its foundation is diverse. Currently, over half of SRI’s management team is female and SRI increased female representation on the board of directors by 25%. Responsible consumption and production are a key focus at SRI. Our organization has implemented a Sustainable Purchasing Policy, which emphasizes buying local, chemical-free and sustainably-sourced products. SRI has also made efforts to reduce consumption by using ceramic dishes instead of single-use plastic and to divert remaining waste through composting and recycling efforts. Based on the Materiality Matrix, SRI understands that reducing its environmental footprint is critical to business. One of the largest contributors to SRI’s carbon footprint is due to auditor travel. SRI is committed to offsetting our emissions by investing in Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and reducing scope 3 emissions through strategically planned auditor travel and computer assisted audits when possible. SRI is committed to cultivating its partnerships with other organizations across the industry that also share a strong, sustainabilityfocused vision. SRI has identified a unique opportunity to educate clients and partners on the importance of sustainability from a business management perspective by showing that sustainable measures not only minimize environmental impact, but also often reduce cost and increase revenues.

PAGE 22 Appendix I: SRI and the Sustainable Development Goals EXTERNAL PRACTICES Given SRI’s work across a number of standards and frameworks, SRI is positioned to help clients achieve many of their own SDG goals: Affordable and clean energy, ensures access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. The SRI Green Building Team has reviewed more than 8000 LEED projects phases, which seeks to reduce energy usage in the built environment. ISO 50001 (Energy management system) ensures that energy use is being actively managed by a company. Industry, innovation and infrastructure, builds resilient infrastructure, promotes inclusive and sustainable industrialization and fosters innovation to improve resource-use efficiency and promote adoption of clean and environmental technologies. SRI’s management system approach ensures that companies manage their environmental and other industrial impacts through audits to a number of ISO standards. The LEED suite of standards addresses not only buildings, but neighborhoods and communities, on topics from building design to access to green spaces and public transport, as well as waste and water management. SRI emphasizes developing sustainable communities through volunteer days, donations, and educational programs Responsible consumption and production ensures sustainable consumption and production patterns to reduce waste throughout the entire value chain of a product or service, from cradle to cradle. The TRUE Zero Waste standard provides a framework to reduce waste; RC 14001 (Responsible Care) defines responsible use within the chemicals industry; ISO 28000 (Supply Chain Management) ensures control, security and traceability within a company’s supply chain.

PAGE 24 Appendix III: Management System Approach BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY INTO SRI'S MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ISO 26000 (Guidance on Social Responsibility) provided a framework upon which SRI built its Sustainability Goals and defined its management system requirements. During the Planning and Materiality Assessment phase, SRI leveraged multiple frameworks to ensure our completeness in scope and principles, from ISO 26000 to GRI Reporting, the UN Sustainable Development Goals, SASB metrics, B Corp certification, AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement and Assurance, and best practices in other industries, etc. The themes across sustainability frameworks are quite similar. SRI mapped its material impacts and actions to the specific sections within the various frameworks. Below is a high-level ISO 26000 mapping. SRI SUSTAINABILITY GOALS ISO 26000 CORE SUBJECT Providing Service with the Highest Level of Fair Operating Practices Integrity and Ethical Conduct Organizational Governance Consumer Issues Maximize Impact for Clients’ Sustainability Consumer Issues Goals Organizational Governance Human Rights Recruiting and Retaining the Right Talent Labor Practices Community Involvement and Development Minimizing Environmental Footprint The Environment To ensure that sustainability is built into SRI’s management system, the principles of AA1000 for stakeholder engagement and assurance were followed. AA1000 goes beyond a scope framework and provides a principlesbased approach to sustainability strategy, governance and operational management. As an AA1000 trained and licensed provider, SRI has incorporated these principles into its own sustainability management system and process for continual improvement.

Certified B Corporations achieve a minimum verified score on the B Impact Assessment—a rigorous assessment of a company’s impact on its workers, customers, community, and environment—and make their B Impact Report transparent on bcorporation.net. Certified B Corporations also amend their legal governing documents to ensure their management and board of directors balance profit and purpose, by considering the triple bottom line impacts of environment, social and governance factors. The combination of third-party validation, public transparency, and legal accountability help Certified B Corps build trust and value. B Corp Certification is administered by the non-profit B Lab. Today, there are just over 2,500 Certified B Corps around the globe. SRI is proud to join them in redefining success in business, so that one day everyone may use business as a force for good. To learn more about this certification, check out SRI’s B Corp profile. For more information on B Lab and B Corp Certified Companies visit: bcorporation.net.

PAGE 26 Appendix VI: B Corp Certification and JUST Label JUST LABEL The JUST Label is a program by the International Living Future Institute, and provides a transparent platform of disclosure, and a “nutrition label” for socially responsible organizations and corporations. Francis Janes, Associate Director, International Living Future Institute praised, “The International Living Future Institute is pleased to announce that SRI has been recognized with the JUST Label. SRI’s pursuit of a Social Equity Disclosure Label is consistent with the organization’s long-standing support of Corporate Social Responsibility principles and practices.” SRI qualified for the JUST Label through voluntary disclosure of internal policies in key JUST categories such as diversity, equity, safety, employee benefit, local benefit and community stewardship. SRI has consistently shown what it means to be an innovative company and a role model within the sustainability community. Creating a CSR Plan and applying for B-Corp certification shows dedication and engagement, and the JUST distinction goes on to exemplify SRI’s commitment to sustainability and well-being. The goals of the JUST Program and the goals of SRI closely align with one another. SRI recognizes the connection between retaining the best talent and a socially just and equitable work environment. In addition to exemplifying transparency, SRI continues to grow as a leader in the sustainability industry. The most recently released version of ILFI’s Living Building Challenge, LBC v3.1, requires that a JUST labeled organization must have an integral role during the design and construction phase of a project when submitting for Living Certification. 3R, as a sister company of SRI, can act as a sustainability consultant on any LBC project. The JUST label is verification and a convenient summary of SRI’s efforts in social justice and sustainability embodied in its working environment and culture. SRI is proud to advocate for and contribute to the success of equitable and just workforces. COPYRIGHT 2020 © SRI QUALITY SYSTEM REGISTRAR 2019 CSR REPORT. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
