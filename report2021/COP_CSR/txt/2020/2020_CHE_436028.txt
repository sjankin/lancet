Page 2 of 6 ENVIRONMENT deugro group is committed to protecting and preserving the environment, whether in our own location or in of fsite locations where we provide services. deugro group understands that environmental protection and preservation are not merely limited to reducing our carbon f ootprint and implementing green programs. We must also be committed to environmental protection by working with our customers and subcontractors to identify all risks involved in providing services and implementing solutions to eliminate and/or reduce these risks. It is our conviction that this can only be successfully accomplished if we are good custodians of the trust granted to us by our customers and of the surrounding environment. We aim to continually improve the quality of our services and strive towards our ultimate goals: • ZERO environmental incidents; and • Increased energy efficiency by investing in energy efficient products and services. deugro group also promotes the SDG to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. Oceans and seas are vital conduits for trade and transportation, and careful management of these essential global resources is important for a sustainable future given that our global climate, food, and drinking water are regulated by the seas. Implementation Branch managers and their deputy on work sites are the responsible process owners. The QHSES manager is responsible for collecting, investigating and reviewing data which may affect deugro group's site performance f or environmental improvements on a regular basis. Environmental aspects: As a global shipping and logistics company, deugro group operates offices and subcontracts the transport and warehousing process. The environmental aspects are typically focused on: • Facilities (work environment, material usage); • Logistic services (packaging, transportation, warehousing, waste disposal); • Energy consumption (electricity, fuel, gas and oil); and • Water consumption. Identif ication of environmental aspects: All sites must check the environmental aspects for applicability. If applicable, a risk assessment is carried out. Once a year, branch management reviews all relevant topics like energy consumption, emissions (to air, ground and water), equipment substances and hazardous goods, waste disposal, water consumption, and work environment for any changes or new aspects related to legislation. Risk assessment of environmental aspects: Based on the environmental impacts, the evaluation of aspects covers: • the processes as intended • the processes as not intended (disorder) • the processes as not intended (worst case scenarios like fire, leakages...) and results in a • compliance check Page 3 of 6 • justif ication/feasibility check • relevance check. Environmental programs: The most relevant environmental issues, which have passed the justification / f easibility check are targeted and monitored. Where possible the decisions are based on perf ormance data like energy consump tion, inf ormation and resources for investing in energy efficient products and services. This year deugro group has emphasized local campaigns to support the environmental initiative of reducing its carbon footprint by encouraging employees to carpool and participate in local Earth Day Activities. Environmental performance: Perf ormance data is collected by each deugro group branch (where applicable). Occurrence Reporting: deugro group has implemented a reporting system for occurrences including: • Accidents • Incidents • Fatalities • Near misses • Nonconformities • Spillages Af ter the reporting, deugro group conducts an investigation in order to identify the root cause of the occurrence. The outcome of the investigation could result in immediate, preventive and/or corrective actions, as well as dissemination of “lessons learned” to increase awareness and avoid recurrences. Measurement Environmental performance based on energy consumption (electricity, fuel, gas and oil), waste disposal and water consumption is measured and monitored in every deugro group branch by way of deugro g roup’s monthly reporting system. In addition to consumption, deugro group's monthly reporting system, the occurrence management system and the investigation of incidents will be analyzed. Once corrective measures have been identified, a so called lessons learned will be distributed to the group via deugro group's intranet and via training sequences and/or audits in all locations. deugro group has three different categories of “lessons learned”: • Immediate actions • Corrective actions • Proactive actions Specific actions are shared via: • Saf ety Moments • Saf ety Alerts • Saf ety Directives • Training Sequences • Internal Audits In the annual corporate management review deugro group evaluates the collected f igures, consumption, incidents, reports and KPI’s and set an action plan for the upcoming year. Page 4 of 6 ANTI-CORRUPTION At deugro group, we are committed to conducting business lawf ully, with integrity and with respect f or all people. Together, these values comprise the foundation f or the way we work, our reputation, and the trust of our stakeholders. deugro group ’s commitment to f ostering a culture of ethics and integrity is lived top down f rom our owners, executive board, senior management, to all our employees worldwide. This commitment is codified in the Ethics & Compliance Policy, the Code of Ethics and Compliance (“CoEC”), and the Anti-Corruption Compliance Policy (“ACCP”) f or employees and business partners. deugro group has a zero-tolerance approach to corruption. Any kind of bribery or facilitation payment is strictly forbidden. We understand that our commitment to anti-corruption and working with integrity furthers the SDG to promote peacef ul and inclusive societies f or sustainable development, provide access to justice f or all, and build ef f ective, accountable institutions at all levels. According to the UN, corruption, bribery, theft and tax evasion cost some US$1.26 trillion for developing countries per year. Implementation To implement our commitment to conducting business lawf ully, with integrity and with respect for all people and the law, deugro group has implemented a Compliance Management System (CMS) led by the Head of Global Legal & Compliance, reporting directly to the CEO. Using a combination of ef fective governance and executive management oversight, a strong compliance program incorporating training, communications, and risk management, and on-going compliance monitoring, the CMS is designed to prevent, detect, and resolve any bribery and corruption related issues within the deugro group. A suite of compliance policies and procedures to support our commitment to working with the highest standards of business ethics have been established, including: • D-POL-0007 deugro group Ethics & Compliance Policy • D-POL-0010 Gif ts & Hospitality Policy • D-SYS-0013 Code of Ethics & Compliance • D-SYS-0014 Anti-Corruption Compliance Policy • D-SYS-0016 Compliance Risk Evaluation The policies and procedures are announced and promoted on the intranet to raise awareness about compliance. Every deugro group employee completes a yearly commitment and acknowledgment f orm to abide by the CoEC and all associated policies. Proper training f or all levels of management and staff is essential to maintaining an ef f ective CMS. deugro group has established a risk based, systematic training system which takes the individual risk classification of each employee into account, while combining it with the respective inherent country risk. Every employee at deugro group participates in e-learning and, depending on the risk analysis, additional face-to-face training. All senior managers within the company are trained in person by the Head of Legal & Compliance every two years at the Global Management Meeting. The LEOs are trained in person by the Head of Legal & Compliance every two years at Regional LEO Workshops. The gif ts and hospitality review process has been designed to address gaps that had been identified through on-going monitoring and review. The new f ramework provides thresholds regarding gifts and hospitality, which vary depending on the counterpart and limited to a number of occasions per year. Strict rules apply when working with public officials or representatives of state-owned entities. The process applies to all branches and companies throughout deugro group, and Branch Managers are the process owners responsible for effective implementation locally with the Compliance team serving as a controlling function. To address corruption concerns related to business partners, all third parties are expected to adhere to the same strict standards as provided by deugro group’s compliance program. Business partners are subject to designated policies for third parties, including the Code of Ethics and Compliance – Business Partners and the Page 5 of 6 ACCP – Business Partners. All agents are vetted through a strict compliance due diligence process. In the coming year, deugro group plans to further improve its subcontractor management system. deugro group understands the importance of having healthy and functioning communities in which it operates in order to ensure a sustainable business into the f uture. To that end, deugro group participates in various collective action programs as a member of TRACE International and the Association of Corporate Co unsel Compliance Committee. In 2019 deugro group’s Compliance Management System became ISO 37001:2016 Anti-Bribery Management Systems certified. The goal in 2020 is to continue promoting and enhancing our Anti-Bribery and Corruption program and undergoing our recertif ication process to confirm our Compliance Management System and processes are being followed across the company. Measurement Whistleblowing by employees or business partners is f acilitated by providing access to various channels to raise their concerns. deugro group ’s various whistleblowing channels include email, phone call, or by contacting the LEO, Deputy Compliance Officer, or Head of Legal & Compliance directly. Concerns can be raised by any internal or external party. A clear non-retaliation policy is in place. All alleged occurrences are investigated, and all investigations are managed by the Head of Legal & Compliance. Each occurrence is classified according to a pre-defined standard and escalated internally and/or externally as required. Investigations may result in disciplinary action including formal warnings, extra trainings, regular reporting, or termination of employment or business contracts, depending on the severity of the circumstance. Because of deugro group’s zero tolerance policy, any potential violation of our compliance policies is addressed with utmost care and time-sensitive action. All cases are monitored and documented.
