Letter from the Chairman Welcome, It is a pleasure to present Tag Systems’ Sustainability Report 2019, the second drafted as per the Global Reporting Initiative Standards, showing the conclusions of a new analysis and thoughts where we would like to underline our commitment and development in the social, environmental, economic, and ethical areas. It has been a good exercise and we closed it with an exciting business novelty: AustriaCard GmbH and TAG Systems did a merger; which will allow us to expand further, serving our valued customers on a world-wide level, walking together with a company also fully committed with the sustainability in all aspects. We completely trust that this value will continue leading the way. Once again, we renew our commitment to the United National Global Compact as shown with this report, demonstrating our willingness to consolidate, develop and implement good practices that are aligned with our activity and that help us to be more sustainable. But in our day-to-day operation we do not just want to respond to the needs we have as a company, but also to the global environmental and social agenda set out by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). From the essence of our activity and with the willingness of those of us who are part of Tag Systems, we contribute to the different goals defined in this ambitious agenda. TAG Systems is evolving the way the payment industry moves, building strong relationships with our partners, across borders, establishing future strategic lines with the capacity to meet the expectations of all those with whom we work. As mentioned above, sustainability leads the way, but it is the excellence that defines how we must move forward. At Tag Systems, we promote initiatives of added value throughout our value chain. With our employees, we are committed to their continuous improvement through training, professional development and offering them a safe working environment. With customers, we guarantee maximum quality and security of all our products and services. We want them to be completely satisfied and to see us as a trustworthy and competitive supplier in terms of quality, price and sustainability. With our suppliers, we are moving forward to make them participants in our commitment with society and the environment. We are challenged by the uncertainties due to the situation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. We take our compromise to minimize the impacts of that in front of our customers, employees, and the society in general, and to follow strictly the health and prevention recommendations done by the authorities. We will face these extraordinary times with determination and responsibility. I hope you find this Sustainability Report of interest. Health for all, Joaquim Miró Castillo Chairman Sustainability Report 2019 3 2.

Joining forces with strategic alliances Tag Systems’ alliances enable us to be part of various networks that enhance what we are and what we do as a company, as well as sharing experiences and knowledge of future challenges in our market and the economic and business context. Tag Systems is part of ICMA. As the main international card manufacturers association, its mission is to promote the whole card industry, together with the value of its products and services, providing an independent forum for sharing knowledge and ideas. Tag Systems is a member of PIMEC, a social agent in Catalonia, Spain that participates in work committees and panels with public administrations and representative social agents, as well as regularly giving opinions on legislative initiatives and public policies and making proposals to defend and represent the interests of SMEs and the self-employed. Tag Systems is a member of CEA, a representative body of Andorran business associations which actively liaises with the Andorran business network, institutions and Andorran society in general. This year, Tag Systems has obtained the Ecovadis qualification system, which arose from the consumers’ need to demand greater control over supply chains, not just from a business performance perspective, but also from ethical and environmental standards. Sustainability Report 2019 10 4. Sustainability leads the way 4.1. Sustainable and responsible management 4.2. Relevant sustainability topics 4.3. Commitment to the local community SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS INTEGRATED IN TAG SYSTEMS The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) – global, inclusive and ambitious – are what guide the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. In the different sections of this Sustainability Report, we have included the SDG aligned with who we are and what we do at Tag Systems. As a result of the dialogue with the stakeholders set out in this chapter, the sustainability topics that are relevant to us have been validated. This shall enable strategic planning with greater awareness of our ability to generate positive impacts on people as well as the natural environment. Sustainability Report 2019 11 4.1. Sustainable and responsible management With the goal of generating solid growth of Tag Systems, we base our actions on responsible criteria that reinforce our links with stakeholders, ensure our competitiveness and promote the creation of long-term value. Our commitment to sustainability is present in all departments and activities: from product marketing to our employees’ wellbeing, via responsible purchasing of raw materials from suppliers and environmentally efficient production processes. Commitment to the United National Global Compact In 2011, Tag Systems made a commitment to the 10 Principles of the United Nations Global Compact regarding human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption. Human rights Tag Systems respects human rights in each of its activities and positively values its partners, suppliers and customers’ support of the Global Compact or other declarations respecting this principle. Labour Tag Systems respects all national and international principles and regulations relating to labour rights. Non-discrimination labour policies of all kinds are applicable to Tag Systems, all kinds of forced labour are rejected, as well as any kind of work that puts any human or labour right in danger.

Since 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) guide the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of the United Nations. The 17 Goals of this ambitious Agenda guide many business actions, particularly when the activity not only generates local impacts but also global ones. Sustainability Report 2019 12 The consolidation of Tag Systems in the international market and future plans demand we deeply reflect on the role we shall have to positively contribute to achieving the SDG. In this sense, throughout this document we have indicated the SDG to which we contribute through our activity. Our stakeholders Each of our stakeholders has an important role in the goals we set. We aim to maintain relationships of trust with each of them to find solutions to common challenges. Aware of the intrinsic value of each of our stakeholders, we establish channels of communication through which we exchange impressions on any aspect related with our activity. Dialogue with stakeholders is key to detecting improvements in the strategic design of the business, as well as in the design of specific actions that may provide solutions to the expectations of the different groups.

Material sustainability topics The initial identification of the potentially material sustainability topics for Tag Systems was based on the following information sources: • GRI Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative • Sustainability Topics for Sectors: What do stakeholders want to know? of the GRI (Software and Service; Technology Hardware and Equipment) • Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) • RobecoSAM regarding IT & Software Services • European Non-Financial Information Directive • Sectorial benchmarking Later, we carried out an exercise to identify and prioritise the material sustainability topics for our stakeholders (indirect external analysis through a consultancy of senior and middle managers who are in contact with different stakeholders) and those that are significant due to their impact on the business (direct internal analysis in a participatory session with the Management Team). During the participatory session with the Management Team, each of the potentially material topics was reflected and agreed upon bearing in mind three factors: Boundary, identifying whether the impact is produced inside and/or outside Tag Systems; involvement, to identify whether Tag Systems is the direct or indirect cause of the impact (through its business relationships); and the level of importance. For indirect prioritisation by the corresponding people, first they were sent a questionnaire and information on all the material topics. Afterwards, a meeting was held with them all to comment and discuss the scope of each topic and the result of their answers. Material sustainability topics Economy and strategy Environment Social Economic performance Materials Employment Anti-corruption Emissions Occupational Health and safety Environmental Training and education compliance Diversity and equal opportunities / Nondiscrimination Socioeconomic compliance Customer Health and Safety Customer privacy Customer communication, satisfaction and Quality The social scope covers many material topics linked to employees and customers. This vision, shared by the Management Team as well as the stakeholders, emphasises the relationship of Tag Systems with people. Sustainability Report 2019 14 4.3. Commitment to the local community Tag Systems’ actions in the local community are carried out through initiatives that enable the projection of corporate values, such as teamwork, or which allow it to be an active participant in contributing solutions to local challenges. In 2019, we have sponsored individual and team sports through, for example, the participation of a Tag Systems team in the race UltraTrail Andorra or an intercompany football championship with other Andorran companies and we have made direct donations to some Andorran NGO. Ultra trail 2019 Team Building 2019 We also have collaboration agreements with the University of Andorra and professional training centres in the country through which they offer work experience so students can complete their training and improve their marks before their subsequent incorporation into the labour market. In 2018, Tag Systems became an inclusive company, a necessary commitment to offer employment opportunities to a sector of the population that often has additional difficulties to show their value, this year the company has hired a new employee.

Sustainability Report 2019 21 5.5. Suppliers, a key factor At Tag Systems, we know that to guarantee the correct development of our activity and quality products and services, it is essential to have suppliers from diverse spheres of activity and categories with whom we maintain long-term relationships of trust. (103-2, 103-3) This means not just having suppliers with a high technical and quality performance, but who also comply and are aligned with the criteria we have defined, among them environmental and social criteria; for example, the provision of a certified environmental management system. We periodically update our supplier database to incorporate compliance with new environmental, quality and occupational safety certificates. The criteria defined when choosing suppliers are: Provision of certificates and/or systems for quality, environment and occupational health and safety Prioritisation of local suppliers Environmentally-friendly products Technical adaptability of the product The activities for which Tag Systems is supplied with products and services are: raw materials for production, machinery maintenance services, transport services, installations, IT services, consultancy and cleaning services. Regarding the materials used in the manufacture of our cards, we are aware of their importance, so we choose the best raw materials via a strict approval protocol. Almost all our raw materials come from European countries and, regarding services, we give priority to local suppliers, from Andorra. Every year the Purchasing Department is commissioned with monitoring the suppliers who directly impact the quality of the end product. Monitoring is done via the control of external supply, as per the protocol described in the purchasing protocols policy. In parallel, the Quality Department monitors the arrival of materials where any imperfection or incorrect supply of material is detected, thus avoiding future problems during production. If any defect is discovered, the Quality Department opens a “Quality Non-conformity” file for the supplier, information that is later used in the monitoring. Finally, suppliers are periodically informed of the results obtained from the assessment. Purchases as per supplier’s origin 2019 5,40% 94,60 % Europe Others Sustainability Report 2019 22 6.

Occupational Health and Safety One of our priorities is the health and safety of everyone who works at Tag Systems. For this reason, we focus on strengthening the occupational health and safety prevention and management culture, which is established via the OSHAS 18001 management system we have implemented and certified. We have hired an External Prevention Service for all specialities relating to health and safety, including health monitoring. All the workplaces, teams and products are duly assessed and corrective actions planned. Our occupational hazards prevention and safety policy contemplates guaranteeing safe and correctly equipped installations for the performance of the activity.

Environment, an active commitment 7.1. Consolidated environmental management 7.2. Efficiency and optimisation of the resources 7.3. Minimisation of waste 7.4. Mitigation of the carbon footprint SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS INTEGRATED IN TAG SYSTEMS Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts. At Tag Systems, we have implemented an ISO 14001 certified environmental management system, we require environmental policies and certificates from suppliers and we work to minimise our environmental footprint optimising the consumption of resources and correctly managing waste. Sustainability Report 2019 28 7.1. Consolidated environmental management Respect for the environment is an unavoidable requirement for a company aiming to be sustainable, such as Tag Systems. In this sense, we assess the environmental impact and effects of our activity and manage the prevention of environmental risks, aspects that are set out in our policy and that also form part of our business strategy. Since 2012, Tag Systems has implemented an ISO 14001 certified environmental management system. Principles of action of the Tag Systems environmental policy: • Application of environmental and energy efficiency criteria in production processes, through the rational use of natural resources and the reduction of generated waste and emissions. • Compliance with environmental and energy legislation, as well as with other voluntary commitments. • Provide training and allocate the necessary resources to promote employees’ active participation in attaining the environmental objectives. • Continuous improvement of the integrated management system. We constantly invest to reduce energy consumption as much as possible and to improve waste management and processing. We are loyal to our principles and values and make sure that the agents who interact with us also respect them. At Tag Systems, we ensure compliance with the applicable environmental legislation and, therefore, we have all the necessary licences for water discharge, atmospheric emissions and production of dangerous waste. 7.2. Efficiency and optimisation of resources At Tag Systems, we make sure we use resources rationally and efficiently whilst trying to assess and recycle as many materials as possible.

Responsible economic management 8.1. Economic performance 8.2. State of added value Sustainability Report 2019 32 8.1. Economic performance The result of the 2019 economic management is considered very satisfactory for Tag Systems. This has been possible thanks to the improvement in income and in efficiency. In terms of sales, improvement has occurred in the growth of some medium-sized customers and high added value sales, which has been possible thanks to the implementation and sale of Dual Interface cards in most markets where we operate. New important customers have been won within the Fintech sector and we have succeeded, with the effort of the entire organization, their loyalty. The efforts made in the reduction of costs is focused to: reduce the rate of purchasing the main raw materials, improve the efficiency in the production methodology and finally, reduce the rates of overheads (maintenance, supplies, human resources, etc.). The increase in the intra-group turnover has continued, growing in all Tag Systems companies, which in turn gives more value to the Tag Systems Group. Sustainability Report 2019 33 8.2.
