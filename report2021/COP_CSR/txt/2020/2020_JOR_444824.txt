COVID-19 RESPONSE The COVID 19 pandemic has challenged ACES and the rest of the world to continue business operations safely and productively. The shelter at home orders have significantly affected ACES operations across its various branches. COVID 19 infected some staff, restricted our movement, and fundamentally changed the way we conduct our business. Below is a list of COVID-related measures that ACES took to mitigate the impact of COVID on our staff and operation. This section was added for this particular year as COVID has had the most significant impact on our team's well-being. This is over and above our regular practices, which are also highlighted in the document. A. Description of Actions 1. ACES management established several task forces to ensure the safety and security of our employees. These include the Crisis Management Team consisting of the Management Committee and CHRO, Covid Response Teams at the branches, and a Business Continuity Team focused on Quality and Finance. Below are the details of the subcommittees: 1.1. Crisis Management Team consisting of the Management Committee and Group CHRO: This dealt with big picture strategic issues to address the business and employees' risks. Meeting were held bi-weekly for the first four months of the pandemic (March – June). 1.2. COVID Response Team consisting of Group Corporate HR team and the branch HR managers: A centralized, rapid-response team to communicate COVID related health and safety regulations, monitoring the implementation of safety regulations, and reporting/tracking of COVID cases. 1.3. Business Continuity Team consisting of two subcommittees: finance and quality. The quality team monitored the risks and managed the business's overall exposures, while the finance team dealt with modeling the various scenarios for business continuity. 1.4. IT Remote Work Committee, consisting of the Group CTO and branch IT Managers to ensure a successful remote working environment. 2. Limit In-Person Interaction and Access to Premises: 2.1 Limit all client visits to ACES premises: All reports were submitted over email, and meetings were held via MS Teams. Testing samples were dropped off at a designated area with no face to face interactions. 2.2 Social Distancing Measures in Office: We reduced office capacities to 30%-40% of total occupancy (depending on local government requirements). Temperatures of all office employees were taken regularly, and staff present in the office were given masks and gloves. Hand sanitizers were placed in each office and public areas. 2.3 Social Distancing on ACES Transportation and Sites: Engineers, drillers, technicians, and laborers were provided with new COVID HSE guidelines. The number of people in any vehicle was limited to local government guidelines (mostly two people per car), and maintaining one to two spaces on busses and other transportation. 3. Remote Working: ACES provided staff with laptops and the necessary software to have productive work from home. 4. COVID Infections: Given the contagious nature of COVID, many of our staff encountered the diseases or were in contact with family members infected with COVID. To avoid spreading the disease, we developed a series of procedures for all suspected and confirmed cases. 4.1 Testing of Suspected Cases: ACES provided COVID 19 PCR tests (through a private lab) to all employees suspected of encountering the virus or showing symptoms. In one instance, a private lab was hired to conducted tests for over 250 employees in the Abu Dhabi premises. Employees infected with the virus were also tested after they stopped showing symptoms to ensure that they were COVID-free upon returning to the workforce. 4.2 Providing Quaraninte Accommodations: COVID positive employees residing in one of the ACES facilities were provided with a private room to quarantine. 5. Commitment to full payment of salaries: Despite the work stoppages, lockdowns, and project cancellations, ACES has remained committed to its employees by not reducing wages and honoring its employees' contracts. B. Measurement of Outcomes COVID infected 123 ACES employees, most of which have recovered. There were no seriously ill cases or deaths recorded. The measures put in place on the HSE side limited the disease outbreak among ACES staff and ensured a relatively smooth operations continuation considering the circumstances. Aside from the health and safety issues, the business was able to continue. Financial figures for the year were in line with the budget, employee engagement increased, and the staff was satisfied with the remote working arrangement (80% reported that they had the necessary technology resources and collaboration tools to be equally as productive if not more productive from home).
