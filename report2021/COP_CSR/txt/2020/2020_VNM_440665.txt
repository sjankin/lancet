Total There is an increase in 2018/19 for blue collar workers compared to previous years. This is following a general trend in Vietnam where blue collar workers typically are less loyal. In order to ensure a more positive trend in the future and to create the loyalty with the staff, we have end of 2018/19 increased minimum salaries for blue collar workers to ensure that we are approx. 20% above national average. Page 4 of 9 10-06-20 13:42 5 Number of accidents are measured. See below table: Graph 2: No. of Accidents per 100,000 hours As can be seen from the above, no accidents were recorded in 2016/17 and in 2017/18. But in 2018/19, 0.6 accidents were recorded per 100,000 hours. Accidents are being reported to the relevant authorities and corrective actions and necessary control measures are being taken inclusive of training of staff to avoid similar accidents again. 9 customer audits have been conducted during 2018/19. Most of the customer audits have focused on food safety including hygiene. All audits were passed. Some minor non-conformities were raised related to improvement on food safety environment/document, personnel awareness and plant hygiene. All these minor nonconformities were closed with proper corrections, corrective and preventive actions. GMP/ hygiene audits are also being conducted by QC online staff on a daily basis as a routine practice. Any finding is reported and discussed in the daily meeting for corrective actions in need timely. Moreover, we have GMP tour every 2 weeks conducted by the Factory Manager, Quality Assurance Department and other relating departments. The GMP tour report is submitted to General Director. In addition to the above, hygiene related issues are addressed in the Internal Audits. The responsible departments will work on the findings to close gaps in agreed time frames. Health checks. Orana Vietnam offers annual health check for all staff. All staff have accepted the offer and the company also offers extra insurance for accident for all staff. Female staff will be provided extra check. 4. Labour Description of Actions No Orana site will hire any form of forced labour or child labours. Page 5 of 9 10-06-20 13:42 6 All sites recognize and encourage the freedom of association rights of its employees and ensure that trade unions are able to communicate openly with management regarding working conditions without threat of reprisal, intimidation or harassment. All sites pay workers according to applicable wage laws, including minimum wages, overtime hours and mandated benefits. Measurement of Outcomes Orana Vietnam staff have formed a trade union for collective bargaining purposes and twice a year, meetings are held between management and the trade union on matters of mutual concern. All Orana Vietnam’s wages are as a minimum consistent with Vietnamese Law and prevailing industry standards. Holiday, sick leave and maternity leave are provided in consistency with Vietnamese Law. Working hours are also consistent with Vietnamese Law and prevailing industry standards. Overtime is voluntary and as per Vietnamese overtime regulations. During July Quarter 2019, the Orana Vietnam Sustainability Group (see below chapter on Environment for more on the Sustainability Group) presented 49 ideas where 32 ideas were on how to improve work efficiency and 10 ideas were on how to improve working conditions. Several ideas have been implemented already, others are under implementation and some are still being treated. 5. Environment Description of Actions All sites shall comply with all applicable environmental regulations. A system for the safe handling, recycling and management of waste and wastewater discharges has been implemented at Orana Vietnam Measurement of Outcomes Orana Vietnam has ensured that all required environmental permits and licenses are in place and that their reporting requirements by law in Vietnam are followed. Orana Vietnam has set up a new calculator of carbon foot print measuring per ton produced for Scope 1 and Scope 2 and will started measuring in October Quarter 2018. Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from owned or controlled sources. Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions are emissions from sources not owned or controlled by the company. It is under Scope 3 where the Orana Group is making a difference by having decentralized productions. By establishing carbon foot print measuring for Scope 1 Page 6 of 9 10-06-20 13:42 7 and Scope 2, we will have started the process on assessing our impact in all areas and will be able to establish initiatives to address opportunities for improvement. The result for 2018/19 can be seen here: Graph 3: Carbon Foot Print. Total tCO2e/Ton As can be seen the total carbon foot print is in line with the volume, but the CO2e/ton produced is having a variance from 0.149 to 0.271. This is mainly due to product mix. In terms of energy consumption, the following was measured in 2018/19: Table 2: Energy Consumption Energy conVN sumptions Delta Delta % Delta Delta % 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 Base Base LY LY Year Year Electricity 272 258 210 -14 -5.2% -48 -18.6% kWh/ton Gas / Diesel in 876 782 789 -94 -10.8% +7 +0.9% mJ / ton Water m3 /ton 4.1 4.1 4.2 0.0 +0.2% 0.0 +1.1% Waste water m3 2.9 2.8 2.9 +0.1 0.0% +0.1 +3.5% / ton Page 7 of 9 10-06-20 13:42 8 Water and wastewater consumption was high last year compared to base year due to increase in volume of one product requiring double processing and more CIPs/hot water rinsing. It is for the same reason that diesel increased as more steam was needed to produce this product with double processing per ton compared to other products. Orana Vietnam also upgraded Wastewater treatment system in 2018/19. We increased capacity from 30m3/day up to 65m3/day. Orana Vietnam carried out some improvements on electricity which helped to save electric consumption significantly. A Sustainability Group was established in Orana Vietnam in July 2019. The main task was to ensure that all staff: 1)Think 2)Act 3)Work sustainable in all ways so that the Orana Group’s CSR Policy and Sustainability goals and strategy would become a natural part of everyone’s every day work. This will be achieved by involving all employees and thus ensuring that the project is not only top-down but also driven by the staff. During July Quarter 2019, the Sustainability Group at Orana Vietnam presented 49 ideas of which 7 ideas were on how to save energy, water and waste water. Some of the ideas have been implemented already, others are under implementation and a few are still being treated. 6.
