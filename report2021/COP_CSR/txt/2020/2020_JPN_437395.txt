Through the promotion of TSA, we are reducing greenhouse gases (CO2) by improving the efficiency of energy usage for the construction phase at all worksite offices and utilizing renewable energy. Moreover, to have employees and many people involved in construction recognize the importance of reducing environmental impact, we distribute “The Guideline for the Achievement of Targets,” which presents detailed examples to demonstrate the relationship between environmental impact reduction and the improvement of productivity. We also established a new award system to evaluate ideas about environment activities, which can be used as a model, as well as ambitious challenges. In this way, we aim to achieve Environmental Targets. Data Section For material flow and the annual Environmental Targets, please refer to the website.

However, to resolve and cope with these factors with technology and measures, the industry could generate business opportunities such as by reinforcing infrastructure related to ZEB (Zero Energy Building), which could mitigate the effect of climate change, and corresponding measures. Taisei Corporation pays attention to the shortto long-term effect of climate change by referring to the proposals of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to identify risks and opportunities, and utilize them for various EMS (Environment Management System) activities. Major Results in FY2018 ● SBT Certification and Medium and Long-Term Activities Taisei Corporation’s greenhouse gas reduction target was certified by Science Based Targets (SBT), an international initiative. Our CO2 emission reduction target for 2030, which is a benchmark of Environmental Target 2050, was recognized as having a scientific basis, and contributes to the achievement of the target of the Paris Agreement to keep the temperature to less than two degrees Celsius above the level before the Industrial Revolution. Through the popularization of ZEB and environmentally friendly designs for customers, we have been working on reducing environmental burden and CO2 at working sites in Japan during construction by establishing CO2 reduction intensity targets (compared with the value of finished work) for the building operation stage (Scope 3) and construction stage (Scope 1+2). Our 2030 target certified by SBT was reflected in the annual Environmental Targets. To achieve the targets, in addition to implementing TSA (see p.50), we will cooperate with various stakeholders including supply chain partners and customers to reduce the emission amount. Taisei Corporation’s SBT: Reduce Scope 1 + 2 emissions (CO2 at construction stage) by 26% by 2030 Reduce Scope 3 emissions (CO2 at building operation stage) by 25% by 2030 Note: Both are a comparison to those of FY2013.

Japan imports most of the raw materials. Therefore, when the supply of materials becomes unstable due to a disaster caused by an extreme climate, it may create a significant risk to business continuity. By promoting green procurement, Taisei Corporation Toward Sustainable Growth of the Taisei Group aims to achieve a recycling society by considering the life cycle of selecting materials from the building design stage and providing technology that enables buildings to last many years. Major Results in FY2018 ● Recycling and Effective Utilization of Resources Based on Green Procurement Guideline Adoption of Green Procurement Item (Construction design phase: non-consolidated) In 2001, the Taisei Corporation Green Procurement Guideline Other items 10% Facilities 60% was established and put into effect to promote the use of ●Greening of roofs,etc. ●LED light materials, equipment and building methods that have small ●Automatic faucet Structural items ●Western-style toilet environmental burden during the design, construction, 12% Special Feature (water-saving type) operation and demolition of structures. ●Recycled steel ●Automatic cleaning materials Details of equipment and By referring to and reflecting the content of the Green ●High-strength adopted items built-in urinal Purchase Law (the law concerning the promotion of concrete, etc. (water-saving type) procurement of eco-friendly goods and services by the state Construction ●Energy-saving items 18% electric toilet seat and other entities), we review the subject items every year.

Through CSR procurement, we are also promoting environmental consideration for procurement when we work with suppliers. ● Recycling of Waste Plastic Business Section Waste plastic such as building and wrapping materials generated in the construction process are strictly sorted for specialist waste disposers to recycle properly. (Large forming material may be melted with a solution to reduce the volume to be treated. In addition, we are implementing measures to utilize waste plastic by combining it with waste wood products and creating an artificial Taisei Corporation supports the Plastic recycled wood product.) Smart Campaign by the Ministry of the Environment. ● Recycling and Effective Utilization of Resources at Worksites ESG Section The emission volume of construction waste varies depending on the scale and type of construction. In general, the bigger the construction is, the larger the amount of waste becomes. However, most of the waste is strictly sorted and transported by specialists.

During the planning phase, we extract risks such as the violation of environmental laws and regulations as well as opportunities including chances to add value. We pay attention to biodiversity until the operation and management support phase after construction, and provide solutions to create a rich environment to customers. We will contribute to the achievement of a society that cohabits with nature by properly evaluating the value of natural resources to utilize for the development of infrastructure and buildings and reducing the influence of construction. Major Results in FY2018 ● Biodiversity-Conscious Research, Planning, Construction and Monitoring With Ecological Planning, our proprietary environment planning technology, Taisei Corporation contributes to the realization of a society that co-exists with nature by analyzing the natural environment of construction sites and surroundings, carrying out planning based on predictive estimates and monitoring the construction and postconstruction status. In addition, based on our long years of experience, we developed “Ikimono Concierge,” a tool that conducts a predictive estimation of animals that could be introduced to a planned site and “Mori Concierge,” a tool to select plants suitable for the environment of a planned site. Using these tools, we provide high-quality proposals that contribute to cohabitation with nature. ● Consideration of Biodiversity for Proposal During civil engineering construction, there are many chances to face the natural environment. Therefore, we propose measures to protect endangered animals and plants and avoid having an influence on them considering biodiversity. As for construction, our biodiversity evaluation tools such as Ikimono Concierge and Mori Concierge are effectively used for greening plans at construction sites or for redevelopment projects. IKIMONO-Concierge ● Implementation of Activities to Contribute to Environment and Society in Cooperation with Various Stakeholders The direction of the measures for biodiversity is presented with the Environmental Policy and Declaration of Biodiversity Preservation.

Based on this Policy, we formulate the Business Continuity Plan to be implemented in times of disaster, conduct disaster countermeasure training at least once a year, and fully review and update the Business Continuity Plan based on the results of the training and other factors each time. FY2018 Large-Scale Disaster Countermeasure Training Taisei Corporation conducted the FY2018 Large-Scale Disaster Countermeasure Training in November 2018 based on its Business Continuity Plan. A total of approximately 18,000 officers and employees from the head office, 13 branches across the country and all 25 Group companies participated in the training (see p.108). Setting the theme of this training as “establishing and verifying the initial action system that functions even at times of confusion immediately after the outbreak of a disaster,” we informed the members of each countermeasure/response headquarters of the time of outbreak of the disaster, the transportation status and the availability of a building for use on the day of the training to replicate the confusion at the time of initial response and carried out increasingly practical training. In addition, to prepare for a situation where the managers of the countermeasure/response headquarters are unable to gather at the headquarters due to paralyzed traffic functions, etc. and provide prompt instructions, we set up multiple temporary contact points at branches in the Tokyo metropolitan area and conducted training where also on the day of the training some of the managers of countermeasure/response headquarters temporarily gathered at such temporary contact points and took command remotely.

We have established consultation desks in-house and at an external organization (a law firm). At these in-house and external consultation desks, we accept whistleblowing reports from external parties. When handling whistleblowing reports, we abide by the Whistleblower Protection Act and treat all information about the whistleblower as confidential and prohibit any adverse action as a direct result of whistleblowing. Furthermore, we accept anonymous tips in order to find a clue of a wide range of illegal activities. We carry out fact-finding investigations on the whistleblowing reports received, and respond appropriately, including taking corrective measures as needed. We accept any consultation from external stakeholders at our inquiry counter.

Every year, the legal department verifies the legitimacy of bids and checks compliance with the Construction Business Act, Antimonopoly Act and the Subcontractors Protection Act. The results are reported to the in-house Auditing Department. ［３］Initiatives to Ensure Fair Subcontracts and Eliminate Anti-Social Forces Taisei Corporation has adopted Promoting Partnerships with Supply Chains in its Action Guidelines for Taisei Personnel and the Taisei Group as a Whole, and declares “Promoting partnerships with subcontractors and suppliers” and stipulates that transactions be conducted on an equal footing. Furthermore, we have set out Measures for Dealing with Anti-Social Forces and Organizations, stipulating that we will take a resolute stance against anti-social forces and will not comply with illegitimate demands. In order to eliminate anti-social forces, we have included a condition in our contracts, including the basic contract for specialized sub-contractors, declaring that the supplier is not an anti-social force and that if revealed otherwise, the contract may be cancelled without notice. ［4］Prohibition of Bribery and Other Fraudulent Acts At Taisei Corporation, we have set forth “Ensuring fair trade” and “Maintenance of proper relationships with individuals or entities engaged in politics and government” under the Action Guidelines for Taisei Personnel and the Taisei Group as a Whole and implement Group-wide initiatives to prevent bribery and other misleading acts. In April 2018, we signed the United Nations Global Compact and have been making sure we prevent corruption based on one of the ten principles, “Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.” In the previous fiscal year, we organized enlightenment activities for all officers and employees to prevent bribery of foreign public officials. 73 TA I S E I A NNUA L R EPORT 2019 » Priority Initiatives Taken in FY2018 About the Taisei Group Taking the fact seriously that we were indicted on suspicion of violating the Anti-Monopoly Act in connection with the Linear Chuo Shinkansen construction project, we have implemented the measures indicated below based on deliberations by the Compliance Committee chaired by an external lawyer and resolution by the Board. 1. Revision and tightening of internal rules relating to contacts with competitors (September 2018) Toward Sustainable Growth of the Taisei Group 2.

We strategically manage and utilize all intellectual property including patents, copyright, construction and business know-how to promote management that is focused on intellectual property. Regarding management of intellectual property, we intend to improve operational efficiency through building a search function for our own patents and preparing a database for managing patents. We have tightened the handling of classified information and we have established Rules for Handling Intellectual Property Special Feature Information in order to prevent leaks of technical know-how or other confidential business information. We also take measures to reduce the risk of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as making technical departments and business departments thoroughly aware of other companies’ patent information. In addition, we conduct training to ensure that employees are fully informed about this policy and utilize intellectual property strategically in order to strengthen our competitiveness and improve our corporate value. In FY2018, we conducted intellectual property courses for technical departments in the head office and operations departments in branch offices as well as e-learning for all officers and employees, including the utilization of application rights and a series of awareness raising campaigns about infringement (see p.108). Business Section » Information Security Measures Taisei Corporation has formulated policies and action guidelines in order to protect and make appropriate use of company information. We have systematically built rules and regulations concerning company-wide information security systems and information management. We established Taisei-SIRT in order to strengthen the system for responding to security incidents* involving electronic information. We have been actively involved in the Nippon CSIRT Association since joining in March 2013. Under the slogan “ICT Safety First!,” Taisei Corporation implements a range of information security measures. Together with all Group companies, specialized constructors, and other partner companies, we aim for zero incidents related to information security. ESG Section We have been promoting a tighter information security environment at overseas business offices and construction sites since FY2016. We have summarized the minimal rules to be followed in a pamphlet, and conducted education and instruction for all officers and employees as well as specialized constructors and other partner companies. In FY2018, we conducted 19 sessions of company-wide information security training and the number of major information security accidents came down to zero (see KPIs on p.60). » To Share Our Philosophy and Values To spread and consolidate the Group Philosophy among employees while connecting it to social demands and in-house initiatives, Data Section we have operated annual trainings about the Group Philosophy based on an e-learning format since FY2011. In FY2018, we held an e-learning session for employees on the theme of the relationship between the Group Philosophy and improvements in corporate value required by Observing the Charter of Corporate Behavior of the Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), with a participation rate of 97%.

Basis of Presenting Consolidated Financial Statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Taisei Corporation (the “Company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively the About the Taisei Group “Group”) have been prepared in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and its related accounting regulations, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”), which are different in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been reformatted and translated into English (with some expanded descriptions) from the consolidated financial statements of the Company prepared in accordance with Japanese GAAP and filed with the appropriate Local Finance Bureau of the Ministry of Finance as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. Certain supplementary information, included in the statutory Japanese language consolidated financial statements but not required for fair presentation, is not presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The translations of the Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan, using the prevailing exchange rate at March 31, 2019, which was ¥ 110.99 to U.S. $ 1. The translations should not be construed as representations of what the Japanese yen amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be when converted into U.S. dollars at this or any other rate of exchange. Toward Sustainable Growth of the Taisei Group 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (a) Consolidation and equity method The Company prepares the consolidated financial statements including the accounts of the Company and those of its majority-owned subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly controlled. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of 32 subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2019 (31 subsidiaries for the year ended March 31, 2018). TAISEI PHILIPPINE CONSTRUCTION, Inc., which had been an equity method affiliate, was included in the scope of consolidation due to the acquisition of shares by the Group. In addition, TAISEI CONCESSION CORPORATION and one other company were included in the scope of consolidation by new establishments. YB HAMACHO KAIHATSU TMK. and one other company were excluded from the scope of consolidation by liquidation. Exclusion of certain small-scale subsidiaries from the scope of consolidation does not have material impact on the consolidated financial statements. All significant intercompany transactions, account balances and unrealized gains or losses have been eliminated in consolidation. The financial statements of non-consolidated subsidiaries, and investments in affiliated companies in which the Group does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for by the equity method. The financial statements in 20 non-consolidated subsidiaries, mainly consist of TOKYO ACADEMIC SERVICE Co., Ltd. and EHIME HOSPITAL PERTNERS Co., Ltd. are accounted for by the equity method for the year ended March 31, 2018 and 2019. Special Feature Investments in 38 affiliated companies are also accounted for by the equity method for the year ended March 31, 2019 (40 affiliated companies for the year ended March 31, 2018). TAISEI PHILIPPINE CONSTRUCTION, Inc. was excluded from the scope of equity method as the company was included in the scope of consolidation. One other affiliate was excluded from the scope of equity method due to sales of shares by the Company. Exclusion of certain small-scale non-consolidated subsidiaries and the affiliated company from the scope of equity method does not have material effect on the consolidated financial statements. All consolidated subsidiaries other than 11 consolidated overseas subsidiaries have the same balance sheet date, March 31, corresponding with that of the Company. As for the 11 consolidated overseas subsidiaries whose fiscal year ends at December 31, their financial statements as of December 31 are used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Significant transactions, if any, in the period from January 1 to March 31 have been adjusted in the consolidated financial statements. (b) Valuation of Assets and Liabilities of Subsidiaries In the elimination of the investments in subsidiaries, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries including the portion allocated to nonBusiness Section controlling interests are recorded based on their fair value at the time the Company acquired control of the respective subsidiaries. (c) Goodwill included in Intangible assets Significant excesses of investment cost over net equity of consolidated subsidiaries and affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method are recognized as goodwill (negative goodwill, if credit balance), and amortized principally over the estimated useful lives or less than twenty years on a straight-line basis. However, immaterial goodwill is charged to income in the year of acquisition. Negative goodwill is credited to income upon occurrence. (d) Foreign Currency Translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at year-end exchange rates. The resulting exchange gains and losses are reflected in the consolidated statements of income. All revenues and expenses associated with foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing when such transactions are made. The financial statements of consolidated foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies under the equity method are translated into ESG Section Japanese yen at exchange rates prevailing at the respective year-end dates except for shareholders’ equity accounts, which are translated at historical rates. The resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are presented in accumulated other comprehensive income in the net assets section of the consolidated balance sheets. (e) Cash and Cash Equivalents in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows In preparing the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash on hand, readily available deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with maturities not exceeding three months at the date of purchase and with insignificant risks of change in value are considered to be cash and cash equivalents. (f) Securities Securities held by the Group are classified into (a) debt securities intended to be held to maturity, (b) equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies, and (c) all other securities that are not classified in any of the categories above (hereafter “available-for-sale Data Section securities”). Debt securities intended to be held to maturity are stated at amortized cost. Equity securities issued by subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method are stated at moving-average cost. Available-for-sale securities with available fair market value is stated at fair market value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on securities, net of taxes are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the net assets section. Realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are computed using moving-average cost. Other securities with no available fair market value are stated at moving-average cost. TA I SE I A N N UA L R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 86 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (cont.) TAISEI CORPORATION and Consolidated Subsidiaries Years Ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 (g) Revenue Recognition of Construction Revenue associated with construction contracts of which the outcome can be reliably estimated is accounted for by the percentage-ofcompletion method; otherwise contract revenue is accounted for by the completed-contract method. The percentage of completion at the end of the reporting period is determined by the percentage of the cost incurred to the estimated total costs. (h) Inventories The Company and its certain subsidiaries develop real estate projects on their own account. Cost on development projects in progress are mainly stated at the lower of cost based on the specific-identification cost method or net realizable value. For this purpose, the cost includes the purchase cost of land, incidental costs, direct development costs and (in relation to certain developments by one of the subsidiaries) interest expenses. Cost on uncompleted contracts is mainly stated at cost based on the specific-identification cost method. (i) Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets except for buildings and structures are recorded at cost and depreciated principally by the declining-balance method over the standard useful lives prescribed in the Corporation Tax Law. Buildings and structures are principally depreciated by the straight-line method. (j) Accounting for Lease Transactions Finance leases, except for certain immaterial or short-term finance leases in which ownership is not transferred to lessee, are capitalized. Capitalized leased assets whose ownership is transferred to lessee are depreciated by the same method of depreciation applied to property, plant and equipment. Capitalized leased assets whose ownership is not transferred to lessee are depreciated to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method over a useful life period corresponding to the lease contract period. (k) Derivatives and Hedge Accounting Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized as gains or losses unless derivative financial instruments are used for hedging purposes. If derivative financial instruments are used as hedges and meet certain hedging criteria, the Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries defer recognition of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments until related losses or gains on hedged items are recognized. If interest rate swap contracts are used as hedge and meet certain hedging criteria, net amounts to be paid or received under the interest rate swap contracts are added to or deducted from the interest on liabilities for which the swap contract were executed. (l) Income Taxes The Company and its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries apply the system of consolidated tax returns. (m) Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided to reserve for probable losses from bad debt. It consists of the estimated uncollectible amount of certain identified doubtful receivables and the amount estimated on the basis of the past default ratio for normal receivables. (n) Allowance for Warranty on Completed Contracts Allowance for warranty on completed contracts is provided as the amount estimated using an actual ratio of related losses during the past certain periods. (o) Allowance for Losses on Construction Contracts Allowance for losses on construction contracts is provided with respect to construction projects for which eventual losses are reasonably estimated. (p) Allowance for Losses on Order Received Allowance for losses on order received is provided with respect to orders (excluding construction contracts) for which eventual losses are reasonably estimated. (q) Retirement Benefits for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members Retirement benefits for directors and audit & supervisory board members of certain consolidated subsidiaries have been set up in accordance with each company’s regulations. (r) Allowance for Losses on Investments in Subsidiaries and Affiliates Allowance for losses on investments in subsidiaries and affiliates is provided for estimated losses from certain subsidiaries and affiliates in liquidation. (s) Allowance for Environmental Spending Allowance for environmental spending is provided based on estimated costs for disposal of Polychlorinated Biphenyl (“PCB”) waste, which is obligated to dispose by the Act on Special Measures Concerning Promotion of Proper Treatment of PCB Waste. (t) Allowance for Losses on Anti-Monopoly Act Allowance for losses on Anti-Monopoly Act is provided based on estimated payment for penalties under the Anti-Monopoly Act. (u) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefit Net defined benefit liability is provided for severance and retirement benefits for employees and executive officers of the Company’s certain consolidated subsidiaries based on estimated amounts of projected benefit obligations and plan assets at the year-end. In calculating projected benefit obligations, the method of attributing estimated amounts of retirement benefits to the period until this fiscal year is based on the benefit formula basis. Past service costs are amortized using the straight-line method (some consolidated subsidiaries use the declining-balance method) over 1-10 years, which is not longer than an average remaining service period of the employees when the costs are incurred. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized from the subsequent fiscal year (some consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gains and losses from the current fiscal year) using the straight line method (some consolidated subsidiaries use the declining balance method) over 1-10 years, which is not longer than an estimated average remaining service period of the employees when the gains or losses are incurred. (v) Net Income and Cash Dividends per Share Net income per share is calculated by dividing net income available to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Cash dividends per share shown for each year represent dividends declared as applicable to the respective years. 87 TA I S E I A NNUA L R EPORT 2019 (w) Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on About the Taisei Group previously reported results of operations or retained earnings. (x) Accounting standard issued but not yet effective The following standard and guidance were issued but are not yet effective “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No.29, March 30, 2018) “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No.30, March 30, 2018) (1) Overview The IASB and the FASB jointly developed and issued a converged Standard on the recognition of ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ (IFRS 15 for IASB and Topic 606 for FASB.) in May, 2014. IFRS 15 will be applied from the fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 will be applied from the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017. Under these circumstances, the ASBJ developed the converged standard for revenue recognition and issued the “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” along with “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition”. Toward Sustainable Growth of the Taisei Group In developing the ‘Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition,’ the principal policy of the ASBJ is to incorporate the basic concept of IFRS 15 from the perspective of comparability between financial statements, as one way to establish consistency with IFRS 15. The ASBJ will add alternative treatments in the case that there are different accounting treatments prevalent in accounting practices in Japan that require consideration, to the extent that they do not impair comparability. (2) Effective date Effective from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. (3) Effects of the application of the standards The Company and its consolidated subsidiaries are currently in the process of determining the effects of these new standards on the consolidated financial statements. (y) Changes in presentation (1) Changes due to application of “Partial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting” (ASBJ Statement No.28, February 16, 2018 (“Statement No.28”)) The Group applied Statement No.28 from the beginning of this fiscal year. Accordingly, the Group changed the presentation, such that deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are classified as part of investments and other assets and long-term liabilities, respectively. As a result, deferred income tax assets of ¥ 24,777 million classified as “current assets” have been included in deferred income tax assets ¥ 6,557 million in “investments and other assets” in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of the previous fiscal year. In addition, due to the effect of offsetting deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities by the same taxable entity, total assets Special Feature and total liabilities decreased by ¥ 20,227 million, respectively. 3.

Financial Instruments (1) Policies for using financial instruments The Group restricts investments to the low risk assets such as deposits, and raise funds by the indirect finance such as loans from bank as well as by the direct finance such as issuing corporate bonds or commercial papers. Derivative financial instruments are employed mainly for hedging fluctuation in interest rate and foreign currency exchange, not for speculation. Receivables: trade notes and trade accounts are exposed to the credit risks of customers. In order to reduce such risks, the Group conducts strict credit examinations when orders are received, and afterward manage the receivables individually and make effort to detect reduction of ESG Section credit risks early. For investment securities which are mainly debt securities intended to be held to maturity and shares held to keep the relationship with business partners, the Group regularly monitors the fair value or financial positions of the invested companies, and revises the portfolio timely (except for debt securities intended to be held to maturity) considering the relationship with them. Debts, trade payables: trade notes and trade accounts are debts mostly due within one year. Loans, commercial papers and bonds are primarily for working capital, and have maturity dates of five years or less. Although the loans or bonds issued at variable rates are exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk, the risk is hedged by derivative transactions (interest rate swap contracts). The Group primarily utilizes derivative transactions related to interest rates in order to mitigate the fluctuation risk in interest rates or to reduce financing costs, and derivative transactions related to currency in order to mitigate the foreign exchange risk. These transactions are exposed to the fluctuation risk in interest rates and the foreign exchange risk. However, the Group is exposed to limited risk, because most of them are hedged by the corresponding transactions. They consider the credit risk to be low, because they conduct derivative transactions solely with reliable international financial institutions. The Group executes and manages derivative transactions in accordance with internal rules. Their Finance Departments are responsible Data Section for conducting, evaluating transactions and managing related risks. (2) Fair Value of Financial Instruments Book value of the financial instruments was included in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of said items as of March 31, 2018 and 2019, was as follows. Items for which it is extremely difficult to calculate the fair value were not included in the following table (see “Note 2” below).

See the notes on “5. Securities” for notes pertaining to securities categorized by the purposes for which they are held. LIABILITIES ∙ Notes and accounts payable, trade, Short-term loans and Long term loans due within one year and Deposits received The fair value of these financial instruments are almost equivalent to the book value, due to the short term settlements; although, the fair Toward Sustainable Growth of the Taisei Group value of long-term loans due within one year is based on the same method as that for long-term loans. ∙ Short-term non-recourse loans payable and Long-term loans The fair value of these financial instruments is based on the present value of discounted cash flows by the interest rate which may be applicable when the same kind of loans is conducted. ∙ Bonds The fair value of marketable bonds is based on the quoted market value, otherwise the fair value of nonmarketable bonds is based on the present value of discounted cash flows using the interest rate determined by the factors of the estimated redemption terms and issuer’s credit risk. [Derivative financial instruments] See the notes on “14. Derivative Transactions”.

Special Feature 12. Net assets Net assets comprise three subsections; which are shareholders’ equity, accumulated other comprehensive income and non-controlling interests. Under Japanese laws and regulations, the entire amount paid for new shares is required to be designated as common stock. However, a company may, by a resolution of the Board of Directors, designate an amount not exceeding one-half of the price of the new shares as additional paid-in capital, which is included in capital surplus. Under the Japanese Corporate Law (“the Law”), when a dividend distribution of surplus is made, the smaller of an amount equal to 10% of the dividend or the excess, if any, of 25% of common stock over the total of additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve must be set aside as additional paid-in capital or legal earnings reserve. Legal earnings reserve is included in retained earnings in the accompanying Business Section consolidated balance sheets. Under the Law, appropriations of legal earnings reserve and additional paid-in capital generally require a resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. Additional paid-in capital and legal earnings reserve may not be distributed as dividends. Under the Law, however, all additional paid-in capital and all legal earnings reserve may be transferred to other capital surplus and retained earnings, respectively, which are potentially available for dividends. The maximum amount that the Company can distribute as dividends is calculated based on the non-consolidated financial statements of the Company in accordance with the Law. Total annual dividends per share as of March 31, 2019 is ¥ 130.00 (U.S. $ 1.2), which is the sum of the interim dividend per share of ¥ 60.00 (U.S. $ 0.6) and the year-end dividend per share of ¥ 70.00 (U.S. $ 0.6).
