Progress report UN Global Compact Ahlsell is a signatory to the voluntary initiative United Nations Global Compact. By endorsing the UN Global Compact we undertake to follow the ten principles for human rights, labour rights, the environment and anti-corruption. In this implementation, the Ahlsell’s Code of Conduct is an important tool, which is determined each year at a board meeting. It describes how we should act and the requirements we have on ourselves and our suppliers. The Code of Conduct is published on our website, and is based on the UN Global Compact, the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related UN conventions, the ILO’s core conventions and the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Ahlsell has been a distributor within technical installation for more than 140 years. Today, we are proud to be the Nordic market leader within our industry. We did not achieve this position by being just good enough, we always have focused on improvements to offer our customers an even better value proposition. For us, sustainability is to safeguard that we will continue to exist for our customers, suppliers, employees and owners also in the future. We have a vision to be the industry leader within sustainability and to take a clear economic, social and environmental responsibility Already in 2008, we took the first steps towards a more environmentally focused approach in our business. Since then, our ambitions on sustainability has continuously increased significantly. Today it is a central part in our strategy and we see sustainability as an important element for value creation. Our products enable construction and maintenance of school’s, hospitals and housing. We help to ensure that millions of northerners receive water, fibre and power. We support installers and industries in their mission to build a sustainable society. To make sure that our core business is given the opportunity to continue, we will adopt two longterm goals to accelerate the change towards a sustainable society. We will reduce our climate impact with 50% until 2030 and be fossil free 2045. We will also make sure that we have zero high risks in the supply chain 2025. This will be carried out using governance, our competence, leadership and digitalisation. We address our main challenges within four focus areas; Responsible Sourcing, Innovation & Collaboration, Tackle Climate change and Health & Safety. The focus areas cover the entire Group and are broken down into subgoals, internally and externally, Group-wide and local. I believe that what gets measured, also gets done. I’m proud to represent Ahlsell and our achievements. Together with competent and committed employees and engaged investors we have created a longterm vision of a sustainable business.
