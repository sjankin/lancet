Sustainability is at our core, both in caring for our staff and supporting our clients. As a company, we have always paid exceptional attention to environmental, ethical and safety elements in our strategy, and we will continue to strive to anticipate the challenges of the future, and work towards improving quality of life. In 2019, we strengthened our investment in Human Capital, focusing on competence, professional growth, training, skill development, transparency, integrity and innovation. We continue to encourage an inclusive style of leadership based on trust and responsibility, giving our people freedom and autonomy in the organization of their work. We have adopted ‘smart working’ on a large scale, and in turn received extremely positive feedback in terms of a reduced carbon footprint and an enhanced work-life balance for our staff. Indeed, remote working at RINA’s Italian operations has enabled us to save more than 40,000 hours in commuting time, reducing our CO2 emissions by more than 200 tons, equivalent to the absorption capacity of some 13,000 urban trees. This development has also brought valuable changes to our digital attitude and workspace, ushering in a more flexible and agile way of working. This is underlined by the 2019 unveiling of RINA Consulting’s new headquarters in Genoa, which has been specifically designed to enhance the wellbeing of employees using technological developments and green solutions. Under our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, in 2019 RINA launched three major environmental projects which share the common goals of promoting responsible behaviour both on and off our premises and furthering the aims of the UN 2030 Agenda. I refer to such valuable initiatives as the reduction of plastic consumption, which will include a future ban on single-use plastics at all our sites beginning with Italy. Following the same logic of minimizing and mitigating our environmental impact, we also last year launched a plan to source 100% of our future energy needs from renewables at all our offices worldwide. We aim to achieve this, plus near-zero CO2 emissions, as soon as 2021. In addition, we have already started a programme to reduce paper consumption, and in 2019 developed a programme to roll out this best practice across the group. There are further achievements to mention. Last year also saw the implementation of a new ISO 27001-compliant Information Security Management System, as well as programmes for sustainable Short Sea Shipping Systems and new services for clean energy LNG-fuel cruise ships. We have also been instrumental in developing affordable hydrogen fuel cell technologies that can be deployed in large industrial contexts, and continue to explore all new innovative energy vectors. This report demonstrates how monitoring and reducing our carbon footprint and natural resource consumption remains among our highest priorities. It is our responsibility to our clients, our stakeholders, the industry, the planet, and you. We hope you enjoy reading this report. Ugo Salerno Chairman and CEO, RINA Genoa, April 2020 4 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our approach to sustainability report RINA is committed to providing accurate and timely information about our sustainability initiatives and performance. We aim to ensure our Sustainability Report is fair, transparent and balanced, and meets the needs and expectations of our stakeholders. The Sustainability Report covers all geographic regions and business areas of the RINA Group during the 2019 calendar year from 1 January to 31 December. We have identified and prioritized the elements which have the most material impact on our business and for stakeholders across our value chain, and the Sustainability Report includes information on how we are managing these material issues. (For further information on the definition of material issues, please see pages 17 of this report.) Reporting on our sustainability performance indicators in a consistent and accurate manner is essential for transparent reporting. We are working to implement a comprehensive dashboard to monitor KPIs at group level. We follow Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards as a basis of preparation for the majority of our sustainability performance indicators. Occasionally performance indicators do not refer to the entire RINA Group due to a lack of full comparable data. In these cases, the boundaries applied are described next to the indicator. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards Referenced Option. This report reflects RINA’s self-assessment of how it continuously works to meet the UN Global Compact Active Level criteria. RINA welcomes questions, comments and feedback from all its stakeholders.

In order to ensure compliance with the applicable recognition, authorization, notification and accreditation rules, including those relevant to the management of impartiality, the sub-holdings are subject to direction and co-ordination by the holding group in the areas of finance, administration, strategy, organisation, management and business continuity. By contrast, technical and operational decisions remain under the exclusive responsibility of the sub-holdings and the companies under their control. The pillars of RINA’s governance model are:  Strategic direction and coordination is carried out by the holding group  Technical and operational activities are managed by the sub-holdings  Director positions in the Holding and Subholdings are segregated  Relationships, information flow and control are properly managed The strict separation of duties between the governing bodies, and an impartiality risk assessment to identify and manage impartiality and the risk of conflicts of interest in company relations, ensures compliance with the applicable impartiality rules. We have designed an organizational and governance model which over the years has been audited and approved by the strictest controllers, including the European Commission, the European Maritime Safety Agency, the Italian accreditation body Accredia, and many other accreditation bodies worldwide. Board of Directors The Board of Directors of the holding company fulfils the role of guiding, coordinating, verifying and controlling the RINA group as a whole. The board defines the corporate governance structure of the group, guides the general direction of the management of the controlled companies and the RINA group as a whole, and assesses the adequacy of the organizational systems of the controlled companies, both in relation to business development and risk control/ management on the basis of the statutes in force and the applicable legal provisions. Control Body The Control Body is responsible for the Model of Organisation, Management and Control model which is aimed at minimising the administrative liability of legal persons. The Body monitors the application of the Code of Ethics using data and information collected by the Internal Audit function and/or from whistleblowers. It also gives binding opinions on its interpretation, carries out periodic reviews, and proposes any amendments to the management body. Risk Management and Audit Committee This committee assists the Board of Directors and the CEO of RINA S.p.A. in identifying, assessing and managing the strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks associated with the activities of the holding company and its subsidiaries. The RINA Enterprise Risk Management Policy, revised in January 2020, sets out our commitment to developing an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework. Corporate Compliance Board The Corporate Compliance Board provides guidelines to ensure that RINA’s activities comply with the requirements of impartiality as indicated in the applicable standards, as well as those of integrity, confidentiality and fair competition. Internal Audit This audit verifies compliance with the Code of Ethics, manages reports of potential violations and transmits the results of this activity to the Control Body. 10 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our Code of Ethics The Code of Ethics is an overarching document aiming at creating proper knowledge and awareness of the values and guiding principles of the group. The objective of the Code of Ethics is to guide the behaviour of directors, employees and consultants in order to safeguard and maintain RINA’s image in terms of fairness, reputation and prestige. The Code of Ethics applies worldwide to any company under either the direct or indirect control of RINA S.p.A. The Code of Ethics is addressed to any stakeholder within or outside RINA. This includes Directors, Managers and Employees. Meanwhile, Consultants and Suppliers must adhere to the principles of the Code of Ethics as a contractual duty. The Code of Ethics, last published in April 2019, sets out referenced Principles and Ethical Values. These include standards in relation to:  Lawfulness and ethical standards of reference  Financial integrity and the fight against fraud  The fight against corruption  The safeguarding of privacy and confidentiality  The safeguarding of intellectual property  Propriety in business dealings, company activities and competition  Sustainability and Corporate Social Responsability  Human Rights  Health, Safety and Enviroment For any doubts concerning the Code of Ethics and its contents and application, or regarding proper conduct in specific circumstances, RINA has made available a Corporate Compliance Helpline: compliance-helpline@rina.org 11 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our approach to Sustainability RINA has embedded Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability into its business development strategy. This is enhanced by our Corporate Social Responsibility policy, which formalises our approach through four key pillars: Governance, People, Planet and Innovation. The aim is to drive continuous improvement in each of these areas. In 2019, we launched a significant number of new projects. These included revisions to our ‘mission and vision’ statement and our Code of Ethics; developments in our approach to human capital; a move towards plastic free and paperless working and greater use of renewables; and the rolling out of smart working and our new agile headquarters. The path towards sustainability involves both internal and external measures: from internal initiatives designed to increase awareness of more sustainable ways to approach our business and carry out our activities; to the development of innovative external services which generate positive outcomes for our customers’ projects and businesses, as well as for our stakeholders, society and the environment. RINA is also actively engaged in rule development processes with a large number of technical associations, committees and working groups at both a national and international level. The purpose is to share research, results, technical knowledge, and best practices. Stakeholders can be assured that the company is managing its social, environmental and economic impact at the highest level. We maintain a proactive and transparent dialogue with our stakeholders in order to understand their expectations, and build shared values. RINA has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2016 and reports according to the UN Global Compact Active Level. We are committed to making sustainability one of the key drivers of our business strategy, and to ensure this approach is reflected in the services we deliver to our clients. We actively support the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact relating to human rights, labour standards, the environment, and the fight against corruption. Progress on implementing these principles is reported annually to our stakeholders. We also participate in national and international forums dedicated to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability. These include Fondazione Sodalitas, the Italian partner of CSR Europe, as well as Transparency International and its Italian working group Business Integrity Forum, which support voluntary anti-corruption initiatives. 12 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our sustainability Governance RINA has put in place a comprehensive structure to manage sustainability in the company. The Chief Risk Officer assisted by the Compliance & Sustainability Director develops and overviews the implementation of the corporate strategy on quality, environmental, health, safety, security, social responsibility and personal data protection issues at group level. The CSR Manager develops, promotes, communicates and disseminates RINA’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme and is responsible for the coordination of sustainability projects, plus stakeholder engagement and the measuring and reporting of sustainability performance. Meanwhile, the Corporate Sustainability Working Group supports the development of the company’s sustainability strategy and proposes suitable targets and methodologies. The Corporate Sustainability Working Group meets quarterly, and more frequently as appropriate. The Group ensures that sustainability is embedded throughout the company’s activities, and that each function operates in line with the overall sustainability strategy, through the coordination of cross function sustainability projects. 13 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our stakeholders and material aspects We consider it is crucial to have a good understanding of our stakeholders, their expectations, and the aspects that are relevant to them. In 2019, we completed the periodical revision of the fundamental elements of our CSR strategy. It follows an initial analysis in 2010, which was subsequently revised in 2015.

The materiality assessment was carried out with the direct involvement of the group’s key corporate functions. Meanwhile, a qualitative-quantitative assessment of previously identified sustainability issues was also undertaken, taking into account the expectations of stakeholders. On the basis of these assessments, priority themes for each of the four pillars of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy were identified.

Labour Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti-Corruption Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption, the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact guide organisations in meeting fundamental responsibilities in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. 21 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our commitment to the UNGC 10 Principles RINA has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2016. As such, we support and apply and share within our sphere of influence the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We are committed to communicating our progress and developments towards realising these goals on an annual basis. Our Sustainability Report is publicly available on the RINA website: www.rina.org. The UN 2030 AGENDA and the 17 SDGs The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) define global sustainable development priorities and aspirations for 2030 and seek to mobilise global efforts around a common set of goals and targets. The SDGs call for worldwide action among governments, business and civil society to end poverty and create a life of dignity and opportunity for all, within the boundaries of the planet. 22 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 RINA‘s commitment to the 2030 AGENDA Sustainability is integral to RINA’s business culture and strategy. The group wishes to contribute to improving economic, social and environmental conditions wherever it operates, and to build value for future generations. It is committed to ensuring this approach is reflected in the services it provides to customers. RINA pursues a model of sustainable business, which revolves around continuous innovation in business processes, and the provision of services that support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We have been among the first 50 Italian companies to respond to the CEO Call to Action for a New Deal for Europe, launched in consultation with the European Commission on the occasion of the Brussels SDG Summit of 7 May 2019. By participating in this important initiative, RINA reaffirms its commitment to pursuing a model of sustainable development in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as holding an active dialogue with stakeholders. 23 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Human Rights Our Commitment RINA considers the respect of human rights an essential principle.

The Model describes the technical and organizational measures adopted by the Company, in compliance with the new regulation, in order to protect the rights and freedom of data subjects, pursuing a level of security appropriate to the risk connected to the data processing activities carried out by the companies of the RINA group. “Accountability”, the basis of GDPR, is defined as substantial risk assumption. The system introduced by the GDPR regarding personal data is “risk-based”, in other words, based on the assumption that while processing personal data, the rights and freedom of the interested subject must be protected. Furthermore, taking into account the provisions of art.37 co.2 GDPR and with reference to the Group Regulations, a Data Protection Officer was appointed following a RINA S.p.A. Board of Directors’ resolution on 17 April 2018. This role falls within the Corporate Compliance and Risk Management function, and its main task is to ensure in an independent manner that the Company complies with data protection law and protects individuals’ rights and freedoms by securing their personal data. We are working towards achieving the goals of SDG 5 for gender equality, SDG 10 for reduced inequality and the social and economic inclusion of all, and SDG 17 for effective private and civil partnerships. Labour Our Commitment We strive to provide our people with decent, productive work and the prospect of a stable and secure future. People are our most important asset and have a key role to play in supporting the sustainable growth of our organisation. Our aspiration is to be an employer of choice, and to achieve zero harm in our operations. Health, safety and the environment are three major values that underpin RINA’s business philosophy, and are directly applied in the statutory activities of its various companies. RINA is committed to ensuring safety in its activities and business operations through the adoption of policies, procedures and operational actions aimed at reducing security risk and managing crisis situations. The measures undertaken are intended to minimize the impact and likelihood of events occurring that could cause, even potentially or incidentally, direct or indirect damage, tangible or intangible, to persons and property belonging to RINA and other concerned parties. The RINA Health and Safety Policy, last published in June 2019, sets out our commitment to protect the health and security of our personnel as an essential principle. Our key priorities are to:  Comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety  Design workplaces, through suitable organizational and operative models, to safeguard workers’ health and safety, as well as those of third parties and local communities within which group companies operate  Implement appropriate preventive measures to safeguard workers’ health and safety, including medical surveillance and assessment of incidents, injuries and occupational diseases 25 RINA Sustainability Report 2019  Increase workers’ awareness about their own and their colleagues’ safety, by suitable training  Ensure all personnel, at all levels, are informed about the scope of commitments set by the group  Establish appropriate indicators to measure and periodically assess the achievement of targets, identifying possible areas of improvement  Co-operate with workers’ representatives, trade unions, industry associations and national authorities, in order to continuously enhance health and safety targets  Involve customers sharing the same values, with a view to adopting strategies aiming at achieving common health and safety targets  Identify suppliers and external partners that share the same health and safety objectives as established by the group In 2018, in line with the main objectives for the year, RINA adopted a Security Policy establishing key principles for security management within the company. According to this policy, our main security objective is to protect our staff, assets, information and reputation from potential security threats, through a security risk management approach. We are working towards achieving SDG 8 to ensure decent work for all, including safe and secure working environments, and SDG 3 for the promotion of health and wellbeing, and a strengthened capacity for managing national and global health risks. Environment Our Commitment Accounting for our environmental impact is fundamental to RINA’s approach. Monitoring and reducing our energy consumption and carbon footprint are our top priorities in our efforts to minimise the environmental impact of our operations. We draw on our experience and competencies acquired through our position as a market leader in certification and support services for clients in these matters. We are also participating in research and networking activities via European platforms and associations. The RINA Environmental Policy, last published in July 2019, together with the Health and Safety Policy, sets out our commitment to minimizing the impact of our operations as an essential principle. Our key priorities are to:  Comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment  Sponsor initiatives and promote responsible behaviors aimed at promoting environmental sustainability, and protecting and safeguarding the environment, in particular focusing on energy savings, CO2 emissions, sustainable resource use and waste management, disposal and recycling  Co-operate with worker’s representatives, trade unions, industry associations and national authorities, in order to continuously enhance environmental protection targets  Involve customers sharing the same values, with a view to adopting strategies aiming at achieving common health and safety targets  Identify suppliers and external partners that share the same health and safety objectives as established by the group We are working towards achieving the goals of SDG 7 to improve efficiency in energy consumption, SDG 12 to reduce waste generation, SDG 13 to combat climate change and its impacts, and SDG 17 to promote effective private and civil partnerships. 26 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Anti-Corruption Our Commitment RINA is committed to embedding the principles of integrity and transparency into all financial operations and transactions. All financial operations have to be correctly authorised, verifiable, legitimate, coherent and adequate. RINA rejects any form of corruption and bribery is not allowed in any circumstances. No employee, or company connected to RINA, has permission to promise or give money or other advantages to obtain undue benefits for RINA or for themselves. Likewise, these same parties cannot ask for money or other advantages in order to carry out unwarranted services. Our key priorities are to:  Ensure responsible business conduct, benchmarking, and the implementation of voluntary best practices and anti-corruption measures; to be recognised as a company with the highest possible reputation for ethical standards  Focus on promoting networking within international associations and advocacy, in order to foster a culture based on legality. RINA draws on the skills and experience we have acquired as the first ever certification body to be globally ISO 37001 accredited for its anti-bribery management systems We conduct our business in line with the goals of SDG 16 to reduce corruption and bribery in all its forms, and SDG 17 to promote effective private and civil partnerships. 27 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility RINA’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published for the first time in April 2016 and revised in 2018, sets out our commitment to sustainable development. It is built around four pillars: Governance, by:  Integrating sustainability into our global business activities  Creating long-term value  Increasing returns for investors and shareholders  Ensuring the highest level of integrity  Fighting against any form of fraud and corruption  Following fair and correct business practices  Following international best practices People, by:  Respecting human rights in our organisation and supply chain  Respecting labour organisation principles  Meeting health and safety regulations  Creating a safe, participatory and inclusive workplace  Banning any discrimination in respect of employment and occupation  Considering diversity as an opportunity and meritocracy as a must Planet, by:  Meeting environment al protection regulations  Increasing energy efficiency  Reducing CO emissions  Minimising and mitigating any environmental impacts  Creating value in local communities  Sharing social values with our stakeholders Innovation, by:  Promoting research and sustainability-driven projects and services  Delivering innovative solutions to our stakeholders  Offering services that support customers in generating positive environmental and social impacts through their projects and businesses 28 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Governance Highlights 2019  Sustainability Working Group formally established  Revision of the Code of Ethics  New Integrity Course developed  Code of Ethics signed by 100% of suppliers  Zero complaints concerning breaches of customer data privacy  Due diligence carried out on 5,600 third party partners  New Compliance Helpline (to be launched in early 2020)  CEO’s Call To Action signed RINA Compliance Programme On 12 December 2012, the Board of Directors of RINA S.p.A. adopted the RINA Compliance Programme and Principles to meet the IFIA Compliance Code (3rd edition). Changes in the Organisation and the issue of the Fourth Edition of the Code have paved the way for a profound revision of the RINA Compliance Programme. RINA has confirmed its commitment to implementing the TIC (Testing, Inspection and Certification) Council Compliance Code with the adoption, publication and implementation of the “RINA Compliance Programme”, which has been approved by the Board of Directors. With the Compliance Programme, RINA provides guidance on appropriate conduct by employees and collaborators in order to uphold the company’s image of propriety, high standing and good reputation. These characteristics adhere to the TIC Council Code and Principles, and have always been integral to the culture of the group. The RINA Compliance Programme is publicly available on the RINA website. RINA’s reputation as an independent service provider relies upon its open and honest relationship with customers and stakeholders. To preserve these relationships, we are committed to the highest standards of professional behavior. RINA’s culture is built on fundamental principles that are transmitted to all employees and stakeholders: Integrity, Impartiality, Confidentiality and Data Protection, Anti-Bribery, Fair Business Conduct, Health and Safety and Fair Labour. These are encompassed in RINA’s policies, guidelines, and procedures. References to the principles may be found in the following documents:  RINA’s Code of Ethics  RINA S.p.A.’s Organizational, Management and Control Model  RINA’s Organizational and Data Protection Model  RINA’s Anti-bribery Guidelines  RINA’s Guidelines on Impartiality  RINA’s General Policy on Company Data Protection  RINA’s Environmental Health and Safety Policy  RINA’s Policy on Human Rights  RINA’s Risk Management Policy 29 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 RINA has appointed a Director of Corporate Compliance, who, among other activities, is responsible for developing all policies and procedures for the successful implementation of the RINA Compliance Program in accordance with the TIC Council Compliance Code and its Principles. This is carried out in coordination with the relevant Organizational Units of the Group. The Director of Corporate Compliance reports to the Chief Risk Officer and reports to the Corporate Compliance Board. Impartiality RINA manages potential conflicts of interest through:  The strict separation of duties between the governing bodies, i.e. there are no common members in the holding and sub-holding companies, or between the sub-holdings  The establishment of a compliance unit for each business area, dealing with, inter alia, the management of impartiality and reporting functionally to the Corporate Chief Risk & Compliance Officer  The Corporate Chief Risk & Compliance Officer, who is responsible for supervising RINA authorizations, notifications and accreditations, and RINA management system certifications. In addition, the Officer is responsible for identifying, assessing and managing strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks (including impartiality risks) associated with RINA activities. The risk control system for impartiality threats in the RINA Group is principally based on the following:  The Corporate Compliance Board (CCB), which is responsible for:  Supervising the compliance of sub-holding companies’ activities with the requirements of impartiality, integrity, confidentiality, fair marketing and anti-bribery  Defining, and continuously updating and disseminating working instruments (policies, methodologies, procedures, instructions, guidelines, etc.) relating to the management of impartiality risk arising from regulations, activities and relationships  Providing advice on specific unresolved escalating situations of potential conflict of interest as reported by the Chief Risk & Compliance Officer or other functions and/or committees of the holding and sub-holding companies  Monitoring and periodically reviewing the implementation of the TIC Council compliance principles and the Compliance Programme  The Impartiality Risk Assessment Report, which consists of a main text and an addendum for each of RINA’s services business, and which aims is to identify any impartiality threats to the companies in the Group operating in the TIC sector  The Safeguarding Impartiality Board (RINA Services), which was established to ensure that activities carried out by RINA Services and all its controlled companies are in compliance with impartiality, integrity, confidentiality and fair marketing principles  The Committee for Safeguarding Impartiality (RINA Services, Agroqualità and foreign companies reporting to RINA Services), which was established to guarantee the impartiality of activities from bias and to allow the participation of all the entities significantly involved in such activities Anti-Bribery RINA rejects all forms of corruption as a means of conducting business, whether active or passive or in the public or private sector. Under no circumstances is conduct permitted whereby a person offers or accepts, directly or through intermediaries, money, gifts or promises or in any way obtains an advantage of any kind in order to perform, omit to perform, or delay an action that falls within the scope of their duties, or in order to carry out or obtain undue services for themselves or for RINA. The general principles that govern our internal control systems and risk management against bribery and corruption include:  Separation of functions: company activity should be carried out in accordance with the principle of separation of functions, so that the personnel responsible for authorizing an operation are different from those operatively carrying out or controlling such activity 30 RINA Sustainability Report 2019  The delegation of authorization powers and signature should be in line with the assigned organization and management responsibilities within the company, and clearly defined and known. Roles which have the authority to commit the company to specific operations should be well defined, and the limits and nature of their authorization specified  Each task should be transparent and traceable, and in turn should be verifiable, suitably documented, and correctly filed  Internal rules should be in place which are consistent with the services undertaken and complexity of the organization, ensuring the necessary controls and preventing the occurrence of corruption  Specific training programs should be provided to all personnel (employees and consultants) on the anti-corruption measures adopted by RINA group Fair Business Conduct RINA is committed to act in a fair and transparent manner in its business relations and dealings, conducting itself with a sense of responsibility and good faith. We operate in compliance with the highest standards of ethics and business integrity, rejecting any activity that may contravene contractual obligations and the principles of propriety. We recognise that free and fair competition is a fundamental element in the development of business activities. RINA therefore complies with antitrust regulations and applicable tender procedures. It operates in accordance with the rules of fair competition, refraining from acts or behaviour contrary to free and fair competition. In this spirit, RINA prohibits all forms of industrial espionage against competitors. Misleading individuals or entities operating in the market, in particular through statements and assessments of services offered directly or by third parties, is considered unacceptable behaviour. Internal Audits RINA carries out internal (quality) and administrative audits at regular intervals for each of the RINA Group’s companies and locations according to a defined programme. These are carried out by qualified auditors and also verify the implementation of the Compliance Programme within the whole RINA organization. The TIC Council Guidance Checklist for Members’ Internal Compliance Audits is used as reference guide. Findings of non-compliance are reported to the Director of Corporate Compliance, who will in turn send a summary report to the Corporate Compliance Board. External Audits The TIC Council Compliance Code addresses technical as well as professional conduct and ethics in relation to the following aspects: integrity, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, anti-corruption and fair competition. RINA appointed PWC to perform its third-party compliance audits, and it confirmed that the 2019 RINA Compliance Programme and Principles comply with the TIC Council Compliance Code. RINA has been reconfirmed as eligible for TIC Council membership. Integrity Independent Audits Each year an examination is conducted into the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation of Compliance Programme by an external independent auditing company, as appointed by the Director of Corporate Compliance. The external audit programme covers all RINA companies and locations, RINA management systems, and relevant documentation in each location. It is based on an assessment of conformity risk and complexity, and the particularities of the RINA group. In 2019, an independent report confirmed RINA’s compliance with the requirements stated in the TIC Council Compliance Code. 31 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 New compliance helpline Employees may obtain guidance on any question or matter of concern relating to the implementation or interpretation of the Compliance Programme by enquiring with their Line manager. In addition, a dedicated Corporate Compliance Helpline is available which is managed by the Director of Corporate Compliance, who may be contacted via email (compliance-helpline@rina.org) or phone (number available on RINA portal). Employees are also encouraged to suggest, via the Helpline, improvements to RINA’s Compliance Programme. Whistleblowing RINA has established dedicated channels to facilitate information flow regarding any potential misconduct observed by employees. In 2017, we adopted a whistleblowing platform to enhance our existing channels of communication for reporting alleged violations. These might involve violations of the RINA Ethical Code, the Organisational Model pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/2001, internal policies and procedures, current laws and regulations, or good business practices. The platform is publicly accessible on the RINA website, together with information about the procedure. During 2019, the whistleblowing platform was maintained, and information about its aims and use was made available to all employees. The software of the whistleblowing platform is continually being reviewed by the Hermes Center for Transparence and Digital Human Rights to improve user performance, and above all to ensure the protection of the reporting agent’s right to privacy, as set out in the latest EU directives (Directive EU 16 April 2019 on whistleblowing). Since the adoption of the whistleblowing platform, it has quickly become the most used notification channel: in the last two years, 67% of whistleblowing-related reports have been received through the platform, versus 33% from other communication tools. In light of this trend, and in order to ensure the best dialogue with users, RINA recently decided to adopt the whistleblowing platform as its sole official reporting channel, and has updated its Model of Organization, Management and Control pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001 (revision 5 in force since 11 September 2019) accordingly. In its first period of implementation, the whistleblowing platform was used mainly by foreign users (87% of reports were received from countries other than Italy), and mainly by RINA employees (75%), with a minority from consultants (25%). The overwhelming majority of reports, 80%, were received in open modality i.e. signed by the whistleblower. Just 20% were received anonymously. We can report that the goal of the whistleblowing platform has been well understood by users, since 75% of the reports received were relevant for the purpose of the instrument, compared with just 25% of cases of improper use. The whistleblowing platform can be used whenever a risk is identified that could damage clients, employees, shareholders, the public or the reputation of the company. The whistleblowing platform is accessible at the RINA website (https://www.rina.org/en/whistleblowing). Messages may be either signed or anonymous. When sending the report, a ticket is issued that allows the complainant to return to the portal and monitor the progress. Keep a note of the ticket! Why you should report. Because it is a right and a duty to protect the company, colleagues, clients, suppliers and collaborators. What you should report. Alleged violations, perpetrated by internal staff, collaborators, clients and business partners, which refer to the following: Current laws and regulations, Code of Ethics, Organizational Model pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/2001, company policies, internal procedures, standards, good business practices. The whistleblowing platform enables reporters to upload evidence of violations. Who receives the messages. Reports are handled by the Corporate Internal Audit Director of RINA S.p.A. 32 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Whistleblower protection. RINA undertakes to protect reporters against any intimidation and retaliation. Protection of reporters. During the internal investigation, the rights of the reported party are guaranteed, and in no instance will a procedure be initiated solely due to the report, in the absence of concrete findings regarding its content. Revision of the Code of Ethics A new revision of the Code of Ethics was published in April 2019 in recognition of recent legislation and to further meet stakeholder expectations. In 2018, RINA contributed to a Business Integrity Forum (BIF) research project and the development of a Transparency Index. We achieved a positive evaluation in this index but regardless moved to further enhance performance in this area as part of our policy of continuous improvement. Updating our Code of Ethics was an important element in this plan. In the revision, we have now included a more comprehensive set of information, which is addressed to internal and external stakeholders. Dissemination of the Code of Ethics The Code of Ethics is available to all employees through the RINA intranet portal. In Italy, prior to recruitment, all employees receive a list of the documentation that they are required to read which includes the Code of Ethics and Conduct. This document must be signed by future employees. Meanwhile, 70% of employees hired at group companies based abroad have agreed to full acceptance of the principles of the Code of Ethics in their employment contracts. Integrity training for employees All employees have been provided with mandatory training tools concerning the anti-corruption control model, together with anti-corruption guidelines. Following the development of an in-depth course on impartiality in 2018, we continued to develop this in even greater detail in 2019 for all employees. In 2019, an integrity course, based on the revised Code of Ethics was also developed. This training is scheduled to be launched as an online course on the dedicated RINA e-learning platform in early 2020. Data Protection In this digital age, RINA takes its duty to protect personal data extremely seriously and is committed to having safeguards in place to ensure that personal information is collected and used in the appropriate way. Keeping personal data confidential and secure can also help prevent human rights violations by protecting vulnerable individuals and communities. If misused, personal information can put people at risk. Sharing sensitive personal data, such as race, religious or medical data, could lead to discrimination. For these and other reasons, RINA undertakes to protect and avoid improper use of information relating to its own personnel and third parties, however this information is generated or acquired. Such data is of fundamental value to the company and must be managed by all personnel in compliance with the principles and procedures adopted. It must only be made available to users, both internal and external to the company, who have a legitimate right to access it, by virtue of their involvement in specific company processes. To properly manage the protection of personal data, RINA regularly surveys its Organizational and Data Protection Model in 2019 according to the EU General Data Protection Regulation No.2016/679 (GDPR), deploying further the principles set down in the law. An independent auditing firm was retained to perform the 2019 audit plan, and found no major non conformities. 33 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Among the ‘near-misses’ analysed in 2019, there were no substantiated complaints concerning any personal data breach in any category of data subjects. Meanwhile, after launching an awareness campaign on the subject, more than 80% of the personnel enrolled subsequently attended an e-learning course. Privacy binding corporate rules summary Third-party due diligence RINA has opted to enhance its control measures for third parties with which it has established business relationships. The aim is to reduce operational, reputational and security risks, and to comply with national and international standards regarding money laundering and corruption. In late 2017, the Risk Management and Audit Committee reaffirmed its recommendation to develop a third-party due diligence process within the company related to anti-bribery and anti-money laundering regulations as a qualifying element. In line with this indication, a six-month Pilot Programme on Third Party Due Diligence was launched in 2018. The pilot programme focused on selected case studies, clients and candidates connected to potentially high-risk countries, which were identified through a set of Key Risk Indicators. Overall, 1,831 verifications were carried out as part of the Pilot Programme, which was extended until March 2019. In 2019, the Risk Management and Audit Committee favourably examined the results of the Pilot Programme and consequently a permanent third-party verification process has been implemented in RINA. The aim is to check counterparties related to a number of jurisdictions selected on the basis of specific Key Risk Indicators (sanctions, security, corruption, credit, business strategy). In 2019, over 5,600 compliance and security checks were carried out. Renewed collaboration with the Business Integrity Forum Transparency International Italy In early 2017, RINA joined Transparency International Italy’s Business Integrity Forum (BIF) to support voluntary anti-corruption initiatives. We are actively engaged in the initiatives promoted and developed within this forum. Examples include: the Business Integrity Toolkit for small enterprises; advocacy and awareness campaigns via social media; dedicated events for institutional and private-sector stakeholders looking at the role of integrity as a driver of prosperity in local communities; research; and the yearly BIF National Event held in November in Milan. Speaker at international integrity events In December 2019, RINA shared its results and experience in the field of anti-corruption at an event held in London, UK, organised by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Transparency International, and the Italian Embassy in London. CEO Call to Action for a New Deal for Europe The CEO Call to Action for a New Deal for Europe is an appeal made by CSR Europe to CEOs of all companies and industry sectors in Europe to accelerate sustainable growth, tackle climate change and work towards creating inclusive prosperity. RINA has been among the first 50 Italian companies to answer to the appeal, which was launched by CSR Europe in consultation with the European Commission at the occasion of the Brussels SDG Summit of 7 May, 2019. Participating in this important initiative, RINA reaffirmed its commitment to having an active dialogue with its stakeholders, and pursuing a model of sustainable development in line with the UN’s Agenda 2030. The CEO Call to Action was promoted in Italy by Foundation Sodalitas, the national partner organization of CSR Europe, of which RINA has been a member since 2016. 34 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 People Highlights 2019  Male employee turnover 10.4%  Female employee turnover 8.7 %  Nearly 60% of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements  Almost 90% of employees assigned work objectives  Around 21,000 hours of e-learning courses completed  Nearly 5,000 courses on managerial skills provided  More than 90,000 hours of training provided  More than €1,250,000 distributed in employee bonuses in Italy through a welfare platform  More than 44,000 hours of commuting time saved in Italy  New Diversity and Inclusion Policy launched  Workforce composition: 69% male and 31% female  100% suppliers qualified on the basis of ethical and social policies  20 security risk assessments carried out for 20 major RINA projects  102 business trips assessed  RINA Safety Day held on 28 April  Safety Driving Course: 937 attendees for e-learning course, 30 attendees for practical training course Fair employment and remuneration At RINA, our workforce is a valuable asset and we work to maintain a constructive approach to the management of employees throughout the organisation worldwide. Work contracts are applied in line with local labour regulations, according to overarching company guidelines as defined by the Corporate Human Resources department, and implemented by local Human Resources managers. We co-operate regularly with trade unions to help address and solve any issues that arise. Appropriate employment policies are set out that provide information regarding workers’ rights under the national labour and employment laws. All of our practices reflect a groupwide culture aimed at valuing individual capabilities and potential. Our practices reflect our long experience as a Social Accountability certification body. Our reputation as an employer benefits from our efforts to encourage positive relationships with employees, and follow international standards on working conditions. The remuneration policy is aimed at attracting and retaining the best talent by ensuring internal pay equity and external competitiveness in terms of compensation packages. In terms of total reward, additional compensation beyond the salary takes into consideration the needs of staff members and their work-life balance. This includes a smart working policy, healthcare assistance, and a range of benefits (accident insurance, tax assistance, scholarships for employees’ children, discount schemes with selected third-party providers, etc.) tailored to the country and the type of contract applied. 35 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 In 2019, the new RINA Italian Collective Agreement was applied for the first time. All staff employed in RINA’s main companies in Italy are now employed under this collective agreement, which has been approved and endorsed by the relevant trade unions. The new contract allows more employees to benefit from innovative welfare policies such as excellent health insurance for employees and their families, and seeks to increase motivation through a productivity bonus for all staff. Total reward strategy As part of a philosophy of ‘total reward’, we are developing a corporate compensation strategy which aims to better tailor benefits according to people’s needs and interests. This strategy will be developed based on benchmarking at local level, which will verify any gaps with the standard benefits offered by our competitors. This task will be achieved at a corporate level, and we will start by mapping the benefits in each region where we operate. As a participant in the market, we understand that our reward strategy plays a fundamental role in our success. A solid reward policy encourages better performance and therefore growth and also reinforces corporate strategy. Employees covered by collective bargainingg agreements 52% of the group’s employees are employed in Italy. All employees have an employment contract regulated by Italian law, and each employee is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The remaining 48% of the group’s employees are employed in the rest of the world where, in the majority of cases, there are not collective bargaining agreements in place. In such cases, our staff’s employment contracts are regulated by local labour regulations. Overall, 9% of the group’s employees outside Italy are covered by local collective bargaining agreements. Welfare You@rina We strongly believe in the importance of communication and sharing information. As part of this effort, we will launch a new digital workspace in 2020. Before the new digital workspace is launched, we have revised the “Office Personnel” section of the existing site. Here, the design has been refreshed, while the content and documents have been re-organized in a more structured and accessible way in order to guarantee a better user experience. Employees will be able to access all the services and information needed through a digital map on the internal site. Content will be adapted according to the services provided by RINA in each country, and according to local legal requirements. Welfare distributed In 2019, €1,256,298 was spent on welfare by the company’s Italian operations, of which €358,684 was used to offer, among other things, vouchers to buy gym, holiday and travel passes, plus subscriptions to cinema tickets, magazines and newspapers. Diversity and Inclusion RINA has published a Diversity and Inclusion Policy. This affirms our commitment to creating an environment of inclusivity which promotes the fair and equal treatment of all our employees during their time with the business. The policy’s principles strive to exceed the minimum standards set by current equality legislation. RINA recognises that a diverse culture encourages new ideas and innovation, and that procedures to manage equality, diversity and inclusion should be at the core of every aspect of the business, from recruitment and selection all the way through the employee’s life cycle with the company, in order that everybody can contribute. 36 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 The composition of the workforce by gender is: MALE FEMALE RINA TOTAL 69% 31% Breakdown: MALE FEMALE TECHNICAL CAREER STREAM 79% 21% BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CAREER STREAM 75% 25% BACK OFFICE PROFESSIONALS CAREER STREAM 31% 69% MANAGERS CAREER STREAM 79% 21% RINA has a higher percentage of male personnel working for the company overall, and this is particularly evident in the technical, business development and managerial career streams. Female personnel are largely working in back office roles. The statistics for the gender split are typical of technical companies and also apply to many of our competitors. Examination of the situation reveals that more males in society study for the required technical qualifications that we typically seek for our technical roles e.g surveyor, engineer and inspector. As a result, they appear more frequently in the application pool for technical roles that require specific qualifications. The number of female personnel in technical roles reflects the percentage of females in the application pool. However, it is recognised by RINA and other technical companies that there are wider societal reasons for this gender split, and that managing change in this area will involve a long-term effort, including encouraging more school age girls to consider studies and careers in science and technical subjects. Schools, colleges, parents and companies like RINA have a role to play in attracting more girls into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) careers. RINA’s Diversity and Inclusion strategy is aimed at attracting more women into technical and managerial roles in order to have a more diverse mix of talent in the workplace. We also recognise that a continuing review of all stages of the employee experience is necessary to ensure that unconscious bias in the workplace is properly managed. The composition of the workforce by age (generation) is: GENERATION % SILENT GENERATION (1925-1945) 0.2 BABY BOOMERS (1946-1964) 13.0 GENERATION X (1965-1979) 42.8 MILLENNIALS (1980-2000) 44.0 GENERATION Z (2001TODAY) 0.0 RINA acknowledges the different generations in the workforce, not only by identifying their differing needs and motivations but also what they can offer to the business. 37 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 The composition of employees by nationality is: NATIONALITY % ITALY 55.0 UK 6.0 INDIA 3.5 CHINA 3.0 BRAZIL 2.9 ROMANIA 2.9 TUNISIA 2.9 EGYPT 2.4 UNITED STATES 2.0 51 OTHER COUNTRIES 19.4 At this time, we have limited or no data on the breakdown of race, religion, sexual orientation and disability at the company. During 2020, RINA will look to increase its understanding of the composition of the company, and will launch a number of initiatives to manage unconscious bias and manage diversity and inclusion. The work to manage unconscious bias, as well as have better criteria and objective data for decisions affecting career progression, has already begun with the development of a myCareer Framework of job roles used in RINA and a competency framework that describes the criteria for each role. This will give us clarity, consistency and transparency. In 2020, the RINAppraisALL has been launched using competency profiles to evaluate performance. This approach will be used for recruitment, selection, training and development and is under continuing review and improvement. Global employee turnover Male employee turnover 10.4% (versus 11.0% in 2018) Female employee turnover 8.7 % (versus 7.9% in 2018) Recruiting strategy In the last quarter of 2019, we finalised the Corporate General Procedure relating to Recruitment and Selection which will be applied worldwide in the company from 2020. The aim is to define the general criteria and operating procedures to be used in managing the search for personnel and the selection process in the RINA companies, field personnel included. 38 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Training and skills development Our training initiatives and programmes cover both technical and managerial competencies, and are an integral part of our policy on human resources management. Training initiatives aim to:  Promote and increase competencies and behaviours in line with business needs  Nurture personal and professional growth in order to ensure a sustainable and appropriate operational workload in the long term E-learning is a proven training methodology that has been successfully used within RINA since 2006. In 2019, we further increased the use of our e-learning system by adding new functions and sector-specific training modules, such as a new set of courses on governance and compliance. We also introduced a specific e-learning course on travel risks and IT security. Around 21,000 hours of e-learning courses were made available globally in 2019. In addition to e-learning, in 2019 nearly 5,000 hours of managerial skills courses and individual coaching sessions with managers and team leaders were provided on topics including team management and leadership, conducting feedback interviews, and coaching demotivated employees. At the end of 2019, we launched the first cycle of our People Management Academy. This learning path was dedicated to enabling managers to reflect on their managerial capabilities. To make the RINA People Strategy a success, it is paramount that managers are brought on board in order to: ensure that managers are responsible for employee development and act as strong role models; create connections between managers and between management teams and Human Resources; to collect feedback in order to deploy and improve the tools of the induction programme ‘People Journey’; and to improve engagement and satisfaction among both managers and employees. The 2019 cycle of the People Management Academy will finish at the beginning of February 2020. After the end of the third module, we will launch a survey in order to assess the full learning path. A new cycle of the People Management Academy will be launched in Q4 2020. Social competencies were an important focus in 2019, with courses on topics such as communication, negotiation, and relationships with clients and colleagues. In 2019, we delivered more than 90,000 hours of training worldwide. This is equivalent to an average 24 hours of training per person, in addition to time spent on e-learning courses. For 2020, our target is to further increase our capacity to deliver e-learning training courses to our personnel worldwide, with new topics, additional learning tools and dynamic monitoring of progress. In addition, we will reinforce our people strategy by focusing on programmes and processes to improve human performance at all levels of the organisation and to ensure we have the right culture and environment to attract, retain and develop the best people. As part of our goals in building an effective learning strategy, in 2019 we significantly expanded and improved our Learning Management System (LMS) platform. One of the main objectives achieved was the introduction into the platform of some 250 e-learning courses on soft skills. Soft skills are a key part of achieving a peaceful and harmonious work environment. Investing in soft skills means investing in our people, in the quality of our work environment, and consequently in productivity. In 2019, we improved the user experience of the platform by enhancing reporting and the system integration. We are now working to respond to the increasing demand for mobile capabilities. In 2020, we will release the GoLearn application to all our employees, which empowers learners to access learning content anywhere, anytime directly from their own mobile devices. We believe that the impact of our soft skills training can already be seen after the release of these e-learning courses on our DOCEBO platform. In terms of social sustainability, the long-term impact will be increasingly visible in the future quality of teamworking and productivity. As part of the development of projects within the Corporate Human Capital Development function, we have also created a new employee induction programme to ensure coherence and alignment with the company’s overall people strategy, and in order to reinforce the importance of Human Resources in the company. During the third quarter of 2019, a pilot induction scheme was launched in three countries (UK, Romania and Turkey) with a view to subsequent full implementation across the company at the end of 2020. This will be carried out in four waves (one wave per quarter), with Italy as the last pilot country. In the first quarter of 2020, we launched a survey of the inductees and managers taking part in the pilot programme in the first three countries, in order to monitor its results. 39 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Training initiatives In 2019, we designed a motivational operational training programme which took place in Lisbon (Portugal). The objective of this learning path was to develop and strengthen the role of the Surveyors, Project Managers and Auditors within the business, helping them understand what their role is, how it fits in with organizational goals, and how to manage people. The aim of this storytelling project was to increase awareness about the importance of the role in the company, in the process energizing staff and increasing motivation. In the context of career development, we also designed a new training course called “New People Manager Empowerment & Mentorship” aimed at staff members who have moved from professional positions to more managerial roles. We created a training path to foster the potential of a group of individual surveyors in order to develop key competencies. The path focused on elements such as strategic thinking, people management, leadership and time management. We launched an initial pilot phase of this training course in the second half of 2019. The path also included several more technical issues such as administration, budget and management control, to provide a rounded set of skills for the modern manager. In 2020, we will create another managerial learning path called Change Management dedicated to first line managers and their direct reports within RINA’s Corporate Staff (HR, Communication, Administration & Finance and IT). The objectives of this initiative are to raise awareness among managers of the developments taking place at the company, enabling them to become promoters of change. In this way, managers can assist their staff in overcoming resistance to change, acquire tools and methods to proactively embrace change and pass these methods onto their collaborators. Around 100 people will be involved in the learning path, divided into 3 groups and with two days of training foreseen for each group. In 2020, we will also create a “storytelling project” following the example of the “Lisbon city training” in 2019 for about 30 people belonging to a new team, Marine Business Development (a mixed group, with most coming from outside Italy). This two-day city training will be split between Milan and Genoa with the objective of reinforcing RINA’s brand and bringing an awareness of the high potential for business development in this new team. The aim is to create a common identity and to reinforce team building at a time of high digital transformation and innovation at the company. Meanwhile, six months after the “New People Manager Empowerment & Mentoring” training in 2019, we will hold a follow-up training session in 2020 for the Hi-Po (high potential) surveyors involved. This one-day training will be entirely dedicated to bringing mentors and mentees together. Our aim is to assess and carefully evaluate the impact of the initial training, in order to measure the efficacy of the learning path with an eye on offering it to other high potential employees in the company in future. Performance management RINA has designed an integrated approach to careers and performance based on the following principles:  Transparency: employees will be measured against a global profile, in order to know clearly what is expected from them  Responsibility: our new evaluation system allows each RINA employee to play an active role in the process; they will have more ownership of their own performance by means of self-evaluation  Feedback culture: to encourage more interaction between staff, we have created the Mid-Year-Review step. This will provide employees with an initial feedback on their performance, and lay the groundwork for the final evaluation which will include an element of crowdsourcing, that is, managers will have the option to involve other managers in evaluating competences of employees in their team With this new strategy of managing and evaluating staff, based on a feedback-culture approach and using an innovative digital tool, we achieved excellent results in 2019. This was demonstrated by the fact that around 90% of employees with objectives assigned received performance appraisals. We strongly believe that organizations with a feedback culture succeed in investing in talent, rather than exploiting it. Incorporating feedback into the company culture greatly enhances employee engagement, a key goal for RINA. The new evaluation system, together with precise definitions of roles and a framework of competencies that back up the roles, will positively impact motivation and engagement. We believe it will also increase managers’ empowerment, handling capabilities and communication with their team members, as well as significantly increase employee satisfaction and bring more opportunities for career development. 40 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Talent management Talent Management Program We consider talent a key driver for the company, and strive to identify exceptional talent within the company. Following the evaluation process, those employees identified as high potential will enter into a talent management program, which in turn will provide customized training and development paths. In 2020, we will further strive to enhance our human capital by combining professional objectives and the results of competency tests. Close analysis of this data will enable us to map high potential employees. Graduate Program In 2020, RINA will launch a new Graduate Programme, an excellent new initiative aimed at increasing attraction rates to the company. Such programmes are one of the most effective methods of recruiting high-flying graduates who are eager to progress, and aspire to leadership positions. Under the programme, one graduate will be taken for each business area for a period of 24 months. Each graduate will be given three rotations, with at least one taking place outside Italy, in order to experience different departments and gain experience in a range of functions. At the end of the programme, an assessment will be carried out to measure competences and, based on the business need, define a potential role in RINA. This project is aimed at identifying the best new graduates on the market, and will be launched as a pilot scheme in Italy in 2020. Job rotation Job rotation is one of several strategies in place to offer new challenges and continuous improvement to employees, while also bringing tangible benefits to the organization. Under this programme, employees have the possibility to work in different positions within the company. Job rotation can also help identify the best personnel for specific roles as their skills and competences are tested in different professional environments. Job rotation is not just about improving employee motivation and satisfaction. There are also many advantages for the organization in terms of productivity and appeal, while it can enable the company to unearth hidden talents. Job rotation is also a good springboard to improving team building across departments. The programme is part of a wider context of many initiatives aimed at guiding people through a professional development path that increases their skills, enhances their work experience, and brings career growth. Our people and their skills are the principal keys to our success and our advantage over our competitors, particularly in challenging market conditions. We believe job rotation can play a key role in achieving these goals. The project is enhanced with the use of Lean and Six Sigma methodologies, on which the programme is based. The job rotation programme will be implemented in 2020 through a pilot project involving several RINA business areas, including energy operation, industry and T&I consulting. Occupational Health and Safety Management System RINA considers Health and Safety issues a priority for all its employees and workplaces. To fulfil this commitment and comply with applicable legal requirements for Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), RINA has implemented several integrated Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Management Systems which apply to its companies. A set of RINA Corporate OHS documents will be issued in 2020 in order to achieve the same Health and Safety level across all our worldwide companies. In the interim, a Health & Safety Audit Plan will be started which will include a certain number of RINA companies worldwide. Every Health and Safety Risk Assessment is performed according to the new criteria identified at Corporate level. All employees can participate, through their Worker Safety Representatives, in activities related to the Risk Assessment and Management System in order to identify hazards and mitigate the associated risks. Every work-related injury is recorded in order to investigate, identify the root causes and take appropriate measures to prevent similar cases in the future. All records and actions are managed in the OHS Management Systems. In 2020, we will introduce a specific tool to automatically receive notification in case of Accident; this will enable us to record a RINA Worldwide OHS Accident rate and log all accident Investigation evidence. In order to increase awareness of OHS matters and work-related risks, all employees are required to attend mandatory Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) training. The training modules, delivered both via e-learning and in a classroom setting, cover basic OHS and task-specific subjects. Employees also have easy access to key information about the OHS Risk Assessment and Management System through the RINA portal. 41 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 RINA Safety Day The 4th RINA Safety Day was held on 28 April 2019. The aim was to raise employee awareness of the importance of “near miss” reporting. This is due to the fact that reporting a near miss today can prevent an injury tomorrow! Please help RINA to help you! Safety driving course A specific e-learning module on safe driving was developed in 2019 and will continue to be mandatory for all new employees. A further practical driving course was given to those employees driving more than a specific amount of kilometres each year. Some 937 employees and partners attended our e-learning module, while 30 took part in practical training. Improving security for our people In line with internationally recognized duty of care principles, RINA considers the safety and security of people and corporate assets a priority. In 2019, we worked on several programmes implementing measures to continuously improve security controls and to increase security awareness at the Group level. During the year, the Business Travel Risk Management Programme, which was first introduced in 2015, was consolidated and further developed. The aim is to manage security and health and safety risks related to overseas business travel by RINA employees. All RINA employees have access to a special travel intelligence platform to identify any security risks linked to specific destinations, and to note security advice. In the event of an emergency during a business trip, a 24/7 Assistance Centre is available for support and advice on medical and security issues. The tool includes a mobile application that supports trip planning, keeps employees continuously informed about security incidents through an alert system, and enables on-demand assistance if needed. Every business trip to a highor very high-risk destination is specifically assessed by the Health, Safety and Environment and Security functions, in order to ensure that mitigation measures are implemented to lower the risk and ensure the safety of our employees. In 2019, a total of 102 business trips involving 126 employees were assessed for their security risk. Furthermore, security risk assessments were carried out for 20 major projects worldwide. The Asset Physical Security Programme was also launched. This application maps all RINA sites worldwide with their linked employees, and four site security risk assessments have been carried out. Meanwhile, a new office headquarters for RINA Consulting has been developed in Genoa which will group together employees previously spread over four offices in the city. For this new strategic office, security controls have been carefully implemented to ensure a secure environment for RINA employees and operations. Finally, several initiatives were also taken in order to enhance security awareness in the Group. These include:  The publication of Guidelines for Personal Security, providing employees with best practices to prevent and overcome security events  A periodical worldwide security bulletin was distributed to provide all employees with up-to-date information on political and security developments worldwide  Specialized awareness and training was provided for the company’s Mail Office Supplier Qualification A revision of the General Procedure for the Qualification of Suppliers was issued in November 2019, and a new revision is underway which will aim to simplify the process in light of the difficulties encountered in the various countries in applying the first one. The primary objective is to homogenize not only the process but also the approach adopted in each country, and therefore to standardize activities and strengthen control and governance at a Corporate level. 42 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 The underlying criteria have not been changed compared to the original procedure, providing for:  An assessment of the moral suitability requirements, in compliance with the laws and regulations in force  Recognition of the RINA Code of Ethics  Recognition of the Corporate Privacy Policy  Regulation with obligations concerning social security, health and safety at work, and insurance cover  Regulation with the obligation to pay social security, welfare and insurance contributions  Future regulation, to be shortly introduced, with the obligation to pay fees as per new procurement law provisions The assessment shall be based on the information produced by the candidate supplier. If this verification process is unsuccessful, the supplier will be required to implement corrective measures to meet the qualification requirements, otherwise it will not be admitted to the RINA Register. The quality of supplier qualification is monitored in accordance with specific additional Key Performance Indicators:  The total number of new suppliers registered within one year  The percentage of suppliers that have received: continuous positive assessment, a temporary suspension, a negative assessment  The percentage of unqualified suppliers  The adequacy of documents and evidence collected during the qualification process To meet the requirements of our Enterprise Risk Management structure, the qualification process has been developed to be applied worldwide by all RINA companies, taking into account local regulations and in compliance with the guidelines provided at Corporate level. All service providers are required to read the group’s Code of Ethics on the company portal (made available to them via a link) and apply it in 100% of cases. From 2020 onwards, particular attention will be paid to the environmental impact aspects for all suppliers tendering for service contracts, and this will be considered one of the criteria in awarding the contract. Human rights and the supply chain RINA is actively improving its human rights impact assessment in order to identify and adequately address actual and potential negative impacts on human rights. RINA’s suppliers are mainly consultants, professionals and suppliers of goods and services. Although the level of potential risk identified in our supply chain is very low, we are continuously improving our qualification process to take social and human rights aspects into account. Through internal due diligence, we have identified opportunities for improvement in our supplier qualification process. In line with the consolidated qualification process implemented for RINA companies in Italy, which covers both technical and administrative aspects, suppliers undertake to carry out their activities in compliance with the principles set out in the RINA Code of Ethics, and to declare any proceedings or judgments relating to child labour and other forms of trafficking and exploitation of human beings. The original procedure and its subsequent revisions are designed to harmonize our approach, standardize activities and strengthen control. 43 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Planet Highlights 2019  3 Environmental Projects launched: 1. Plastic free: in Genoa: 40,000 plastic bottles equivalent to 1,000 kg of plastic saved per year; 2,600 kg of CO2 emissions averted, corresponding to the annual absorption capacity of almost 3 acres of forest (more than 1 hectare). 2. Renewable energy: expected reduction of around 3,500 tons CO2 emissions per year, corresponding to the annual absorption capacity of around 1,300 hectares of forest. 3. Paperless: 15 tons of paper saved yearly and 15,000 kg of CO2 emissions averted, corresponding to the annual absorption of about 6.5 hectares of forest.  241 tons of CO2 emissions saved as a result of reductions in commuting in Italy  Nearly €100,000 donated to support NGO projects and local communities Monitoring our natural resource consumption and reducing our carbon footprint are our top priorities in the effort to minimize the environmental impact of our operations, as set out in RINA’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy. Within the Sustainability Working Group, the following environmental projects have been launched in 2019:  Plastic Free Project  Renewable Energy Project  Paperless Project These 3 projects share several common goals:  To support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals  To enhance and confirm RINA as a sustainable brand  To engage with RINA employees, promoting responsible behaviour both on and off RINA’s premises Plastic Free Project RINA is working to reduce its plastic consumption and contribute, in this field, to the achievement of the ambitions of the UN SDG 12, Target 12.5, that declares: “By 2030, substantially reduce waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse”. In 2019, we developed a comprehensive plan to ban the single use of plastic products, with specific reference to plastic bottles. We are currently extending our best practices to all our sites globally and taking the following global actions. 44 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 The principal initiatives planned are:  Reusable water bottles with RINA’s logo were distributed to around 50% of employees in December 2019. The distribution to all RINA employees was completed in February 2020  Each office will be provided, if it has not been already done, with water fountains or filtered taps according to a roadmap that will involve all offices by December 2021. Wherever the installation of water fountains or filtered taps is not feasible, recycled water jugs will be used to replace plastic bottles  Cups and scoops for coffee dispensers will be replaced with compostable items whenever feasible, thus anticipating the entering into force of the EU Directive 2019/904 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment. In addition, suppliers will be required to provide compostable dishes and glasses for catering needs  Plastic water bottles will no longer be present in vending machines. During training courses and meetings, recycled water jugs will be used, replacing plastic bottles As an example, the expected impact of the above measures at RINA’s Head Office in Genoa is:  40,000 plastic bottles saved per year  1,000 kg of plastic saved  2,600 kg of CO2 emissions saved, corresponding to an annual absorption capacity of almost 3 acres of forest (over 1 hectare) Renewable Energy Project We are working towards achieving the ambitions of UN SDG 7, target 7.2, by switching to renewables in the energy mix we use. Since 2012, all energy consumption in RINA’s headquarters in Genoa has come from electricity generated from renewables. This has been the first step towards achieving an energy supply from renewable sources. Since 2017, energy consumption in all our Italian offices, including lighting, air conditioning, heating and cooling, has been entirely supplied by certified renewable sources. In several other offices abroad, we are already using renewable energy. In order to continue to minimise and mitigate our environmental impact, including reducing our CO2 emissions, we have developed a plan to extend this best practice to all our sites globally. Together with other initiatives underway aimed at improving energy efficiency, the final goal is to achieve nearly zero emissions and source 100% of our energy needs from renewable energy by 2021. The expected impact is a reduction of around 3,500 tons in CO2 emissions per year, corresponding to the annual absorption capacity of around 1,300 hectares of forest. In order to pursue this goal, we will give priority to sourcing only from renewable energy where locally feasible and affordable. We plan to launch a communications campaign to inform all employees about the project, in the process raising awareness and asking for their co-operation when it comes to responsible behaviour. Paperless Project We are working towards achieving the goals of UN SDG 12 to reduce paper consumption and improve our paper processes. A programme to reduce paper consumption was started several years ago, using a range of initiatives. We have reduced the number of printers, and optimized set default configurations, including two-sided and gray scale printing; in the larger offices, we have implemented an authentication system for all the printers. In 2019, we developed a plan to extend this best practice to all our sites globally. 45 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 To achieve print reductions, we will carry out the following:  More print monitoring, enabling us to manage and assign print outputs on a per capita basis  Analysis of the reasons for significant print overruns  Wherever possible, the purchase of 70gsm paper instead of 80gsm, reducing the overall weight and volume of paper used  A communication campaign to inform all employees about the project, in the process raising awareness and asking for their co-operation when it comes to responsible behaviour The expected impact will be around 15 tons of paper saved yearly, equivalent to 15,000 kilograms of CO2 emissions, or an annual absorption capacity of about 6.5 hectares of forest. Sustainable mobility In 2019, the company again benefited from our global travel procedure which was implemented in 2017 and aimed at improving the management of all aspects relating to business trips, including health, safety and security, environmental impacts, and cost efficiency. The procedure applies to all RINA employees plus external consultants worldwide, and states that “all travellers are expected to exercise a duty of care from the point of view of their safety and security… [and] to make environmentally friendly decisions to the best of their ability”. In 2019, we implemented a new self-booking tool which allows individual users to buy their required services direct. The tool takes into account all the recommendations in the RINA travel procedure, and strongly encourages the use of train transportation rather than domestic, short-haul flights. Every year, our contracted travel agency provides an environmental report with details of carbon emissions per service type for the RINA companies based in Italy, which is then validated by LifeGate. The 2019 document reported 4,828,164 kg of global CO2 emissions, which is 4% lower than the 5,013,943 kg reported for 2018. Environmental Management System RINA’s operating companies utilize several Environmental Management Systems. No major non-conformities were raised in 2019 as a result of either external or internal audits. All minor findings, or opportunities for improvement, have been successfully addressed and closed. RINA has not been subject to any fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws and/or regulations. Support to local communities RINA is committed to delivering and supporting projects and initiatives aimed at creating social value. In 2019, RINA made donations totaling some €100,000 to charitable organisations and local communities as part of non-profit initiatives in compliance with its internal procedures. This does not include political endorsements. Our main charitable initiatives in Italy in 2019 included: New equipment for the Gaslini Children’s Hospital RINA and the Carige Foundation donated pediatric video-colonoscopy equipment, including new 3D imaging software, to support the doctors and healthcare professionals at the Gaslini Children’s Hospital in Genoa. This equipment will enhance the hospital’s current equipment and enable it to carry out more effective diagnoses and treatments. Donation to Istituto Don Bosco RINA, together with Ansaldo Energia and Fondazione Ansaldo, sponsored the renovation of the Autistic Centre, a socio-educational centre for children, young people and adults with autism, at the Don Bosco Institute in Genoa. Incubator for premature babies In 2019, RINA opted to donate funds raised for its employee Christmas party in Genoa to a charitable initiative instead. In doing so, employees were asked in an internal survey to vote for a charity initiative. Employees voted for the purchase of an incubator for premature babies for the Cicogna Sprint Onlus association. 46 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Other charitable initiatives to support local communities As in 2018, RINA offices were invited to donate the amount set aside for local Christmas parties to charitable organisations, in line with the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy. As a result, in 2019 we were able to support, among others, the following initiatives:  An organisation supporting children and adults with Rett Syndrome in Germany  An organisation supporting homeless people with employment, housing and wellbeing services in the UK. Case history India CSR project RINA strives to integrate social and environment concerns into its business processes. This includes providing solutions for sustainable developmental in developing regions by undertaking CSR projects. This includes, for example, creating the necessary infrastructure required for the promotion of education, health, sanitation, mobility, environmental issues etc. RINA is active in India, where it is committed to making a significant contribution towards societies in remote areas with difficult conditions. To aid development of these remote areas, RINA is implementing various CSR projects in and around several project sites. In 2019, we chose to help Keshav Srushti, a not-for-profit organization, to construct a community hall for locals in a village called Nihali. The hall will be used as a library, and for education and skills development. The operative phase will start in early 2020. 47 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Innovation Highlights 2019  New ISO 27001 compliant Information Security Management System  11 OPEX (Operational Excellence) Projects  68 employees trained and certified Green and Yellow belt under the OPEX project  1,117 employees regularly engaged in “smart working” in Italy  Around 33,000 “smart working” days in Italy  Around 400 employees moved to new “smart offices” in Genoa  Around 100 Research and Innovation projects launched Operational Excellence In 2019, RINA launched its Operational Excellence programme, based on Continuous Improvement and Lean Six Sigma. Through Continuous Improvement, we will prepare the group and create the necessary buy-in for the future innovation created by digitalization. The Operational Excellence programme enables us to achieve more through better employee engagement, and more streamlined processes. The goal is not to reduce resources, but to determine how resources can be better applied. Operational Excellence enables employees to see the flow of value to the customer, and adjust or fix that flow if necessary. In line with the Lean Six Sigma system, the programme certifies participants as different coloured belts according to their knowledge. In 2019, 11 Green Belts and 57 Yellow Belts were developed and certified. Meanwhile, we are close to finalising 11 successful projects in Procurement, Finance and Human Resources. In 2020, RINA will expand the Operational Excellence programmes to the entire group, incorporating both Corporate Functions and Business areas, as part of its multi-year commitment to this initiative. ICT and Information Security RINA is strongly committed to good Information and Communications Technology (ICT) practices and information security. Due to the nature of our business, we continuously work to strengthen privacy protection, the confidentiality of information, and intellectual property. In line with this commitment, we implemented a new Information Security Management System in 2019, which is compliant with ISO/IEC 27001:2013. The system includes a new set of internal policies, procedures and operational activities aimed at continuously improving our internal control model and reducing IT-related risks. The measures taken in 2019 attest to the importance that RINA places on the protection of information contained within its IT systems. They confirm our commitment to implementing all reasonable organizational and technical measures necessary to mitigate the growing risk in the area of cyber and information security. In 2019, RINA successfully passed the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 audits and verifications carried out by the Certification company and received its Certificate in early 2020. A vulnerability assessment (VA) and a penetration test (PT) are carried out to test the effectiveness of our system and procedures at least once a year, and more frequently when necessary. Any reported findings are used to steer future plans and investments to improve the security of internal information and our clients’ data. 48 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Smart Working Our Smart Working initiative continued in 2019, and from October onwards we took the initiative worldwide. It is currently in its final pilot phase. A total of 1,117 employees working in Italy have taken advantage of Smart Working, completing 32,979 days during 2019. Under this scheme, employees can work from home up to 8 days per month (no more than four cumulative days), using RINA equipment and technology. Employees must have sufficient internet capacity, but can stay connected with colleagues using video communication technology, plus other group chat and document sharing software. Health and Safety matters are covered in a compulsory training scheme undertaken by each employee prior to receiving permission to enter the smart working scheme. Employees must request each smart working session in advance, which managers will approve according to the work demand. The scheme enabled employees in Italy to reduce their commuting time by 44,522 hours in 2019, equivalent to 241 tons of CO2 emissions saved. Employee feedback in Italy shows this scheme continues to be a great success, enabling staff to take advantage of the extra flexibility it brings, a positive factor in employee retention rates. Smart working has also had an impact on our new head office in Via Cecchi, Genoa, which opened in December 2019 and whose design reflects a modern and flexible approach to working. A ‘hot-desking’ layout offers flexibility and features collaborative spaces, while also catering for a reduced capacity of permanent office-based employees. We have now extended Smart Working beyond our Italian operations. It is a new approach for many countries in Asia, where the culture of Smart Working is not well established, and it is anticipated that the take-up of Smart Working may initially be slower in this region. By contrast, the UK was already quite advanced in flexible working, and will now conform more formally to the RINA policy. The goal for 2020 is to record meaningful data on Smart Working statistics outside of Italy, bringing the same software for applying and recording the information to these countries. Agile offices Smart Working is also bringing change to work spaces. In recent years, offices have evolved into a hybrid format, offering employees more flexibility on when and where to work. This new concept also places attention on the physical and emotional wellness of staff, with the aim of creating offices with relaxing and comfortable spaces. RINA is choosing to rethink its office space, creating a more flexible work ambiance, which also offers greater possibilities to collaborate within teams. The first result of this philosophy of rethinking the working model was our Rozzano office in Milan, created in 2017. At the beginning of 2019, RINA started work on the design of its new, agile offices in Genoa. The location, via Cecchi, was chosen for its easy accessibility to train, subway and other types of public transport. The 4,000 square metre office space which will now house the three RINA Consulting offices is dedicated to sustainability and welfare. More than 400 employees will have at their disposal open plan working areas, co-working areas, meeting rooms, food courts, green spaces and relaxation areas. Employees began moving into the new premiers in December 2019. An application was developed internally dedicated to the process, showing the new layout of the floors, the description of the new spaces and their philosophy, how the office could be reached, and the calendar for personnel movement. A welcoming committee was organised for employees to explain the spaces and demonstrate their use. In January 2020, the move was completed and its inauguration took place in the presence of the local authorities. In the design of the new office, we have focused on environmental sustainability, aiming to minimizing our environmental impact. Only LED lighting has been used in order to reduce energy consumption, while electricity is generated from renewable sources in order to reduce our carbon footprint. In line with RINA’s Plastic Free project, the new offices will have three water fountains, while reusable water bottles have been distributed and plastic bottles are not present in vending machines. In future, cups and scoops for the coffee dispenser will be made from compostable materials to reduce the use of disposable plastic. In addition to these measures, RINA has also added a bicycle park to its car parking space, to encourage cycle use and reduce CO2 emissions. 49 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 As mentioned, the office functions as a smart space, where employees do not have a fixed workstation but can sit wherever they choose. This is one of the largest changes, and ensures flexibility, collaboration and productivity, and encourages close integration between colleagues. These ideas are reflected in the common areas:  Co-working areas to stimulate collaboration, which are furnished with natural materials to give a warm sensation to facilitate physical and psychological comfort; the offices can be seen as an extension of the home  Relaxation areas offering the possibility to read, share information and brainstorm using ideas boards  Phone booths offering the possibility of private calls and meetings  Kitchen areas where employees can both eat and have informal meetings Meanwhile, the use of materials and colours has been carefully studied with the support of experts in order to define the functions of different areas. For spaces designed for individual work, the colour palette is neutral, using colours such as white and grey to encourage concentration. By contrast, for co-working areas, phone booths and kitchens, specific colours and materials have been chosen to create a relaxing but stimulating atmosphere: for example, greens and oranges, with wood furnishings. Plants and murals have been used, while some walls have been covered with moss, giving these spaces a distinctive character. Adding foliage to work spaces has been shown to improve the quality of air, but also to help employees feel more comfortable and relaxed, in turn aiding productivity. This overarching philosophy will be applied to all new offices, and to the renovation of existing offices where possible. Digitalization RINA’s digital transformation process started in 2018 with the aim of supporting Business Areas in both the development of new digital products and services, as well as the digital delivery of traditional methods. During 2019, a complete set of functions for RINA’s main digital product, Optimum, was finalized. This product to manage fleet performance was installed on board the ships of several of our principal clients. With Optimum, we have created a real digital fleet manager using very limited hardware: each ship hosts a small PC that acts as a data collector (gathering data from all of the ship’s systems) and transfers data to the cloud using our digital platform. From there, the data take different paths:  Some data are simply aggregated on control dashboards which, in real time, retransmit the data both on board the ship and to a control room ashore. The interfaces used allow fleet managers to control the fleet status with a simple glance at the screens. Managers can supervise a wide range of elements such as consumption, routes and the operation of individual components of the ship. In case of excessive deviations from expected performances, alarms are activated  In addition, other data are processed in more detail, before being aggregated and re-presented. Historical data, benchmarks and algorithms/artificial intelligence define when the performance of a ship no longer falls within expected parameters, and decides how to intervene from a maintenance point of view to reduce the costs and downtime of the ships Optimum is proof that the general approach to data in shipping has changed. Operational information from the different operating systems on board ship can now be shared in a single environment on RINA’s digital CUBE platform, where the information can be analyzed, compared and evaluated. Such information is no longer “confined” to one device. This platform can then become a database for complex processing, exploiting machine learning and artificial intelligence to optimize a fleet’s performance and maintenance programme. Clearly, this approach is not limited to the marine industry, but can be applied to any asset, or group of assets, where data collection and analysis can be beneficial to decision makers. RINA has also developed the “Optimum Wind” platform to support wind farms operators and managers. Another field where big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning are set to usher in a new way of working is maintenance, both for industry and infrastructure. 50 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 RINA is able to design, implement and maintain structural health monitoring systems for transport infrastructures (roads, bridges, tunnels…) based on data collection from new or existing systems. We then provide tailored interfaces for real-time data visualization, advanced analytics, and machine learning-based analysis for the proper predictive maintenance of complex assets. Visual recognition tools, paired with machine learning techniques, have also been implemented to support clients with advanced maintenance tasks. Delivery methods are also changing for traditional services. In the marine sector, certificates relating to a ship are no longer in paper form. The reports and nautical journals that ships must produce for regulatory reasons have become pre-filled electronic forms. These are capable of highlighting inconsistent data, thereby limiting the possibility of error, while also recording transactions in the public blockchain to ensure data is immutable. Even the most traditional of operations, on-board inspection, is changing its execution model. Our surveyors have now been provided with an advanced technology helmet which on the one hand continues to perform its function of personal protective device, and on the other allows those on board to share on RINA’s digital platform what they are inspecting with experts on the ground. Thanks to its wireless camera, the helmet offers high quality audio/video communication, integrating optical, thermographic and borescope cameras. Due to its innovative data compression technology, it can also share documents (monographs, construction drawings) and transmit very large audio and video files. The device can be used both to support a RINA technician who is carrying out the inspection, and to provide assistance to a crew member who is conducting maintenance or managing a breakdown or emergency situation. The helmet has application in the marine field, and also in the energy and in the infrastructure sectors, and can be a key tool in reducing unnecessary trips and travel. Research and finance project RINA is a key player in Horizon 2020, the European Commission-funded research and innovation programme. Horizon 2020 focuses on three key areas: Excellent Science, Industrial Leadership and Societal Challenges. It had €80 billion of funding between 2014 and 2020. RINA is particularly engaged in developing research projects with a focus on Industrial Leadership and Societal Challenges, in order to:  Support our business departments in identifying innovative services, sectors and market trends  Gain knowledge to develop, design and enhance our services and to develop new offers  Develop strategic relationships with key players in relevant areas for the company  Gain higher visibility as a global player within the innovation sector  Support clients within the innovation chain In 2019, RINA was involved in around 100 research and innovation projects, most of them within the Horizon 2020 framework. In the area of sustainability, we continue to focus on the topics of:  Secure, Clean and Efficient Energy in the Built Environment  Smart Cities and Communities  Sustainable Production and the Circular Economy  Disaster Resilience and Nature-based Risk Reduction  Innovation in the Transport Infrastructure  Low Carbon Energy and Smart Grids  Health  Innovation in the Manufacturing Industry Horizon 2020 seeks sustainable solutions to meet the economic, social and environmental objectives for Europe as laid down in UN’s 2030 Agenda. As an example of the Horizon 2020 Programme’s commitment to the SDGs of the 2030 Agenda, its Energy Challenge is designed to support the transition to a reliable, sustainable and competitive energy system. Within this framework, RINA is very active in the Clean Energy for EU Islands initiative. Three Horizon 2020 projects SMILE, INSULAE and NESOI have recently been launched to encourage a clean energy transition for the EU Islands. Within this cluster of projects, RINA is working on the deployment of innovative solutions for the decarbonization and modernization of the EU islands, such that they can generate their own sustainable, low-cost energy. 51 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 The modernization of energy systems will be vital for achieving Europe’s sustainability energy targets, and smart grids will be an essential element of this process. Another area where RINA is highly active is in hydrogen’s potential to deliver high-quality, highly efficient energy services, while contributing to a reduced local, regional and global environmental impact. For instance, within the EVERYWH2ERE project, RINA is showing how temporary energy generators based on Hydrogen Fuel Cells can be used on construction sites, at music festivals, and at other temporary events, while having zero environmental impact. Finally, RINA is committed to contributing to the resilience of our built environment and critical infrastructures. An example of this commitment is the participation in a number of R&D projects aimed at developing methodologies and operative tools to support the managers of such infrastructures. These tools will also assist stakeholders, including citizens and first responders, in applying resilient principles, no matter the type of stress and shock inflicted or the sector of application. The aim is to minimize the damage from such events to our strategic infrastructure, cities, communities and society. Two examples of these R&D projects are the FORESEE project, which is aimed at developing cost effective and reliable tools to improve the resilience of transport infrastructure against extreme events, and the PANACEA project, which is delivering people-centric cybersecurity solutions in healthcare. 52 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our services for sustainability In September 2015, world leaders adopted the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This defines a set of global sustainable development priorities and initiatives, and calls for worldwide action in the public and private sectors for sustainable development combining economic, social and environmental aspects. This section explores examples of our efforts to contribute to the Agenda’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It focuses on some of the businesses areas in which we are proactively supporting clients to develop projects in line with the expectations of the SDG framework. In 2019, we continued working in the sustainability field alongside numerous private stakeholders operating in the energy, marine, certification, transport and infrastructure and industry sectors. Through the application of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Sustainability Framework and other environmental and social standards, we support companies in identifying the environmental and social risk responsibilities associated with their operations and contribute to the application of the SDGs. Albanian Water Sector Performance and Investment Programme As part of Albania’s Water Sector Performance and Investment Programme (WPIP)/Municipal Infrastructure V Programme (MIP V), RINA Consulting has been appointed by KfW to provide guidance to the Albanian National Agency for Water Supply, Sewerage and Waste Infrastructure (AKUM) on the management of environmental and social risks and impacts associated with the Programme. The objective of the Programme is to achieve for the population efficient and sustainable access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation through sewerage disposal at a socially acceptable tariff that covers at least the operating costs. Funding of the programme through soft loans and grants will be provided by German Financial Cooperation through KfW, by the EU under the IPA 2018 action, and by the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). The scope of our work included the elaboration of an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF), including a Stakeholder Engagement Framework (SEF) as well as a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF). These were to ensure that potential negative environmental and social impacts were minimized, while benefits for local communities and the environment were maximised. Khantex Group LLC Assessment of Labour and Working Conditions Khantex Group LLC is a privately owned company established in April 2016 which is working to create a modern cotton production cluster in Uzbekistan. This model implies the organization of a single production cycle, which includes the cultivation of raw cotton, primary processing, further processing at cotton ginning enterprises, and the production of final textile products with a high added value. Underlining its commitment in this field, in December 2019 the Khantex Group LLC was recognized by the Uztextileprom Association as the most innovative cotton-textile cluster in Uzbekistan. Within the framework of a project financing/credit insurance provided by a Swiss supplier (exporter) of spinning machinery and equipment, RINA Consulting was retained by the Lender and the ECAs to act as Independent Environmental and Social Consultant, and instructed to carry out a pre-financial assessment of labour and working conditions. 53 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our involvement allowed the identification of aspects to be improved in order to comply with IFC PS2 requirements, and in particular to eliminate any risk linked to the work and labor conditions with a particular focus on aspects such forced LABOUR within the project supply chain. LNG Sector Development LNG is considered the cleanest fossil fuel on the market. Current regulations and legislation are pushing the increased use of LNG in several sectors, in particular in the transportation (road and maritime) segments, with the aim of reducing GHG emissions and other air pollutants. In 2019, RINA Gas consolidated its presence as an environmental and permitting consultant in the LNG sector, in the process diversifying from its original focus on large scale plants to provide consulting services for several small-scale projects in crucial areas of the Mediterranean. For example, RINA supported the IVI-Petrolifera Group and Venice LNG in obtaining the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) greenlight for two LNG storage and distribution plants in Sardinia and Marghera, Venice. RINA is able to support the client not only by preparing the technical and environmental documents for the EIA procedure, but also by liaising with the relevant permitting authorities and stakeholders, providing them with the environmental baseline data, impact assessment and proposed mitigation measures. This extensive procedure has enabled the plants to collect the opinions of stakeholders (institutional stakeholders and local communities), identifying all the potential design optimization and impact mitigation measures possible, leading to an environmentally and socially compatible project. The two LNG plants, which are strategic for Italy’s national LNG and clean fuels strategy, will now proceed to construction and operation. Biodiversity Action Plans In 2019, RINA has furtherly strengthen its position in the delivery of biodiversity related services, providing Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP) for several major oil & gas companies. The BAPs are mainly focused on the identification and implementation of actions to achieve the best feasible reinstatement of sites affected by the construction and operation of a project (plants, facilities, etc.). The main steps are: i) theoretical biodiversity features (i.e. potential biodiversity status prior to the construction activities) ii) current biodiversity status (affected by the project) with characterization by means of dedicated field surveys iii) identification of potential reinstatement actions iv) monitoring planning and execution (in order to assess the biodiversity status progress both in absence and/or presence of reinstatement actions). RINA is carrying out such studies in several geographical areas, involving a wide range of different climates (Mediterranean coast, hill/mountains inland, wetlands; arid areas). This service is of increasing interest to our major clients who want to fulfil the sustainability policy requirements linked to the UN 2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. 54 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Study on Geothermal plants and applications emissions: overview and analysis The European Commission, DG RTD, has commissioned a study on ‘Geothermal plants’ and applications’ emissions: overview and analysis’ from Ernst & Young, RINA and VITO in order to have a consistent, harmonized and exhaustive assessment of the possible release of greenhouse gases and other pollutant emissions in the geothermal sector. The study was launched on 8 November 2018 and will last 14 months, focusing on electricity production and heating and cooling applications. Specific sectoral rules for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) will be set up and applied, to guarantee a robust, consistent and transparent method to assess the potential impact of the geothermal sector on human health and environment across the various types of geographies and technologies. The outcome of the study will be an in-depth, independent and reliable analysis of the emissions from the full spectrum of geothermal plants and applications, based on the life cycle approach. Energy and GHG optimization Saipem Energy is committed to the containment of GHG emissions. Its 4-year plan to reduce GHG emissions includes a series of measures on energy saving and innovation. To reduce GHG emissions, Saipem has undertaken a strategy of energy consumption optimization, and investigation of clean technologies; in this context, Saipem has engaged RINA Consulting to carry out a series of energy assessments on relevant facilities of different types (vessels, civil buildings, accommodation camps, logistic base), aimed at quantifying the environmental benefits of the systems already implemented and to further evaluate related interventions. Other energy saving initiatives are in the process of being implemented. The final goal is a certified model that will lead to the measurement, planning and targeted reduction of GHG emissions. The Energy and GHG Assessment aims to provide technical and management information in order to:  Increase and disseminate awareness about GHG emission reductions and energy efficiency  Optimize accommodation camp efficiency in terms of GHG emissions reduction  Comply with all international legal requirements and standards Promoting Green Technologies for SMES in the Western Balkans The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the EU have launched a support programme for businesses in Serbia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Macedonia and Kosovo, to help Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) move towards EU standards relating to sustainability targets. This will enhance the competitiveness of SMEs from the region in the EU market. At the end of 2018, RINA was selected by the EBRD as the Project Consultant for this new initiative, and activities started in January 2019. Our team is providing assistance to local companies and Participating Banks (PBs) in setting up, managing and promoting a Credit Facility aimed at disbursing low interest rate loans and grant incentives to eligible investments in green technologies. Our multidisciplinary team of international and local experts is helping local SMEs in the four countries identify and refine their technical needs, accompanying them throughout the financing process and during project implementation, as well as providing dedicated monitoring. 55 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Our team of international and local experts supported more than 150 SMEs and eight local banks across the region in the first year of activity. Technical Assistance to the Project Implementation Unit for EGAS Energy’s Efficiency Project in Dahshour The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has provided a sovereign loan of up to $200 million to the Arab Republic of Egypt which it will on-lend to the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and its subsidiary Egyptian Natural Gas Company (GASCO), the sole operator of the natural gas system in Egypt. The proposed project consists of energy efficiency investments in the Egyptian gas pipeline infrastructure, consistent with the Bank’s Green Economy Transition Approach (“GET”). The Project focuses on energy efficiency investments comprising of waste heat recovery from compression stations at gas processing plants, including the Dahshour compression station. GASCO selected RINA Consulting as the Technical Support for a Project Implementation Unit (PIU). RINA will provide organisational and technical assistance to the company to ensure the successful completion of the Project in accordance with the Project Implementation Plan (PIP) and with all EBRD requirements stipulated in the Loan Agreement. Inter alia, the PIU consultancy includes the following tasks:  Support in the finalisation of the technical documentation of the Project to ensure compliance with the EBRD’s Procurement Policies and Rules (PP&R)  Development of PIU Operating Procedures  Support during the Procurement Process  Support during the Evaluation Process  Support during contract finalisation  An Environmental and Social Action Plan Feasibility Study on the Business Opportunities for Women in a Changing Energy Value Chain in West Africa The scope of the assignment is to deliver four separate feasibility studies combined within one final document. The key focus of these studies is to qualify for credit approval from banks, funds and others. The feasibility study is oriented towards gender mainstreaming, highlighting the potential for women entrepreneurs to be engaged across the entire supply chain of the four businesses. It should also take into account women’s engagement during the stakeholder consultation phase of the business development, and other areas where applicable. The geographic focus of the study is the country specified in the title of each feasibility study project, examining its replicability across the other three countries in West Africa. The scope of the feasibility study will include, but is not limited to, the evaluation of the following projects:  Development of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) distribution businesses in Nigeria  Development of distribution businesses for solar-based electricity generation systems and solar lighting products in Ghana 56 RINA Sustainability Report 2019  Development of Clean Energy Powered Mini and Micro Grid electricity generation and distribution businesses in Senegal  Identification and development of Smart Applications for Energy Consumers in Cote d’Ivoire. MRV-DCS FORMS EU MRV (Measuring Recording and Verification of CO2 emissions) and IMO DCS (Data Collection System on fuel consumption) EU MRV (Measuring, Recording and Verification of CO2 emissions) and IMO DCS (Data Collection System on fuel consumption) are two mandatory monitoring, communication and verification systems set up for ships over 5,000 gross tons serving one or more commercial routes (goods or passengers), regardless of their flag registration. RINA Services is accredited for the verification of data reported under both schemes, and has also developed a digital tool to assist customers in collecting the required data for the two Regulations. The forms include a guided procedure to assist users, typically the crew on board, through the process, increasing the ease of completion. Data are stored locally and sent ashore as soon as a connection is available. At the end of the reporting period, no additional action is required by the customer to aggregate the data as required by the Regulations. With RINA’s MRV-DCS forms, shipowners can achieve the ambitious environmental targets set for shipping, while ensuring efficiency in the running of their fleets. BWMS ballast water management systems Roughly 80% of globally traded commodities are carried by sea at some point in their journey across markets. Along with the transport of goods, shipping also moves 3-5 billion tons of ballast water across the world each year. Shipowners, designers, builders and operators rely on RINA to understand international ballast water regulations and assist in the installation and proper operation of ballast water management systems (BWMS) on their ships. In order to respond to shipowner’s needs, RINA offers technical guidance, operational solutions and unparalleled insight into all facets of ballast water management, including:  Clarification and guidance on applicable standards of BWM compliance  Review of BWM plans  BWMS technology evaluation services  Training for officers and crew  Survey, certification and inspection  Clarification and guidance on compliance with USCG regulations and US EPA Vessel General Permit 57 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Inventory of hazardous materials (IHM) In 2013, the European Parliament adopted a regulation on ship recycling in order to prevent, reduce or eliminate adverse effects on human health and the environment caused by the recycling, operation and maintenance of ships. The regulation requires an inventory of hazardous materials (IHM) on board ships of 500 gt and above on international voyages, which fly the flag of a Member States or the flag of a third country calling at a port or anchorage of a Member State. Newbuildings must already carry the IHM, while existing ships are required to carry the IHM from 31 December 2020. The inventory of hazardous materials consists of three parts:  I. A list of hazardous materials (as defined in the regulation) contained in the structure or equipment of the ship, their location and approximate quantities  II. A list of the operationally generated waste present on board  III. A list of the stores present on board For new and existing ships, Part I is mandatory, while Part II and Part III are to be prepared prior to recycling. RINA Consulting is supporting shipowners with the preparation of Part I (and also Parts II and III if needed) of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials in accordance with the requirements of IMO “2015 Guidelines for the development of the Inventory of Hazardous Materials”, adopted by Resolution MEPC.269(68). Certification of anti-bribery management system for Ansaldo Energia S.p.A. RINA carried out the evaluation and certification of the ISO 37001 standard for Ansaldo Energia, Italy’s largest supplier, installer and service provider for power generation plants and components, and one of the world’s leading players in the sector. A rigorous analysis of the company’s main activities and processes was conducted in accordance with the ISO 37001 standard, which aims to combat bribery and promote an ethical, transparent, open, and compliant culture within the company. ISO 26000 for Eni Rewind S.p.A. Eni engaged RINA to verify the application of ISO 26000 for Eni Rewind. Eni Rewind is the environmental arm of the Eni Group, and is engaged in the sustainable remediation of all Eni sites through integrated projects. It operates according to the principles of the Circular Economy to give new life to industrial land, water and waste through efficient remediation and recovery projects. RINA has verified the use of the guidance provided by ISO 26000 as the main reference document for integrating social responsibility throughout its activities, policies, strategies, procedures and objectives. 58 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Validation of the Green Bond Framework prepared by Asja Ambiente Italia S.p.A. Asja Ambiente Italia S.p.a. (Asja) prepared a Green Bond Framework under which it intends to issue green bonds to finance or refinance projects that promote environmental progress and sustainability (green projects). RINA validated the Green Bond Framework in order to issue an independent “Second Party Opinion” on the sustainability of the green projects financed and the management of the Green Bond Framework. RINA validated the Asja Green Bond Framework for compliance with the Green Bond Principles issued by the International Capital Market Association in 2018, the United Nations’ 2015 Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, and the 2010 ISO 26000 Social Responsibility Guidelines. Certification of sustainability for the food products of Barilla G. e R. F.lli S.p.A. and Tomato Farm S.p.A. RINA is increasingly establishing itself as a key certification partner for the food chain and those companies that want to declare the sustainability of their products according to the ISCC PLUS scheme. For Barilla, RINA certified its flour (a strategic ingredient of bakery products), a project which involved 3 Barilla plants, 33 storage centres, 500 farms and 12 crushing plants during 2019. In November 2019, RINA certified the sustainability of the tomato products for Tomato Farm, a project which involved 3 storage centres, 1 plant, 1 trader and 78 farms. Verification of the greenhouse gas inventory for Regione Valle d’Aosta RINA verified that the greenhouse gas emission inventory of the Aosta valleys for the year 2017, as prepared by Regione Autonoma Valle d’Aosta, complies with the requirements of the IPCC Guidelines and is based on the principles contained in the standard ISO 14064-1: 2019 “Greenhouse gases Part 1: Specification with guidance at the organization level for quantification and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and removals”. Assessment of carbon neutrality for Kagal facility of Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited RINA assessed the carbon neutrality in accordance with PAS 2060 for the Kagal facility of major Indian publicly listed company Kirloskar Oil Engines Limited, which manufactures diesel generators and engines used in heavy equipment. 59 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 The boundary for the assessment was the company’s key operational site i.e. the manufacturing unit located in Kagal MIDC, Kolhapur, Maharashtra. The scope consisted of verifying first the greenhouse gas inventory (scope 1, 2 & 3) of the site operations, and subsequently the measures taken by the company to offset the GHG to become carbon neutral. Environmental Technology Verification for EU Horizon 2020 research project SMART-Plant RINA evaluated the eligibility under the EU ETV (Environmental, Technology, Verification) Programme of all the ecoinnovative and energy-efficient technologies in the EU Horizon 2020 research project SMART-Plant. The project is aimed at renovating existing wastewater treatment plants and closing the circular value chain by applying low-carbon techniques to recovering materials that are otherwise lost. RINA made a speech on this subject at the Ecomondo Exibition held in Rimini. Certification of Sugurya in Turkey RINA performed its first certification of Sugurya, a ship recycling facility in Turkey, a leading country in the global ship recycling market. The certification was carried out according to the requirements of the International Hong Kong Convention (HKC) and the EU Ship Recycling Regulation (SRR) for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships. This is aimed at ensuring ships do not pose any unnecessary risk to human health and safety or to the environment when recycled after reaching the end of their operational lives. RINA gave a speech about its certification activity at ACI’s 8th Ship Recycling Congress in Amsterdam in January 2020. Certification ReMade in Italy® for AMSA S.p.A. and A2A AMBIENTE S.p.A.
