Through our core businesses we inspire, motivate, prepare and develop people across the globe to embrace the future of work. Every year, the Group’s 35,000 colleagues worldwide enable 3.5 million people to participate in the world of work, and support more than 100,000 organisations with their human capital needs, allowing them to invest and grow. In 2019, we provided coaching and training to more than half a million people, enhancing their employability and accelerating their careers. And we also ran programmes in fields where persistent skills shortages exist to ‘train and place’ candidates; acting as a source of talent, rather than an intermediary. We believe this decade will be defined by a reskilling revolution, and we are committed to doing our part with an ambitious plan to upskill and reskill five million people globally by 2030. In doing so, we will continue to support economic dynamism across the 60 countries in which we operate. Making the future work for everyone As a leader in the world of work, we are also vocal advocates for a new social contract, highlighting the need for social security systems to catch up with the way that people work in the 21st century, to guarantee appropriate protections for all workers – permanent, temporary, or freelance. We are also leading the debate on how companies and governments should rethink workforce investment and account for human capital, to incentivise organisations to address skills shortages and employability challenges. At the forefront Leveraging our scale and scope The future success of the Adecco Group will in part be of a changing determined by our ability to take advantage of our scale and scope, which is increasingly important in a digital world. As the business evolves from a branch-centric world of work to an omnichannel model, customer solutions become more complex, and data becomes central to the value proposition. The Adecco Group is well-positioned to lead this shift and expand its market share, in what remains a highly fragmented industry.

Ten years ago, the Group was grappling with the fallout from the global financial crisis, which had significantly impacted demand for HR solutions. Unemployment was rising, and many commentators were predicting a ‘jobless recovery’, Rolf Dörig Alain Dehaze while at the same time, ageing workforces and rising Chair of the Board Chief Executive Officer demand for skilled workers were prompting fears of skills shortages in the longer term. The HR solutions industry was meanwhile predicted by some to be disrupted by the emergence of online professional networks.

Even with this investment our conversion ratio (Gross Profit increasing operational efficiency. I am confident that conversion to EBITA) remained industry-leading, and we will build on this progress in 2020 and beyond. our EBITA margin improved year on year. We see many opportunities to drive profitable growth, as GrowTogether further expands, the Ventures come to profitability and pockets of business underperformance are addressed. For example, GrowTogether helped drive a material improvement in both client and candidate Net Promoter Score, which should underpin future growth. The programme also over-delivered against its productivity target of EUR 120 million, reaching EUR 140 million of annual benefits. This was a key driver of the solid margin performance in the year and gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the EUR 250 million GrowTogether commitment in 2020. 6 Annual Report 2019 Meanwhile, the Ventures portfolio continued to grow strongly, with increasing synergies with other Group such as training, outsourcing, permanent placement and professional staffing.

At the time of the acquisition, we said we believed there was an opportunity to leverage GA’s capabilities to better serve customers across other Group brands, and we are now proving that to be the case. Collaboration with LHH really stepped up, which we will talk about with Sarah in a moment. We also piloted the Modis Academy, in which we are putting Modis candidates through GA full-time and part-time software engineering courses before placing them with clients. This ‘hire-train-deploy’ model is similar to what the Adecco Group already does in Modis VSN in Japan and is a real differentiator with both candidates, who get to increase their employability, and clients, who gain access to in-demand talent. Q. How did the collaboration between General Assembly and LHH begin? Sarah Dollander (SD): As Charandeep mentioned, right from the beginning we recognised there was a strong complementarity between LHH and GA, and potential to create truly innovative solutions to address the urgent needs of many of the Group’s clients. Most companies face a need to adapt to rapidly changing skills requirements and digital disruption. In the past, they would ‘fire and re-hire’; lay people off and bring in new employees with the required skills. However, today the pace of change has accelerated and there are shortages of talent in many critical digital fields.

I joined Adecco more than 20 years ago and stayed because I’m passionate about helping people find fulfilling careers. Perhaps the biggest change I have seen in my own career is the shift that GrowTogether has brought to the branches. The combination of the PERFORM way of working with the InFO technology platform, has transformed the branch from analogue to digital. We used to huddle around the white board and then spend time with each team member planning their day. Today we have a data-driven culture. We can assess sales performance based on real-time analytics and have the visibility to know when we need to up our game to make sure we hit our numbers. Client visits are up more than 30%. Behaviour has changed and people are more accountable. But perhaps the most important shift is in how the new digital tools have given us the insights – and the time – to build deeper client and candidate relationships. We feel it in our interactions, and we see it in our Net Promoter Scores.

The lines between work time and personal time are blurring, with the concept of work-life balance evolving into a “work-life integration” paradigm. Across sectors and geographies there is growing recognition of the impact of work and its role in worsening or improving health. Wellbeing matters; how employees feel – not only about their job, but also in their personal lives – influences how and where they work. It affects productivity and ultimately financial results. Further, individuals who are thriving, secure, balanced and connected can not only help improve the workforce, but also the world as we know it. Doing wellbeing well While the need for companies to look after the health and wellbeing of their employees is widely recognised, many companies are unsure how to craft a workforce wellbeing program that is effective and takes a holistic view of wellbeing. The Adecco Group is no exception. The Adecco Group Foundation’s social innovation lab thus set out to tackle this challenge to create a more holistic model that could benefit employers – and employees – across all sectors and industries. At the heart was the necessity to better understand the needs of employees, both permanent and temporary, looking at what employers could do to promote wellbeing at each stage of their journey. To foster broad-based adoption of employee wellbeing practices, the Foundation used research and design-thinking to create the Workforce Vitality model. We are currently testing the model in different contexts to ensure it works effectively across various types of employers, before launching it in the public domain later in 2020. Test groups to date have included Adecco Group brands and country offices, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). The Pontoon vitality programme Involved in the testing is the Adecco Group brand Pontoon, a leader in contingent and permanent workforce planning and talent advisory solutions. As a result, Pontoon has applied the model to transform how they interact with their colleagues, consultants, and their NextGen associates, with wellbeing and vitality at the core. Pontoon President Corinne Ripoche says, “Workforce vitality and employee wellness is an extremely important subject for our customers and a topic we are often consulted on. We wanted to hear from Pontoon colleagues and understand what wellness meant to them. As a customer-obsessed business it is essential to share our own experience to benefit our clients and this project successfully brought together many areas of the Adecco Group working towards a common goal of engaging with our people and helping them thrive at work.” A positive working environment has a profound impact on job satisfaction and productivity, and on wider society. 52 Annual Report 2019 Dan’s story “For me, a key learning was that not every solution needed to be complex or truly innovative. It became clear that our consultants often desired support that was very achievable and which we could quickly and easily implement. We were indirectly improving the value proposition for our clients by providing our consultants with the best environment possible in which to operate.” Dan Credand, Head of Client Services, Pontoon
