The transformation from historically being a printing house, to becoming a diverse company is the result of a clear strategy in order to adapt to technological developments and constantly changing customer needs, but also to stay innovative on a fast developing global market. Today, we offer our customers a broad range of services within marketing communication. Statement of support At Bording Group, we take social responsibility seriously. Both the social responsibility for our employees and the impact we have on the environment and the local community. Bording Group is more than 200 years old which has led to a culture of constant development and improvements. This is something we are proud of, and every year we strive to provide positive changes through sustainability management. Bording Group has been part of the UN Global Compact since 2009. In the year to come, we will continue following the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact. At Bording Group, we want to be known as a reliable partner who respects the Global Compact. This does not only apply to Bording Group and its associated companies, but also to suppliers and business partners. As a Scandinavian business with several suppliers both within and outside Europe, it is important for us to make sure that suppliers live up to certain standards. We will therefore continue to encourage that suppliers and business partners live up to our ethical guidelines presented in the Code of Conduct which can be found on our website through this link: https://cdn.bordinggroup.com/media/1161/code-og-conduct_bg.pdf Yours faithfully Bernt Therp Chief Executive Officer COMPANY DETAILS Bording Group CVR.

Being responsible also means that we are responsible not only for our employees, but also for our suppliers, our customers, people around us as well as the environment. Bording Group and the principles With a history as a Danish printing company, Bording Group has focused on environmental concerns and opportunities for a long time. We do our best to create and uphold working procedures that protect the environment. Our longtime focus on environmental issues has created a unique base for suggesting, and to some extent demanding, improvements from our suppliers. The Bording Group understands that we cannot change the whole world, but by utilizing the Global Compact as a strategic tool for our work with social, ethical and environmental responsibility and values, we believe that we have taken an important step in the right direction. We continue to see CSR and sustainability as an important opportunity to work constructively with the challenges that we come across in our business operations. This adds value to our employees, the society, the environment and our business. The strength of the UN’s Global Compact is that the 10 principles are built upon internationally recognized conventions. The principles help us match expectations of good behavior and ethics when we do business across national and cultural borders. Furthermore, it gives us a strategic tool when it comes to sending our customers a clear signal on corporate responsibility and human rights. To a division such as Fiftytwo Digital Ltd., which is based inDhaka, Bangladesh, where many employees work under less fortunate conditions, we believe that it is important to send this clear signal in order to encourage other companies to treat the local employees with dignity and respect as well. For further information about UN’s work with Global Compact please visit: http://www.unglobalcompact.org/ The ethical guidelines of Bording As a Scandinavian Group, we see globalisation as an opportunity to expand our market and to participate in international projects. However, associated with these opportunities are the risks and challenges of doing business across different legal and cultural traditions. Bording Group has acknowledged these risks and challenges, which have led to a process of making our own set of ethical guidelines. These have become an integrated part of our daily operations. Bording Groups’s Code of Conduct (our ethical guidelines) is meant as a guide to our management team, employees, customers, suppliers and other cooperative partners about behavior and values in the Bording Group. Please visit our webpage, https://bordinggroup.com/about-us to read our Code of Conduct. In Bording Group, we strive to achieve the goal of always following the highest ethical standards and reducing the environmental impact our business may have on its surroundings as much as possible. At the same time, we assign a high importance to responsibility, trustworthiness and honesty. COMPANY DETAILS Bording Group CVR.
