In identifying material topics, the team focused on those that: • Align with our vision, purpose, strategy, brand portfolio and geographic footprint; • Intersect multiple areas of our value chain; and, • Affect consumers, customers, employees, communities, regulatory agencies and other stakeholders in regions where we operate and source. Although there are myriad important issues facing society today, we focus on the intersection of those that are most material to our business and where we can have the greatest impact given the reach of our operations, supply chain and value chain. In 2018, we conducted a comprehensive mapping exercise to evaluate this intersection against all 17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As a result, we expanded our materiality matrix across our value chain and indicated those “Priority SDGs” most aligned with our work. We also identified “Additional SDGs” that are important to our business and that we impact, however, those listed as Priority are where we concentrate our corporate responsibility efforts. See our GRI and SASB indices for additional information on economic, governance, environmental and social disclosures, as well as topics specific to the food processing sector. 2019/2020 Corporate Responsibility Report | 8 MATERIALITY ACROSS OUR VALUE CHAIN The following reporting materiality matrix lists the four sections of this corporate responsibility report and the topics within each.
