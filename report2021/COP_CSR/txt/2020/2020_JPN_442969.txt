Through these efforts we will continue to deliver benefits to our varied stakeholders even as the times change, a mission embodied in the name Mizuho, which evokes images of a “bountiful harvest of rice” in Japanese. In closing: Think, act, and deliver in order to rise up stronger than ever This fiscal year is a critical moment for us as we face the unprecedented crisis brought about by COVID-19. The financial industry is said to be a mirror of the real economy in some ways and our performance may dip somewhat for at least this fiscal year. However, our customers and society expect great things of Mizuho. We must seize this critical moment and fully draw on our financial capabilities, including cash flow support and settlements, coming together as a united group in order to help society and the economy recover as early as possible. Additionally, structural changes in society, the economy, and industry that will shape the post-COVID-19 world are occurring rapidly, such as digitalization and the shift to remote work and remote channels. In light of this, we will expand our business base, deepen our structural reforms, and otherwise further accelerate the transition to the next generation of financial services. As the true value of financial services is being tested, this is a window of opportunity and if all of us at Mizuho can come together to think, act, and deliver, I am confident that we will rise up stronger than ever. The entire group is working together to achieve the objective I have outlined since I was appointed as Group CEO of “building a stronger and more resilient financial group which our customers can depend on in the coming era”. We appreciate your continued support and will do everything in our power to exceed your expectations.

Additionally, in Japan, workers’ perspectives are shifting away from the idea of belonging to a company with the assumption of lifetime employment, to the idea of belonging to a profession, which assumes a lifelong active role in one’s field, and the focus is on increasing one’s individual value. Our new HR strategy responds to these changes in customer needs and employee perspectives, and aims to maximize employees’ universally recognizable value while focusing on honing their expertise. By creating organic opportunities for learning, taking on new challenges, and gaining experience through work, this strategy will form a mutually beneficial relationship between employees and the company where the growth of one leads to the growth of the other. Overview of the new HR strategy Changes in external environment Changes in the attitudes and perspectives of workers Declining birthrate Belong to a company Belong to a profession and aging population Digitalization Globalization Emphasize universally Mandatory retirement Age of longevity / Lifelong recognizable expertise active role in one’s field Changes in customer needs Focus on success at (Must provide value beyond the realm of finance alone) one’s company Focus on growth New HR strategy Shift from a model where the source of competition is limited to within the company to a model prioritizing employees’ professional growth and career preferences, providing opportunities for learning and taking on new challenges with a strong focus on maximizing employees’ universally recognizable value. Talent development focused on expertise Learning Learning Upgrading our talent development platform Challenge Opportunities to take on varied challenges inside and outside Mizuho Growth Cycle of growth through learning, taking on challenges, and work Challenge Work Frameworks supporting flexible career development + Work A work environment that enhances employee engagement Form a mutually beneficial relationship between employees and the company where the growth of one leads to the growth of the other – Create a virtuous cycle that enhances employee engagement and motivation and promotes development of the company Talent development focused on expertise Learning: Upgrading our talent development platform Previously, we provided training and educational content according to employer-determined groups based on seniority and other employee categories. Under the new HR strategy, in order to strengthen employees’ expertise and skills through highly effective development, our new framework will provide personalized content based on each individual’s needs and career aspirations. As one part of this, in addition to addressing learning needs across a wide range of subjects, in order to support employees who are proactive in taking on new challenges, we have rolled out a new digital learning platform, M-Nexus, for our entire group. This new platform allows employees to study without restrictions on time or place, and enables us to utilize a broad range of the latest content from external sources, including content on digital technologies. We will also utilize AI to provide each individual with personalized recommendations for content that is related to their interests. Mizuho Financial Group Our strategies for creating value Employee engagement Next, in addition to utilizing this platform as a one-stop source for learning as well as information on internal job opportunities, we plan to expand functionality to utilize it as a foundation for creating an employee community and facilitating communication between employees. Challenge: Opportunities to take on new challenges inside and outside Mizuho We are confident that an effective way to increase employees’ ambition and universally recognizable value is to provide more opportunities for employees to work in different fields and in different locations throughout Mizuho’s global business, taking on new challenges in order to achieve the career they envision for themselves. In order to achieve this, in addition to expanding internal job No. of applicants for internal job postings postings at Head Office targeting talent currently assigned to branch operations, we are also strengthening our support framework including training for ambitious employees interested in trying 820 new types of work and contributing in a leading role at Mizuho in the future. The number of internal 522 job applicants has increased by over 50% as a result of these initiatives. 496 We have also launched a concurrent assignment program which provides opportunities for employees to be involved in other roles or projects they are interested in while maintaining their primary duties, and in fiscal 2019, the first fiscal year of this program, we received applications from FY2017 FY2018 FY2019 over 120 employees. E  xample of concurrent assignment Additionally, we are creating a framework to enable employees to take on new challenges outside of outside Mizuho Mizuho, and have added job postings for secondment opportunities at external companies including start-up firms. Also, in addition to adopting the concurrent assignment program via which employees 2 days/wk External (secondment) company work some days at Mizuho and other days at another company, we have newly added a part-time work program for employees to operate their own businesses outside of work hours, and so far 3 days/wk around 120 employees are utilizing these new arrangements. Gain diverse perspectives and external insight Work: Frameworks supporting flexible career development New job track for expanded scope of involvement Under the new HR strategy which emphasizes employee expertise, we will merge the existing job Generalist Generalist Operations tracks to enable employees to be involved in a broader scope of work regardless of their job track track specialist track (rotational) (non-rotational) Current track, thus laying the foundations that will enable flexible career development (job tracks will be Retail Retail operations, operations, combined in fiscal 2021).

After merging New “Generalist track” An evaluation system that encourages employees to gain expertise Broader work opportunities Focus on building expertise that will This new evaluation system outlines the specific types of expertise and skills needed for each translate into business results business field, which are key for talent management, and under the new job track framework we will expand opportunities to engage in a wide range of activities and gain expertise at an early stage. Especially regarding personnel evaluations, which will be key for maximizing the value of each employee, we will strengthen and disseminate development-focused HR initiatives that consider evaluations not as assessments but as opportunities for growth. For example, we will increase opportunities for communication between managers and employees in the course of the evaluation process, and in addition to providing thorough feedback on issues hindering growth and the employee’s actions, we will focus on enhancing training to improve managers’ skills as evaluators. By shifting to a flexible compensation model that is more focused on job duties, placing an emphasis on each individual’s current performance and expertise rather than seniority or years of experience, we will draw out employees’ motivation and ambition and encourage proactivity. 2020 Integrated Report 50 Our strategies for creating value A work environment that enhances employee engagement Achieving a more flexible working style We are accelerating initiatives on flexible working styles as we look ahead to a post-COVID-19 Mizuho received 5 stars on the Nikkei Smart Work Survey society and give consideration to increasing employee interest.

When employees from different areas in the organization and varying national backgrounds come together to proactively learn from one another, this not only stimulates their growth, but contributes to the creation of bonds across company lines, creating a corporate culture that facilitates new business ideas and discoveries.

(Online video feed in Japan) We will host Mizuho Diversity & Inclusion Month on a continued basis to transform employee mindsets and behaviors, thus encouraging the creation of new corporate value on a broad scale across the group. Promoting employee health and wellness In our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are prioritizing the health and safety of customers and employees, and in addition to basic measures such as wearing face masks and promoting hand washing, we have also encouraged employees to work remotely and conduct meetings online, and made consultations available for employees.

We were also recognized for the way in which we pursue these goals through an integrated framework enabling collaboration between the company, health insurance providers, and occupational health services providers. Our HR strategy The core of the new HR strategy launched last fiscal year under our 5-Year Business Plan is to cultivate the universally recognizable value of employees by encouraging them to take independent action and take on challenges. To this end, we are working to expand opportunities for learning and taking on challenges so that each employee can design their own career, hone their expertise through learning, and experience growth by taking on challenges. As we work to expand such opportunities, an increasing number of employees are taking specific action with many utilizing new frameworks such as internal job postings, concurrent assignments, and external part-time work, and we are now feeling the impact of these initiatives as they begin producing results. We will continue building the HR foundations needed to develop talent for the transition to the next generation of financial services including the creation of frameworks for flexible career development. Furthermore, we will utilize the ideas and experience of employees from diverse backgrounds to further stimulate Mizuho’s growth, and continue promoting D&I initiatives such as the newly established Mizuho Diversity & Inclusion Month. And, in addition to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, as physical and mental wellbeing are essential for each individual employee to be fully engaged at work, we will continue strengthening employee health management and other such initiatives aiming to ensure Mizuho’s sustainable growth. Hiroaki Ehara Group Chief Human Resources Officer 2020 Integrated Report 52 Our strategies for creating value Sustainability By promoting sustainability initiatives, we at Mizuho aim to operate in a way that considers creation of value for our varied stakeholders and improve corporate value through sustainable, stable growth for the entire group, thus contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Thus far, we have strengthened our stance of advancing sustainability initiatives as an integral part of our group strategy. We have been making an effort to strengthen our environmental and climate change initiatives. In 2019, we signed the Principles for Responsible Banking, a framework created by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative. In April 2020, in light of these efforts and other factors, and with the aim of promoting sustainability consistently throughout the Mizuho group, after deliberation at the Executive Management Committee and the Board of Directors, we revised our Basic Policy on Sustainability Initiatives to clarify our fundamental approach. Further, in fiscal 2019, our business execution and supervision lines deepened their discussions on sustainability, particularly in relation to strengthening our environmental and climate change initiatives, and we set policy going forward and long-term targets in relation to these issues.

In April 2020, we revised the policy to be comprehensive in prohibiting financing and investment in such initiatives regardless of sector, as well as points of caution (“Environmental and Social Management Policy for Financing and Investment Activity”). Additionally, from the perspective of strengthening our response to climate change risks, we conducted revisions, including tightening the policy which states that we will not provide financing for the construction of new coal-fired power generation facilities and adding the coal mining sector, as well as additional clarification of our responses to transition risks in the oil and gas sectors, and based on this policy we set a quantitative target to reduce our outstanding credit balance for coal-fired power generation facilities.

Against this backdrop, initiatives to improve sustainability are becoming an ever more critical aspect of business strategy. At Mizuho, as part of promoting sustainable business, we have established key sustainability areas (materiality) for our business, as well as KPIs (monitoring indicators). In order to capture expanding business opportunities, we have also strengthened our structure for promoting sustainable business and set long-term targets for sustainable finance and environmental finance. Business promotion through engagement In light of the indirect impact that we, as a financial group, have through our clients, we strive to deepen our understanding of the issues and needs of clients through proactive engagement, and have strengthened our group-wide support of sustainable businesses in order to aid clients’ SDGs and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives, sustainability-related innovation, and risk reduction, including initiatives that address climate change and the transition to a low-carbon society. This is also enabling us to capture business opportunities.

To that end, we will also use this platform to undertake initiatives for implementing and expanding impact investment and loans. Seminar for startups Mizuho Financial Group Our strategies for creating value Sustainability Research & Consulting Sustainability Promotion Project In the Research & Consulting Unit, we have always offered expert insight into sustainability, as demonstrated by our extensive record of consulting in the field of energy and the environment. However, our insights tended to remain scattered within the unit across different entities, and we were looking to improve internal sharing of information and coordination on deals. To solve this issue and support Mizuho in responding as a united group to clients’ varied sustainable business needs, beginning with the SDGs and ESG issues, in 2020 we launched the Sustainability Promotion Project. The Sustainability Promotion Project is deepening the collaboration within the unit in both the research and consulting fields and, in doing so, enhancing and promoting our sustainable business initiatives, such as expanding the areas in which we can serve clients. In terms of research collaboration, we are focusing on output usable in consulting and coordination among in-house companies, and we have formed a Task Force on Climate Research collaboration Change Research. In terms of consulting collaboration, we have Task Force on Climate Change Research taken client needs into account and launched a Task Force on Environmental Issues and a Task Force on Corporate/Business Information Strategy to make positive contributions to business through sharing consulting. Consulting collaboration Task Force on Environmental Issues The Task Force on Climate Change Research is composed of Deal employees from Mizuho Research Institute and Mizuho Bank’s collaboration Task Force on Corporate/ Industry Research Department and is researching climate change Business Strategy impacts from macroeconomic and industrial perspectives. The task force’s work is furthering initiatives that support Mizuho’s Secretariat management and business.

The Task Force on Corporate/Business Strategy is composed of members from Mizuho Research Institute and Mizuho Information & Research Institute and is focusing on co-creation of value, beginning with consulting to promote incorporating the SDGs in corporate management. Investment and products: ESG investment In the Asset Management Company, we are engaging in constructive, purposeful dialogue (engagement) with the companies in which we invest. In addition to supporting improvements in these companies’ corporate value and supporting sustainable growth for society, we are also pursuing ESG investment, making investment decisions with not only financial information but also ESG factors and other types of non-financial information. For example, we are offering ESG investment products, such as those using our ESG Low Volatility High Dividend Payment Strategy, in which we select stocks from an ESG perspective with a focus on dividend yields and low volatility and aim to produce stable returns, and our Sustainability Research Strategy, in which we consider positive contributions to solving social issues as revenue opportunities and employ selective investment. Going forward, we will continue to practice ESG investment, with the goal of creating a positive cycle for society’s sustainable development. 2020 Integrated Report 62 Our strategies for creating value Environmental and climate change measures At Mizuho, we have supported the intent and aims of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)* Recommendations since 2017, and we are working to engage in initiatives and enhance disclosures in accordance with the recommendations. Based on our awareness that climate change is one of the most crucial global issues having the potential to impact the stability of financial markets, we have positioned addressing environmental issues and climate change as a key part of our corporate strategy and have bolstered the following initiatives as a result of numerous discussions at bodies including the Executive Management Committee, Risk Committee, and the Board of Directors. *A task force led by representatives of the private sector, established in December 2015 based on recommendations from the Financial Stability Board in order to enhance the availability of corporate information related to climate change; issued final report (recommendations) in 2017. Governance Establishment of Environmental Policy and enhancement of group-wide promotion structure Strengthening disclosure Strategy Support for clients’ environmental and climate change initiatives P59 to 62 Scenario analysis based on TCFD Recommendations Risk management Strengthening the management of climate change risks Management of top risks Responsible investment and financing P57 to 58 Indicators and targets Setting of targets pertaining to risks and opportunities P57, 60 Governance Establishment of Environmental Policy and enhancement of group-wide promotion structure We conduct business activities and operations based on the Mizuho Code of Conduct to put the tenets of our Corporate Identity into practice, and the Code of Conduct states: “We will act independently and proactively with the awareness that environmental initiatives represent an essential precondition for the existence and activities of our company.” Establishing our Environmental Policy alongside our Human Rights Policy under the Mizuho Code of Conduct in April 2020 clarified our stance on climate change as well as our environmental awareness and specific actions that we will take on environmental initiatives including those targeting climate change as we work toward transitioning to a low-carbon society. The Environmental Policy clearly states that oversight is provided by the Board of Directors, and in addition to building a strong corporate governance system that promotes environmental initiatives as an integral part of our strategy, Mizuho group companies will establish similar policies to enable us to engage in consistent environmental initiatives on a group-wide basis. Efforts to address climate change We recognize climate change as one of the most crucial global issues with the potential to impact the stability of financial markets, representing a threat to the environment, society, people’s lifestyles, and businesses. At the same time, we believe there are new business opportunities arising from the need to transition to a low-carbon society, such as the field of renewable energy and other businesses and innovations which contribute to mitigating and adapting to the impact of climate change. In light of this, we have included responding to climate change as a key pillar of our business strategy and will take the following actions in order to proactively fulfill our role as a financial services group in the effort to achieve a low-carbon society by 2050.  e will engage in proactive, constructive dialogue in response to our clients’ individual concerns and needs, and in support of their W efforts to introduce climate change countermeasures and transition to a low-carbon society in both the medium and long term.  e will proactively develop and offer financial products and services designed to support clients’ efforts to introduce climate change W countermeasures and transition to a low-carbon society.  e understand the importance of climate-related financial disclosures and we utilize the framework under the Recommendations of W the TCFD in order to leverage growth opportunities and strengthen risk management as well as disclose information in a transparent manner regarding our progress. Mizuho Financial Group Our strategies for creating value Sustainability Strategy Scenario analysis based on TCFD Recommendations Based on the TCFD Recommendations, we conducted a qualitative evaluation of the risks that climate change poses for each sector, and based on the evaluation results and other data, we conducted scenario analysis of the transition risks and physical risks for certain scenarios. In line with the results of our scenario analysis of transition risks, we will further strengthen constructive dialogue (engagement) with our clients and respond with a deep understanding of their challenges and needs. In doing so, we will capture business opportunities and also strengthen risk management. Item Overview International Energy Agency (IEA)’s Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS)1/New Policies Scenario (NPS)2 Scenario In our analysis for impacts on our clients’ business, we employed two scenarios: a static scenario which assumes that no attempt is made to transform the present business structure, and a dynamic scenario under which the business structure is transformed. Targeted sectors Electric utilities and oil, gas & coal sectors in Japan Transition risk Period 2050 (while the IEA scenario is until 2040, the period for this analysis is until 2050) Credit costs Increase of approx. ¥120 billion (dynamic scenario) to ¥310 billion (static scenario) T  his analysis reaffirms the importance of addressing this issue starting now in anticipation of mediumto long-term effects as the transition toward a low-carbon society progresses.

Risk management Strengthening the management of climate change risks Management of top risks Until recently, we have monitored financing and investment from the perspective of environmental and social responsibility in our management of “top risks”, which are risks recognized by management as having major potential impact on the group. We now position climate change risks as “emerging risks”, which we define as major risks that must be addressed in the next few years despite the fact that materialization of the risks will occur over a mediumto long-term time frame, and we have begun periodic monitoring of related indicators.

Mizuho Financial Group conducted an evaluation* of its Board of Directors’ effectiveness in December 2019. *Evaluation period was from April 2018 to June 2019. 1. Evaluation framework The Board of Directors’ effectiveness was evaluated based on Mizuho Financial Group’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. In addition, in conducting the evaluation, one questionnaire was divided into five categories: “Structure of the Board of Directors”, “Operation of the Board of Directors”, “Matters to be discussed”, “Status of issues raised last fiscal year”, and “Committees” (with regard to all 36 questionnaire items, the evaluation uses an absolute scale, a comparison to the previous fiscal year (degree of improvement), and written description format) In particular, questions related to “Necessary qualities and skills for outside directors”, “Agenda and themes to be discussed in the future,” “Contributions of each director to the Board of Directors”, and “Whether discussion was productive and contributions of each director with respect to establishment of our 5-Year Business Plan” utilized the written description format. 2. Evaluation procedure For the evaluation, an external consultant from an independent organization was used to conduct a preliminary questionnaire involving all directors and heads of in-house companies. At the December 2019 Board of Directors’ meeting, the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and measures to be taken going forward were discussed, and self-evaluations were conducted. 3.

Summary With regard to the Board of Directors’ functions and corporate governance, it was confirmed that sophisticated corporate governance has been maintained. For example, taking rigorous measures to address the issues that had been recognized last fiscal year, the situation of which was confirmed to have improved. And in establishing our 5-Year Business Plan, internal and outside directors shared their concerns and understanding with regard to the structural reforms among other Mizuho Financial Group Foundations for our corporate value Corporate governance contributions. Based on this, steady progress was made with the effectiveness of the Board of Directors as a whole and was accordingly evaluated as having been secured. In the meantime, from the viewpoint of further improving the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, we will continue to make further efforts on the following two points: (1) Improving the quality of discussion in the Board of Directors’ meetings focusing on fundamental issues (2) Continuous monitoring of the status of important topics/issues Based on this evaluation of effectiveness, we will continue to implement and consider the additional measures necessary for the Board of Directors to demonstrate its supervisory functions to the fullest extent. Off-site meetings on management issues Off-site meetings on management issues serve an important function in a role that complements the Board of Directors. Designed to enable outside directors to enhance their communications with executives, to fully understand the status of business execution, and to lead to high-quality discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings, off-site meetings are attended by outside directors and cover themes such as topics of concern to senior management. Fiscal 2019 initiatives and number of times held Number of Outline times held Overview of 5-Year Business Plan, plan to reduce cross-shareholdings, control of staffing levels, new HR strategy, Retail & Business Banking Company and Research & Consulting Unit initiatives, current status in 14 each overseas region and future initiatives, etc. Number of times held Visits by outside directors to domestic branches of the Three Core Companies In December 2019, outside directors visited multiple branches to see the situation there following the release of MINORI, our next-generation IT system. At the branches, in addition to being given tours to observe each area of business operations and conducting interviews with branch managers, the outside directors held open discussions with early career employees on site. Upon completion of the site visits, outside directors shared their honest feedback as follows: Feedback from outside directors • I was concerned about the migration to the MINORI system integrated management of the banking, trust banking, and because of the extra burden it placed on the frontlines, but was securities domains is firmly established. relieved to hear that operational efficiency improved, for example • Staff concerns about the transformation into next-generation the closing of accounts for the day is faster than with the old branches are being dispelled. system. • Continual efforts to increase operational efficiency are essential • The boundaries between Mizuho Bank, Mizuho Trust & Banking, in order to win out over the competition. and Mizuho Securities are disappearing, and I realized that the We also heard outside directors voice the opinion that the visits provided a valuable opportunity to listen to feedback from frontlines employees, and we will continue to implement measures designed to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors in the years to come. 2020 Integrated Report 74 Foundations for our corporate value Executive compensation Basic policy The basic policy with respect to determining individual executives’ compensation is as follows: 1) The executive compensation shall be determined based on appropriate governance and control, and function as an appropriate incentive in order to realize management that contributes to value creation for various stakeholders and improve corporate value through continuous and stable corporate growth based on our basic management policies under our Corporate Philosophy. 2) The executive compensation shall be based on the function and responsibility assigned to and the performance of each Officer and other factors. 3) The executive compensation shall contribute to suppressing excessive risk-taking, improving corporate value, and creating value for various stakeholders not only in the short-term, but also over the mediumto long-term. 4) The executive compensation shall reflect the management environment and business performance of our group. 5) The executive compensation shall enable compensation for securing expert personnel such as professionals with a competitive edge in the market. 6) The compensation system and standards shall be timely and appropriately reevaluated and set at a competitive and appropriate standard based on such factors as economic and social conditions and survey data with respect to management compensation provided by external specialized organizations. 7) Regulations, guidelines, etc., concerning executive compensation, both in Japan and overseas, shall be complied with.

Looking back on fiscal 2019 Kobayashi: Looking back, I think fiscal 2019 was a year that we were able to have productive discussions at the Board of Directors. It was the first year of the 5-Year Business Plan, which we had been discussing since the previous fiscal year, and because of the importance of getting the plan off the ground we conducted focused monitoring on the progress of relevant initiatives, mainly structural reforms. As I also mentioned at the Board of Directors meeting, due to these efforts, in fiscal 2019 expense control and other finance structure reforms achieved a degree of success, and Consolidated Net Business Profits exceeded targets. Seeing those and other positive outcomes, I think the plan is off to a good start. In addition, we addressed a significant topic: Mizuho’s relationship with its varied stakeholders. In regard to the shareholder proposal raised in 2019 on sustainability and the proposal to change the body determining the cash dividend within the Articles of Incorporation, we continually discussed the importance of Mizuho fulfilling its responsibility and duty to society and being more proactive about engagement. The supervision side also provided a number of views. Those discussions and views contributed to Mizuho being able to deliver a stronger message in its presentations to external stakeholders. Sakai: Mizuho’s Board of Directors performs its governance functions extremely effectively, with both the business execution side and supervision side remaining diligent. On the business execution side, we discuss matters thoroughly in advance of reporting them to the Board of Directors, but there are many times when the Board Tatsufumi Sakai Member of the Board of Directors President & Group CEO Mizuho Financial Group Foundations for our corporate value Dialogue between the Group CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Directors then gives us valuable comments and suggestions on points that would not have occurred to us otherwise. This helps us see things in a different way. Kobayashi: I think the outside directors on the board, with their wideranging experience and insights, are quite enthusiastic about offering their views. The internal directors then take those views seriously and apply them to business execution. The outside directors and internal directors have developed that sort of trust in each other, so, even while being diligent, we are still able to have a good relationship, which enables governance improvements. One of the unique features of Mizuho’s corporate governance is that, in addition to the Board of Directors meetings, there are also many off-site meetings on management issues. In these meetings, we outside directors have a chance to hear directly from you about the business situation and your thoughts, to listen to in-house company heads’ presentations on in-house company management and perspectives, and to receive additional, separate explanations as needed. The meetings promote meaningful communication and strengthen our relationship of trust with the business execution side. Sakai: Mizuho’s corporate governance structure strictly separates business execution and supervision, making executive officers responsible for a large share of the performance of duties. Nevertheless, we proactively share information with outside directors on any matters requiring their consideration. Just as you said, I think that through this we have been able to develop a good relationship, one which allows for encouraging comments on business execution from outside directors and for candid, constructive dialogue at the Board of Directors. Izumi Kobayashi Chairman of the Board of Directors 2020 Integrated Report 80 Foundations for our corporate value to venture outside Mizuho and take in some different scenery will produce flexible new ideas and approaches for use in Mizuho’s business. In the 5-Year Business Plan, we put forth “Open & Connected” as one of our action principles and called for creating new value incorporating both financial and non-financial products and services. External concurrent assignments are an initiative well suited to this. We will endeavor to develop our talent as a unified group and make those efforts a driver of our 5-Year Business Plan. The Board of Directors’ role going forward Kobayashi: Under the 5-Year Business Plan, transformation towards a new approach to business operations has been moving forward, and the shift to next-generation branches has also begun. While the plan has been progressing, the global outbreak of COVID-19 has been having unpredictable and sizeable impacts on people’s ways of living and working. The situation is very serious worldwide, but the changes taking place in the configuration of the economy and The power behind Mizuho’s corporate value society also bring with them substantial opportunities. Kobayashi: There is no question that we are beginning to get a sense Last December, in my capacity as outside director, I visited of what Mizuho must consider and do in order to create branches in Japan and talked with early career employees. sustainable value in the post-COVID-19 “new normal”. In these and other conversations I had with early career employees and female employees, I could see that they have high expectations for the new HR strategy and are determined to move forward despite the challenges they face. I also met with employees working together as teams across banking, trust banking, and securities and employees striving to develop their individual expertise, all of whom impressed me with their potential as part of the Mizuho group. Making good use of employees with such potential is critical. The key is the communication between managers and their employees, as well as the HR system. When managers can ease employees’ concerns about the future and support them in taking on new challenges, based on an understanding of the new HR strategy framework, employees are better able to develop professionally. Each employee finding satisfaction in their new roles and pursuing their own development furthers Mizuho’s growth. That is the core of the 5-Year Business Plan. Sakai: I can feel that the transition to our new HR strategy is really changing employees’ mindsets. To give an example, in order to create opportunities for employees to take on challenges and exercise their skills outside Mizuho, we began allowing external concurrent assignments, and many employees have been applying for them. Finance is an extremely traditional and orthodox field with a conservative-leaning culture. Allowing employees Mizuho Financial Group Foundations for our corporate value Dialogue between the Group CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors Changes in the business environment may lead to the response to the post-COVID-19 world, we have changes in various stakeholders’ perspectives, which will outside directors with progressive outlooks on business have implications for Mizuho’s approach to engagement. management. I think the membership is very appropriate This new era is again calling into question the conditions for the situation. Considering COVID-19 as a starting point, for Mizuho to continue creating lasting value, is it not? I would like business execution and supervision to be attentive to a wider range of risks, opportunities, and time Sakai: spans; to discuss Mizuho’s unchanging responsibility and For Mizuho to continue creating lasting value for our duty to society, its steady implementation of the 5-Year stakeholders in these times of change, we must be willing Business Plan, and its pursuit of new challenges; and to to confront a variety of changes and undertake our work in unison towards Mizuho creating even greater structural reforms with a strong commitment. value. I hope you will continue giving us your invaluable advice Since Mizuho transitioned to a “company with three so that we may transition to the next generation of committees” model of corporate governance in 2014, financial services and build a stronger and more resilient an outside director has served as the Chairman of the financial group that our customers can depend on in the Board of Directors, and Mizuho’s corporate governance coming era. has steadily evolved. With the robust governance that has been developed to this point as a foundation, I will do my utmost as Chairman to chart a path to the future Kobayashi: for Mizuho while advancing further corporate governance In June, we welcomed new directors and began a improvements. new structure for the Board of Directors. To facilitate 2020 Integrated Report 82 Foundations for our corporate value Risk governance Risk governance overview Risk governance is a part of Mizuho’s corporate governance framework, centered on our risk appetite framework (RAF). The Board of Directors determines fundamental matters regarding the RAF, along with its management systems and specific risk appetites, and incorporates these in document form as the risk appetite statement (RAS). At Mizuho, we also work to foster and promote a sound risk culture to support this risk governance framework. The effective administration of the RAF leads to the creation of a sound risk culture, and at the same time, cultivating a sound risk culture creates a foundation for the disciplined risk-taking and risk communication which are promoted as part of the administration of the RAF. To ensure strong risk governance, we maintain a risk management and compliance structure that operates in accordance with the principles of the “three lines of defense.” Risk culture We foster a sound risk culture in which all executive appropriate risk. These guidelines provide a foundation officers and employees maintain a high level of awareness for the appropriate values and courses of action for regarding risk, and endeavor to make proper judgments Mizuho’s executive officers and employees to take when and take appropriate actions rooted in good sense and approaching risks. The guidelines are aligned with the five ethical standards. Such judgments and actions allow us to Mizuho Values that form a part of Mizuho’s Corporate achieve our risk appetite and enhance our corporate Philosophy, and executive officers and employees can value. refer to them when they are unsure of a risk-related judgment that needs to be made in their daily work.

For Mizuho to put the These initiatives are also important from the standpoint of “customer first principle” into practice and enhance our internal control, ultimately helping to prevent corporate value, it is essential that all members maintain inappropriate behavior by executive officers and an attitude of not simply avoiding risk, but rather taking employees. Risk appetite framework (RAF) The purpose of our RAF is to maximize our corporate business and financial strategies. We will further value by securing sustainable and stable profits, and to concretely define our risk appetite in our medium-term fulfill our social responsibilities.

As the financial services industry and world affairs have developed, steps have been taken to steadily enhance this framework. Formulated in 2010, Basel III is a framework that tightened capital requirements along with introducing liquidity requirements to address issues that came to light in the 2008 global financial crisis. Regulatory reforms following the financial crisis were largely completed in 2017 (Basel III finalization) with reforms aimed at reducing discrepancies among banks regarding the calculation of risk-weighted assets (RWA, which is the denominator of the capital ratio). The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS) agreed to postpone the initial schedule for implementing Basel III finalization by one year due to the COVID-19 outbreak, with this being phased in between 2023 and 2028.

Market risk management method To manage market risk, we set limits that correspond to risk capital strength represented by capital and other indicators. The amount of allocations according to the risk profile of each of our principal risk capital allocated to market risk corresponds to value-at-risk (the banking subsidiaries and other core group companies and thereby “VAR”) and additional costs that may arise in order to close relevant prevent the overall market risk we hold from exceeding our financial positions. Setting limits Monitoring When the above mentioned limits are set, various factors are To provide a system of mutual checks and balances in market taken into account, including business strategies, historical limit operations, we have established middle offices specializing in risk usage ratios, risk-bearing capacity (profits, equity capital, and risk management that are independent of front offices which engage in management framework), profit targets and the market liquidity of market transactions and of back offices which are responsible for the products involved. The limits are discussed and coordinated by book entries and settlements. When VAR is not adequate to control the Risk Management Committee, discussed further by the Executive risk, the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices, Management Committee and then determined by the President & carry out stress testing, and set stop loss limits as needed.

Liquidity categorization We have established a group-wide framework of liquidity risk stages such as “normal,” “anxious” and “crisis,” which reflects funding conditions. In addition, we set early warning indicators (“EWIs”) and monitor on a daily basis to manage funding conditions. The EWIs we use include stock prices, credit ratings, amount of liquidity reserve assets such as Japanese government bonds, and our funding situation.

Measurement of operational risk equivalent 1. Implementation of the Advanced Measurement Approach 2. Outline of the AMA (AMA) Outline of the measurement system We have adopted the AMA for the calculation of operational risk We have established our model by taking account of four elements: equivalent in association with capital adequacy ratios based on the internal loss data; external loss data; scenario analysis and business Basel Accords. However, we use the Basic Indicator Approach for environment; and internal control factors (BEICFs). We calculate entities that are deemed to be less important in the measurement of the operational risk amount by estimating the maximum loss, operational risk equivalent. using a 99.9th percentile one-tailed confidence interval and a oneyear holding period as operational risk equivalent, employing both The measurement results under the AMA are used not only as the internal loss data (i.e., actually experienced operational loss events), operational risk equivalent in the calculation of capital adequacy and scenario data to reflect unexperienced potential future loss ratios but also as Operational VAR for internal risk management events in the measurement. purposes for implementing action plans to reduce operational risk, and other countermeasures. In the measurement of operational risk equivalent as of March 31, 2020, we did not exclude expected losses and also did not recognize the risk mitigating impact of insurance. In addition, we did not take into account the events related to credit risk in measuring operational risk equivalent. Mizuho Financial Group Appendix Risk Management Structure Outline of measurement model Estimation of Frequency Distribution and Loss Severity Operational risk equivalent is calculated as a simple sum of those risk Distribution amounts related to the seven loss event types defined in the Capital Frequency Distribution is estimated by applying information on Adequacy Notice from Japan’s Financial Services Agency, large-scale occurrence frequency of both internal loss data and scenario data to natural disasters, and litigation. In the measurement of operational Poisson Distribution. Loss Severity Distribution is generated as the risk equivalent as of March 31, 2020, we did not reflect the correlation result of combining, through a statistical approach (Extreme Value effects among operational risk related to each of the seven loss event Theory), of the actual distribution for the low severity distribution types. portion created by internal loss data and another loss distribution (Log-normal Distribution or Generalized Pareto Distribution) for the Operational risk by loss event type high severity distribution portion created by scenario data. Loss Distribution (Compound Poisson Distribution) Approach (LDA) is adopted for the calculation of operational risk. LDA is based on the assumption that Poisson Distribution applies to the occurrence frequency of operational risk events, and loss severity is expressed through a separate distribution. Operational risk is calculated for each of the seven loss event types employing both internal loss data, based on our actual experience as operational loss events, and scenario data. Scenario data, expressed as numerical values of occurrence frequency and loss severity, reflects external loss data and BEICFs, in order to estimate unexperienced potential future loss events (of low frequency and high severity). Frequency Distribution and Severity Distribution are estimated employing the above mentioned internal loss data and scenario data, and Monte-Carlo simulations are then applied to these distributions to measure operational risk. The detailed steps of creation of scenario data are explained later in the Scenario Analysis. Outline of measurement model Internal loss data External loss data Business environment and Litigation data internal control factors Scenario analysis Risk amount for litigation risk Large-scale natural Risk amount for large-scale Scenario data disaster scenario data natural disasters Risk amount for internal fraud Risk amount for external fraud Distribution of Distribution of Unified Loss distribution Risk amount for employment internal loss scenario data distribution practices and workplace safety Monte-Carlo simulation Risk amount for customers, Frequency Frequency Frequency products, and business practices distribution distribution distribution Risk amount for damage to information information information physical assets Risk amount Risk amount for business Loss severity Loss severity Loss severity disruption and system failure distribution distribution distribution Calculate risk amount information information information by seven loss event Risk amount for execution, types defined by BIS delivery, and process management Operational VAR (Total operational risk amount) 2020 Integrated Report 124 Appendix Operational risk of large-scale natural disasters Setting units for scenario analysis Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to the datasets expressed as a In order to ensure completeness and sufficiency, we set units that combination of the probability of occurrence of large-scale natural are commonly applied across group entities that adopt AMA (the disasters and the probable loss amount in case of such occurrence, “Group Entities”) by referencing and categorizing risk scenarios as opposed to estimating Frequency Distribution and Loss Severity recognized through control self-assessment, internal loss data of Distribution. the Group Entities, external loss data, etc. Then each of the Group Entities selects the unit on which scenario analysis is conducted from Operational risk of litigation the units established on a group-wide basis in accordance with its Each litigation is converted into data according to the profile of the business activities and operational risk profile. individual litigation to which Monte-Carlo simulation is applied, as opposed to estimating Frequency Distribution and Loss Severity Estimation of occurrence frequency Distribution.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of the audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming the auditor’s opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. (1) Reasonableness of self-assessment of loans, write-offs and reserve provisions Description of Key Audit Matter Auditor’s Response As described in (10) “Reserves for Possible Losses on We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and Loans” in Note 5, “Standards of Accounting Method,” the tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company recognizes the Reserves for Possible Losses on Company’s allowance for loan losses process.

Responsibilities of Management, the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern and disclosing, as required by accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, matters related to going concern. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: ･ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ･ Consider internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for our risk assessments, while the purpose of the audit of the consolidated financial statements is not expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. ･ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ･ Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. ･ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. ･ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with the ethical requirements regarding independence that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Japan, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. 143 From the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Interest Required to Be Disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan Our firm and its designated engagement partners do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan. Convenience Translation The U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year ended March 31, 2020 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of Japanese yen amounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Statements,” which are an integral part of these statements. 156 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Basis for Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared from the accounts maintained by Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. (“MHFG”) and its consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with the provisions set forth in the Company Law of Japan and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law, and in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (“Japanese GAAP”) which are different in certain respects from the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. Certain items presented in the consolidated financial statements which were previously filed with the Director General of the Kanto Local Finance Bureau are reclassified for the convenience of readers outside Japan. The notes to the consolidated financial statements include information which is not required under Japanese GAAP but is presented herein as additional information. The amounts indicated in millions of yen are rounded down by truncating the figures below one million. Totals may not add up exactly because of such truncation. Amounts in U.S. dollars are included solely for the convenience of readers outside Japan. The rate of ¥108.83=US$1.00, the foreign exchange rate on March 31, 2020 has been used for translation. The inclusion of such amounts is not intended to imply that Japanese yen has been or could be readily converted, realized or settled into U.S. dollars at that rate or any other rate. 2. Scope of Consolidation (a) The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MHFG and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “the Group”), including Mizuho Bank, Ltd. (“MHBK”), Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. (“MHTB”), Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. (“MHSC”) and certain other subsidiaries. The numbers of consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 were 126 and 117, respectively. During the period, Mizuho Markets Americas LLC and 19 other companies were newly included in the scope of consolidation as a result of establishment. During the period, Mizuho Delivery Service Co., Ltd. and 10 other companies were excluded from the scope of consolidation as a result of merger and other factors. (b) There were no non-consolidated subsidiaries as of March 31, 2020 and 2019. 3. Application of the Equity Method (a) There were no non-consolidated subsidiaries under the equity method as of March 31, 2020 and 2019. (b) The numbers of affiliates under the equity method as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 were 26 and 22, respectively. Investments in affiliates include JTC Holdings, Ltd., Orient Corporation, Mizuho Leasing Company, Limited and certain other affiliates. During the period, LINE Credit Corporation and 4 other companies were newly included in the scope of the equity method as a result of increasing the shares and other factors. During the period, Qubitous Co., Ltd. was excluded from the scope of the equity method as a result of decreasing the shares. (c) There were no non-consolidated subsidiaries not under the equity method as of March 31, 2020 and 2019. (d) Pec International Leasing Co., Ltd. ,an affiliate not under the equity method, is not accounted for under the equity method, as it is not significant to the consolidated financial statements of MHFG. 157 4. Balance Sheet Dates of Consolidated Subsidiaries (a) Balance sheet dates of consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 are as follows: July 31 1 company December 31 43 companies March 31 82 companies From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Mizuho Capital Markets LLC has changed its balance sheet date from December 31 to March 31. Accounting period in the current fiscal year has been 15 months from January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020. (b) The consolidated subsidiary with balance sheet dates of July 31 was consolidated based on its tentative financial statement as of and for the period ended the consolidated balance sheet date. Other consolidated subsidiaries were consolidated based on their financial statements as of and for the period ended their respective balance sheet dates. The necessary adjustments have been made to the financial statements for any significant transactions that took place between their respective balance sheet dates and the date of the consolidated financial statements. 5. Standards of Accounting Method (1) Credited Loans pursuant to Trading Securities and Trading Income & Expenses Credited loans held for the purpose of trading are, in line with trading securities, recognized on a trade date basis and recorded in Other Debt Purchased on the consolidated balance sheet. Other Debt Purchased related to the relevant credited loans is stated at fair value at the consolidated balance sheet date. Interest received and the gains or losses on the sale of the relevant credited loans during the fiscal year, including the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, are recognized in Other Operating Income and Other Operating Expenses on the consolidated statement of income. (2)Trading Assets & Liabilities and Trading Income & Expenses Trading transactions intended to take advantage of short-term fluctuations and arbitrage opportunities in interest rates, currency exchange rates, market prices of securities and related indices are recognized on a trade-date basis and recorded in Trading Assets or Trading Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Income or expenses generated on the relevant trading transactions are recorded in Trading Income or Trading Expenses on the consolidated statement of income. Securities and other monetary claims held for trading purposes are stated at fair value at the consolidated balance sheet date. Derivative financial products, such as swaps, futures and option transactions, are stated at their fair values, assuming that such transactions are terminated and settled at the consolidated balance sheet date. Trading Income and Trading Expenses include the interest received and paid during the fiscal year, the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value of securities and other monetary claims between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, and the gains or losses resulting from any change in the value of financial derivatives between the beginning and the end of the fiscal year, assuming they were settled at the end of the fiscal year. (3) Securities In accordance with “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (the Business Accounting Deliberation Council, January 22, 1999), MHFG classifies securities, excluding those of investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates, into three categories based upon management's intent. These securities are accounted for as follows: (i) Trading securities are carried at market value and included in Trading Assets. (ii) Bonds held to maturity are stated at amortized cost (straight-line method) and determined by the moving average method. 158 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (iii) Other securities are securities which are not classified as either trading securities or bonds held to maturity. Other securities which have readily determinable fair value are stated at fair value with changes in net unrealized gains or losses, net of applicable income taxes after excluding gains and losses as a result of the fair-value hedge method, included directly in Net Assets. The fair value of Japanese stocks is determined based on the average quoted market price over the month preceding the consolidated balance sheet date. The fair value of securities other than Japanese stocks is determined at the quoted market price if available, or other reasonable value at the consolidated balance sheet date (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the moving average method). Other securities, the fair values of which are extremely difficult to determine, are stated at acquisition cost or amortized cost which is determined by the moving average method. In addition, investments in affiliates not under the equity method are stated at acquisition cost as determined by the moving average method. Securities which are held as trust assets in Money Held in Trust accounts are valued in the same way as Securities above. Certain Securities other than Trading Securities (excluding Securities for which it is deemed to be extremely difficult to determine the fair value) are devalued to the fair value, and the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value is treated as a loss for the fiscal year (“impairment (devaluation)”), if the fair value (primarily the closing market price at the consolidated balance sheet date) has significantly deteriorated compared with the acquisition cost (including amortized cost), and unless it is deemed that there is a possibility of a recovery in the fair value. The amounts of impairment (devaluation) were ¥41,655 million ($382,759 thousand) and ¥4,736 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The criteria for determining whether a security's fair value has “significantly deteriorated” are outlined as follows: • Security whose fair value is 50% or less of the acquisition cost • Security whose fair value exceeds 50% but is 70% or less of the acquisition cost and the quoted market price maintains a certain level or lower (4) Bills Discounted In accordance with “Accounting and Auditing Treatment relating to Adoption of Accounting Standards for Financial Instruments for Banks” (The Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“JICPA”) Industry Audit Committee Report No. 24), bills discounted are accounted for as financing transactions. The banking subsidiaries have rights to sell or pledge these commercial bills, foreign exchange bills purchased and others. The face value of these bills amounted to ¥1,341,367 million ($12,325,349 thousand) and ¥1,487,045 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (5) Derivative Transactions Derivative transactions are valued at fair value with changes in fair value included in current income. Derivatives qualifying as hedges are mainly accounted for using either the fair-value hedge method or the deferred method of hedge accounting (see (22) Hedge Accounting). (6) Tangible Fixed Assets (Except for Lease Assets) Depreciation of buildings is computed mainly by the straight-line method, and that of others is computed mainly by the declining-balance method. The range of useful lives is as follows: Buildings 3 years to 50 years Others 2 years to 20 years (7) Intangible Fixed Assets (Except for Lease Assets) Amortization of Intangible Fixed Assets is computed by the straight-line method. Development costs for internally-used software are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful lives of mainly from five to ten years as determined by MHFG and its consolidated subsidiaries. (8) Lease Assets Depreciation of lease assets booked in Tangible Fixed Assets and Intangible Fixed Assets which are concerned with finance lease transactions that do not transfer ownership is mainly computed by the same method as the one applied to fixed assets owned by us. 159 (9) Deferred Assets Bond issuance costs are expensed as incurred. (10) Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans of major domestic consolidated subsidiaries are maintained in accordance with internally established standards for write-offs and reserve provisions: • For claims extended to obligors that are legally bankrupt under the Bankruptcy Law, Special Liquidation under the Company Law or other similar laws (“Bankrupt Obligors”), and to obligors that are effectively in similar conditions (“Substantially Bankrupt Obligors”), reserves are maintained at the amounts of claims net of direct write-offs described below and the expected amounts recoverable from the disposition of collateral and the amounts recoverable under guarantees. • For claims extended to obligors that are not yet legally or formally bankrupt but are likely to be bankrupt (“Intensive Control Obligors”), reserves are maintained at the amounts deemed necessary based on overall solvency analyses of the amounts of claims net of expected amounts recoverable from the disposition of collateral and the amounts recoverable under guarantees. • For claims extended to Intensive Control Obligors and Obligors with Restructured Loans (defined in Note 12 below) and others, if the exposure to an obligor exceeds a certain specific amount, reserves are provided as follows: (i) if future cash flows of the principal and interest can be reasonably estimated, the discounted cash flow method is applied, under which the reserve is determined as the difference between the book value of the loan and its present value of future cash flows discounted using the contractual interest rate before the loan was classified as a Restructured Loan, and (ii) if future cash flows of the principal and interest cannot be reasonably estimated, reserves are provided for the losses estimated for each individual loan. • For claims extended to other obligors, reserves for the next one year or three years are maintained at rates derived from historical credit loss experience or historical bankruptcy experience for one or three years and making necessary adjustments such as future prospects and others. • Reserve for Possible Losses on Loans to Restructuring Countries is maintained in order to cover possible losses based on analyses of the political and economic climates of the countries. All claims are assessed by each claim origination department in accordance with the internally established “Self-assessment Standard,” and the results of the assessments are verified and examined by the independent examination departments. In the case of claims to Bankrupt Obligors and Substantially Bankrupt Obligors, which are collateralized or guaranteed by a third party, the amounts deemed uncollectible (calculated by deducting the anticipated proceeds from the sale of collateral pledged against the claims and amounts that are expected to be recovered from guarantors of the claims) are written off against the respective claim balances. The total directly written-off amounts were ¥89,216 million ($819,782 thousand) and ¥92,269 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other consolidated subsidiaries provide the amount necessary to cover the loan losses based upon past experience and other factors for general claims and the assessment for each individual loan for other claims. (Additional Information) In light of the principles set forth in the report entitled “Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”)’s supervisory approaches to lending business and loan loss provisioning” published by JFSA in December 18, 2019, we have reflected the potential impact of the COVID-19 on Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans for some credit. More specifically, we have identified certain industries and certain obligors that are expected to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19. For these identified industries and obligors we have updated the estimated expected loss amount by incorporating certain assumptions such as the future recovery periods and the forecasted GDP growth rate in Japan. (11) Reserve for Possible Losses on Investments Reserve for Possible Losses on Investments is maintained to provide against possible losses on investments in securities, after taking into consideration the financial condition and other factors concerning the investee company. (12) Reserve for Bonus Payments Reserve for Bonus Payments, which is provided for future bonus payments to employees, is maintained at the amount accrued at the end of the fiscal year, based on the estimated future payments. 160 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (13) Reserve for Variable Compensation To prepare for the payments of performance payments and stock compensation to be paid as variable compensation within compensation for directors, and executive officers of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd., the estimated payment based on the standard amount regarding variable compensation of the fiscal year is provided. (14) Reserve for Director and Corporate Auditor Retirement Benefits Reserve for Director and Corporate Auditor Retirement Benefits, which is provided for future retirement benefit payments to directors, corporate auditors, and executive officers, is recognized at the amount accrued by the end of the fiscal year, based on the internally established standards. (15) Reserve for Possible Losses on Sales of Loans Reserve for Possible Losses on Sales of Loans is provided for possible future losses on sales of loans at the amount deemed necessary based on a reasonable estimate of possible future losses. (16) Reserve for Contingencies Reserve for Contingencies is maintained to provide against possible losses from contingencies which are not covered by other specific reserves. The balance is an estimate of possible future losses considered to require a reserve. (17) Reserve for Reimbursement of Deposits Reserve for Reimbursement of Deposits is provided against the losses for the deposits derecognized from liabilities at the estimated amount of future claims for withdrawal by depositors. (18) Reserve for Reimbursement of Debentures Reserve for Reimbursement of Debentures is provided for the debentures derecognized from liabilities at the estimated amount for future claims. (19) Reserve under Special Laws Reserve under Special Laws is Reserve for Contingent Liabilities from Financial Instruments and Exchange of ¥2,509 million ($23,063 thousand) and ¥2,473 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This is the reserve pursuant to Article 46-5 of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and Article 175 of the Cabinet Office Ordinance regarding Financial Instruments Business, etc. to indemnify the losses incurred from accidents in the purchase and sale of securities, other transactions or derivative transactions. (20) Accounting Method for Retirement Benefits In calculating retirement benefit obligations, a benefit formula basis is used as a method of attributing expected retirement benefits to the period up to the end of this fiscal year. Unrecognized prior service cost and unrecognized actuarial differences are recognized as follows: Unrecognized prior service cost: Recognized mainly as income or expenses in the period of occurrence. Unrecognized actuarial difference: Recognized as income or expenses from the following fiscal year under the straight-line method over a certain term within the average remaining service period of the employees (mainly 10 years) of the respective fiscal years. Certain consolidated subsidiaries apply the simplified method that assumes the amount required for voluntary resignation at the end of the term to be retirement benefit obligations in computing net defined benefit liability and retirement benefit expenses. 161 (21) Assets and Liabilities Denominated in Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and accounts of overseas branches of domestic consolidated banking subsidiaries and a domestic consolidated trust banking subsidiary are translated into Japanese yen primarily at the exchange rates in effect at the consolidated balance sheet date, with the exception of the investments in affiliates not under the equity method, which are translated at historical exchange rates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies of the consolidated subsidiaries, except for the transactions mentioned above, are translated into Japanese yen primarily at the exchange rates in effect at the respective balance sheet dates. (22) Hedge Accounting (a) Interest Rate Risk The deferred method, the fair-value hedge method or the exceptional accrual method for interest rate swaps are applied as hedge accounting methods. The portfolio hedge transaction for a large volume of small-value monetary claims and liabilities of domestic consolidated banking subsidiaries and domestic consolidated trust banking subsidiaries is accounted for by the method stipulated in the JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No.24, February 13, 2002. The effectiveness of hedging activities for the portfolio hedge transaction for a large volume of small-value monetary claims and liabilities is assessed as follows: (i) as for hedging activities to offset market fluctuation risks, the effectiveness is assessed by bracketing both the hedged instruments, such as deposits and loans, and the hedging instruments, such as interest-rate swaps, in the same maturity bucket. (ii) as for hedging activities to fix the cash flows, the effectiveness is assessed based on the correlation between the base interest rate index of the hedged instrument and that of the hedging instrument. The effectiveness of the individual hedge is assessed based on the comparison of the fluctuation in the market or of cash flows of the hedged instruments with that of the hedging instruments. (b) Foreign Exchange Risk Domestic consolidated banking subsidiaries and domestic consolidated trust banking subsidiaries apply the deferred method of hedge accounting to hedge foreign exchange risks associated with various financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as stipulated in the “Accounting and Auditing Treatment relating to Adoption of Accounting Standards for Foreign Currency Transactions for Banks” (JICPA Industry Audit Committee Report No.25, July 29, 2002). The effectiveness of the hedge is assessed by confirming that the amount of the foreign currency position of the hedged monetary claims and liabilities is equal to or larger than that of currency swap transactions, exchange swap transactions, and similar transactions designated as the hedging instruments of the foreign exchange risk. In addition to the above methods, these subsidiaries apply the deferred method or the fair-value hedge method to portfolio hedges of the foreign exchange risks associated with investments in subsidiaries and affiliates denominated in foreign currency and Other securities denominated in foreign currency (except for bonds) identified as hedged items in advance, as long as the amount of foreign currency payables of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts exceeds the amount of acquisition cost of the hedged foreign securities denominated in foreign currency. (c) Inter-company Transactions Inter-company interest rate swaps, currency swaps and similar derivatives among consolidated companies or between trading accounts and other accounts, which are designated as hedges, are not eliminated and related gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income or deferred under hedge accounting, because these intercompany derivatives are executed according to the criteria for appropriate outside third-party cover operations which are treated as hedge transactions objectively in accordance with JICPA Industry Audit Committee Reports No.24 and 25. As for certain assets and liabilities of MHFG and its consolidated subsidiaries, the deferred method, the fair-value hedge method or the exceptional accrual method for interest rate swaps are applied. (23) Consumption Taxes and Other With respect to MHFG and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, Japanese consumption taxes and local consumption taxes are excluded from transaction amounts. 162 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (24) Amortization Method of Goodwill and Amortization Period Goodwill is amortized over an appropriate period not to exceed 20 years under the straight-line method. The full amount of Goodwill that has no material impact is expensed as incurred. (25) Scope of Cash and Cash Equivalents on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows In the consolidated statement of cash flows, Cash and Cash Equivalents consist of cash and due from central banks included in “Cash and Due from Banks” on the consolidated balance sheet. 6. Changes in Accounting Policies (Application of “Leases” (IFRS 16 and ASU 2016-02)) MHFG has applied “Leases” (IFRS 16 and ASU 2016-02) at some consolidated subsidiaries from the consolidated fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Accordingly, lessees recognize assets and liabilities for all leases as a general rule. In accordance with transitional treatment, MHFG has recognized the impact of adoption of this accounting standard cumulatively as of the date of adoption for balances at the beginning of the consolidated fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. The impact on the consolidated financial statements for the consolidated fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 is immaterial. (Changes in Hedge Accounting) Previously, deferred method or the fair-value hedge method have been applied as hedge accounting methods. From the consolidated fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, hedge accounting methods of some items were changed from fairvalue method to deferred method. Based on current market trends, MHFG reconsidered its risk management activities from the consolidated fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, in order to provide more transparent disclosure in the financial statements. This change has no impact on the gains and losses. 7. Issued but not yet Adopted Accounting Standard and Others 1. Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition and Others ・Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (Accounting Standards Board of Japan ( ASBJ ) Statement No.29, March 31, 2020) ・Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (ASBJ Guidance No.30, March 31, 2020) ・Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (ASBJ Guidance No.19, March 31, 2020) (1) Overview International Accounting Standards Board ( IASB ) and Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) jointly established the comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and issued Revenue from contracts with customers (International Financial Reporting Standards ( IFRS ) 15 / FASB Topic 606). Considering the application of IFRS 15 from the fiscal year beginning on and after January 1, 2018 and Topic 606 from the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2017, ASBJ has established the comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and issued the accounting standard together with the implementation guidance. As a basic policy in establishing the accounting standard for revenue recognition, ASBJ has initiated deliberation on the accounting standard, incorporating the basic principles of IFRS 15 from the standpoint of maintaining comparability between financial statements that is one of benefits of ensuring consistency with IFRS 15. If there were items that should give consideration to practical businesses conducted in Japan, the alternative treatment shall be provided as long as comparability is not harmed. (2) Scheduled Date of Application MHFG is scheduled to apply this accounting standard from the beginning of the consolidated fiscal year starting on April 1, 2021. (3) Effect of Application of this accounting standard The effect of the application of this accounting standard is under assessment. 163 2. Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement and Others ・Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement (ASBJ Statement No.30 July 4, 2019) ・Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement (ASBJ Guidance No.31, July 4, 2019) ・Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments (ASBJ Statement No.10, July 4, 2019) ・Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (ASBJ Guidance No.19, March 31, 2020) (1) Overview Considering the situation where IASB and FASB have provided almost the same detailed guidance on fair value measurement (IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement / US Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement ), ASBJ has implemented initiatives to ensure consistency between Japanese and international accounting standards, mainly with regard to guidance and disclosure about fair value of financial instruments, and has issued Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement and others. As a basic policy of ASBJ in establishing accounting standard for fair value measurement, it has been decided to basically adopt all of the provisions of IFRS 13 from the perspective of improving comparability between financial statements of domestic and foreign companies using a unified measurement method. If there were items that should give consideration to practical businesses conducted in Japan, the alternative treatment shall be provided as long as comparability is not harmed. (2) Scheduled Date of Application MHFG is scheduled to apply this accounting standard from the beginning of the consolidated fiscal year starting on April 1, 2020. (3) Effect of Application of this accounting standard The effect of the application of this accounting standard is under assessment. 3. Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates ・Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates (ASBJ Statement No.31, March 31, 2020) (1) Overview In response to requests to consider requiring disclosure as footnote information under Japanese GAAP of Sources of Estimation Uncertainty that is required to be disclosed by Paragraph 125 of International Accounting Standards 1 Presentation of Financial Statements ( IAS 1 ) issued by IASB in 2003 as such information is considered highly useful to financial statements users, ASBJ has established and issued accounting standards for disclosure of accounting estimates. As a basic policy of ASBJ in establishing this accounting standard, it has been decided not to expand requirements for individual notes but to provide principles (disclosure purposes), and a company determines the contents of disclosure in light of the disclosure purposes. In establishing this accounting standard, it has been decided that the provisions of IAS 1, Paragraph 125 are referred to. (2) Scheduled Date of Application MHFG is scheduled to apply this accounting standard from the end of the consolidated fiscal year starting on April 1, 2020. 8. Additional Information (The Board Benefit Trust (“BBT”) Program) Since MHFG operates its business to contribute to the creation of value for diverse stakeholders and realize improved corporate value through the continuous and stable growth of MHFG group pursuant to MHFG’s basic management policy defined under the Mizuho Financial Group’s Corporate Identity, MHFG has introduced a stock compensation program using a trust (the “Program”) that functions as an incentive for each Director, Executive Officer, and Specialist Officer to exert maximum effort in performing his or her duties, and also as consideration for such exertion of effort. (1) Outline of the Program The Program has adopted the Board Benefit Trust (“BBT”) framework. MHFG’s shares on the stock market will be acquired through a trust established based on the underlying funds contributed by MHFG, and MHFG’s shares will be distributed to Directors, Executive Officers, and Specialist Officers of MHFG, Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. (the “Company Group”) in accordance with the Rules on Distribution of Shares to be prescribed in advance. The framework consists of the stock compensation program based on the Company Group Officer’s position in their respective company (“Stock Compensation I”) and the stock compensation program based on the performance evaluation of the Company Group (“Stock Compensation II”). Stock Compensation I will be paid at the time of retirement in the form of shares of MHFG calculated based on their position. A system is adopted which enables a decrease or forfeiture of the amount depending on the performance of the company or the individual. 164 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Stock Compensation II will be paid in the form of shares of MHFG and will be deferred over three years, which is calculated based on the status of achieving our Five-Year Business Plan. A system is adopted which enables a decrease or forfeiture of the amount depending on the performance of the company or the individual. Upon the payment of stock compensation under the Program, MHFG may, for a certain portion, pay a monetary amount equivalent to the market value of its stock in lieu of stock compensation in accordance with the Rules on Distribution of Shares. Voting rights related to MHFG’s shares belonging to the trust assets under the trust shall not be exercised. (2) MHFG’s Shares Outstanding in the Trust MHFG’s shares outstanding in the trust are recognized as Treasury Stock under Net Assets at the carrying amount (excluding the amount of incidental expenses) in the trust. The carrying amount of such Treasury Stock as of March 31, 2020 was ¥3,485 million ($32,026 thousand) for 19,636 thousand shares. (The carrying amount of such Treasury Stock as of March 31, 2019 was ¥3,569 million for 18,917 thousand shares.) (Application of tax-effect accounting to the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Aggregation System) Some domestic consolidated subsidiaries of the Group record amounts of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities based on the provisions of tax laws prior to amendment under the treatment in Paragraph 3 of Treatment of the application of the taxeffect accounting in relation to the transition from the consolidated tax system to the aggregate group system (Practical Solutions No.39 March 31, 2020), without applying the provisions of Paragraph 44 of Guidance on Accounting Standard for taxeffect accounting (Implementation Guidance No.28 February 16, 2018), regarding the tax items for which review of the nonconsolidated Tax Payment System was implemented in accordance with the transition to the aggregated group system established under the Act for Partial Revision of the Income Tax Act, etc. (Act No. 8 of 2020) and the transition to the aggregated group system. 9.

Note: The amounts given in the above table are gross amounts before deduction of amounts for the Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans. 166 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Commitment Line for Loans Overdraft protection on current accounts and contracts of the commitment line for loans are contracts by which banking subsidiaries are bound to extend loans up to the prearranged amount, at the request of customers, unless the customer is in breach of contract conditions. The unutilized balance of these contracts amounted to ¥90,835,753 million ($834,657,299 thousand) and ¥91,744,406 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of these amounts, ¥68,937,304 million ($633,440,265 thousand) and ¥69,611,691 million as of March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, relate to contracts of which the original contractual maturity is one year or less, or which are unconditionally cancelable at any time. Since many of these contracts expire without being exercised, the unutilized balance itself does not necessarily affect future cash flows. A provision is included in many of these contracts that entitles the banking subsidiaries to refuse the execution of loans, or reduce the maximum amount under contracts when there is a change in the financial situation, necessity to preserve a claim, or other similar reasons. The banking subsidiaries require collateral such as real estate and securities when deemed necessary at the time the contracts are entered into. In addition, they periodically monitor customers’ business conditions in accordance with internally established standards and take necessary measures to manage credit risks such as amendments to contracts. 13.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 41. Financial Instruments 1. Matters Relating to the Conditions of Financial Instruments (1) Policy on Financial Instruments Mizuho Financial Group (MHFG), which primarily engages in banking business, incurs financial liabilities such as customer deposits and market deposits on the funding side while holding financial assets such as customer loans, stocks and bonds on the investment side, and also engages in trading business for certain financial products. Some majority-owned consolidated subsidiaries and other subsidiaries conduct securities business and other financial business. For above funding and investment business, MHFG appropriately manages risks of each financial instrument and carefully watches term-gaps and other risk factors. (2) Contents and Risk of Financial Products The main financial assets of the Mizuho group consist of loans to customers, government bonds and stocks. These financial assets are subject to various types of risk that may cause the Group to incur losses due to a decline in, or total loss of, the value of assets, as a result of deterioration in a counterparty’s and/or an issuer’s financial position (“credit risk”), or due to a decline in the value of assets caused by fluctuations in interest rates, stock prices and foreign exchange rates and so on (“market risk”). The Group may also be exposed to the risk of incurring losses when it becomes impossible to execute transactions in the market because of market confusion or losses arising from transactions at prices that are significantly less favorable than usual (“market liquidity risk “). The main financing source of the Mizuho group is a stable source of deposits from its customers in addition to direct funding from the financial market. These financing sources are subject to the risk of losses (“liquidity risk”) arising from funding difficulties due to market disruption or a deterioration in our financial position that makes it difficult for us to raise the necessary funds or that forces us to raise funds at significantly higher interest rates than usual. In addition, the Mizuho group uses derivative financial products to control the interest rate risk related to the assets and liabilities of the Group, as part of our asset and liability management (“ALM”). The Group primarily utilizes the portfolio hedge by grouping numerous financial assets and liabilities such as loans and deposits into similar interest risk units in accordance with risk management policies. Some derivative products like interest rate swaps are used as hedging methods for cash-flow hedges or fair value hedges. The Group applies hedge accounting to the majority of these products, treating them as deferred hedges. The effectiveness of the hedges is assessed periodically by regression analysis and other methods to ensure whether the derivative financial products effectively work in order to offset the exposure to changes in fair value and variable cash flows from hedged items. It should be noted that the Mizuho Group uses derivative financial products for trading purposes and so on as well. (3) Risk Management for Financial Products (a) Commitment to Risk Management We recognize the conducting of operations tailored to the risks and managing such risks as a key issue relating to overall management. In order to implement our business strategy while maintaining our financial stability, we maintain comprehensive risk management and control measures. We maintain basic policies for risk management established by our Board of Directors that are applicable to the entire Mizuho group. These policies clearly define the kinds of risks to be managed, set forth the organizational structure and provide for the human resources training necessary for appropriate levels of risk management. The policies also provide for audits to measure the effectiveness and suitability of the risk management structure. In line with these basic policies, we maintain various measures to strengthen and enhance the sophistication of our risk management system. (b) General Concept of Risk Management We classify our risk exposures according to the various kinds of risk, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and operational risk, and manage each type of risk according to its characteristics. In addition to managing each type of risk individually, we have established a risk management structure to identify and evaluate overall risk and, where necessary, to devise appropriate responses to keep risk within limits that are managerially acceptable in both qualitative and quantitative terms. More specifically, we allocate risk capital to core group companies, including their respective subsidiaries, to control risk within the limits set for each company. We also control risk within managerially acceptable limits by 195 working to ensure that the overall risk we hold on a consolidated basis does not exceed the Group’s financial strength. To ensure the ongoing financial health of Mizuho Financial Group, we regularly monitor the manner in which risk capital is being used in order to obtain a proper grasp of the risk profile within this framework. Reports are also submitted to the Board of Directors and other committees of each company. (c) Credit Risk Management The Board of Directors of Mizuho Financial Group determines basic matters pertaining to credit risk management. In addition, we have established the Risk Management Committee, as one of its Business Policy Committees. This committee broadly discusses and coordinates basic policy in connection with credit risk management matters in connection with overall credit portfolio management and credit risk monitoring for the Mizuho group. Under the control of the Chief Risk Officer of Mizuho Financial Group, the Credit Risk Management Department and the Risk Management Department jointly monitor, analyze and submit suggestions concerning credit risk and formulate and execute plans in connection with basic matters pertaining to credit risk management. We have adopted two different but mutually complementary approaches in credit risk management. The first approach is “credit management,” in which we manage the process for each individual transaction and individual obligor from execution until collection, based on our assessment of the credit quality of the customer. Through this process, we curb losses in the case of a credit event. The second is “credit portfolio management,” in which we utilize statistical methods to assess the potential for losses related to credit risk. Through this process, we identify credit risk and respond appropriately. We use statistical methods to manage the possibility of losses by measuring the expected average loss for a oneyear risk horizon (“expected loss”) and the maximum loss within a certain confidence interval (“credit VAR”). The difference between expected loss and credit VAR is measured as the credit risk amount (“unexpected loss”).Our principal banking subsidiaries have established guidelines to manage “credit concentration risk,” which stems from granting excessive credit to certain corporate groups. The Board of Directors of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies determines key matters pertaining to credit risk management by establishing their respective basic policies in line with the basic policies for credit risk management set forth by Mizuho Financial Group. Their respective Business Policy Committees are responsible for discussing and coordinating overall management of their individual credit portfolios and transaction policies towards obligors. The Chief Risk Officer of each principal banking subsidiary and core group company is responsible for matters relating to planning and implementing credit risk management. Departments in charge of credit risk management are responsible for planning and administering credit risk management and conducting credit risk measuring and monitoring. Credit Departments determine policies and approves/disapproves individual transactions regarding review and management of and collection from customers in accordance with the lines of authority set forth by each principal banking subsidiary. In addition, each of our principal banking subsidiaries has also established internal audit groups that are independent of the business departments in order to ensure appropriate credit risk management. (d) Market Risk Management The Board of Directors of Mizuho Financial Group determines basic matters pertaining to market risk management policies. In addition, we have established the Risk Management Committee, as one of its Business Policy Committees. The committee broadly discusses and coordinates matters concerning basic policy and operations in connection with market risk management and market risk monitoring, and proposes measures to be taken in emergencies such as sudden market changes. The Chief Risk Officer of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for matters relating to market risk management planning and operations. The Risk Management Department of Mizuho Financial Group is responsible for monitoring market risk, reports and analyses, proposals, setting limits and guidelines, and formulating and implementing plans relating to market risk management. In addition, the department assesses and manages the overall market risk of the Mizuho group as a whole and keeps track of the market risk situation of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies. The department also submits reports to the President & CEO on a daily basis and to our Board of Directors and the executive management committee of Mizuho Financial Group on a regular basis. To manage market risk, we set limits that correspond to risk capital allocations. The amount of risk capital allocated to market risk corresponds to VAR and additional costs that may arise in order to close relevant positions. 196 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements For trading and banking activities, we set limits for VAR and for losses. For banking activities, we set position limits based on interest rate sensitivity as needed. The Board of Directors of each of our principal banking subsidiaries and other core group companies determine key matters pertaining to market risk by establishing their respective basic policies in line with the basic policies for market risk management set forth by Mizuho Financial Group. Based on a common Mizuho Group risk capital allocation framework, the above-mentioned companies manage market risk by setting limits according to the risk capital allocated to market risk by Mizuho Financial Group. They have the same market risk management structure as the Mizuho Financial Group, such as their Business Policy Committees being responsible for overall discussion and coordination of the market risk management. In addition, they have established middle offices specializing in risk management that are independent of their front offices, which engage in market transactions, and their back offices, which are responsible for book entries and settlements. This system enables them to achieve mutual checks and control over market operations. When VAR is not adequate to control risk, the middle offices manage risk using additional risk indices such as 10 BPV (Basis Point Value), carry out stress tests and set stop loss limits as needed. (e) Situation of Market Risk i. Banking Business The following table shows the VAR figures relating to our banking activities for the fiscal years indicated: Billions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars For the Fiscal Years ended March 31, 2020 2019 2020 As of fiscal year end ¥361.4 ¥194.4 $3,320,879 Maximum 361.4 298.5 3,320,879 Minimum 167.9 194.4 1,543,480 Average 215.7 255.5 1,982,448 [Definition of Banking Business] The following transactions are categorized as banking business, with trading business and cross-shareholdings being categorized separately. (1) Deposits and loans as well as related funding activities, and hedge against interest rate risk. (2) Equity (excluding cross-shareholdings), bonds, investment trusts, etc. and hedges against related market risk. The core deposit of liquid deposits is to be specified and incorporated into the measurement of market risk. Banking business VAR used to calculate Market Risk Equivalent is based on the following: • VAR : historical simulation method; • confidence interval: one-tailed 99%; • holding period of one month ; and • historical observation period of three years. 197 ii. Trading Business The following table shows VAR figures of our trading activities for the fiscal years indicated : Billions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars For the Fiscal Years ended March 31, 2020 2019 2020 As of fiscal year end ¥8.3 ¥2.6 $76,349 Maximum 11.8 9.2 108,900 Minimum 2.3 2.4 21,682 Average 3.8 3.4 35,103 [Definition of Trading Business] (1) Transactions held for the purpose of short-term resale. (2) Transactions held for the purpose of making a profit from price fluctuations over a short period as well as fixing a profit from arbitrage activities. (3) Deals that have both aspects of (1) and (2) above. (4) Deals held for broking business or market making business. Trading business VAR used to calculate Market Risk Equivalent is based on the following: • VAR: historical simulation method; • confidence interval: one-tailed 99%; • holding period of one trading day; and • historical observation period of three years. iii. Cross-shareholdings For cross-shareholdings, we take the same market risk management approach as that for Banking and Trading businesses with the use of VAR and risk indices. The risk index for the cross-shareholdings (sensitivity of the portfolio to a 1% change in the equity index of TOPIX) is ¥13.9 billion ($127,360 thousand) and ¥28.0 billion for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. iv. Risk management using VAR VAR is a commonly used market risk management technique with statistical assumptions to measure maximum possible loss in the market, which will be incurred to the holding portfolio in a certain period with some probability. It should be noted that in general VAR model has the following shortcomings: • VAR estimates could differ by assumptions of holding period, confidence interval level and approaches for the measurement. • VAR which is calculated based on historical data does not necessarily indicate an accurate future possible maximum loss. • VAR might underestimate the probability of extreme market movements when the market gets inactive as VAR assumes sales of holding portfolio and hedges in the market during the holding period for the calculation. • The use of a 99% confidence level neither takes account of, nor makes any statement about, any losses that might occur beyond this confidence level. The historical simulation method used as the measurement technique of VAR assumes that change in a market movement follows an empirical distribution. Therefore, the model might underestimate the risk under the circumstance that the market is likely to move extremely beyond the assumption. We check the validity of the market risk measurement made by VAR approach periodically by the back-test which compares VAR with actual profit and loss. In addition to VAR, we make a wide variety of management and controls such as risk indices monitoring, implementation of stress tests, loss limit monitoring in order to make strict risk management by capturing carefully all risks, including what VAR approach is not able to cover. (f) Liquidity Risk Management Our liquidity risk management structure is generally the same as the market risk management structure described above (“Item (d) Market Risk Management”). However, the head of the Financial Control & Accounting Group of Mizuho Financial Group is additionally responsible for matters relating to planning and running cash flow management operations, while the Financial Planning Department is responsible for monitoring and adjusting 198 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements the cash flow management situation and for planning and implementing cash flow management. Reports on the cash flow situation are submitted to the Risk Management Committee, the Balance Sheet Management Committee, the executive management committee and the President & CEO. We measure liquidity risk using indices pertaining to cash flow, such as limits on funds raised in the market. Limits on liquidity risk are discussed and coordinated by the Risk Management Committee, discussed further by the executive management committee and determined by the President & CEO. We have established classifications for the cash flow conditions affecting the Group, ranging from “normal” to “anxious” and “crisis,” and have established procedures for dealing with cases which are deemed to fall into the “anxious” or “crisis” categories. In addition, we have constructed a system under which we will be able to respond smoothly in the event of emergency situations that affect our funding by establishing action plans. (4) Supplementary Explanation of Matters Relating to Fair Value of Financial Instruments and Others Fair values of financial instruments include the values based on market prices, and the values deemed as market prices obtained by the reasonable estimate when the financial instruments do not have market prices. Since certain assumptions and others are adopted for calculating such values, they may differ when adopting different assumptions and others. 199 2.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Note 1) Calculation method of fair value of financial instruments Assets (1) Cash and Due from Banks For Due from Banks which have no maturity, since fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values. For Due from Banks which have maturity, since contractual terms of these items are mainly short (i.e., within six months) and fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values. (2) Call Loans and Bills Purchased, (3) Receivables under Resale Agreements and (4) Guarantee Deposits Paid under Securities Borrowing Transactions Since contractual terms of these items are mainly short (i.e., within six months) and fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values. (5) Other Debt Purchased Fair values of Other Debt Purchased are based on the values deemed as market prices obtained by the reasonable estimate such as those obtained from brokers and financial information vendors. (6) Trading Assets Fair values of securities held for trading, such as bonds held for trading, are based on the market prices and others. (7) Money Held in Trust As to securities managed as trust assets in a directed money trust for separate investment with the management of securities as its primary purpose, fair values of these items are calculated using the method stated in (8). For other Money Held in Trust, since fair values of these items approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values. The notes to Money Held in Trust based on holding purpose are stated in “42.Fair Value of Securities and Money Held in Trust.” (8) Securities Fair values of stocks are based on the prices on securities exchanges, and those of bonds and others are based on the market prices, valuations obtained from brokers and information vendors and others. Fair values of investment trusts are based on the disclosed net asset value and others. Fair values of private placement bonds are calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest and others at interest rates based on the discount rate reflecting expected loss and various risk factors by categories according to the internal ratings and terms. Fair values of securitized products are based on valuations obtained from brokers and others, and reasonably calculated prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management. In deriving reasonably calculated prices based on the reasonable estimates of our management mentioned above, we used the discounted cash flow method. The price decision variables include default rates, recovery rates, pre-payment rates, and discount rates. Fair values of Floating-rate Japanese Government Bonds, according to our determination that current market prices may not reflect the fair value, are based on the reasonably calculated prices as book value. In deriving the reasonably calculated prices, we used the discount cash flow method as well as other methods. The price decision variables include the yield of 10-year Japanese Government Bonds and the volatilities of interest rate swap options for 10-year Japanese Government Bonds as underlying assets. The notes to Securities based on holding purpose are stated in “42.Fair Value of Securities and Money Held in Trust.” (9) Loans and Bills Discounted Fair values of Loans and Bills Discounted are calculated by the total amount of principal and interest and others at interest rates based on the discount rate reflecting expected loss and various risk factors by categories according to the types, internal ratings and terms of the Loans and Bills Discounted. In addition, as to claims against bankrupt obligors, substantially bankrupt obligors and intensive control obligors, since the estimated amount of bad debts is calculated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows or the estimated amounts that we would be able to collect from collateral and guarantees, fair values approximate the amount of Debentures and others minus the amount of 203 Reserves for Possible Losses on Loans in the consolidated balance sheet as of the consolidated balance sheet date and we thus deem such amount to be fair values. Of the Loans and Bills Discounted, for those without a fixed maturity due to loan characteristics such as limiting loans to within the value of pledged assets, we deem book values to be fair values since fair values are expected to approximate book values based on the estimated loan periods, interest rates and other conditions. Liabilities (1) Deposits (2) Negotiable Certificates of Deposit For demand deposits, we deem the payment amounts required on the consolidated balance sheet date (i.e., book values) to be fair values. In addition, fair values of fixed deposits and negotiable certificates of deposits are calculated by classifying them based on their terms and by discounting the future cash flows. The discount rates used in such calculations are the interest rates. Since fair values of those whose deposit terms are short (i.e., within six months) approximate book values, we mainly deem the book values to be fair values. (3) Call Money and Bills Sold, (4) Payables under Repurchase Agreements and (5) Guarantee Deposits Received under Securities Lending Transactions Since contractual terms of these financial instruments are mainly short (i.e., within six months) and fair values approximate book values, we deem the book values to be fair values. (6) Trading Liabilities Fair values of Securities Sold, Not yet Purchased in Trading Liabilities are based on the market prices and others. (7) Borrowed Money Fair values of Borrowed Money are calculated mainly by discounting the total amount of the principal and interest of such Borrowed Money classified by certain period at the interest rates considered to be applicable to similar loans. (8) Bonds and Notes Fair values of Bonds and Notes issued by MHFG and its consolidated subsidiaries are based on the market prices for Bonds and Notes which have market prices, and calculated by discounting the total amount of principal and interest by the interest rates considered to be applicable to similar Bonds and Notes for those which do not have market prices. (9) Due to Trust Accounts Due to Trust Accounts of consolidated trust banking subsidiaries is used for transactions in which consolidated trust banking subsidiaries manage fund entrusted to them in bank accounts of consolidated trust banking subsidiaries. As the purpose is considered to approximate demand deposit, we deem the book values to be fair values. Derivative Transactions Derivative transactions include interest rate-related transactions (futures, options, swaps and others), currency-related transactions (futures, options, swaps and others), bond-related transactions (futures, futures options and others), and are based on the prices on securities exchanges, discounted value of future cash flows, option pricing models and others. 204 Financial Data of Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.

We calculate our capital adequacy ratio on a consolidated basis based on “the criteria used by a bank holding company for deciding whether or not the adequacy of equity capital of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries is appropriate in light of the assets owned by the bank holding company and its subsidiaries pursuant to Article 52-25 of the Banking Law” (Financial Services Agency, or FSA, Notice No.20 issued in 2006). We also calculate our leverage ratio on a consolidated basis according to “the criteria for evaluating the soundness of the leverage, prescribed as supplemental requirements of the criteria used by a bank holding company in deciding whether or not the adequacy of equity capital of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries is appropriate in light of the assets owned by the bank holding company and its subsidiaries, pursuant to Article 52-25 of the Banking Law” (FSA Notice No.12 issued in 2019.) Liquidity standards agreed upon by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision require our liquidity coverage ratio to surpass certain minimum standards. We calculate our consolidated liquidity coverage ratio (the “Consolidated LCR”) in accordance with the regulation “The Evaluation Criterion on the Sound Management of Liquidity Risk Defined, Based on Banking Law Article 52-25, as One of Criteria for Bank Holding Companies to Evaluate the Soundness of Their Management and the Ones of Their Subsidiaries and Others, which is also One of Evaluation Criteria on the Soundness of the Banks' Management”(the FSA Notice No. 62 of 2014 (the “Notice No. 62”)). ■ Key Metrics KM1: Key Metrics (millions of yen, except percentages) a b c d e Basel III As of As of As of As of As of Template March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, No. 2020 2019 2019 2019 2019 Capital 1 Common Equity Tier 1 capital ¥7,244,776 ¥7,535,918 ¥7,383,281 ¥7,413,983 ¥7,390,058 2 Tier 1 capital 9,024,404 9,327,154 9,161,779 8,956,734 9,232,160 3 Total capital 10,722,278 11,052,065 10,864,818 10,714,473 10,917,507 Risk weighted assets 4 Risk weighted assets 62,141,217 63,219,955 60,599,128 59,928,686 57,899,567 Capital ratio 5 Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio 11.65% 11.92% 12.18% 12.37% 12.76% 6 Tier 1 capital ratio 14.52% 14.75% 15.11% 14.94% 15.94% 7 Total capital ratio 17.25% 17.48% 17.92% 17.87% 18.85% Capital buffer 8 Capital conservation buffer requirement 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% 2.50% 9 Countercyclical buffer requirement 0.01% 0.04% 0.05% 0.05% 0.05% 10 Bank G-SIB/D-SIB additional requirements 1.00% 1.00% 1.00% 1.00% 1.00% 11 Total of bank CET1 specific buffer requirements 3.51% 3.54% 3.55% 3.55% 3.55% CET1 available after meeting the bank's 12 7.15% 7.42% 7.68% 7.87% 8.26% minimum capital requirements Leverage ratio 13 Total exposures 220,977,568 211,843,311 210,901,420 208,837,962 208,557,401 14 Leverage ratio 4.08% 4.40% 4.34% 4.28% 4.42% Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) Total HQLA allowed to be included in the 15 60,112,726 60,243,374 58,141,304 61,006,477 59,797,149 calculation 16 Net cash outflows ¥43,816,756 ¥41,800,058 ¥41,230,070 ¥42,792,200 ¥41,447,805 17 LCR 137.3% 144.1% 141.0% 142.5% 144.3% Note: Base Ⅲ Template No. from 15 to 17 are quarterly averages. 251 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Status of Mizuho Financial Group’s Consolidated Capital Adequacy The information disclosed herein is in accordance with Matters Separately Prescribed by the Commissioner of the Financial Services Agency Regarding Status of the Adequacy of Equity Capital Pursuant to Article 19-2, Paragraph 1, Item 5, Subitem (d), etc. of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Banking Law (the FSA Notice No. 7 issued in 2014). ■ Scope of Consolidation (1) Scope of Consolidation for Calculating Consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio (a) Difference from the Companies Included in the Scope of Consolidation Based on Consolidation Rules for Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements (the “Scope of Accounting Consolidation”) None as of March 31, 2020 and 2019 (b) Number of Consolidated Subsidiaries As of March 31, 2020 As of March 31, 2019 Consolidated subsidiaries 126 117 Our major consolidated subsidiaries are Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.

Maintaining a sufficient BIS capital ratio We confirm our maintenance of a high level of financial soundness by conducting regular evaluations to examine whether our risk-based capital is adequate in qualitative as well as quantitative terms, in light of our business plans and strategic targets to match the increase in risk-weighted assets acquired for growth, in addition to maintaining our capital above the minimum requirements of common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, total capital ratio, capital buffer ratio, adequate leverage ratio and TLAC ratio. Balancing risk and capital On the basis of the framework for allocating risk capital, after obtaining the clearest possible grasp of the group’s overall risk exposure, we endeavor to control risk so as to keep it within the range of our business capacity by means of allocating capital that corresponds to the amount of risk to the principal banking subsidiaries, etc., within the bounds of our capital, and we conduct regular assessments to ensure that a sufficient level of capital is maintained for our risk profile. When making these assessments, we calculate the potential losses arising from assumed stress events and risk volumes, which we assess whether they balance with the group’s capital. Stress events are based on risk scenarios that are formulated based on the current economic condition and the economic outlook, etc. In addition, we examine whether an appropriate return on risk is maintained in the assessments. 253 (2) Composition of Capital, etc. (a) CC1: Composition of Capital Disclosure (Millions of yen, except percentage) a b c Basel III Reference Template As of March As of

The following business units have adopted AIRB approach: Mizuho Financial Group, Inc., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd., Mizuho Credit Guarantee Co., Ltd., Mizuho Trust Realty Company Limited, Mizuho Bank (China), Mizuho Bank (USA), Ltd., Mizuho Bank Europe N.V., and Mizuho Capital Markets LLC., Mizuho Markets Cayman LP., and Mizuho Markets Americas LLC. Note: Special purpose companies (SPCs) controlled by the above companies have also adopted the AIRB approach due to their business operations integrated with their parent companies. The application scope of AIRB is determined through taking into account the importance for each business unit, such as the ratio of its credit RWA to that of the entire group. AIRB is generally applied to those assets held by the business units that have adopted AIRB except for some asset classes considered immaterial for the purpose of calculating credit RWA .In addition, AIRB is used for all equity exposures regardless of what approach the business unit has adopted. With respect to credit RWA exposures under Regarded-Method, AIRB is used for those of which the look-through approach is applied except for cases where it is difficult to accurately calculate credit RWA regarding their underlying assets based on the IRB Approach and therefore reliability of credit RWA cannot be secured. The standardized approach will be applied to any of those business units and asset classes that do not meet the above conditions. (ii) Summary of Our Internal Rating System See pages 114 to 116 for a summary of our internal rating system and rating assignment procedures. Estimation of parameters and validation We use our own estimates for the parameters indicated below in the calculation of credit RWA under the Basel Framework. We generally validate the parameters by backtesting or other methods on an annual basis. Methods of estimation and validation as well as results are approved by the Chief Risk Officer. PD Probability of default (likelihood of default of an obligor over a period of one year) LGD Loss given default EAD Exposure at default The definition of default conforms to the Notice issued by Japan’s Financial Services Agency. Details of Estimates: We estimate PD of corporate, sovereign and bank exposures per obligor rating, and that of retail exposures per pool allocations. In making estimations, we make conservative adjustments such as accounting for estimation error on the long-term average of internal default records. We supplement estimations for low default portfolios with external data. We apply the regulatory floor PD (0.03%) to A1-rated obligors in the measurement of credit RWA, except for sovereign exposures. The estimated parameters in almost all the PD categories such as obligor rating or pool allocations exceeded actual defaults in the last three years. The differences stemmed from such reasons as: actual defaults in the last few years were lower than the long-term average of the defaults over the entire period, which was the basis for our estimation; conservative adjustments have been made to estimated parameters. We estimate LGD based on obligor classifications in our self-assessments or pool allocations, and protection coverage. For LGD per obligor classifications, we estimate LGD under normal economic circumstances based on prior defaulted obligor data, making adjustments in consideration of periods of economic downturn using stochastic methods. Our estimation is based on validation of the time between the default event and the closure of the exposure as well as LGD for low default portfolios etc. With regard to protection, we estimate LGD per type of collateral using some external data. We estimate EAD based on prior defaulted obligor data. (iii) Asset Class-based EAD Ratios to the Total EAD by Credit RWA Calculation Approach As of March 31, 2020 As of March 31, 2019 Internal Ratings-based Approach 98.18% 98.08% Corporate 87.78% 86.81% Retail 5.70% 6.12% Equities 1.95% 2.44% Purchase Receivables 1.45% 1.62% Others 1.29% 1.07% Standardized Approach 1.81% 1.91% Total 100.00% 100.00% Notes: 1. Counterparty credit risk exposures, securitization exposures, and regarded-method exposures are excluded from the amount of credit risk exposures above. 2. As for any portfolio to which the standardized approach is applied, exposure instead of EAD is used for calculation. 282 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Status of Mizuho Financial Group’s Consolidated

In obtaining the collateral and guarantees, we evaluate the value of the collateral, guarantee performance capability of guarantor and legal enforceability, and we also conduct periodical subsequent re-evaluations. Furthermore, we monitor any concentration of risks in particular corporate groups including indirect credit exposure such as collateral issuers and guarantees. When calculating the credit risk weighted assets for capital adequacy ratio regulations, the effect of credit risk mitigation through financial collateral (mainly deposits and securities), other collateral (mainly real estate) and guarantees by sovereign, banks or corporations above a certain credit rating is reflected.

(including central counterparty) in derivatives transactions and repurchase transactions etc., we generally allocate risk capital together with loans, etc., (we take into account wrong way risk for derivatives transactions). For derivatives transactions and repurchase transactions, in cases in which a bilateral netting agreement is valid in light of the legal system of the relevant jurisdiction, we take its effect into consideration. As to derivatives transactions with financial institutions, etc., we periodically, where necessary, deliver and receive collateral to and from the counterparty based on the replacement cost to mitigate credit risk (collateralized derivatives transactions). In conducting such transactions, there is a risk in which we may be required to provide additional collateral in cases where our credit profile deteriorates.

“senior/subordinated structure,” pursuant to the definitions set forth in the FSA Notice No.20, etc.; provided that the transactions do not include those which fall within specialized lending exposure. (1) Summary of Risk Management Regarding Securitization Exposures Our role in securitization transactions We are associated with securitization transactions from various purposes and positions through our banking book and trading book. (a) Securitization of our assets (“Securitization as originator”) For the purposes of mitigating credit risk and credit concentration risk, controlling economic capital and responding to the needs of our investors, etc., we engage in securitization transactions, the underlying assets of which include mortgage loans and loans to our corporate customers. When conducting a securitization as an originator, we consider such transactions from various aspects, including the effects of reduction of economic capital and improvement of return on risk as well as the practical effects of risk transfers, and make a comprehensive judgment on the structure and appropriateness of such transactions. (b) Securitization program (ABCP/ABL) sponsor As a means of supporting our customers in the securitization of their account receivables and notes receivables, etc., we retain securitization exposure by providing asset-backed loans (ABLs, which are on-balance-sheet transactions), and providing asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) backup lines (off-balance-sheet transactions), as sponsor to special purpose companies (in the form of Cayman Islands Corporations, etc.). In such cases, in addition to gaining firm understanding of the actual risk profile through due diligence from the viewpoint of investors, we assign internal ratings and make evaluations by assessing such transactions and carefully managing the exposure together with other direct loan assets. (c) Investment in alternative credit risk assets (“Securitization Transactions as an Investor”) We hold securitization products, such as ABS, CMBS, RMBS, and CDO, and resecuritization products, the underlying assets of which are mainly RMBS and CDO, etc., for the purpose of investing in alternative credit risk assets that are different from conventional credit risk assets in order to diversify our investment portfolio. The Risk Management Committee, etc. set limits on the amount of investment for Securitization Transactions as an Investor, and we maintain a stringent structure for management of such transactions. In addition, we implement stress tests based on scenarios under the market liquidity depletion and sharp price declines. In addition, we undertake various securitization program arrangements such as ABL, ABCP and trust schemes, etc., as a means of financing for our customers. We endeavor to understand the actual risk profile, including the underlying assets, and to appropriately disclose the risks and terms of the program to the customers who invest in the product. Furthermore, we actively act as servicer for securitization transactions, offer settlement account facilities (servicer cash advance) and provide interest rate swaps to securitization conduits. One of our affiliated entities ,Mizuho Leasing Company, Ltd, holds securitization products in which we are involved as originators or sponsors. The securitization conduits included within the scope of consolidation are as follows: ROCK FIELD CORPORATION, FANTASTIC FUNDING CORPORATION, ARTEMIS FUNDING CORPORATION, N&M FUNDING CORPORATION, Denshi Saiken Kaitori Godo Kaisha, JAPAN SECURITIZATION CORPORATION, Allstar Funding Co., Ltd, SPARCS FUNDING CORPORATION, PERPETUAL FUNDING CORPORATION, Working Capital Management Co. L.P., ALWAYS CAPITAL CORPORATION, HORIZON CAPITAL CORPORATION There are no securitization conduits that provide credit enhancement beyond what is provided in agreements. Overview of risk profile of securitization transactions and monitoring system In addition to price fluctuation and market liquidity risks, securitization and resecuritization products are exposed to risks related to default, recovery and granularity of underlying asset portfolio. The structure of these products also contains risks related to the originators, the administrators, trustees and managers of the underlying assets. To address these risks, we also analyze the structure in terms of the underlying assets and credit events. We monitor the ability, quality and operating performance of originators and managers in charge of controlling the underlying assets as well as covenant information and credit status of the parties related to the program. In addition, for resecuritization products, we pay attention to the underlying assets of the underlying securitization products. We also assign internal ratings to all products and review the rating at least once a year. If there is a change in the credit situations, we will review the internal rating as appropriate. As mentioned above, we have established a system to comprehensively understand the risk characteristics of securitization exposures and manage these exposures. We conduct credit risk measurements on all credit transactions, including securitization transactions. Furthermore, we carry out periodic monitoring on investment amount and performance on securitization transactions and report the situations to our Risk Management Committee, etc. 306 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Status of Mizuho Financial Group’s Consolidated Capital Adequacy Response to Basel Framework In calculating credit risk-weighted assets of securitization exposure, we apply the internal-ratings-based approach (“IRBA”) if we have sufficient information regarding all the underlying assets for IRBA. If IRBA cannot be applied to a certain asset and it has a rating obtained from an eligible external credit assessment institution, we apply the External rating-based approach (“ERBA”) We apply the standardized approach (“SA”) in other cases pursuant to the FSA Notice No. 20. We apply a risk weight of 1,250% under Basel III when neither IRBA, ERBA nor SA can be applied. In terms of securitization exposure in our trading book that is subject to market risk regulations, we adopt the standardized measurement method and calculate market risk equivalent amounts in connection with the specific risks of securitization products based on risk weights according to ratings assigned by eligible external credit assessment institutions pursuant to the FSA Notice No. 20. As for the eligible external credit assessment institutions, we refer to Rating and Investment Information, Inc. (R&I), Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR), Moody's Investors Service Inc. (Moody's), Standard & Poor's (S&P) and Fitch Ratings, Ltd. in determining securitization exposure risk weight. (2) Accounting Policies for Securitization Transactions The point at which financial assets and liabilities relating to securitization transactions begin or cease to be recognized, their evaluation and accounting treatment are pursuant to Accounting Standards Relating to Financial Products (Business Accounting Standards No. 10).

risk management structure, etc. (1) Trading Activities In the calculation of the market risk equivalent amounts under the regulatory capital requirements, the risk arising from fluctuations in common factors across the market as a whole (e.g. foreign exchange and interest rates, etc.) is referred to as general market risk, and the risk arising from a deterioration in creditworthiness or market liquidity inherent in bonds and stocks is referred to as specific risk. In principle, we calculate market risk equivalent amounts by determining both general market risk and specific risk by applying the Internal Models Approach (IMA) to the former and the standardized approach to the latter, and by simply adding up both amounts. The Internal Models Approach is applied to trading transactions and calculated by adding up VAR and stressed VAR.

The historical simulation method is used for the calculation of VAR and stressed VAR under the Internal Models Approach. 2. VAR is measured based on the observation period of 3 years (801 business days), a 99% confidence interval and a 1-day holding period. This 1-day VAR is scaled up to 10business day VAR using the square-root-of-time (√T) rule. We update historical data on a daily basis, in principle, and do not weight such data. When re-pricing instruments, we use the full revaluation method, a sensitivity-based approach and the like. We consider change width or rate as market volatility of risk factors according to product attributes. 3. When measuring stressed VAR, the same measurement approach as VAR is used except for the observation period of 1 year (265 business days). As a stressed period, we select a period which has an adequate length of time and is considered the most stressful under a certain set of criteria established based on the most recent portfolio. 4. When applying the internal model, we regularly verify the preconditions used for VAR measurement. 314 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Status of Mizuho Financial Group’s Consolidated Capital Adequacy (D) MR4：Back testing results of IMA As of March 31, 2020 As of March 31, 2019 Note: The number of cases where VAR on a particular day was exceeded by losses on the following business day for the past 250 business days was 3 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (0 in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019). The following details information relevant to the excess incident: VAR calculation date: August 1, 2019; Amount in excess: JPY 136 million; Primary cause of the excess: Foreign exchange rate fluctuations VAR calculation date: March 16, 2020; Amount in excess: JPY 215 million; Primary cause of the excess: Interest rate fluctuations VAR calculation date: March 17, 2020; Amount in excess: JPY 680 million; Primary cause of the excess: Stock price fluctuations (2) Banking Activities To comply with Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB) requirements, we are required to calculate expected changes in the economic value of equity (ΔEVE) arising from banking activities and expected changes in net interest income (ΔNII) from the reference date until the date no later than 12 months from the reference date under interest rate shock scenarios (i.e. parallel up and downwards shifts in the yield curve and the like). ΔEVE and ΔNII change according to changes in the banking portfolio.

Decreased economic values and interest income are shown as positive values. 2. As for some of those current deposits and ordinary deposits whose interest rates are not changed at predetermined intervals and from which depositors can withdraw money as desired on demand, we measure the interest rate risk associated with such deposits by applying an appropriate method after recognizing them as core deposits. The average repricing maturities are 0.7 years for yen deposits and 0.1 years for dollar deposits respectively. The longest repricing maturities are 10.0 years for yen deposits and 5.0 years for dollar deposits respectively. We measure interest rate risk associated with term deposits and loans in an appropriate manner by estimating their early redemption rates based on their historical prepayment and cancellation data. 3. When aggregating the respective ΔEVE of multiple currencies, we use the internal model that estimates the correlations between the key currencies based on historical data. When aggregating the respective ΔNII of multiple currencies, we simply add their respective ΔNII. 4. For the calculation of ΔEVE and ΔNII, we set an appropriate interest rate and spread according to a certain discount rate and reference rate. 5. When making the calculations above, we use regulatory defined preconditions including an interest rate shock scenario. 315 ■ Investment or Equity Exposure (1) Summary of Risk Profile, Risk Management Policies/ Procedures and Structure With regard to equities, we manage default risk through our credit risk management structure and price fluctuation risk through our market risk management structure. With regard to subsidiaries and related companies in which we invest, we manage their risks on a consolidated basis, and manage them appropriately in accordance with their management classification. In addition, securities, a part of equity exposure, are valued as follows: Japanese stocks with quoted market prices are valued based on the average quoted market price over the month preceding the consolidated balance sheet date; other securities which have readily determinable fair values are valued at the quoted market price if available, or otherwise based on their reasonable value at the consolidated balance sheet date (cost of securities sold is calculated primarily by the moving average method); and other securities the fair values of which are extremely difficult to determine are stated at acquisition cost or amortized cost and determined by the moving average method. ■ Operational risk (1) Summary of Operational Risk Management and Procedures See pages 122 to 125 for a summary of our operational risk management policies, etc. (2) Approach Used for the Measurement of Operational Risk Equivalent We use the Advanced Measurement Approach for the calculation of operational risk equivalent. See pages ●●● to ●●● a for the outline of the Advanced Measurement Approach. In the measurement of operational risk equivalent, we do not recognize the risk mitigating impact of insurance. The following entities have adopted the Advanced Measurement Approach: Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.; Mizuho Bank., Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Information & Research Institute, Inc.; Mizuho Operation Service, Ltd.; Mizuho Credit Guarantee Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Business Service Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Trust Operations Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Trust Systems Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Trust Business Operations Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Trust Retail Support Co., Ltd.; Mizuho Bank Europe N.V.; and Mizuho International plc. 316 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Status of Mizuho Financial Group’s Consolidated Capital Adequacy ■Composition of Leverage Ratio (Millions of yen, except percentage) Correspon Correspon ding line # ding line # on Basel on Basel As of March 31, As of March 31, III III Item 2020 2019 disclosure disclosure template template (Table 2) (Table 1) On-balance sheet exposures (1) 1 On-balance sheet exposures before deducting adjustment items ¥176,472,143 ¥170,866,057 1a 1 Total assets reported in the consolidated balance sheet 214,659,077 200,792,226 The amount of assets of subsidiaries that are not included in 1b 2 the scope of the leverage ratio on a consolidated basis (-) The amount of assets of subsidiaries that are included in the scope 1c 7 of the leverage ratio on a consolidated basis (except those included in the total assets reported in the consolidated balance sheet) The amount of assets that are deducted from the total assets reported in the 1d 3 38,186,933 29,926,169 consolidated balance sheet (except adjustment items) (-) 2 7 The amount of adjustment items pertaining to Tier1 capital (-) 1,120,264 1,338,983 3 Total on-balance sheet exposures (a) ¥175,351,879 ¥169,527,074 Exposures related to derivative transactions (2) 4 RC multiplied by 1.4 associated with derivatives transactions, etc. Replacement cost associated with derivatives transactions, etc. 2,913,469 1,965,230 5 PFE multiplied by 1.4 associated with derivatives transactions, etc. Add-on amount associated with derivatives transactions, etc. 6,853,455 6,846,996 The amount of receivables arising from providing cash margin 1,480,143 885,366 in relation to derivatives transactions, etc. The amount of receivables arising from providing collateral, 6 provided where deducted from the consolidated balance sheet pursuant to the operative accounting framework The amount of receivables arising from providing cash margin, provided where deducted from the consolidated 266,007 130,942 balance sheet pursuant to the operative accounting framework The amount of deductions of receivables (out of those arising 7 from providing cash variation margin) (-) The amount of client-cleared trade exposures for which a 8 bank holding company acting as a clearing member is not / / obliged to make any indemnification (-) 9 Adjusted effective notional amount of written credit derivatives 1,827,558 1,469,165 The amount of deductions from effective notional amount of 10 1,655,992 1,350,813 written credit derivatives (-) 11 4 Total exposures related to derivative transactions (b) ¥11,684,642 ¥9,946,886 Exposures related to repo transactions (3) 12 The amount of assets related to repo transactions, etc. 20,824,650 15,575,762 13 The amount of deductions from the assets above (line 12) (-) 5,439,650 4,961,226 The exposures for counterparty credit risk for repo 14 836,282 457,242 transactions, etc. 15 The exposures for agent repo transactions / / 16 5 Total exposures related to repo transactions, etc. (c) ¥16,221,282 ¥11,071,778 Exposures related to off-balance sheet transactions (4) 17 Notional amount of off-balance sheet transactions 41,023,520 41,344,892 The amount of adjustments for conversion in relation to off18 23,303,756 23,333,230 balance sheet transactions (-) 19 6 Total exposures related to off-balance sheet transactions (d) ¥17,719,764 ¥18,011,661 Leverage ratio on a consolidated basis (5) 20 The amount of capital (Tier1 capital) (e) 9,024,404 9,232,160 21 8 Total exposures ((a)+(b)+(c)+(d)) (f) ¥220,977,568 ¥208,557,401 22 Leverage ratio on a consolidated basis ((e)/(f)) 4.08% 4.42% Note: As an external audit of calculating the leverage ratio on a consolidated basis, we underwent an examination under the procedures agreed with by Ernst & Young ShinNihon LLC, on the basis of Practical guidance on agreed-upon procedures for the calculation of capital adequacy ratio and leverage ratio (Practical Guideline for specialized fields No. 4465 of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants). Note that this examination is not a part of the audit performed on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls over financial reporting.

(MHFG) and its subsidiaries. More concretely, at the time of a stress, following the relevant authority's determination that one or more of the material sub-groups, i.e. Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. and Mizuho Securities Co., Ltd. have reached the point of non-viability, losses incurred to them would be passed to MHFG, the ultimate holding company. While this could lead to a resolution of MHFG, the material sub-groups are expected to continue their business as usual under the Specified Bridge Financial Institution, etc. incorporated by the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Japan (DICJ) to which MHFG transfers its business.

(B) Evaluating the Appropriateness of the Design and Operation of the System Relating to Compensation of Subject Directors and Employees of Mizuho Group 1. Policies relating to compensation (1) Policies relating to compensation of Subject directors, etc. MHFG set out the “Mizuho Financial Group Compensation Policy” concerning the determination of compensation for each individual director, executive officer and specialist officer (“Officers, etc.”) of MHFG as well as MHBK, MHTB and MHSC (the “Three Core Companies”). a. Philosophy and objectives Executive compensation for MHFG and the Three Core Companies pursuant to such policy is determined based on appropriate governance and control, and aims to function as incentive and compensation for each Officer, etc., to exercise their designated function to the fullest in our efforts to realize management that contributes to value creation for various stakeholders and improve corporate value through continuous and stable corporate growth based on our basic management policies under our Corporate Identity. b. Basic Policy The basic policy with respect to the determination concerning the individual compensation of Officers, etc., of MHFG and the Three Core Companies is set forth below: (i) The executive compensation shall be determined based on appropriate governance and control, and function as an appropriate incentive in order to realize management that contributes to value creation for various stakeholders and improve corporate value through continuous and stable corporate growth based on our basic management policies under our Corporate Philosophy. (ii) The executive compensation shall be based on the function and responsibility assigned to and the performance of each Officer, etc. (iii) The executive compensation shall contribute to suppressing excessive risk-taking, improving corporate value and creating value for various stakeholders not only in the short-term, but also over the mediumto long-term. (iv) The executive compensation shall reflect the management environment and business performance of our group. (v) The executive compensation shall enable compensation for securing expert personnel such as professionals with a competitive edge in the market. 328 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Compensation of Directors and Employees (vi) The compensation system and standards shall be timely and appropriately reevaluated and set at a competitive and appropriate standard based on such factors as the economic and social conditions and survey data with respect to management compensation provided by external specialized organizations. (vii) Regulations and guidelines, etc., concerning executive compensation, both in Japan and overseas, shall be complied with. c. Compensation System I. Compensation for Officers, etc., shall, in principle, consist of a “Basic Salary,” “Performance Payment” and “Stock Compensation.” (i) “Basic Salaries” shall factor in the function and responsibility of each Officer, etc., in addition to the standard amount for each position and payment will be made monthly in cash. (ii) “Performance Payments” shall be made as a monetary incentive for Officers, etc., to achieve the annual budget and as compensation for their achievement. The payment thereof shall reflect the results of organizations (our inhouse companies and units, etc.) that each Officer, etc., is in charge of and the performance of each Officer, etc., in addition to the standard amount for each position. A system shall be adopted which, based on resolution by the Compensation Committee, etc., enables certain amount of deferred payments of the performance payments over three years, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount depending on performance, etc., of the company or the individual. (iii) “Stock Compensation” shall be paid in the form of shares of common stock of MHFG consisting of “Stock Compensation I” and “Stock Compensation II,” (together “Stock Compensation I and II”) acquired from the stock market through a trust with an aim to align the interests of Officers, etc., with those of the shareholders and increase the incentive to enhance corporate value. (a) “Stock Compensation I” shall be paid at the time of retirement of each Officer, etc., in the form of shares of common stock of MHFG calculated based on each position. A system shall be adopted which enables a decrease or forfeiture of the amount by resolution of the Compensation Committee, etc., depending on performance of the company or the individual. (b) “Stock Compensation II” shall be paid in accordance with the status of achieving our 5-Year Business Plan in addition to the standard amount for each position. A system shall be adopted which enables the entire amount of deferred payments over three years, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount by resolution of the Compensation Committee, etc., depending on performance of the company or the individual. II. Within the Officers, etc., the compensation system for the executive officers as defined in the Companies Act, the directors, the executive officers as defined in our internal regulations and the specialist officers responsible for business execution (the Officers Responsible for Business Execution ) shall be separate from the compensation system for the directors responsible for management supervision ( Non-Executive Officers Responsible for Management Supervision ). (i) The basic compensation system for Officers Responsible for Business Execution shall be a “Basic Salary,” “Performance Payment” and “Stock Compensation I and II.” (a)The composition of the compensation shall, in principle, be 50%, 17.5% and 32.5% for “Basic Salary,” “Performance Payment” and “Stock Compensation I and II” respectively. (b) “Performance Payment” shall be paid, in principle, within the range of 0% to 170% of the standard amount for each position. (c) “Stock Compensation II” shall be paid, in principle, within the range of 0% to 130% of the standard amount for each position. (ii) The compensation for Non-Executive Officers Responsible for Management Supervision, in principle, shall be in the form of fixed compensation from the perspective of ensuring the effectiveness of the supervisory function. The compensation system shall consist of “Basic Salaries” and “Stock Compensation” and the composition shall, in principle, be 85% and 15% for “Basic Salaries” and “Stock Compensation,” respectively. 329 III. There are cases where compensation for some personnel, including those officers recruited locally in countries other than Japan, may be designed individually in compliance with local compensation regulations while taking into consideration local compensation practices and the responsibilities, business characteristics and market value, etc., of each respective officer. For cases where compensation is designed individually, payment of compensation is also made in accordance with the performance of the company or the individual. Payment of compensation is designed to avoid excessive risktaking through a system which enables certain amount or a portion of deferred payments and non-monetary payments such as stock, as well as a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount depending on the performance, etc., of the company or the individual. d. Compensation Determination Process I. The Compensation Committee shall determine the determination policy of executive compensation for MHFG and the Three Core Companies and the executive compensation system including the compensation system set out in “Compensation System” in order to effectively secure the transparency and objectivity of compensation, etc., for individual Officers, etc. In addition, the Compensation Committee shall determine the compensation for each individual director and executive officer, as defined in the Companies Act, of MHFG and approve at MHFG the compensation of each individual director of the Three Core Companies. II. The President & CEO, pursuant to this policy and regulations and detailed rules, etc., shall determine the compensation for each executive officer, as defined in our internal regulations, and specialist officer of MHFG and approve at the MHFG the compensation of each individual executive officer and specialist officer of the Three Core Companies. III. The Compensation Committee will verify the validity of the compensation system and standards based on economic and social conditions and survey data with respect to management compensation provided by external specialized organizations. IV. All members of the Compensation Committee shall be appointed from among outside directors (or at least nonexecutive directors) and the Chairman thereof shall be an outside director. V. The Compensation Committee may have officers who are not members of the committee (including officers of the Three Core Companies) such as the President & CEO and external experts, etc., attend its meetings and provide their opinion in order to facilitate adequate and appropriate discussions and determinations. (2) Policies relating to compensation of Subject employees, etc. The policies relating to compensation for executive officers (as defined in our internal regulations) and specialist officers of MHFG and directors, executive officers (as defined in our internal regulations) and specialist officers of MHBK, MHTB and MHSC are also the same as the policies described in (1) Policies relating to compensation of Subject directors, etc. above. Compensation for other employees, etc., is determined in accordance with their duties and responsibilities. Some bonuses that are linked to performance are determined after comprehensively evaluating the employee’s contribution to business, including any qualitative contributions to the organization, in a manner that does not place an excessive emphasis on results. 2. The effect of the overall level of compensation, etc., on equity capital The Compensation Committee of MHFG receives reports on the amount of compensation paid to directors, executive officers (as defined in the Companies Act), executive officers (as defined in our internal regulations) and specialist officers of MHFG, MHBK, MHTB and MHSC in the previous fiscal year and confirms that there is no material effect on the Mizuho group’s performance or the adequacy of equity capital. 330 Basel Regulatory Disclosures Compensation of Directors and Employees (C) Compatibility between System for Compensation of Subject Directors and Employees of Mizuho Group and Risk Management and Matters Relating to Linking Compensation with Performance 1. Compatibility between system for compensation of Subject directors and employees and risk management The compensation of employees in risk management department, compliance department and internal audit department is decided in accordance with the salary and bonus system, and specific payment amounts are conclusively determined in accordance with employee performance evaluations made by the relevant department and the human resources department, independent from departments furthering business. Each employee of the risk management department, the compliance department and the internal audit department sets their own objectives in the employee performance evaluations, subject to the approval of their superiors. The degree to which the objectives are achieved is evaluated by taking into account the degree of the employee's contribution to the establishment of a system for risk management, compliance and internal audit. 2.Linking compensation of Subject directors and employees with performance The performance payments and performance-based stock compensation for Officers Responsible for Business Execution shall be made or paid in accordance with each officer’s performance, the result of organizations (our inhouse companies and units, etc.) that each Officer, etc., in charge of, and the status of achieving our 5-Year Business Plan etc., against the annual business plan in addition to the standard amount of each positon. A certain amount of the performance payments and the entire amount of the performance-based stock compensation shall be made or paid in deferred payments over three years, and a decrease or forfeiture of the deferred amount may be made depending on the performance, etc., of the company and such officer. It should be noted that certain Subject directors and employees have entered into compensation-related contracts. Stock compensation for Non-Executive Officers Responsible for Management Supervision shall be made in accordance with the standard amount set for each position, and the payment level shall not change based on the performance of each officer. With regard to compensation for other employees, salary is determined according to their job duties and responsibilities. In addition, the proportion linked to the performance bonus is determined through appropriately and comprehensively evaluating the contribution to performance, including the degree of contribution to the organization, etc., so as not to become excessively performance based. 331 (2) Quantitative Disclosure Items (A) REM1：Compensation Assigned to the Relevant Fiscal Year (Millions of yen, except people) a b “Subject “Subject No. directors, etc.” employees, etc.” 1 Number of “Subject directors, etc.” and “Subject employees, etc.” 13 250 2 Fixed compensation amount (3+5+7) ¥612 ¥9,947 3 Cash compensation amount 490 8,454 4 Fixed Of which, deferred amount 5 compensation Stock compensation amount or stock-based type compensation amount 121 8 6 Of which, deferred amount 7 Other compensation amount 1 1,484 8 Of which, deferred amount 9 Number of “Subject directors, etc.” and “Subject employees, etc.” 9 244 10 Variable compensation amount (11+13+15) 58 12,159 11 Cash compensation amount 28 11,312 12 Variable Of which, deferred amount 3,717 13 compensation Stock compensation amount or stock-based type compensation amount 29 842 14 Of which, deferred amount 29 442 15 Other compensation amount 4 16 Of which, deferred amount 17 Number of “Subject directors, etc.” and “Subject employees, etc.” 1 Retirement 18 Retirement benefits amount 355 benefits 19 Of which, deferred amount 20 Number of “Subject directors, etc.” and “Subject employees, etc.” 181 Other 21 Other compensation amount 1,323 compensation 22 Of which, deferred amount 470 23 Compensation amount (2+10+18+21) ¥671 ¥23,785 Notes: 1.
