COP July, 2020 SAJDI Consulting Engineering Center COP 2020 Page | 1 COP July, 2020 About SAJDI Our company started as a small local consultancy in 1974. Today, it offers services across three continents, 32 countries and have successfully completed more than 512 projects. From vast water & wastewater projects to the building of roads, the expertise we provide is at the heart of the modern world. Simply put, we connect things. Far from unmoving, our work carries a sense of “flow” — a concept that we have incorporated into our logo and slogan “Engineering the Flow of Tomorrow”. As well as connecting the infrastructure of the modern world, we connect people. Our teams work with professionals in dozens of different markets. This work delivers essential services to hundreds of thousands of people in cities and remote areas in 3 continents. The things we help build are contributing to a more prosperous and exciting global future for everyone. WHAT IS OUR MISSION? To oversee projects that solved problems and helped communities through the art of engineering. We would be the engineering consultants that breathed life into our work as an ode to Jordan and any other country we operate in; whether it is in the harsh environments of Lesotho or the ocean-embraced archipelago of the Maldives. RESPECTFUL WORK THAT STANDS THE TEST OF TIME That’s one of the first and most important things to know about Sajdi. We’re a familyowned business with a global outlook. Through the work of hundreds of dedicated engineers committed to making the world a better place, we are coming up with solutions to age-old problems that benefit societies and communities as a whole. WHY DO WE MENTION RESPECT? Because it is one of Sajdi’s most essential elements for a job well done. Respect towards the environment, communities, and most importantly, for the people’s needs. By integrating our engineering solutions into the appropriate contexts, we are able to target and break down hyper-local issues in the transportation sector and water delivery methods. Overall, we aim to create tangible, empowered, and dignified lifestyles. We started this business as a family and intend on continuing this journey into the future as a united front. This mind-set made it possible to help our clients achieve their objectives and earn us an esteemed reputation. Times change, plans alter, and goals differ...yet our principles and DNA remains the same. Sajdi will always be the engineering consulting firm that’s committed to engineering the flow of tomorrow, leaving a positive impact today, and serving communities. Page | 3 COP July, 2020 Human Rights Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: SAJDI has always been committed to excellence by following the universal standards of operation at all levels. This is seen in our Core Values which is represented in the following statement:” We are Committed to Excel in providing our services to our clients with Integrity and Respect.” In addition, our up-to-date ISO, EFQM, FCIC and the KAIIAE certifications and awards attesting to our commitment to the Human Rights Principles, which is one of the components of these certificates’ methodologies. Moreover, our commitment to join, contribute and attend the UN Leaders’ Summit in NY, 2016 also is evidence to our commitment to the issue. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labor principles to our stakeholders. Here is a brief of what each accreditation is: EFQM: Recognized for excellence Certificate (R4E) (3 Star-2012) from the European foundation for Quality Management FCIC: Federation of Consultants from Islamic Countries (FCIC) KAIIAE: King Abdullah II Award for Excellence (the highest award at the local Level) Implementation: SAJDI’s implementation of the Human Rights issue is seen in the following: • SAJDI has a Quality Procedure Manual which every employee is familiar with, have access to and is required to follow at all times. • Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. • Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis in various formats from emails, presentations to surveys. These prompts keep our employees aligned which is one of our strategic objectives. One of the awareness promotes that was conducted in 2016 was presented by the Global Compact Network Jordan by the contact person for the UNGC in Jordan after a request from the CIM unit at SAJDI.A presentation on the UNGC 10 principles and the 17 SDGs was presented to SAJDI employees.17 SDGs were communicated to employees in June, 2017 to ensure full alignment. SAJDI has conducted an awareness about Covid-19 and how to stay safe and avoid the infection. • SAJDI has participated in the CGNJ activities and events since 2016. One such event was entitled, “Our Renaissance in Our Partnership”. Other event was a training session about “Sustainability Management” held on July 2019. The latest event we have attended in October 2019 was a workshop about “Anti-corruption and Human rights”. • Implementing the CSR’s Action Plan for the year. Page | 4 COP July, 2020 • Our Social and Cultural Committee was formed in 2006. The members are elected on an annual basis aiming to provide a platform of synergy between the employees and management. • The Corporate Image Management unit was formed in 2009. This unit’s duties and responsibilities are to demonstrate SAJDI’s corporate image and the added value of our services, as well as, to enhance the culture of Self Responsibility and Corporate Social Responsibility. Moreover, the CIM unit has specific procedures (CSR Manual) and develops a yearly action plan. The manual is annually reviewed and the action plan’s outcomes are measured and communicated with our stockholders. Since 2014, and for each year thereafter, we have supported NGO’s in the field of education. Two Memorandums of understanding were signed with two different NGOs. The objective is to bridge the gap between formal education and the labor market’s needs. During 2018 & 2019 , SAJDI has supported one of NGOs that funds Orphans to secure their education. Measurement of Outcomes: Being a Strategy-Focused company, we have opted to use the Balance Scorecard Strategy tool to measure our strategic objectives on a five-year basis. This tool has been implemented since 2006 and we are now in our third 5-year strategy cycle (20162020). From our Balanced Scorecard then, we have objectives, initiatives, measures and/or targets. Following is what is relevant to the Human Rights issue: • Quarterly review meetings are held to review the Balance Scorecard Strategy measures of outcomes or KPI’s. • Each of our employee has a job description and procedures specific to his/her job and are audited internally and externally every year. • We require our business partners and our staff to abide by the safety requirements: from enforcing safety gear on construction sites, to the safety measures to the public in the area. This is followed up by the Quality Department at project sites. • We abide and require our business partners to work on an “Environment Assessment” for each project. This is part of our Project Quality Plan (PQP) which is also included in our Procedure Manual. • Our Environment Policy has objectives, initiatives, measures and is reviewed on a yearly basis. The outcome of the review is a new action plan for the following year. • The “Core Values Commitment Questionnaire has been conducted on a quarterly basis for several years now. The results are measured against their target and compared to the previous year. Preventive measures are taken for falling short of the target. • While we give equal opportunity to candidates, we use the standard procedure for recruitment to ensure that we hire the most competent employee irrespective to Page | 5 COP July, 2020 gender, religion, or race. Our equality for hiring is seen in the fact that our male to female ratio is at 60 % and our hiring is posted on our website, social media and local newspapers. • Ergonomics Survey is conducted every two years to look into the needs and complaints of our staff. Recommendations are made and sent to the management for approval. It was noticed that the results of the survey that was conducted in 2017 was at 82.2 % compared to the result of 2015 which was at 76.1%, the result of 2020 is to be included in the next COP as SAJDI has moved in to a new physical location in November 2019. • Employee Satisfaction Survey is conducted on an annual basis covering issues such as: general working conditions, pay and promotion potential, use of skill & abilities. Actions are taken by our management to insure a high level of employee satisfaction. • Reviewing CSR’s KPI’s at the end of each year brings about the new changes that need to be done in our next CSR action plan. • The Social and Cultural Committee end of year evaluation by the staff through independent survey. • See Appendix for our:  Environment Policy-Action Plan  Strategy Map  Core Values  Commitment to Core Values Questionnaire sample.  Employee Satisfaction Survey  CSR Manual  Social and cultural committee survey  Ergonomic Survey form Labor Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our Manual Procedure covers not only the duties and responsibilities of each job at the company, but provides the employees’ labor rights as well. We have a dedicated resource that monitors and mandates labor laws. Our Strategic Objective of “Enhance Knowledge Management” under the learning and growth perspective engages the employees while providing them with a platform for freedom of association and collective bargaining. This goes hand in hand with the Social and Cultural Committee discussed earlier. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labor principles to our stakeholders and to maintain our compliance with labor laws and other official holidays. Page | 6 COP July, 2020 Implementation: • Our Procedure Manual, as well as, the New Employee Handbook provide the knowledge of labor rightsamong other informationregarding the employee. • Medical Insurance Coverage • Social Security. • Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. • Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis to inform employees regarding new labor laws or health issues. One such presentation was “Ergonomics” presentation, another one was conducted in 6/2019 about safety at office and about Covid-19 and how to prevent the infection. • Continuous Human Resources and the Finance departments’ training and upto date knowledge on the local labor laws. They are the dedicated resource for labor rights. • Based on our management’s belief of the importance of work-life balance, the working hours have been reduced one hour a day in 2011. The number of weekly working hours at SAJDI became 41.25 h versus 48h by labor law. • SAJDI is committed to the official holidays announced by the government due to religious, national and other occasions. • The Social and Cultural Committee provides a platform for employees to voice their opinions and thoughts. There are many activities made by SCC during the year. For an example, arranging outdoor lunches, celebrating national and religious occasions, arranging for the yearly picnic and many other activities. SCC members are elected each year by SAJDI employees. • Our Incentive Program Fast Track is disclosed to our employees and is reviewed periodically. The Fast track program and career path were reviewed by SAJDI management, departments and relevant units. • Our Information Management System is an open domain to our employees. It includes the official manuals on labor laws and the updated social security benefits. • Celebrating our 45 years of dedication and relentless to our client has spread the spirt of excellence among our employees, the celebration took place at Amman Rotana towers in November, 2018. Page | 7 COP July, 2020 Measurement of Outcomes: Being a Strategy-Focused company, we have opted to use the Balance Scorecard Strategy tool to measure our strategic objectives on a five-year basis. This tool has been implemented since 2006 and we are currently in our third 5-year strategy cycle. Following is what is relevant to the Labor Principles issue: • Quarterly review meetings are held to review the Balance Scorecard Strategy measures of outcomes or KPI’s. • Age: we do not discriminate against age. (see figure below). • Ethnicity percentages, we hire local individuals in our global branches. • 100% compliance on approved working contracts. • Our working related injuries target is at zero with zero related injuries for 2018. • Our employee Satisfaction Survey was 78% for 2018 against the target of 70%. • See Appendix for our:  Incentives Environment Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: We have an Environment Policy since 2006 which is also part of our Quality Management system. we have identified “Operational Excellence” as our customer value prospection in our Strategy. Increase Utilization of Staff and Resources, and Enhance Project Quality Plan implementation are two strategic objectives, among Page | 8 COP July, 2020 others, that enable us to achieve Operational Excellence. Our goal is to decrease our recyclable waste and to shift to renewable energy whenever possible. Implementation: • We do and require our business partners to do an Environment Impact Assessment as part of our procedures within each Project Quality Plan to insure that the projects are in alignment with our Environment policy. • The “Go Green” initiative by the Corporate Image Management Unit in 2014 has led to: Continuous paper recycling in association with Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute. Provided awareness prompts on energy saving and recycling, Planted trees by SAJDI employees wherever they were in the world in 2017 and 2018. SAJDI has supported an environmental initiative related to waste recycling and reduction of plastic usage to preserve the environment by a group of 12-yearold students in 2018. They aimed at spreading awareness and to deliver their message to the decision-makers. • The Creativity and Development Committee has embarked on installing solar panels at SAJDI’s HQ in Jordan in 2016 as a renewable energy while substituting diesel consumption and CO2 emissions. • We develop an Environment Policy Action Plan on a yearly basis. • SAJDI is a member at the JES (Jordan Environment Society) and always contribute to its activities related to the Environment. Measurement of Outcomes: • Yearly external audits by the ISO insuring the implementation of our Environment Policy action plan. • Yearly review of the Environment Policy results or KPI’s by upper management. • Yearly reporting by Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute re our recycled paper. Outcomes of our achievement in recycling paper for the year is shared with our employees by giving the CO2 emissions and mature trees saved. • See Appendix for our:  Environment Policy Action KPI’s for the last 3 years.  Sample of the Recycled Paper Poster. Page | 9 COP July, 2020 Anti-Corruption principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our core values in a statement is: ““We are Committed to Excel in providing our services to our clients with Integrity and Respect.” Integrity is where we state that we do our services without favoritism. Implementation: • We ensure that our engineering services are provided to clients following our Quality Management System (QMS) which, in turn, is regularly audited by internal auditors. This system insures that every employee is doing his/her duties according to the QMS standards without bias or favoritism. This system ensures verification and validation by staff in independent departments to prove that all decisions are correctly taken. • One of our initiatives within the Corporate Social Responsibility action plan-under the Clients & Business Partners beneficiary is to “Emphasize SAJDI’s Governance, Credibility and Transparency.” • We have participated in the CGNJ activities and events since 2016. One such event was entitled, “Our Renaissance in Our Partnership”. The latest event we have attended in October 2019 was a workshop about “Anti-corruption and Human rights”.
