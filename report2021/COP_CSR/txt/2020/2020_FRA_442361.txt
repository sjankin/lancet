Such risks are, as of the date of this Universal Registration Document, the risks that Rexel believes may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, its results, its business activities or its prospects, should they occur. Rexel conducted a review of these risk factors and considers that there are no other significant risks than the ones described in this section. Note that there may, however, be other risks that have not yet been identified as of the date of this Universal Registration Document, or whose occurrence as of the date hereof is not considered likely to have a material adverse effect. 2.1 Risk factors In a constantly changing environment, Rexel is committed to protecting the interests of its shareholders, employees, clients, suppliers, and all other stakeholders, while achieving its objectives. In this context, Rexel is implementing an active risk management policy to be able to efficiently respond to internal and external threats likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, its results, its business activities or its prospects. The 14 risks presented in this chapter are the risks featured in the risk mapping updated annually as part of the internal control and risk management procedures deployed by the Rexel Group (described in paragraph 2.3 “The Rexel internal control and risk management system” of this Universal Registration Document). These risks are those that may have a material adverse effect on the Rexel Group, its activities, its financial condition, its results of operations or its perspectives. The 14 risks are grouped in four categories (commercial and strategic risks, operating risks, ethics and environmental risks and financial risks) and ranked based on Rexel’s level of residual exposure to these risks on a scale of Low/Moderate/High. This residual exposure results from the level of the potential impact on the Group if the risks were to occur, the likelihood that they would occur and the control and ability of the Group to reduce their impact or likelihood. The ranking, category and exposure of Rexel (including a quantitative analysis of the potential impact when possible(1)) and the control mechanisms in place are mentioned for each of the risks presented below. The risks are ranked by order of importance within each category, the risks with the greatest residual exposure being presented first. In parallel and for the purposes of the extra-financial performance declaration, Rexel carried out a more detailed analysis than the one undertaken by the Risk Committee of the main risks related to the environmental, social and societal consequences of its activities. The specific procedures availed to identify and analyze the risks are described in paragraph 4.1.3 “Main non-financial risks” of this Universal Registration Document. Lastly, the vigilance plan (“plan de vigilance”) implemented for the Rexel Group is described in section 4.7 “Vigilance plan” of this Universal Registration Document.

Moreover, the Group’s procurement chain could be affected in the event that one or several suppliers become limited in the manufacturing or distribution of their goods especially in the areas of lightning, solar panels and cable. These elements could lead to a decrease in sales in one or several geographies of the Group. Lastly, as a distributor of electrical supplies for professionals, the Rexel Group is particularly sensitive to the building and renovation sectors (the residential and commercial markets accounted for 26% and 44% of the sales of the Group in 2019, respectively), which could be particularly impacted by an economic recession.

As a result, Rexel uses considered to be moderate. customer data collected by its information systems to improve customer portfolio management and product assortment in the branches. The deployment of new digital tools and solutions to complement the services provided to customers and suppliers could encounter temporary difficulties related to slow Group employee adoption, first and foremost by the sales forces in the different countries. N ewly developed tools could potentially fail to achieve the results expected, fail to meet customer expectations or malfunction. Lastly, in an unfavorable economic environment and/or in a situation in which the Group’s sales and operating margin were to decline significantly, the digital transformation strategy may need to be revised, since it is based on a significant investment program (€77.4 million of gross capital expenditures related to information systems and digital in 2019, i.e. 61.6% of the CAPEX of the Group). Failure to pursue deployment could have a negative effect on the results of the Group due to the loss of certain sales, or even of some customers, and it could also impact the expected return on investment of these innovative initiatives. This could affect the image, the reputation of the Group with its shareholders and the market in general, or the Group’s financial rating. Despite all of this, while the digital transformation is an important aspect of the Group’s short and mediumterm strategy, any delay would only have a limited immediate impact on the Group’s ability to continue selling through its traditional distribution channels and branch network. 50 Rexe l 2 01 9 – U n i ve rsal Re gi strati o n D o c u m ent RISK FACTORS AND INTERNAL CONTROL Reinforced competition from digital players and suppliers RESIDUAL EXPOSURE Moderate RISK IDENTIFICATION AND EXPOSURE CONTROL SYSTEMS Because of its positioning as a distributor, the Rexel The Rexel Group benefits from competitive edge Group is exposed to a risk of competition by digital limiting the competition risk inherent in its business: players and its suppliers, in addition to the pre-existing risk of competition by traditional electrical supplies • First, the Group deployed a multi-channel strategy to meet customer expectations.

The logistics system 5 is being continuously strengthened thanks to the gradual deployment of best practices inspired by the major e-commerce players (locker systems available 24/7, parcel delivery in pick-up locations, express delivery, track-and-trace during delivery, etc.) to best meet customer needs. • L astly, the management of a very large number of customers requires a sophisticated receivables and credit risk management system which is specific to 6 distribution companies. Rexel deployed this type of client risk management system many years ago, and the results show a low level of trade accounts receivable losses (€25.6 million in trade accounts receivable losses in 2019 on over €2,157.3 million of total receivable). All of these elements are barriers to entry for digital platforms and for manufacturers who would try to sell 7 directly to Rexel customers. However, despite these control systems, the residual exposure of the Group is assessed as moderate due to the size and growth of the major e-commerce players and due to the fact that some suppliers are willing to directly address some markets. 8 Rexel 2019 – Universa l Registration Docum ent 51 RISK FACTORS AND INTERNAL CONTROL Inability of the Group to define an offer plan meeting customer expectations for all the countries and markets in which Rexel operates RESIDUAL EXPOSURE Low RISK IDENTIFICATION AND EXPOSURE CONTROL SYSTEMS As a distributor of electrical equipment, one of the The drafting of an offer plan tailored to the expectations core activities of the Rexel Group is to roll out, in each of customers in each of the countries and markets in country and for each market in which it operates, which Rexel operates remains one of the top priorities an appropriate offer plan to select the products and of the Group. For this purpose, Rexel relies on its references that best meet the needs and expectations experienced teams benefiting from the technical skills of its customers. This plan allows Rexel to select required to develop an adequate offer plan. Besides, the products that the company wishes to offer for best practices and innovative initiatives developed in each market, and thus to select those for which it is several countries of the Group are identified by the able to provide competitive prices and high levels of central teams and promoted throughout the rest of the availability.

Some entities of the Group have also deployed digital solutions for analyzing customer behavior The drafting of this offer plan is a complex exercise to help them select the products to be included in within the Rexel Group because of the number of their offer plan. Those solutions are currently being countries in which it operates (electrical standards promoted by Rexel. Finally, as offer plans are drawn up are prone to changes and customer needs differ from at country level, the impact of an offer plan resulted country to country) but also due to the highly variable to be unsuitable for a given country would be limited weight of each different market within these countries. to that country.

North America. Thus, each entity has to draw up an offer plan tailored to its specific characteristics. This complexity is reinforced by the ever-growing advanced technological innovation and frequently changing standards of the products provided by the Rexel Group. The rapid development of home automation, the widespread use of the Internet of Things and the progress of robotization increased the need for extensive technical skills to build this offer plan and for more frequent updates than in the past. As a result, the risk for Rexel to propose an offer plan that is not adapted to the needs of its customers in one or more of the Group entities has increased. Any unsuitability of the Rexel offer plan in one or more of the countries in which the Group operates could result in a deterioration of the Group’s reputation with its customers (by Rexel positioning itself as a provider of expertise and advice) and, consequently, a potential loss of market share. In addition, an inadequate offer plan could lead to an increase in the level of Rexel inventory (stemming from a demand for alternative products from customers) and thus, a potential decrease in the inventory turnover that could induce obsolescence and hence an increase in the inventory depreciation (which amounted to €75.8 million in 2019 compared to €79.0 million in 2018). This could lead to a negative impact on the Group financial performance. 52 Rexe l 2 01 9 – U n i ve rsal Re gi strati o n D o c u m ent RISK FACTORS AND INTERNAL CONTROL 2.1.2 Operating risks Significant cyber-attack on the information systems of the Group RESIDUAL EXPOSURE High 2 RISK IDENTIFICATION AND EXPOSURE CONTROL SYSTEMS The Rexel Group’s strategy partially relies on the digital T h e R e x e l G r o u p h a s d e p l oy e d a g l o b a l a n d transformation of its business activities, both via the sophisticated IT security system within all of the improvement of the Group’s management systems entities of the Group.

A change in one or more of these assumptions could significantly reduce the value of goodwill and result in a major accounting impairment. The goodwill of some countries is exposed to the risk of non-achievement of growth targets, notably due to changes in the political or economic environment in those countries. For instance, the Group recognized goodwill of €181.3 million at the end of 2019 for its activities in the United Kingdom, which is vulnerable to the Brexit-related instability risk. Likewise, together France, the United States and 4 Canada account for over 65% of the total value of goodwill for the Group. They could be exposed to an unfavorable economic environment, which would call into question the Group’s growth assumptions for these areas. The value of goodwill was impaired by €98 million 5 in 2019 compared to €56.3 million in 2018, while the Group’s net income was €203.8 and 135.6 million, respectively. A significant impairment of goodwill, notably due to conditions external to the Group (economic environment, financing rates) could have a negative impact on the financial reputation and the stock market value of the Group. However, any impairment of goodwill would only have an accounting impact, and without any cash nor EBITA impact on the Group.

The non-recurring effect in relation to the price variation of copper-based cables reflects the effect of copper price variations on the selling prices of cables between the moment they are purchased and the time they are sold, until all such inventory is sold (direct effect on gross profit). This impact mainly relates to the gross margin of the 6 Group. An increase in copper-based cable prices would have the reverse effects of those described above. The Rexel Group believes that in 2019, fluctuations in cable prices contributed to a recurring decrease in its sales of approximately 0.3%, on a comparable basis and at a constant number of days. The Rexel Group is also exposed to variations in 7 prices of other commodities, which are part of the components of distributed products such as metals (steel, aluminum or nickel) or oil and its derivatives (PVC, polyamide or polycarbonate). Oil also impacts transportation costs for products distributed by the Rexel Group. Transportation costs accounted for 2.2% of the Rexel Group’s sales in 2019. Changes in prices of certain commodities may have an adverse effect on the financial situation or the results of the Rexel Group. 8 Rexel 2019 – Universa l Registration Docum ent 59 RISK FACTORS AND INTERNAL CONTROL 2.1.4 Ethics and environmental risks Unethical behavior within the Group (corruption, anticompetitive agreements, non-compliance with embargoes, failure to protect personal data) RESIDUAL EXPOSURE Moderate RISK IDENTIFICATION AND EXPOSURE CONTROL SYSTEMS A specialist in the distribution of electrical supplies for The Rexel Group and its management have been professionals, the Rexel Group could be exposed, like any committed to a consistent and repeated ethical approach other distributor for professionals, to the risk of unethical that reflects the standards of loyalty, integrity, respect behavior, including the risk of corruption, anticompetitive and transparency of the Group.

BENEFITS OF ANY KIND Patrick Berard receives benefits in kind consisting of a company car inter alia (in accordance with the policy applicable to Rexel’s managers). LONG-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION The Board of Directors considers that share allocation mechanisms, that also benefit to other keys duties in the company, are particularly adapted to the duties of executive corporate officers, considering the level of responsibility of these duties as well as their capacity to contribute directly to the long-term performance of the company in line with the interests of the shareholders. The shares allotted to the Chief Executive Officer are fully subject to performance criteria assessed over periods of at least three years. These shares are also allotted subject to a presence criteria of three years. As a result, the vesting period is 3 years, with no further retention period. Furthermore, the allotment is limited by two specific caps in value and in number of shares: • the annual value of the performance shares granted to the Chief Executive Officer in respect of a financial year may not exceed 100% of his annual fixed and variable target compensation for that financial year (as defined in section “Long-term 3 variable compensation” of paragraph 3.2.1.6 “Summary tables of the compensation policy for the financial year 2020 (Say on Pay Ex-ante)” of this universal registration document); and • the number of shares allotted to the corporate officers cannot exceed 10% of the total performance shares allotted to all of the beneficiaries. The Chief Executive Officer has a lock-up obligation in respect of 20% of the shares vested in connection with these schemes until the termination of his/her duties. DESCRIPTION Allotments of shares fully subject to demanding performance AMOUNT Maximum number of shares that may be allocated: 10% of 4 conditions assessed over a period of 3 years (corresponding the total amount allocated to all beneficiaries (within the to the vesting period) and condition of presence, without overall limit of the percentage of share capital authorized by additional retention period. the General Meeting of April 23, 2020)(1). Maximum value of the shares at grant: 100% of the annual target fixed and variable compensation of Patrick Berard, i.e. €1,430,000 in accordance with the compensation policy that will apply from January 1, 2020 until December 31, 2020 or, in the event of early renewal of the term of office of Patrick Berard’s Chief Executive Officer, until the date of such renewal. 5 Performance criteria CRITERIA WEIGHT TRIGGERING THRESHOLD TARGET MAXIMUM COMMENTS Annual average 30% 50% of shares vest if the 100% of shares vest if the 150% of shares vest if the Calculation on a of EBITA growth rates 2019average performance reaches target is reached average performance reaches linear basis between 2022 (Medium Term Plan) 75% at least 125% of target the points Annual average of organic sales growth rates 2019-2022 (Medium Term 30% 50% of shares vest if the average performance reaches 75% 100% of shares vest if the target is reached 150% of shares vest if the average performance reaches at least 125% of target Calculation on a linear basis between the points 6 Plan) Average free cash flow 20% 50% of shares vest if the 100% of shares vest if the 150% of shares vest if the Calculation on a before interest and taxes/ average performance reaches target is reached average performance reaches linear basis between EBITDA ratio between 2020, 90% at least 120% of target the points 2021 and 2022 (Medium Term Plan) 7 Relative performance of the 20% Vesting equal to 50% if Vesting equal to 100% if the Vesting equal to 150% if the Rexel share compared to the the performance of the performance of the Rexel performance of the Rexel SBF 120 GR(2) index Rexel share is equal to share outperforms the share outperforms the the performance of the SBF 120 GR index by 5% SBF 120 GR index by 10% SBF 120 GR index by 5% 100% The performance level of each criterion is combined with the weight of each criterion in order to obtain a weighted global level of performance.

(2) The relative performance criterion of the Rexel share compared to the SBF 120 GR index has replaced the previously determined TSR criterion based on a panel of selected companies. This change is due to the difficulty to establish and update a representative panel of companies comparable to Rexel (in particular from a geographical, strategic challenges, digital transformation in product and services sales point of view). The SBF 120 GR 8 index, which Rexel is part of, better integrates some of these criteria. The weighting of this criterion, the triggering threshold, the target and maximum vesting have been determined based on a comparable structure to that of the TSR criterion previously used, in line with market practices.

The employment contract of Patrick Berard, suspended during the performance of his duties as Chief Executive Officer, provides, under certain conditions, in the event of termination at the initiative of the employer (1), for the payment of severance and/or non-compete indemnities, up to a total amount corresponding to 18 months of the monthly reference compensation (i.e., the last fixed annual compensation plus the average amount of the last two bonuses received, divided by 12)(2). It is specified by the Board of Directors that in case of reactivation of the employment agreement of Patrick Berard, these potential severance indemnities would be calculated without taking into account the vesting period of the corporate office (without considering his seniority or fixed or variable compensation received as a corporate officer). It is specified that the payment of a severance indemnity and/or the payment of a non-compete compensatory allowance would be less than the 24-month cap provided for in the compensation policy and the guidelines referred to in article 25.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The payment of a non-compete indemnity would be precluded if Patrick Berard were to exercise his retirement rights SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT SCHEME Patrick Berard was maintained in the defined-benefit retirement plan in view of his seniority within the Group and his career (Patrick Berard joined Rexel in 2003).

This scheme complies with the guidelines of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. In accordance with the applicable laws and regulations (Law n° 2019-486 of May 22, 2019 relating to the growth and transformation of companies, known as the “PACTE Law” and Order No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019 relating to supplementary occupational retirement schemes), and following the decision of the Board of Directors, at its meeting of December 17, 2019, rights were frozen, consisting of the interruption at December 31, 2019 of the acquisition of new contingent rights under the plan. Periods of employment after December 31, 2019 will therefore not be taken into account for the assessment of seniority used to calculate the amount of the additional pension. On the other hand, end-of-career compensation will be taken into account, in accordance with the terms of the plan’s regulations and Order No. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019. It is restated that Patrick Berard is not eligible for the medium-term savings scheme (Article 82 of the French General Tax Code), as an exception to the compensation policy applicable to the Chief Executive Officer.

Supplemental No payment Considering the career of Patrick Berard (born in 1953) and his seniority retirement plan (he joined the Rexel Group in 2003), the Board of Directors decided on July 1, 2016 not to suspend the supplemental defined-benefit retirement plan, in which Patrick Berard has been maintained in his capacity as an employee prior to accepting the duties of corporate officer. The upholding of this benefit has been confirmed by the Board of Directors of May 24, 2018 which decided on the renewal of the corporate office as Chief Executive Officer of Patrick Berard.

The performance criteria determined by the Board of Directors of July 1, 2016 have been aligned with those of the annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (financial portion and individual portion).

Supplemental No payment Considering the career of Patrick Berard (born in 1953) and his seniority retirement plan (he joined the Rexel Group in 2003), the Board of Directors decided on July 1, 2016 not to suspend the supplemental defined-benefit retirement plan, in which Patrick Berard has been maintained in his capacity as an employee prior to accepting the duties of corporate officer. The upholding of this benefit has been confirmed by the Board of Directors of May 24, 2018 which decided on the renewal of the corporate office as Chief Executive Officer of Patrick Berard. In order to comply with article L.225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, the Board of Directors decided that the contingent rights that may be acquired by Patrick Berard in respect of his duties as Chief Executive Officer in connection with this scheme would only be granted subject to the achievement of annual performance criteria. The performance criteria determined by the Board of Directors of July 1, 2016 have been aligned with those of the annual variable compensation of the Chief Executive Officer (financial portion and individual portion). The performance criteria shall be considered as satisfied if the payment level of the annual variable compensation reaches at least 60% of the target variable compensation for the relevant financial year. The Board of Directors of February 12, 2020, acknowledged the achievement of the performance criteria for the 2019 financial year (the payment level of the variable compensation for 2019 having reached 84.2%).
