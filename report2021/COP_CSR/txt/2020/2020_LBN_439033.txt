Deeply embedded in our DNA, these values are the foundation stone of our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy that revolves around four main pillars: Workplace, Marketplace, Community and Environment. Furthermore and as entrenched in its motto, “A Partner for your Ambitions”, our Bank’s promise is to create shared value by spearheading sustainable banking in Lebanon through a balance between economic, environmental and social objectives. With this in mind, I take great pride in reaffirming BLF’s support to the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor Rights, Environment and Anti-Corruption, as well as to the ISO 26000 guidelines. I am also pleased to present to you the third edition of our bi-annual CSR Report covering 2016 and 2017. It illustrates our continuous approach to integrate the UNGC and ISO 26000 principles into our strategy, culture, business and daily operations. It further underlines our pledge, as a founding member of the Global Compact Network Lebanon (GCNL) Steering Committee, to embed the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in our CSR strategy: Quality Education (SDG 4), Gender Equality (SDG 5), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Climate Action (SDG 13), and more particularly Reduced Inequalities (SDG 10) which BLF is championing since December 2017. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the Bank’s shareholders, clients, employees, correspondents, community partners and suppliers whose continuous commitment helped us achieve the significant milestones that we have reached despite the challenging prevailing situation in our country and region. I count on their engagement to strengthen sustainability in the years ahead. Walid Raphaël Chairman General Manager Believing that sustainability is a journey marked by countless small and big leaps, ongoing learning and improvement, our CSR Unit took in 2018 its reporting to a new level by preparing this 2016-2017 Report in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative Standard Core Option. 3 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 2017 I About Banque Libano-Française ABOUT BANQUE LIBANO-FRANÇAISE PROFILE Banque Libano-Française (BLF) was established as a joint stock company (Society Anonyme Libanaise, S.A.L.) in 1967.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Principles Banque Libano-Française has defined its own model of governance, inspired by its founding values and the banking regulations. Its governance is based on the values of transparency, responsibility and efficiency. This is translated in the organization and the work of the Board of Directors through: • Active involvement of Board Members in the social life of the company, as well as in its strategy • Willingness to pursue openness and balance in the distribution of powers and the composition of the governing bodies • Constant concern with the ability of each individual to efficiently exercise his/her responsibilities with objectivity and independence, particularly through the quality of dialogue and the transparency of information • Belief that good governance allows the creation of value; therefore the Bank formalizes the principles of good governance and integrates them in its company culture • Conformity to worldwide best practices in corporate governance • Adherence to governing principles as discussed in several Bank’s documents such as its statutes and those of its subsidiaries which define the roles of the Board of Directors and stakeholders in terms of management, regulations, procedures and codes of conduct aiming to ensure transparency and the assumption of responsibility • In the context of reinforcement of regulatory provisions, the Board of Directors devotes a major part of its work to the analysis of the consequences of change, and establishes ways for the Group to respond to and prepare for new regulations; the Audit Committee and Risk Committee are focused on these changes. Composition of the Board of Directors The Bank is administered by a Board of Directors made up of three to twelve members, elected by the General Assembly among Shareholders holding each a minimum of 250 shares: • National law determines how many members of the Board must be Lebanese citizens • Corporations may be members of the Board, they may be represented by a manager or delegate of their Board of Directors, even if those representatives are not shareholders of the corporation • Board Members serve for a three-year term • At each Annual Assembly, a partial or total renewal of the Board is carried out by election in such a way that total renewal takes place at the end of every three years • Each member must assign 250 shares as a collective guarantee of the Board; these shares are inalienable during the Board Member’s mandate • A member of the Board is considered to have resigned if he/she takes a position of employment or becomes a member of the Board of Directors of another company in Lebanon exercising the same activities as the Bank, unless he/she has been given special permission to do so by the General Assembly • Should one of the positions of Board Member become vacant, the Ordinary General Assembly may vote to fill that position at its next regularly scheduled meeting, unless the remaining Board Members view the replacement as urgent, in which case an Extraordinary Assembly can be formed • If the number of members is reduced to less than three, a General Assembly must be called within two months in order to replace the missing Board Members • Any Board Member taking over the position of a former member will stay until the expiry of the former member’s mandate • The Board of Directors elects a Chairman from among its members, to serve as such for the duration of their mandate • On the basis of a proposal by the Chairman, the Board may nominate a General Manager from among the members or from outside the Board • The General Manager will fulﬁll his/her duties under the Chairman’s authority • The Board chooses a Secretary from among the members or outside the Board 7 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 2017 I About Banque Libano-Française • The Board of Directors has officially adopted the definition of the profile of independent Board Member as defined by Banque du Liban; as such an “independent” Board Member shall be: non-executive not one of the major shareholders directly or indirectly holding more than 5% of the shares at the Bank, or voting rights relative to those shares -independent from all members of the Executive Committee and from the major shareholders, and does not have a professional relationship with them during his/her term or during the last two years preceding his/her nomination to the Board not a 4th degree relative or less of a major shareholder not in debt to the Bank • All members have financial, accounting, strategic planning, governance, risk management, regulatory, and auditory qualifications • Group policy ensures that the Board has a non-executive majority.

BLF’s General Services Division has embedded sustainability into its procurement practices and strives to promote ethically, economically, socially and environmentally responsible business practices amongst its network of suppliers. In 2016, BLF launched a Sustainable Procurement Policy which details how the General Services Division selects the suppliers to ensure that their products and services have the lowest environmental impact and most positive social and economic impacts possible. The aim is not to favor Sustainable Procurement “at all costs”, but to select the most competitive offer based on a rational analysis of costs, quality and risks as well as CSR criteria. Moreover, the selection of suppliers is conducted in a fair and equitable manner, free from discrimination and giving preference to local suppliers when their offers are competitive. Local suppliers comprise 94% of the Bank’s total suppliers. The Sustainable Policy also sets out the code of conduct the Bank expects from its suppliers and those within their suppliers’ sphere of influence. More information on the Sustainable Procurement Policy can be found on the Bank’s website: www.eblf.com/Library/Files/SustainableProcurementPolicy-ENG.pdf BLF also integrated a sustainability statement in all its contracts with suppliers urging them to abide by socially responsible principles, thus extending CSR awareness into its sphere of influence. 2015 2016 2017 Total number of suppliers 518 765 1,049 Percentage of local suppliers 94% 94% 94% Monetary value of payments made to suppliers USD 29,893,354 USD 32,882,186 USD 34,124,577 Monetary value paid to local suppliers USD 28,099,752 USD 30,909,254 USD 32,077,102 Geographic locations of Lebanese suppliers Greater Beirut Greater Beirut Greater Beirut Suppliers and spendings on suppliers.

Inspired by its five founding values and guided by a solid corporate governance framework, the Bank established a CSR Unit in 2010 and adopted a holistic CSR strategy revolving around four main pillars: Workplace, Marketplace, Community and Environment, geared by a solid Corporate Governance Framework. Workplace Marketplace Community Environment Corporate Governance Values CSR standards and guidelines: • ISO 26000 • United Nations Global Compact • United Nations Sustainable Development Goals • Global Reporting Initiative In 2013, BLF selected ISO 26000 as a framework to further embed CSR at the heart of its business strategy and systematically integrate it in its behaviors, business operations, and interactions with all stakeholders. Its CSR project team included members from the Communications, CSR and Customer Experience, International, Human Resources, as well as the Strategic and Organizational Planning Divisions, in addition to two experts from the Lebanese Standards Institution (LIBNOR). It conducted a stakeholder mapping and a gap analysis to assess the Bank’s strength and identify opportunities for enhancement, based on ISO 26000 seven core subjects in the fields of Organizational Governance, Labor Practices, Human Rights, Environment, Fair Operating Practices, Consumer Issues as well as Community Involvement and Development. BLF’s approach to CSR stems from a firm belief that CSR is a continuously-evolving journey, and in this regard, the Bank engaged in 2014 with its stakeholders through an online survey to examine what they viewed as key issues to address. BLF then developed a new strategy, aiming at playing a leading role in Sustainable Banking in Lebanon, setting targets focusing on the key target areas of sustainability: • Sustainable Lending • Sustainable Financial Innovation • Sustainable Support to the Community • Sustainable Environmental Strategy • Sustainable Engagement with Stakeholders. The strategy was translated into a long-term action plan, which will be gradually implemented across all business units at the Bank by 2019. “Our key focus has been on building, among all employees, awareness on sustainability concepts and on further embedding CSR into our organizational governance, incorporating CSR into our policies, procedures... These steps are crucial to continuously enhance our commitment to our four pillars.” Tania Rizk (Head of Group Communications, CSR and Customer Experience Division) In 2014, BLF’s new strategy and action plan were also selected as a case study for successful integration of CSR and they were presented in Geneva during the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) in the presence of CEOs of the Standardization bodies of the MENA region, the Social Responsibility National Project managers and the ISO Secretary General, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) representative and ISO Academy Director. The case study and action plan were published on the ISO website. In 2014, BLF amended its Mission Statement to reflect its commitment towards shared value and sustainability. During the same year, BLF took the next step to longstanding commitment to sustainability by joining the United Nations Global Compact, “the world’s largest voluntary corporate responsibility initiative that offers a strategic policy for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption.” BLF joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2014. In 2015, BLF became a founding member of the Local Network Steering Committee of the United Nations Global Compact. Since then, it sits on board of the Global Compact Network Lebanon (GCNL) and works in partnership with other business and non-business leaders to support the advancement and implementation of the ten UNGC principles in Lebanon and to expand the number of signatories. Loyal to its long-term ISO 26000 action plan, BLF also created in 2015 a CSR Committee headed by its Chairman General Manager to oversee the implementation of the Bank’s CSR activities. The Committee is comprised of the General Manager, the Head of Communications, CSR and Customer Experience, the Head of International and the Head of Human Resources Divisions. 15 Corporate Social

SDG 10: Reducing inequality within SDG 13: Taking action to combat and among countries. climate change and its impacts. Within the framework of its first CSR Report and ISO 26000 gap analysis, BLF identified in 2013 the themes which are relevant for its CSR. These material topics were selected on the basis of the Bank’s economic, environmental and social impacts, and substantive influence on the decisions of stakeholders. This exercise was done internally by the ISO 26000 Committee and their two consultants, and then shared in 2014 for feedback with internal and external stakeholders through an online study. Engaged stakeholders included representatives from the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL), Association of Banks in Lebanon (ABL), banking sector, correspondent banks, suppliers, media, Board Members and employees. The findings shaped the basis for identifying and prioritizing material topics for the Bank and refining its strategy. BLF also discussed the GRI disclosures with over 30 internal stakeholders, in addition to reviewing hundreds of internal documents (presentations, reports, benchmarks, website, Intranet, press releases, interviews…). The four GRI reporting principles for defining the Report content (stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, materiality, and completeness) were taken into consideration to determine material topics while considering their activities, impacts, and the substantive expectations and interests of its stakeholders. Priorities identified during the stakeholders engagement process are still relevant today. They will be validated in a formal way with all stakeholders in the next CSR Report. Further information on how each material topic is managed is provided in the Corporate Governance, Workplace, Marketplace, Community and Environment sections of this Report. 15 23 13 19 14 16 22 25 1 7 3 Importance to Stakeholders 11 18 4 24 5 12 26 6 17 28 27 10 2 9 20 8 21 Importance to BLF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE: The boundary of the material topic occurs internally (shareholders, executives, employees) and externally (clients, regulators and industry associations, suppliers and civil society) 1Principles 2Supply chain 3Values 4Code of conduct WORKPLACE: The boundary of the material topics occurs internally (executives and employees) 5Equal employment opportunity and diversity 6Training and human development 7Human rights policy and labor practices 8Rewards and remuneration 9Health, well-being and work-life balance 10Engaging employees 11Protection and freedom of expression MARKETPLACE: The boundary of the material topic occurs internally (executives and employees) and externally (clients, regulators and industry association, and civil society) 12Diversiﬁed business activities, products and services to empower the marketplace 13Enhancing customer experience 14Feedback and complaints mechanisms 15Compliance, anti-corruption and risk management 16Fair operating principles 17Financial inclusion 18Financial literacy 19Secure operations COMMUNITY: The boundary of the material topic occurs internally (employees) and externally (clients, media and civil society) 20Backing-up education 21Support to arts, culture and Lebanese heritage 22Giving back to humanitarian and social causes 23Supporting economic development 24Employee corporate volunteering ENVIRONMENT: The boundary of the material topic occurs internally (employees) and externally (clients, media and civil society) 25Eco-friendly products and services 26Green partnerships 27Environmentally-friendly practices at the workplace 28Raising environmental awareness 25 WORKPLACE Because Banque Libano-Française believes that human capital makes the ultimate difference for sustainable growth, it persistently does its utmost to attract, motivate and retain a talented workforce.

In addition to complying with the internationally recognized Human Rights Declaration, the Lebanese Labor Law and the Collective Labor Agreement, BLF strives to observe and promote the respect of the following: • ISO 26000 guidelines on social responsibility • The United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) principles • The International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work • The Arab Labor Organization (ALO) Convention on Human Rights. The Human Rights policy details how BLF respects human rights in the workplace and promotes them within its sphere of influence.

PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT BLF is concerned with the career development of its employees and seeks to encourage ambitious employees by rewarding them for their performance. In this context, a standardized annual performance review takes place between employees and their managers in order to assess the work and mutually set the objectives for the coming year. The annual performance review is an effective tool that allows for a two-way productive communication between the employee and his/her direct manager and clarifies mutual expectations. During the meeting, employees’ performances are acknowledged, development opportunities discussed and training needs identified. BLF uses a performance management software to monitor the achievement of the objectives and to help employees optimize their performance and achieve maximum results. Since 2016, BLF evaluates employees not only on goals, but also on embedding the Bank’s values into their dayto-day activities. In order to further reinforce the CSR Strategy and its realization, BLF also integrated in 2017 a CSR component into the employees’ objectives in order to make them contribute to BLF’s culture of sustainability through their day-to-day behaviors and decisions. 100% of employees received an annual performance review in 2016 and 2017. MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES Banque Libano-Française has implemented a management by objectives policy in order to align the individuals’ objectives with the overall objectives of the Bank. The Chairman issues towards the end of every year an orientation letter in which he summarizes the Bank’s achievements during the current year and sets the objectives for the coming year. Based on this, Managers set the annual plan of their Divisions involving their teams in the strategic planning. By doing so, the Bank does not only motivate the employees, but also makes sure that set goals are realistic and measurable. MANAGEMENT TRAINING PROGRAM The Bank offers a Management Training Program (MTP) to highly performing and promising employees. To shift into management positions, the latter are invited to follow a specific program which can reach up to two years depending on their profile. The program provides them with tailor-made internships at various entities of the Bank, as well as trainings. The candidates who are enrolled in the program witness real-life experiences. In 2017, BLF included newly recruited employees to this program, in order to identify their true potential and fast-track their professional development. 6 2014 8 2015 2016 2017 3 2 Number and percentage of employees who enrolled in MTP. INTERNAL MOBILITY AND RECRUITMENT Internal mobility allows employees to acquire skills in various areas or perform the same job in a different environment (Division or Branch) and helps the Bank keep expertise, experience and talent within the organization. Internal mobility encourages occupational as well as regional mobility by giving the employees access to several vacancies across the Bank. In line with a policy of internal promotion, BLF provides its employees, through its Intranet, first-hand open access to available vacancies before initiating an external recruitment process. BLF truly believes that in addition to filling vacant positions faster and more efficiently, internal mobility leads to greater staff satisfaction and retention. Moreover, prioritizing internal candidates for vacant positions allows employees affected by restructuring measures to find new roles within the organization.

FLEXIBLE SCHEDULE FOR STUDYING EMPLOYEES The Bank offers flexible arrangements for employees who are pursuing higher studies. PROTECTION AND FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION BLF’s policies are based on the respect of human rights in order to provide a work atmosphere free of harassment, racism, religious discrimination, power abuse or insults. FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION BLF recognizes that everyone has the right to freedom of opinion. At the same time, a completely unrestricted freedom of expression may lead to the infringement of the rights of others. Therefore, BLF practices political and religious neutrality and prohibits discussion of political or religious matters at the workplace. Employees must maintain absolute neutrality towards such topics, issues and events, and refrain from displaying in their work and working space political or religious documents and symbols that may be perceived as implying institutional support for a particular affiliation. BLF promotes the freedom of expression amongst its staff by fostering a two-way communication between employees and Management, encouraging employees to voice their concerns, opinions and problems via several communication channels. FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION BLF recognizes and respects the right of employees to freedom of association. The Bank affirms that employees that have decided to join or to refrain from joining the Federation of Unions of Banks’ Employees, as well as those who become syndicate representatives will not be subject to reprisal, dismissal or any sort of discrimination or power abuse. Employees who act as representatives are neither advantaged nor disadvantaged. The Bank assumes a strictly neutral position in this regard. VIOLENCE, HARRASSMENT AND BULLYING FREE WORKPLACE BLF ensures that all members of personnel are treated fairly and respectfully. It is committed to ensuring that its workplace is free from violence, power abuse, harassment and bullying. It does not permit nor tolerate any behavior that is violent, insulting, offensive, discriminatory, racist, humiliating, threatening, or degrading of anyone’s dignity at the workplace. COMPLAINTS AND GRIEVANCES MECHANISMS With regards to the internal and external schemes for reporting concerns and seeking advice on ethical and lawful matters, BLF has instated the following mechanisms: • Complaints and grievances module on the Intranet: To ensure a proper and confidential pathway for sensitive and compromising information, BLF has created a portal that allows employees to report grievances anonymously and directly to the Head of the Human Resources Division. The later then acts as an ombudsman with the full authority to investigate and act on claims without compromising the informer. • Internal whistle-blowing policy: The internal whistle-blowing policy aims to facilitate the detection and prevention of illegal activities harmful to the profitability and to the image of the Bank in accordance with guidelines of Circular N° 271 of the Banking Control Commission. Each employee is handed the detailed policy the day of recruitment and is asked to acknowledge that he has read, understood and will abide by the terms outlined in the policy. Similarly he agrees to inform the Internal Audit Division if an employee intentionally or negligently violates the Bank’s procedures. The employee is also held accountable for any unreported breach. • HR site visits: The Career Development team conducts periodic visits to all branches and divisions. During these visits, the team meets with all employees to discuss their careers and aspirations. It seizes this opportunity to encourage openly discussing any concern, and works actively towards investigating and resolving it. This approach fosters a climate of trust, open communication and accountability. • Open-door policy: An open-door policy has been instated in the Human Resources Division to enable all employees to walk in and discuss any doubt or concern. During these confidential meetings, the Human Resources Division advises the employees taking into consideration the Bank’s rules and regulations as well as its values and ethics. No incidents of discrimination were reported at the Bank during the reporting period. 55 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 2017 I Workplace EFFECTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH EMPLOYEES BLF aims at empowering its staff with constant information through various internal communication vehicles. This organizational culture brings coherence to the workplace and allows for a better synchronized work. But most importantly, internal communication allows keeping communication lines open between Management and employees, which is essential to convey management policies to employees and encourage them to voice their opinions. Internal stakeholders’ engagement tools include the following: • Intranet • Employees’ Facebook Group • Internal events • Suggestion box • Brand engagement think tank • Internal campaigns • Employees’ newsletter • Employees’ Club activities • Surveys • Employees’ Staff Instagram account • Employees’ Staff Snapchat account • Meetings • Committees. Winners of the suggestion box award. Trait d’Union, the employees newsletter. CELEBRATING SUCCESS AND STRENGTHENING TIES To reinforce the employees’ sense of belongingness, BLF organizes regular gatherings.

Employees gathered during a ﬁeld day held in 2016. Employees showcasing their talents during the annual employee ﬁeld day.

The Bank also organizes regular events to award winners of internal challenges for their outstanding performances. 57 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 2017 I Workplace THE EMPLOYEES’ CLUB To help increase employee engagement, motivation and well-being, BLF founded “Le Club des Employés” in 1972. The Employees’ Club arranges social, cultural, sports, recreational activities, and travels, thus enhancing cooperation among colleagues from all Lebanese regions and all entities. While some of the activities are free of charge, others are held at reduced costs, mainly because they are subsidized by the Bank or financed thanks to a symbolic monthly membership fee paid by the members.

Charles Salem (Assistant General Manager, Global Head of Private Banking and Wealth Management Division) INTERNATIONAL AND CORRESPONDENT BANKING The International Division serves the various divisions and entities of the Bank in terms of analyzing and following up counterparty and sovereign risks. It also generates business through BLF’s correspondent banking network, including risk participation activities, forfeiting, and pre and post-export finance, and coordinates with the Bank’s other entities to provide cash management services and foreign exchange, securities brokerage services, locally and internationally. The Bank maintains relationships and credit lines with a large number of international banks. Such a wide correspondent banking network allows the Bank to provide efficient and competitive services to its clients for all their international banking activities. The Bank’s trade finance confirmation lines were strengthened in 2005 when the Bank was the first in Lebanon and the second in the region to join the Global Trade Finance Program (GTFP) of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) by becoming first an issuing Bank and later a confirming Bank in the program. GTFP gives the Bank a competitive advantage in international trade finance transactions, enhances the Correspondent Banking network and improves the conditions and transparency of trade finance activities. In addition, the Bank’s International Division participates in various syndicated loans of foreign banks, and has structured several cross-border transactions as well as long-term borrowings from international and multilateral financial institutions such as: • Agence Française de Développement (AFD) • Banque Européene d’Investissement (BEI) • Arab Trade Financing Program (ATFP) • Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) • The Arab Investment Guarantee Company. The International Division is in charge of the Group’s International expansion plan, and supervises the activities of the Bank’s Representative Offices in Abu Dhabi (UAE), in Lagos (Nigeria) and its Baghdad branch (Iraq). 67 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 2017 I Marketplace FINANCIAL INCLUSION THROUGH DIVERSE DELIVERY CHANNELS BRANCHES Since the Bank intends to continuously invest and enhance the country’s economy, it aims to grow and expand outside the capital Beirut.

These regulations are often more restrictive than those issued by the Basel Committee. In accordance with Pillar 1 of Basel ll & lll, BLF applies the “standardized approach” for credit risk, the “standardized approach” for market risk and the “basic indicator approach” for operational risk. The Bank has sufficient capital to satisfy these requirements. In addition, BLF’s investment in advanced technological solutions to manage risks allows the Bank to reduce the capital charge for credit and operational risks. In terms of liquidity management, BLF is also fully compliant with Basel III rules covering short-term liquidity (Liquidity Coverage Ratio) and the long-term Net Stable Funding Ratios, as required by the Central Bank of Lebanon. BLF has also invested in a new ALM module which is being implemented. Furthermore, BLF conducts an internal assessment of the ability of its capital to cover further risks not identified by the Pillar 1, through the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) exercise recommended by the Pillar 2 of Basel ll. In addition, the Bank abides by the new regulations of Basel lll concerning the quality and quantity of eligible capital, and maintains a large buffer above the minimum solvency ratios required by the Lebanese regulators. 73 Corporate Social Responsibility Report 2016 2017 I Marketplace COMMITTING TO A SOLID CORPORATE CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE The Bank is highly committed to comply with all applicable local and international regulations, including standards of prevention of money laundering, terrorism financing and other criminal activities, as well as strictly implementing international sanctions and embargo programs. Disseminating a strong compliance culture among all employees is considered by the Bank’s Board of Directors and General Management as a top priority. Hence, and in order to prevent BLF products and services from being used for illegal purposes, all employees are constantly informed of compliance risks and trained to avoid or mitigate them. Moreover, the Bank is committed to fighting corruption in line with local laws, international best practices and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC). The Bank’s policies and procedures include specific measures for fighting corruption and bribery, such as a whistle blowing policy that is strictly implemented. The Bank has also put in place adequate measures and procedures forbidding its employees from accepting gifts above a certain value or other undue benefits from third parties. As a member of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) since 2014, a founding member of UNGC’s Local Network Steering Committee since 2015, a member of the SDG Council since 2017 and a champion of SDG 10 “Reduced inequalities”, BLF pledges to apply and promote within its sphere of influence the 10th principle of UNGC covering all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. Also in line with its CSR strategy, BLF follows the ISO 26000 guidelines where “Fair Operating Practices” is one of the core principles that encourage ethical behavior in its dealings with other organizations, in addition to the prevention of corruption. COMPLIANCE PROGRAM The Bank has established a robust compliance program under the responsibility of its Compliance Division and put in place a clear set of compliance policies and procedures, which are constantly updated in line with new local and international regulations requirements. The Legal Compliance monitors daily the issuance of new local and international regulations, as well as any amendments of existing regulations. It also handles their analysis, disseminates them to concerned parties at the Bank and/or its affiliates, assesses measures to be taken in order to be compliant thereto, and follows-up on their implementation. For the performance of its tasks, the Compliance Division resorts to various tools and controls, including a risk-based Anti-Money Laundering (AML) system, regular reports based on clients’ aggregated movements, and sanctions names filtering systems. The AML/CFT within the Compliance Division verifies, through daily and ongoing monitoring, that the Bank’s clients’ funds movements are not exposed to potential criminal activity, Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing (ML/TF), acts of bribery, corruption or tax evasion. Banque Libano-Francaise constantly ensures that its procedures for on-boarding clients and for updating their files are in compliance with international standards for due diligence following a Risk-Based Approach (RBA). Risk level is assessed according to the Risk-Based Approach which identifies the ultimate beneficial owners and assesses the inherent risks of ML/TF of the legal entities to apply an appropriate level of due diligence. Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies and procedures manual was circulated to all concerned employees, underlining the following points: • Local laws and circulars regarding AML/CFT • AML/CFT international standards and best practices • Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regular updates • Ongoing monitoring of accounts • AML/CFT red ﬂags and indicators • High risk and sanctioned countries • Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) on high risk clients • Screening on sanctions lists • Obligation to report suspicious transactions or doubtful clients • Roles and responsibilities of all staff and compliance ofﬁcers in branches and divisions.

Visa. “In line with our involvement in CSR initiatives within the marketplace, the World Food Program allowed us to achieve the financial inclusion of more than a million individuals using a digital and secure way, and to increase the banking literacy in rural and peripheral areas of Lebanon…” Myrna Wehbe (Head of Cards Services Division) Extracts from Walid Raphaël’s intervention at the Economic Conference for Development through Reforms with the Private Sector (CEDRE) in Paris, on April 6, 2018 “This Conference has already brought the concerns of our political leaders back to our country’s economy. It is actually raising a public debate that was long absent especially that the economy has been neglected in recent years and has greatly suffered from the multitude of events that have shaken our region… The GDP growth rate collapsed after the good years of 2008 to 2010 which recorded rates ranging from 8% to 10%. Since then, it has been oscillating between 1 and 2%. But we avoided the recession by keeping on attracting capital and carrying out private investment projects… Our economy has a huge potential. Its size has more than doubled since Paris 3 and has multiplied by 19 times since the end of the civil war. I believe it can still double in the next 10 years, which should reduce the debt burden; but this would only happen when the budget deficit is cut off and the potential of human capital is unlocked. Beyond improving the business environment, we are envisioning 3 growth poles for our economy: Walid Raphaël at CEDRE in Paris. The first pole is the oil and gas sector which represents a real opportunity for Lebanon. Although it is necessary to wait for the exploration phase in order to discover the true potential of our resources, the exploration companies must base their companies and managers in Lebanon, rent offices and apartments, recruit staff and outsource many services. New companies will be created and invest to serve this new industry. This opportunity alone will help initiate an investment process that should benefit the entire Lebanese economy. The second pole is the knowledge economy. Banque du Liban took the initiative of developing the entrepreneurship sector to create jobs and retain the human capital in Lebanon. Circular 331 allows banks to invest 4% of their equity in start-ups or venture capital funds with a 75% guarantee from the Central Bank against sharing 50% of profits. We are beginning to see the positive effects of this Circular as Lebanon is differentiating itself as a place of innovation. The digital sector could thus add an additional 1.5% GDP growth in 5 years. Finally, Public Private Partnerships stand as the third axis of development for our economy. In our view, this is the real opportunity for our country to reform the state and invest in infrastructures while avoiding the overburdening of public financing of an additional debt, to increase the efficiency of investments and to improve the provision of public services to our citizens. The only way to attract substantial investments to Lebanon is to privatize public services or set up Private Public Partnerships. We support the Government’s capital investment plan, while stressing on the importance of following the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund in the management of the plan, particularly regarding the need to apply good governance standards. The banking sector stands ready to support the reforms to be undertaken by the Government and to provide some of the funding required for PPPs.” 95 COMMUNITY Deeply engrained in Banque Libano-Française’s values is a sense of commitment to give back to the community.
