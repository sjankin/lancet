Based on the operational free cash flow the board proposes a dividend of SEK 2.45 per share for 2019, equal to a 3.8 percent increase versus 2018. Since the start of the share buy-back program in 2018, we have used SEK 10 billion, or around 6 percent additional return to our shareholders. As we have a slower than expected recovery of the service revenues, impacting our financial leverage expectations negatively and a potentially weaker economic outlook, the board decided in October not to execute on the remaining SEK 5 billion of the three-year share buy-back program. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my team and all my co-workers at Telia Company for the hard work everyone put into 2019. Thanks also to all 472,000 shareholders for your trust in our company.
