Impact Report 2 Introduction Unleash Human Potential Transform Manufacturing Minimize Environmental Footprint Our Approach Appendix ABOUT THIS REPORT NIKE, Inc.’s (“NIKE”) mission as a brand is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete1 in the world. Our purpose is to unite the world through sport to help create a healthy planet, active communities and an equal playing field for all. We do that by building creative and diverse global teams, making a positive impact in the communities where we live and work, and by making products responsibly and more sustainably. A commitment to transparency, accountability, and impact drives us – as reflected by our approach to sharing our priority issues and reporting our progress toward NIKE’s 2020 targets.2 The targets and measures in this NIKE, Inc. Impact Report represent our public commitments and are an aggregated view of our long-term goals to meet stakeholder3 expectations and align with NIKE’s business priorities. Building on NIKE’s reporting tradition since 2001, we expect to report progress against our social and environmental targets and priority issues annually. We know that we may face unforeseen and untimely setbacks, and that factors outside of our control may impact our efforts and intentions. We consider our goals aggressive – but achievable. We have plans in place to achieve these goals, knowing progress depends on end-to-end execution. Progress will not be linear. That said, we will amplify our successes and learn from our setbacks and failures. These goals are integral to our Purpose and we will pursue them relentlessly. In this report, we cover NIKE’s fiscal year 2019 (June 1, 2018, through May 31, 2019), with the notable exception of calendar year 2019 data for the Employee and Occupational Health and Safety sections. We will refer to the fiscal year as FY19 and the calendar year as CY19 for the rest of the report. Unless otherwise stated, the baseline for our targets is FY15. We have obtained external assurance on select reported metrics (Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption and emissions, and Scope 3 commercial air travel emissions).

We also continue to think critically about the change we want to drive inside NIKE. As of this FY19 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report, I have been President and CEO of NIKE In FY19, we maintained the global pay equity ratio for men to women, and for less than two months. Yet the extraordinary impact NIKE can have is already white to underrepresented groups in the U.S., that we achieved last year. Over the clear to me. past year, we increased VP-level representation for women by 3 percentage points (p.p.) to 39% globally and for U.S. underrepresented groups by 2 p.p. to 21%. This is the power of sport. Like so many across our company, I came to NIKE While this is good progress, we know there is more work to do. We will continue to because I believe in sport.

We are using CO2e emissions as a proxy for other environmental impacts (e.g. energy, other air emissions). 9 Average product carbon footprint is flat compared to the FY15 baseline due to an increase in both material per unit (apparel getting heavier) and manufacturing emissions intensity (driven by grid electricity in Vietnam and style/model mix). NIKE has two other FY20 carbon targets, which represent Tier 1 (finished goods manufacturing) combined with other key operations, and Tier 2 (materials finishing). The product target represents Tiers 1 through 4 (which includes materials manufacturing and raw materials production). 10 Product scope includes all product engines across Nike brand, Converse, and Hurley and Nike brand licensees. 11 We define more sustainable materials as those that reduce the environmental impact of a product through better chemistry, lower resource intensity, less waste, and/or recyclability. 12 FY16 and FY18 FW EPM percentages have been restated due to reporting variances identified through NIKE’s data governance processes. 13 Certified organic, Better Cotton (cotton grown according to the Better Cotton Standard System), or recycled. 14 FY18 has been restated due to a reporting variance identified through NIKE’s data governance processes. 15 The target scope includes electricity only, where we make energy purchase decisions on strategic assets. Equivalent to absolute reductions in Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions of at least 50% by FY25. Target year to achieve 100% is FY25, not FY20. FY18 performance data for this target has been restated due to enhancements in NIKE’s PPA tracking processes (FY18) that have resulted in more comprehensive and accurate reporting. 16 Key operations represent finished goods manufacturing, inbound and outbound logistics, DCs, HQs, and NIKE-owned retail. Historical performance data for this target has been restated due to a shift in NIKE’s logistics’ emissions data source (FY15–18) and to enhancements in NIKE’s PPA tracking processes (FY18) that have resulted in more comprehensive and accurate reporting. 17 Measure includes focus suppliers only. Focus suppliers represent key suppliers involved in the dyeing and/or finishing of materials that directly support finished product assembly. 18 Target covers waste to both landfill and incineration. Incineration does not include waste to energy recovery unless otherwise noted. 19 The waste index is a weighted average of our footwear manufacturing waste per unit, DCs waste per unit and HQs waste per occupant. Baseline is FY15 except for Tier 1 FW Manufacturing and Converse HQ, which are FY16 and are included in Inc.-wide baseline for comparability across years. 20 Baseline is FY15 except for Converse HQ, which is FY16 and included in Inc.-wide baseline for comparability across years. 21 As we add new chemicals and tighten the limits, we may see a small number of failures as the supply chain adapts to the more stringent requirements. Due to these changes, we do not recognize a baseline or change vs. the baseline. 22 FY18 was NIKE’s first year tracking this metric. FY18 has been restated due to a reporting variance identified through NIKE’s data governance processes. 23 This target is now measured and reported using the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines. Previously, this target was measured and reported using the BSR Standard. In FY17, we introduced the ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines, holding suppliers accountable to 24 additional conventional parameters and 202 hazardous chemicals, to vendors who produce approximately 80% of our materials. FY18 was the first year testing against the ZDHC Standard. FY19 NIKE, Inc.

Target Attract and develop an increasingly diverse, engaged, and healthy workforce Consumers live at the center of complex generational, social, cultural, and technological changes, and to serve them – and all athletes – better and more personally, NIKE must work to have our employee base reflect our global community. We must also continue to listen to our employees and invest in our culture to create a workplace where all employees feel valued and have opportunities for career growth. Sport gives us that opportunity.

The program helps FOR GIRLS girls, ages 8–10, develop movement skills based on a diverse array of sports and activities. Globally, girls tend to be less active than boys. Research by the Women’s Sports Foundation31 shows that only one in three girls between the ages of 6 and 12 participate in sport on a regular basis; 40% of teen girls don’t participate in sports; and boys get 1.13 million more sport opportunities than girls every year. Why? Researchers32 point to a “complex confluence of cultural, social, and economic factors, including, but not limited to, physical and perceived barriers to accessing sport, and a lack of supportive coaches.” Active girls are more confident, do better in school, and are better at setting goals – and these benefits continue into their adult lives. That’s why removing barriers is a primary focus of NIKE’s Made to Play commitment. We work with local, national, and global organizations around the world, working to grow girls’ access to sport and remove the barriers currently preventing them from play and obstructing the path to their potential. We also support girls with product so they can play with confidence, and we invest in gender-inclusive training models and enhanced curriculum that we make widely available.

Impact Report publication. 39 The reported injury rates reflect a combination of NIKE full-time and certain external temporary workers. 40 Data is collected based on U.S. legal reporting requirements, reporting on all NIKE’s operations except retail, which is excluded from OSHA recordkeeping requirements. Retail will be included in future reports. 41 The industry average comes from the United States Department of Labor; Bureau of Labor Statistics. Each industry classification (such as DC, Air Manufacturing Innovation (Air MI), Offices, Footwear Manufacturing, Apparel Manufacturing) reports a separate average for recordable injuries and lost time rates (which are captured). 42 A surge in product demand in a tight labor market is the primary driver behind the increase in injury rate. At the beginning of 2019, a number of employees elected to work overtime in order to meet production demands. We then added over 500 temporary workers to staff the production demands, many of whom had never worked in a manufacturing environment before. We have since stabilized our workforce and are seeing a downward injury trend that we expect to continue. 43 Tier 1 focus factory data is self-reported by factories and may be incomplete. At the time of the FY19 NIKE, Inc. Impact Report publication, December 2019 data was estimated for factories where actual data was unavailable. The BLS does not calculate manufacturing rates for equipment. 44 Due to publication timelines, CY17 BLS rates were used in the FY18 NIKE, Inc.

Shoetown Manufacturing facility – Yong Zhou, China 46 https://betterbuying.org/ 47 Audit counts were lower in FY17 and FY18 primarily due to NIKE’s introduction of the Factory Compliance Ownership (FCO) program. As the next step in evolving sustainability and compliance management, NIKE introduced the FCO program in early 2016. The program provides incentive opportunities for factories that maintain NIKE’s compliance standards and move beyond minimum compliance. Included in the incentives is reduced audit frequency with self-assessments when a factory has met thresholds for maintaining compliance over a number of years. 48 The top findings identified in audits in FY16, 17, 18, and 19 were working hours and wages and benefits.

That means we need a high volume of materials like textiles, polymers, and other essential fabrics. This reality sets the broad context for our ongoing efforts to reduce our products’ impact by using more sustainable materials, leveraging durability, reuse, recycling, circularity, and reducing waste along our supply chain. All materials carry an environmental impact: carbon emissions related to production and transportation to water use in agricultural and manufacturing processes to name just two. We continue to work aggressively to unite NIKE’s industry-leading design and performance to the lowest impact across carbon, waste, water, and chemistry. 4.3 This Product section of the report aims to represent all dimensions of that effort. While we have made notable progress, our performance against the measurable target defined for FY20 reveals challenges.

The program recycles and repurposes these materials into innovative products designed with athletes in mind. End-of-life shoes and manufacturing scrap – including rubber, foam, leather, and textile blends – become new material feedstock for use in products by NIKE and other industries. To date, the program has recycled over 120 million pounds of footwear factory material, equivalent to the weight of approximately 700 jumbo jets, and transformed 30 million pairs of athletic shoes – material that 120M would otherwise have been considered “waste” – into running tracks, basketball pounds of footwear courts, playgrounds, and factory material recycled other surfaces. 25 YEARS OF IMPACT In FY19, we celebrated Nike Grind’s 25 years of impact with a public exhibit at NIKE’s WHQ, showcasing Nike Grind’s contributions to advancing a zero waste future.

We have reviewed the accompanying NIKE, Inc. (“NIKE”) Management Assertion, that the sustainability metrics identified below, for the year ended May 31, 2019, are presented in conformity with the assessment criteria set forth in management’s assertion (the “assessment criteria”). • Total energy consumption (MWh) • Scope 1 (Direct) Emissions (Metric tons CO2e) • Scope 2 (Indirect) Location-Based Emissions (Metric tons CO2e) • Scope 2 (Indirect) Market-Based Emissions (Metric tons CO2e) • Scope 3 (Indirect) Emissions from Commercial Air Travel (Metric tons CO2e) NIKE’s management is responsible for its assertion and for the selection of the criteria, which management believes provide an objective basis for measuring and reporting on the sustainability metrics. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on management’s assertion based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) in AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to management’s assertion in order to be fairly stated. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether management’s assertion is fairly stated, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion. In performing our review, we have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct issued by the AICPA. We applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA and, accordingly, maintain a comprehensive system of quality control. GHG emissions quantification is subject to inherent measurement uncertainty because of such things as GHG emission factors that are used in mathematical models to calculate GHG emissions and the inability of those models, due to incomplete scientific knowledge and other factors, to accurately measure under all circumstances the relationship between various inputs and the resultant GHG emissions. Environmental and energy use data used in GHG emissions calculations are subject to inherent limitations, given the nature and the methods used for measuring such data. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could result in materially different amounts or metrics being reported. Data related to total energy consumed is subject to inherent limitations given the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection by management of different but acceptable measurement techniques could result in materially different amounts or metrics being reported. As discussed in the accompanying NIKE, Inc. Management Assertion, NIKE has estimated GHG emissions for certain emission sources for which no primary usage data is available. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying NIKE, Inc. Management Assertion in order for it to be fairly stated.

ESTIMATION METHODOLOGY Estimation methodologies employ reasonable assumptions to avoid understating NIKE’s emissions footprint and are described below. Estimated data Estimation methodology Natural Gas (retail and non-HQ offices outside Natural gas usage is estimated for sites outside of the U.S. and Canada, and for landlord-managed sites in the U.S. of the U.S. and Canada) and Canada where visibility on energy consumption is low. Square footage of retail and non-HQ offices per country is used, along with country-level climate assumptions and CBECS energy use intensity (kWh per square foot) based on climate region. In the U.S. and Canada, where some sites are landlord-managed and visibility on energy consumption is low, our internal known average country-level energy use intensity is used instead of the external CBECS benchmark. Approximately 90% of retail scope 1 emissions in FY19 were estimated, and approximately 50% of non-HQ scope 1 emissions in FY19 were estimated. Electricity (retail and non-HQ offices outside of Electricity usage is estimated for sites outside of the U.S., Canada, and EU and for landlord-managed sites in the the U.S., Canada, and EU) U.S., Canada, and EU where visibility on energy consumption is low. Square footage of retail and non-HQ offices per country is used, leveraging actual FY19 square footage data, along with electricity intensity (kWh per square foot of known FY19 NIKE electricity usage in retail or offices). About 63% of retail scope 2 market-based emissions in FY19 were estimated. About 65% of non-HQ scope 2 market-based emissions in FY19 were estimated. Propane (DC) Propane usage at one DC is estimated leveraging propane consumption intensity at a comparable DC based on relative square footage. Fugitive emissions from refrigerant Refrigerant leakage from HVAC units was calculated by applying an operating emissions factor (i.e. leak rate) of gas loss 10% (sourced from EPA’s Direct Fugitive Emissions from Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, Fire Suppression, and Industrial Gases) to the total system capacity across all units.

Similarly, we used a zero emissions factor for facilities in Europe that purchase GOs/EACs. Scope 2 Electricity (U.S., Canada, and EU) Supplier-specific emission factors (various sources) In the absence of a contractual instrument (or electricity consumption that exceeds onsite renewables and contractual instruments), we apply supplier-specific emission factors where they are available and meet a third-party quality criteria review. In FY19, supplier-specific emission factors covered 78% of NIKE’s electricity consumption in the U.S. and Canada and 4% of consumption in EMEA. Scope 2 Electricity (U.S. and Canada) Green-e Energy US Residual Mix Emissions Rates For facilities in the U.S. that do not have contractual instruments or supplier-specific emissions factors available, NIKE uses residual mix factors. Scope 2 Electricity (U.S.) eGRID (location-based) In the absence of contractual instruments, supplier-specific emissions factors, and residual mix factors, NIKE applies a regional/national grid mix factor. This only applies to landlord-managed facilities in the U.S. Scope 2 Electricity (EU) AIB European Residual Mixes For facilities in the EU that do not have contractual instruments or supplier-specific emissions factors available, NIKE uses residual mix factors. Scope 2 Electricity (Global) IEA World Electricity CO2 Emissions Factors In the absence of contractual instruments, supplier-specific emissions factors, residual mix factors, and a regional/national grid mix factor, NIKE applies a protocol that covers all countries globally. This global protocol serves as a catch-all for any sites that haven’t obtained an emission factor from a more granular step in the market-based hierarchy.

Manufacturing Restricted Substances List (MRSL) Data Integrity Sustainability data is shaped by a landscape of evolving methodologies, advancing standards, and expansions in data accessibility over time. Adapting to these changes while maintaining comparability in our data is critical to instilling integrity and confidence in the validity of the insights the data provides. We understand that we must adapt and be nimble to keep pace with broadening data sets and emerging standards. We continue to focus on the internal controls in our sustainability data processes and systems. We have obtained external assurance on select reported metrics (Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption and emissions, and Scope 3 commercial air travel emissions). More information can be found in the appendix. In cases where shifts in scope, methodology, and/or data quality have led to changes in previously reported performance results, we’ve restated historically reported results and provided context on the changes in the Restatements section of the Appendix. The data presented in this report has been collected through a variety of processes, reviewed, and internally validated and represents the most complete and accurate information at the time of publication. NIKE will continue to be transparent on revisions to reported data in the future.

All material types reported are purchased from external suppliers except for EVA foam, which is sourced internally. Data reported consists of both direct measurements and estimates. While many materials are measured directly for a wide variety of products, total corrugate volumes are estimated using average packaging material used for each product group. The majority of cotton and polyester volume data is sourced using direct measurements, though product creation data is used to estimate material volumes for certain parts of the business. In FY19, Nike brand apparel shifted the data source used for reporting polyester volumes.

Previously, our data cut-off (May 31) was in the early stages of our Performance Review cycles so we saw more employees without a performance rating. With the timing of our data being focused on later in the calendar year it allows us to provide information once our annual processes are complete which leads to the variance from previous reports. • Employees without a CFE include “Null” or “No Rating” values. • Employees with a “Too New to Rate” are included with employees with a rating.
