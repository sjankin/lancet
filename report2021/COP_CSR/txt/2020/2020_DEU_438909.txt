The same applies 2 to the topic of sustainability. While others talk, we set Products and services actions into motion. Bold visions and distant targets are fine and good, because they provide orientation. However, 3 what really matters is that we make an effective contribution to environmental and climate protection here and now. Production and Because the only way to realise grand visions like that of value creation a climate-neutral Europe in 2050 is by implementing concrete measures today. 4 Employees and society Sustainability is not just a trend for us. Appendix It is a call to action. For us it’s about thinking and acting beyond today for tomorrow. This can be seen in our Sustainable Value Report 2019. We have already fulfilled almost all the ­sustainability targets that we set in 2012 for 2020 or are in the final stretch Oliver Zipse towards achieving them. Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG Our road to sustainable mobility: we plan to meet Europe’s CO2 requirements for 2020 and 2021. A major focus of our sustainability strategy is lowering CO2 emissions. In recent years, we have steadily reduced the CO2 emissions of our vehicle fleet and achieved a decrease of around 40 per cent between 1990 and 2019. In 2020, we will once again lower our carbon emissions in Europe ­significantly, with a decrease of around 20 per cent from the previous year.

However, the calculation of CO 2 emissions from fleet vehicles will only be switched to WLTP in 2021 by the European Commission. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate WLTP fleet emissions back to NEDC values up to and including 2020 for reporting purposes. The changed WLTP test constraints lead to higher NEDC emissions (NEDC correlated) due to the reversed calculations. In order to ensure comparability, the CO 2 fleet emissions for 2017 (122 g / km NEDC) were converted to a correlated NEDC value of 128 g / km under WLTP test constraints and published originally with the 2 / 2018 quarterly report. 3 A djusted value in line with planned change to WLTP (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure) 4 C alculated based on volumes of green energy purchased as well as the conservative calculation of country-specific energy shares from renewables purchased from third parties.

In 2019, one focus area was the expansion of solar capacities at various sites. New photovoltaic systems were successfully commissioned in Rayong / TH as well as Shenyang / CN plants. A 70,000 m2 solar farm with a capacity of 5 MW was installed at the newly opened San Luis Potosí / MX plant. During its ramp-up phase, the photo­voltaic system already supplied almost half of the electricity required for installing the production facilities. We purchased the remaining electricity from other suppliers of renewable energy and made up any shortfalls by acquiring certificates, thus achieving a 100 % carbon-free electricity supply at this site for the reporting period. And at the Rosslyn / ZA plant the BMW Group has been cooperating since 2015 with the “Bio2Watt” company, which also aims to secure energy supply from renewable sources. In the future, a biogas system producing energy from organic waste and cattle manure will cover approximately 70 % of the electricity demand at this plant. 85 Combined separate non-financial report Introduction Stabilising the grid by storing energy Due diligence processes: In addition, we continuously work on innovative solutions 1 for using and storing renewable energy.
