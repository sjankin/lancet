ScanCom Group is a leading player in the global market for sustainable outdoor furniture. To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way – the sustainable way”, also when nobody is watching. However, we must admit our principles are under pressure from competitor not always doing business the right way, and especially in times of COVID-19 crisis, which will not let us change our focus on what we believe is the right long-term strategy. It is important to stress that our corporate CSR strategy and business values are not a project that starts and ends, but an ongoing willingness to improve our sustainable business model. “Doing Business the Right Way” and focus on sustainability can go hand in hand with improved operational performances and profitability, although our 2019/2020 results have not confirmed that statement, but our employees' safety and our managerial behaviour in implementing tough decisions are key to us. We are confident that the chosen strategy and being loyal to our management principles and values, will generate improved results in the coming year. 6 UN Global Compact: communication on progress SUSTAINABILITY FOR MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OPERATIONS AND KEY SUPPLIERS To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global controls all materials and products in order to meet Compact are requirements for the improvement all relevant regulations in our markets.

CHALLENGES IN SEASON 2019/2020 BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC MARKETS • Several customers went fast into a ‘lockdown-mode’, meaning they postponed or cancelled orders placed, or delayed payments for products. • The overall sense of panic affected across a wide array of businesses, markets and industries, reaching many ‘across the board’ – which is natural and was to be expected due to the unknown situation. • Markets slowly picked up towards the end of the season –particularly in e-commerceand channeling stock and products in this period gave us a surprising peak of sales during the summer of 2020. PEOPLE • People were impacted by the situation as well, and the consumers were naturally scared of the Covid and what this would mean for the individual persons, families, communities and world. • Many people have lost their jobs around the world and this has created a challenging situation that have been life-changing for a lot. Due to the amount of Covid-infections globally, many many families have been hard hit by this. • People have fortunately also come toghether and joined forces to support others in need, reaching out with donations and charities. OUR ACTIONS • Very early in the Covid phase, we reacted to the incoming challenges, by taking tough –but necessarydecision to support the continued existence of the company and all of our colleagues working at ScanCom. • We didn’t wait for reactions from our customers and business partners as the situation required action, so we jumped straight in and fought every day to stay above water; showing our team spirit and organisation –getting through this together. • #proudtobescancom – how we have handled the situation and dealt with the challenges, walking the talk of ‘Doing Business the Right Way’ both during and eventually post Covid is something we can be very proud of. • We keep investing in the future, keep pushing for sustainability and the circular agenda –even in times when others just focus on reducing costs. 11 WORKPLACE CONDITIONS ASSESSMENT During season 2019/20 with result of audits, ScanCom has achieved good results at all the CSR audits from customer’s standards to international standards as BSCI, SMETA 2-4 Pillars, ISO 14001; OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001, Global security verification (GSV) and Supply chain security or Customs-trade partnership against terrorism (C-TPAT). Besides the management system verifications, ScanCom has conducted required annual workplace environment measurement on some working influence factors like: noise, dust, ventilation, chemical exposure level, lighting, humidity, temperature, vibration, ergonomic and conducted the quarterly measurement on the elements exposure and affected to the external environment like: Dust, noise, air-emission and wastewater discharge. In additional, ScanCom has also conducted the periodical test for the living water, the drinking water according to the local national standard, the annual and periodical health check for all employees IKEA WELL-DEVELOPED SUPPLIER UNIT RECOGNITION IKEA has, after over 6 years of business cooperation, recognised ScanCom’s commitment from top management and the entire organisation towards compliance with their CSR and HSE policies. Our transparency system, which is a combination of the in-place tracked record and the efficient internal CSR and HSE control and monitoring systems, has resulted in ScanCom received the IKEA IWAY Well Developed Supplier Unit (IWDSU) award in January 2020. This has re-confirmed the trust from IKEA in our commitment and the internal capability of self-monitoring and self-performance, self-improvement and continuous system driven focus. HUMAN RIGHTS ScanCom International A/S is committed to influence the employees and the business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be reviewed in our website: http://www.scancom.net ScanCom used the BSCI and SMETA monitoring system to ensure that the contracted manufacturers, as a minimum, are in compliant with the basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labour conditions. Besides, for season 2019/20, ScanCom has verified the social compliance performance at 28 contracted manufacturers and put in use for all contracted manufacturers who were registered and audited under the BSCI platform with acceptable rating. 12 UN Global Compact: communication on progress BSCI MONITORING OF CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ScanCom has continued to increase the collaboration and commitment from the existing contract manufacturers (CMs) and new CMs over the requirements from BSCI platform with acceptable rating from BSCI audits. Besides, ScanCom has also extended the support to the new business partners, who ScanCom is going to set up the business relationship with, in conducting the compliance gaps assessment at their facilities on their request and guiding them on remediation of the non-conformance areas to prepare for the BSCI audit. One partner was rated at D level after its initial audits. However, the partner is committed and is currently in a progress of working on the necessary remediation with us and will request for follow-up audits in the coming time. We are confident that this partner will achieve C rating or better at the follow-up audit. Contract Manufacturers SS 18/19 SS 19/20 Production site registered on BSCI audit platform 24 28 Total number of BSCI audits, initial and re-audit 24 28 BSCI Compliance Rating SS 18/19 SS 19/20 A (Outstanding) 0/24 1/28 B (Good) 1/24 2/28 C (Acceptable) 22/24 24/28 D (Improvement needed) 1/24 1/28 E (Non-Compliant) 0/24 0/28 SUPPLIER AUDITS ScanCom is continually developing higher CSR performance levels at the suppliers. All suppliers signed ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. 100% of new suppliers, where relevant, were subjected to an onsite CSR audit conducted by ScanCom or a required audit by external audit firm for BSCI and/or SMETA or other required standards by specific customers. CHILD LABOUR AND FORCED LABOUR During the past season, as with those previous, ScanCom maintained regular audits at CMs together with customer audits, BSCI and SMETA audits. Again, for this season, ScanCom continues to report that there were no cases of child labour or forced labour happening at ScanCom and our business partners. Current control procedures prove sufficient to ensure no child or forced labour enters the supply chain. LABOUR ScanCom continuously committed to the support and protection of labour rights including abolition of child labour, elimination of forced labour, freedom of association, and eradication of any kind of discrimination or harassment and abuse. The way of the data reported this time is a bit different from last season with the comparison of data from the 2 seasons but still keep the visible segregation between males and females from different level of employment, workers to management. From the data, it showed some increased figures and some decreased figures. With the current unbalance between males and females in the management level, we are in the focus to bring up the female management in the coming season with our talent management trainee program in phase 2. Some of the data are newly set up and taken into the report in this season 19/20 for a full picture of safety and care. Therefore, some data input was not actually reflected the fact for the 2 seasons but will be more visible in the coming season. 13 WORKFORCE BREAKDOWN SCANCOM VIETNAM SEASON 2019-2020 (SEPT. AUG.)

In order to compare between the 2 seasons, the average data in 12 months of season 18/19 was used here for computation. SCVN SCVN’s activities are located in an area with traditionally very high labour turnover in general and more so in the furniture Industry. ScanCom has invested in incentive system, education, skills building and subsequent allowances as well as childcare, transportation allowance and house rental allowance. Besides the well payment of wages that was above the legal regional minimum requirement, ScanCom also invested many attracting allowances and bonuses for employees. We also ensured the health and safe working environment from employees through upgrading the firefighting and fire prevention system, ergonomics support system, the safety systems, the restroom and motorbike parking slots, and even the health care program for employees. Going beyond the legal requirements on working environment, ScanCom has installed an in-house air-cooling system in labour-intensive areas to deal with the regional normal high temperatures. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic spreading around the world, the global economic crisis has occurred. This pandemic has seriously affected the production and business activities of ScanCom with cancellation of orders, suspension of shipments, payment delays, inventory at the highest level and customer failure to continue commitment. Those has led ScanCom to no other choices but to cut off for 1,106 employments through mutual agreement with employees, no renewal of labour contract with employees and self-resignation from employees. The labour turnover rate compared to season 18/19 saw a labour turnover higher slightly of 3% in season 19/20. A fast growing economy, driven by the industrial sector has increased labour competition in general and allowed domestic migrated workers to find new suitable jobs close to their rural home towns in new established industrial clusters. SCIN In terms of labour turnover, season 19/20 was higher compare to season 18/19. A part of that was also due to Covid-19 pandemic. SCIN has cut off 108 employments through mutual agreement with employees and no renewal of labour contract with employees. The labour turnover rate compared to season 18/19 saw a spike in labour turnover higher of 17% in season 19/20 SCBR The labour turnover of SCBR saw significant variation from the previous year due to high movement at the Rio Grande do Sul “Minas do Leão” site, which was adjusting its staffing Headcount Turnover by Category. Also due to Covid-19, SCBR has cut off 28 employments through mutual agreement with employees and no renewal of labour contract with employees. The labour turnover rate compared to season 18/19 saw a spike in labour turnover higher of 37% in season 19/20 16 UN Global Compact: communication on progress HOURS OF WORK SEASON 2019-2020 (SEPTEMBER AUGUST) SCANCOM VIETNAM SCANCOM INDONESIA SCANCOM do BRAZIL WORKING HOURs SS SS RATIO to SS SS RATIO to SS SS RATIO to VARIATION 18/19 1920 SS18/19 18/19 1920 SS18/19 18/19 1920 SS18/19 1 Total overtime hours 605,625 681,710 12.6% 4,502 34,345 662.9% 10,149 4,449 -56.2% 2 Average overtime hours 153.79 152.95 -0.5% 19.98 134.55 573.4% 123.76 75.41 -39.1% per head 3 Total normal working hours 9,829,248 11,124,672 13.2% 420,911 448,336 6.5% 179,986 128,949 -28.4% DATA IN TOTAL 10,434,873 11,806,382 13.1% 425,413 482,680 13.5% 190,134 133,398 -29.8% To compare on the working hours between the 2 seasons with season 18/19 having 14 months, we have used the average hours of work for 12 months in season 18/19. The decrease in total headcount plus the orders reduction due to Covid-19 pandemic has driven for slightly low overtime in season 19/20 compared to season 18/19 for SCVN but significant for SCBR while having increment in SCIN. There were significant overtime hours in season 19/20 from November 2019 to March 2020 during the peak season in SCIN due to the serious focus for improving quality and on time delivery. Season 19/20 was in compliant with local regulations of maximum 200 overtime hours a year as well as the international standard of maximum 60 working hours a week.

ScanCom has always compensated employees at a significantly higher level compared to this regional minimum wage. ScanCom applies principles for actual living costs and market competition rather than the regional minimum wage for remuneration strategy. In season 2019/2020, the lowest wage level for ScanCom workers was around 32% higher than the legal regional minimum wage. Furthermore, ScanCom has continued the policy of an extra payment of 2.5% for health, social and unemployment insurance monthly as the financial support to the workers. In January 2020, ScanCom has not only adjusted the salary as per the new legal regional minimum wage for workers but also defined the additional increment by the working seniority with 4 grades of 5 years starting from the entering of the workers. First grade will be entitled to from around USD17.8, USD17.8 + 5% for second grade, USD17.8 + 10% for third grade and USD17.8 + 15% for the last grade. In addition, ScanCom has upgraded the skills allowance scheme in season 2019/20 to attract the welders and grinders working long term with Company. There were 5 levels for welder and 3 levels for grinder at the same amount starting from around USD43.47, USD52.17, USD60.86, USD69.56 and USD78.26 compared to the last season with USD17.39, USD21.73, USD26.08, USD30.43 and USD43.47 for welder and USD21.73, USD26.08 and USD34.78 for grinder. Changes in the national health insurance regulations in Vietnam have caused an increment in the number of sick days and hours compensated by OT hours compared to previous years. SCIN To increase efficiency of contract worker usage (minimize number of contract worker in certain months), SCIN has increased overtime hours instead of hiring too many contract workers. SCIN paid contract workers at a rate of minimum wages level as decided by government and all permanent employees were at the (minimum 11.3%) higher level than regulation (minimum wages), depending on position and responsibility. SCBR Paid wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. SCBR salaries were at least 28% above the national regulation, which is a positive factor in terms of the retention of staff. Variation between one year and another, motivated by the movement of employees (dismissals and admissions). 18 UN Global Compact: communication on progress NON-DISCRIMINATION ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kinds of discrimination during the recruitment, within the time of work or when having mass lay-off on the workforce due to gender, age, origin, family status, region, etc. SCANCOM VIETNAM SCANCOM INDONESIA SCANCOM do BRAZIL RATIO BETWEEN MALEs RATIO BETWEEN MALEs RATIO BETWEEN MALEs & FEMALEs & FEMALEs & FEMALEs WORKFORCE VARIATION SS19-20 SS18-19 SS19-20 SS18-19 SS19-20 SS18-19 1 Male workers 70.1% 70.0% 82.3% 79.7% 81.6% 70.0% Female workers 29.9% 30.0% 17.7% 20.3% 18.4% 30.0% 2 Male staffs 47.6% 47.8% 51.2% 52.4% 33.3% 31.6% Female staffs 52.4% 52.2% 48.8% 47.6% 66.7% 68.4% 3 Male operation management 83.5% 82.3% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% (group leader-sr.manager) Female operation management 16.5% 17.7% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% (helper-sr.manager) 4 Male Indirect management 56.7% 64.5% 65.3% 65.1% 100.0% 100.0% (A.manager-sr.manager) Female Indirect management 43.3% 35.5% 34.7% 34.9% 0.0% 0.0% (A.manager-sr.manager) 5 Male Director 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 0.0% 100.0% 100.0% Female Director 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 0.0% MALE TOTAL 69.1% 68.6% 79.7% 77.2% 67.8% 62.2% FEMALE TOTAL 30.9% 31.4% 20.3% 22.8% 32.2% 37.8% Though there was no discrimination in hiring employees, the number of job application received from female employees was still significantly low. Due to the nature of the industry and the requirement of standing work positions, it was a disadvantage in balancing the workforce gender. In addition, there was so many factories in different industries within the industrial park and surrounding the industrial park, the choice of light work and more overtime hours was the favour of the female workforce. 19 HEALTH AND SAFETY OHSAS 18001 To build a strong culture to prevent accidents, incidents and work related illness is an important priority for all ScanCom subsidiaries and departments. Everyone should go home safely from work and all management focused on protecting the workers’ health and safety. For season 2019/2020, SCVN has passed the annual OHSAS 18001:2007 audit for the occupational health and safety management system with the positive result. In relation to the OHSAS 18001 requirements, SCVN has now fully implemented its standards associated with regulations and customer requirements related to health and safety.

Besides these statistical differences, the higher labour turnover and inflow of new workers supporting the company’s growth – increased the number of new and unexperienced workers. This higher ratio of new workers has, despite the training, contributed to the incidents as well. In season 19/20, the management has decentralized the HSE function to the operational management away from the centralized CSR department. Aim is to enhance the ownership focus and priority of the shop floor management on HSE. Risk assessment, risk based internal audits, machine safety specification and compliance, improved high level of electrical standard implementation, and effective training and part of the focus and improvements. To mitigate the impact of new workers on labour accidents, the training program will be updated going forward. Existing standard health and safety, Fire Safety, and evacuation training for all sites and shifts have been maintained properly. SCIN SCIN provided training to all new employees in health and safety, including evacuation and fire drill. These activities were twice a year for employees. SCIN also provided general training about new regulation related to health and safety with the Labour Department Officer. For new workers, supervisors conducted the training on machinery safety and quality of product. SCIN also got inspection from Labour Department in connection with health and safety at the work place (production area). 20 UN Global Compact: communication on progress SCBR SCBR recorded an increase in the sick leave days this increase in season 18/19 besides monitoring 14 months in season 18/19 and a growth in total headcount of over 30% the numbers were also increased due domestic accidents occurred outside the company working hours and premises. 21 LEAVE INFORMATION Some of the data are newly set up and taken into the report in this season 19/20 for a better picture of ScanCom with more information relating to areas where they shall be taken into consideration for improvement in the future.

And in 19/20, ScanCom be affected by Covid-19, reduced orders so that Company has arranged for workers taking annual leave instead of annual leave payment by cash as per season 18/19. During our 18/19 season the government adjusted the health insurance legislation allowing for more treatable cases at hospital and doctor offices. Additionally, both the father and mother allowed taking leave in case a child was sick. These developments are good for the society overall but caused to increased leave days.

Observed annual re-audited with a good result. Besides, applied sustainability program has induced Green-Steps in eliminating hazardous materials, reducing production waste, saving energy, and complying with REACH in preventing pollution. In this season, the data from all the production units was combined and represented for the entire ScanCom Group, where ScanCom Vietnam still play the key role in environment protection with 7 large production units and 2 finished good warehouses while ScanCom Indonesia’s medium production unit and ScanCom Brazil in a supply role of plank wood material. Moreover, the data from ScanCom Brazil was for the entire wood material supply to many customers including a part of the entire volume for ScanCom Vietnam. DATA Over the preceding years, ScanCom has been working towards an improvement in the collection of reliable data and this has been strengthening over time to reach a higher satisfactory level. MATERIALS USED As to the direction of sustainability strategy, ScanCom has also focused on materials used for production and starting to source with suppliers for high volumes of recycled material with the purpose of achieving a reduced impact to the environment and the climate change. This is further compounded with the reintroduction of ‘waste’ materials from our own production facilities. -Marking the partnership with Plastic Bank, ScanCom Indonesia visited a collection point to see the sorting operation for the Social Plastic® material. 24 UN Global Compact: communication on progress RECYCLE % IN USE IN MATERIALS PURPOSE UNIT MATERIAL ALUMINUM BILLET For production TON 50 DURA LAND PLASTIC RESIN For production TON 100 DURA OCEAN PLASTIC RESIN For production TON 100 PAPER PALLET For production TON 98 SMA PAPER For production TON 98 CARTON PAPER For production TON 98 STRETCHING FILM For production TON 50 PE FOAM For production TON 50 POLYBAG For production TON 50 STRAPPING BAND For production TON 95 -ScanCom Indonesia at Plastic Bank collection point. 25 26 UN Global Compact: communication on progress RESOURCE CONSUMPTION In season 18/19, the period was from July 18 to August 19 with 14 months and season 19/20, the period was from September 19 to August 20 with 12 months.

Approved certified contractors have handled our waste for reuse, resell or treatment purpose. Domestic waste was reduced during season 19/20. Hazardous waste was down because of reduction of production volume during the Covid-19 period. Our annual waste reduction target is 5% and together with Covid-19 impact, the total waste volume was significantly reduced. Hazardous waste: we handle the wastes such as lamp, ink, battery, oil, chemical, solvent, contaminated chemical wastes including container, slug, etc. based on the government regulation and do coordinate with legal authorized third party for disposal. We produced annual report as required for these hazardous wastes to local environmental department. From the above data, all the waste indicators were positive with significant reduction comparing to last season 18/19. This has help ScanCom Group to save 39% of total wastes generation per season where the amount of saving contributed to the group was not small at all. CO2 EMISSION ScanCom has continuously monitored CO2 output with the aim of a stepwise reduction in CO2 emissions. Season 19/20 data with CO2 emission increased 11% for the group though there was a period of few months undergone with Covid-19 pandemic. The reason was mainly due to the additional new sawmill facility at ScanCom Vietnam as well as with the more complicated product styles.
