At that point we could define our major stakeholders, where we wanted to make a difference within the context of our business. These are: • People (employees and members) •Local Society • Global Society In this connection we decided to implement our initiatives in two stages. The first stage would thus concentrate on implementing initiatives within the Secretariat to ensure that all members of staff understood UNs basic principles and ensure the willingness to implement sustainable solutions throughout the Company. The second stage would hereafter be directed at initiatives outside the secretariat, first towards our members, and later toward society, locally and finally globally. To make sure that all initiatives were employee borne, we set up a CSR committee, which became responsible for choosing and implementing the internal initiatives within stage one .

The environment The environmental impact of a smaller and medium size business enterprises and our scope for reducing the carbon footprint is smaller in scale than in many other industries. Even so, we find that this is no excuse not to make an effort. We have therefore adopted a green purchasing policy, in which environmental considerations are essential. Therefore the new printers, which have been purchased in 2013 consume considerably less power than other printers, and the supplies are sustainable. This applies not only to consumption but also disposal and transport of packaging. With regards to lighting, we chose low-energy solutions wherever possible, buying energy efficient light bulbs and purchasing electricity which primarily derives from wind power. We have furthermore installed videoconferencing facilities in order to reduce CO2 emissions from travelling. The Company has also purchased 11 bicycles, so that meetings held within same localities can be reached by bicycle. We also joined the “Bicycle to work” campaign in May, where more than half the employees bicycled to work regularly in the course of the month. Goals We wish to continue to find areas where we can reduce our CO2 emissions. How do we monitor and evaluate performances The CSR committee regularly informs the Company, which initiatives have been initiated. Furthermore once a month, a prize is given to the most environment friendly employee and department. 1.2.The working environment and health of the employees The Zonal Construction and Handling Services Co,Ltd believes that all employees have the right to individual freedom of expression and opinion. This is upheld by regular meetings between management and employee groups and bimonthly office meeting. We have conducted a work place assessment, which showed a few areas of employee discontent. The findings were acted upon immediately to improve the satisfaction of the employees. In having a good working environment, lies also having good health. A bad working environment affects the health of the individual and vice versa – and both have an impact on employee well being and motivation. Some of the initiatives we have implemented thus aim at promoting and protecting our employees’ physical well being. The employee rights therefore include home working, ergonomic work place assessment, an employer subsidised healthy lunch, fresh fruit, a private health insurance, influenza vaccinations, massage, and annual sports and social activities. Goals It is our goal to have a high rate of employee satisfaction and low sickness absence. Monitoring and evaluating performances Constant dialogue with the employees is deemed the best way of securing a good working environment and preventing stress. The management therefore has a responsibility of monitoring the employees well being, both on a regular basis and through the yearly “Performance and Development review” Future initiatives In 2020 and 2021 our focus will be directed towards our members – The Zonal Construction & Handling Services Co,Ltd . We are planning to: • Start a campaign to get our members to register within the global compact framework • Set the agenda for diversity and encouraging equal opportunities in recruitment, training and promotion, especially for female professionals. • Actively inspire our members to give legal advise on Corporate Social Responsibility issues.
