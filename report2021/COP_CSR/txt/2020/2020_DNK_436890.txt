The UN Global Compact Network Denmark and Danish Auditors’ CSR Committee awarded our 2018 report as one of the six best reports of the year in the category “Communication on Progress-report – Global Compact (SMV-COP)”. The award is given for sharing best practices and inspiring other companies, in particular small RA T P CT and medium-sized businesses working with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and BES 1 ICE how this area can lead to new market opportunities. SMV COP At Danish Energy Management (DEM), we have over the past years delivered a broad range of services related to the SDGs, including business strategies, sustainability plans, marketing 2019 strategies, as well as developing cases, action plans and road maps. We have achieved this by having dedicated employees and by working with partners who are actively engaged in providing increased sustainability within their communities – abroad and in Denmark. The preparation of our sustainability report has, above all, created the opportunity for a unique involvement of our employees. It has contributed to increased ownership, making employees aware of the fact that their daily work is part of something bigger and in addition, how reporting and working with the UN Global Goals can open up new business areas and attract new customers. In addition to the sustainability services that we provide, and in order to walk-the-talk, we have also incorporated the SDGs into our own business strategy. Our motivation for this has been supported by our firm belief that “what gets measured, gets done”. For this reason, and for the fourth year in a row, we are measuring progress towards achieving the SDGs across all projects in Denmark and internationally, based on our online SDG reporting system. While the SDGs provide a focus on the sustainable impact of our projects, the Global Compact Initiative and its ten principles provide a clear way to evaluate the sustainability of our company’s day-to-day activities, helping us to continually improve. Together, the SDGs and the Global Compact Initiative enable DEM to approach sustainability in a holistic way; the benefits of which are passed directly on to each of our partners. Through our sister company, Danish Management, we continue to provide consultancy services to private and public institutions on how to work strategically with the SDG’s – in all sectors and on all levels. In 2019 we have had the honor of helping small and medium sized companies and organizations with the SDGs as well as we became part of the consortium that is currently developing country-level SDGindicators for Statistics Denmark. The fulfillment of the SDGs and the 2030-agenda require concerted action on all levels and in DEM we are proud to be part of this mission. Yours sincerely Jørn Lykou CEO D EM SUSTA I N A BI LI T Y REP OR T 2 0 1 9 3 DEMs COMPANY IMPACT MEASUREMENT Since 2016, we have been using our online SDG Reporting System to measure sustainable impact and progress towards SDG 7, 11, 13 and 17 across all projects on an annual basis based on 30 specific indicators. Each relevant SDG, actionable SDG Target, and company specific indicator is connected to our financial system so that impact can be measured both in terms of monetary value, and in terms of hours worked. This year (2020) we will review our system and assess if our services within e.g. LAR (Local drainage of rainwater) and Circular Economy should become part of the system enabling us through new goals and indicators to measure impact from those and other areas.

The base year for reporting on verifiable emissions data is the 2015 reporting year. The operational boundary covers scope 1, scope 2, and part of scope 3 (business travel) with relation to all DEM offices in Denmark. Figures provided follow the Green House Gas (GHG) protocol, and the GHG calculation tool provided by the World Resources Institute. DEM offices included in the 2019 reporting year are: • Aarhus • Copenhagen • Sønderborg To calculate results, emissions are categorized as either direct (Scope 1) or indirect (Scope 2 & Scope 3). Direct, Scope 1, emissions are those that are directly caused by a source that the company owns or controls. Indirect, Scope 2 and Scope 3, emissions are derived from the company’s consumption of energy products and services, where the company does not own or control the emissions source. FOLLOWING THE GHG PROTOCOL CORPORATE STANDARD, THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EMISSIONS ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE SCOPES: SCOPE 1: All direct emissions caused by the company, e.g. SCOPE 3 emissions from company owned cars, or combustion of fossil fuels such as natural gas in company-owned equipment Use of other transportation forms for business • Use of company cars for business purposes – managers purposes Domestic ﬂight • Use of company cars for business purposes – employees International ﬂight SCOPE 2: All indirect emissions caused by the company’s Ferry Employees own car purchase of energy Taxi • Electricity use in offices Train • District heating used in offices Electricity SCOPE 2 Bus Use of energy SCOPE 3: Other indirect emissions caused by consumption in oﬃces of products and services • Use of employee cars for business purposes (car allowance) Employees • Transportation by train • Transportation by taxi SCOPE 1 • Transportation by bus • Domestic air transport Use of company • Transportation by ferry • International air transport cars for business District heating Managers purposes 16 TOTAL CO2 EMISSIONS IN THE 2018-2019 REPORTING YEAR ACTIVITIES DISTANCE ENERGY CON­SUMP­TION/ CO₂ EMISSIONS % CO2 EMMISSIONS DISTRIBUTED BY SCOPE (km) PRODUCTION (kWh) (tCO₂) * Since 2018 the electricity and heat savings are 10%.

Current polices and strategies should be reassessed since the SDG Goals will be a driving force to opening-up new “business” opportunities to meet the growing sustainability demand of consumers and our planet. As a leading consultancy working with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, Danish Management (DEM’s sister company) assists private companies and public institutions in Denmark and abroad in translating the Sustainable Development Goals into new business opportunities. Last year we e.g. assisted The European Commission in measuring SDG impact from the Energy Facility II program. More and more companies and organizations are asking for our assistance to implement the SDGs in business strategies and ESG reporting to be able to document their sustainability efforts. Our services within DEM and DM provide tools for unlocking a vast number of innovation and market opportunities, helping organizations to: identify current and future business risks & opportunities; make contributions toward global sustainability tangible for employees and stakeholders; measure sustainable impact easily over time; maintain visibility for sustainability internally and in the wider community, and; generate key performance metrics that can complement official data and statistics. DEBATE EXAMPLE: = WE MAKE GLOBAL GOALS OUR GOALS FACT: 29% OF YOUNG DANES ARE SMOKING Should we just accept that so many young people are smoking – or should we as a society take initiatives to do something about it? This is one of many questions that this project is asking the Danes. Our results are handed over to the Danish Government 2030 panel. As the first population in the world, the Danes are consulted when the Global Goals are to be written into a Danish context.

To assure that all systems are designed, installed, of the implemented energy saving installations. Performance tests are essential tested and operated according to the planned energy savings, DEM has applied for ensuring that intended energy optimizations are effectuated. For this reason, a commissioning process throughout all phases of the renovation. As a result, DEM has applied the quality control principles from commissioning – a tool that energy consumption has been reduced with at least 15%. ensures the optimum functionality of complex technical installations – during all three phases of the project, i.e. design, execution and operation.
