Sustainable development Soaring urbanisation, economic growth and public & private investment in infrastructure create a growing demand for transport notably in emerging Today more than 90% of the world population lives in areas where air countries. Mature markets, on the other hand, are mainly supported by pollution exceeds the threshold recommended by the World Health projects aiming at updating and modernising existing infrastructure and Organisation (4) while CO2 emissions from transport continue to grow. rolling stock enhanced by growing environmental concerns. From an international standpoint, transport is now clearly recognised overall as a sector which contributes significantly to worldwide emissions Urbanisation whilst offering a great potential to curb them. The increased visibility of climate change consequences and the threat that air pollution poses on The combination of both economic and demographic growth entices a public health drives the actions of governments and regulation bodies to growing number of people to live in cities. By 2050, world population limit the magnitude of impacts by reducing greenhouse gas and airborne should exceed 9.7 billion inhabitants (1) of which nearly 70% will reside emissions. For instance: in urban areas (2). This trend towards urbanisation is particularly strong yy The European Green Deal, unveiled in December 2019, requires action in China, India and in many countries of Africa and Latin America. by all sectors of our economy to reach climate neutrality in 2050. This development triggers the growing saturation of airports, roads and Transportation, which represents approximately 25% of greenhouse existing railways and the need for new infrastructure. In this situation, gas emissions from energy combustion, is expected to decrease by railways typically offer a mass transit solution, safe, reliable and clean. 90% its emissions by 2050 to reach this target. Additionally, in many cities, the population is encouraged to leave behind yy Lead pioneer countries and cities announced or strongly consider individual methods of transportation and favour collective transportation future bans on cars running on combustion engines (Norway, France, to limit traffic congestion. This change is usually supported by the active United Kingdom, Netherlands, India…). promotion of public transportation. Rail transportation offers higher performance levels than other People responsible for urban planning and development are looking for transportation modes, which should have a positive impact on the efficient, green, inclusive and intermodal urban transportation systems (3). evolution of the rail transportation market. Indeed, rail represents 8% of worldwide motorised transports but only 2% of the energy consumption In this context also, rail transportation offers ideal mobility solutions in and 4% of CO2 emissions (source: The UIC-IEA, Railway Handbook term of capacity, punctuality, security, and reduction of noise, pollution 2017 Energy consumption and CO2 emissions).

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the information concerning the Group presented in the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the annual general meeting of shareholders of Alstom SA OPINION In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Alstom SA for the year ended 31 March 2020. These financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 11 May 2020 based on information available at that date in the evolving context of the Covid-19 crisis and the complexity to assess its impacts and outlook. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 March 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. BASIS FOR OPINION Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 April 2019 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. EMPHASIS OF MATTER We draw attention to the note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements which sets out the effects of the first application of the standard IFRS 16 “Leases” and the interpretation IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments” and their implementation by your company. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS KEY AUDIT MATTERS In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements. UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM 107 Financial statements 3 Statutory Auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements REVENUE AND MARGIN RECOGNITION ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS (Note 2.5.6 Sales and costs generated by operating activities, Notes 1.1.2, 3, 18 and 32 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) Identified risks As at 31 March 2020, the Group’s revenue and earnings before interests and taxes (EBIT) (respectively 8 201 M€ and 545 M€) mainly derive from construction contracts and long-term service agreements (“the long-term contracts”). As described in Note 2.5.6 to the Group consolidated financial statements, revenue on long-term contracts is recognized according to IFRS 15 based on the cost to cost percentage of completion method in order to recognize the revenue from contracts for which revenue recognition is qualified as overtime. At each closing date, estimates and assumptions by management are required in order to assess: yy The revenue at completion, including contract variations (variation orders, claims and contract amendments); yy The revenue of the period recognized in accordance with the cost to cost method; yy The margin at completion on each contract, incorporating appropriate contingencies to cover identified risks (technical, commercial, etc.) related to the project execution. We consider the revenue and margin recognition on long-term contracts to be a Key Audit Matter, because of the degree of required management’s estimates and judgements and the complexity of internal processes to be implemented in order to recognize the revenue and margin relating to these contracts. Our response As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the Group’s internal processes and controls for management and monitoring of long-term contracts, identified the main controls set up by Alstom that are relevant to our audit, and then tested their operational effectiveness by sampling; We have assessed the compliance of the new revenue recognition accounting principles and methods with IFRS 15 as described in Note 2.5.6 to the financial statements. We also performed a critical review of the systems and controls implemented by the Group relating to the measurement of the revenue and costs at completion and of the stage of completion. We took into account the high level of integration of the various IT systems involved in revenue recognition by including IT specialists in our audit team and testing the design, implementation and effectiveness of automated system controls affecting revenue recognition. For a sample of contracts, selected based on their risk profile including their technical or commercial complexity and/or their financial impact, we also, notably in the Covid-19 crisis context: yy Examined the terms and conditions of the contracts, including contract amendments and variations; yy Obtained an understanding of the performance and stage of completion of the contract through discussion with the project and Group management; yy Appreciated for these contracts the analyses of the Group which enabled to conclude on the transfer of progressive control or at completion and, if necessary, the identification of the various performance obligations, variation orders and contract amendments; yy Corroborated the main assumptions of revenue and costs at completion with costs incurred to date; yy Examined externally available evidence, such as customer correspondence, physical progress or the performance of services provided for in the contract, and for the most significant turnkey contracts performed physical inspection of construction site ; yy Used our experience gained in previous years on these contracts or on similar contracts; and yy Assessed the consistency of the accounting information reflected in the financial statements with the project information obtained. We verified that Notes 1.1.2, 2.5.6, 3, 18 and 32 to Group consolidated financial statements contain the appropriate information. ASSESSMENT OF DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS (Note 22 Provisions and Note 33 Disputes and Note 1.1.2 Covid-19 Pandemic of the notes to the consolidated financial statements) Identified risks As described in Note 22 and Note 33 to Group consolidated financial statements, Alstom’s operations lead to the risk of litigation and contractual claims from third parties, moreover, the note 33 to the financial statements describes the on-going investigations and procedures performed by judicial authorities with respect to alleged illegal payments in certain countries. Alstom assesses the corresponding risk based on assumptions and estimates, to determine whether a provision is recorded or a risk disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. This assessment involves a high level of judgment by Alstom management. Due to the potential impact on the consolidated financial statements, the degree of management’s judgment and the uncertainty around the resolution of those procedures, we consider the assessment of disputes and investigations to be a Key Audit Matter. 108 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements Our response We performed a critical review of the provisions recorded and disclosures provided. Our procedures consisted, notably in the Covid-19 crisis context, in : yy Examining the procedures implemented by management to identify, assess and account for disputes and investigations; yy Inquiring with the in-house legal counsels and analyzing underlying documentation of procedures ongoing; yy Obtaining external legal positions if considered as relevant; yy Examining legal expenses accounts for any indication of legal matters not yet considered; yy Reading minutes of the meetings of the Boards of Directors and of the shareholders’ meetings of Alstom’s key entities; yy Assessing management’s judgment through understanding of precedent outcomes in similar cases and external legal positions; yy Assessing whether any events subsequent to the reporting date for the year ended March 31, 2019 have been taken into account to estimate provisions and in the information provided in the financial statements; yy Verifying that Notes 1.1.2 and 33 to Group consolidated financial statements contain the appropriate disclosures on the status of disputes and related uncertainties. VERIFICATION OF THE INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE GROUP PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group information given in the management report of the Board of Directors. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) is presented in the Group’s management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L.823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. This information should be reported on by an independent third party. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars, were appointed as statutory auditors of Alstom SA by the annual general meeting held on 23 June 2009. As at 31 March 2020, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars were in the 11th year of total uninterrupted engagement. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM 109 Financial statements 3 Statutory Auditor’s report on the consolidated financial statements As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. yy Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. yy Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. yy Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. yy Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. yy Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit Committee We submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

Provisions for risks and charges Investments are recorded at acquisition cost, excluding transaction costs. Provisions for litigations and disputes Investments are measured based on a multi-criteria approach: The Company identifies and analyses on a regular basis current litigations yy investments are generally measured at their value in use, defined as in which it is engaged. When provisions are deemed necessary, they are the enterprise value net of the indebtedness. The enterprise value is measured on the basis of its best estimate of the expenditure required the sum of the discounted Free Cash Flows and of the discounted to settle the obligation at the balance-sheet date. These estimates take terminal residual value, and represents the ability of the assets to into account information available and different possible outcomes. generate profits and cash flows; Due to changes in facts and circumstances, costs finally incurred may yy when values in relation with arm’s length transactions or any other differ from those estimates. fair market values exist, these values can also be taken into account in the year-end valuation of the investments. 2.4. Financial debt When this value is less than acquisition cost, a provision for impairment is recorded to cover the difference. Financial debt (bonds) is recorded at nominal value in the liabilities. Transaction costs and bonds premium are recorded as deferred charges or deferred income and amortised over the duration of the borrowings. 2.2. Share capital A share capital increase is recorded at the nominal share price. If the 2.5. Tax Group issue price is higher than the nominal value, this difference is recorded as a paid-in capital.

When a subsidiary member of the tax group exits from the said tax group, it is not compensated for the loss of its tax credits, tax losses carried forward and/or long term losses derived during the period of time it belonged to the tax group and which are unused at the exit date.

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the annual general meeting of shareholders of Alstom SA OPINION In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your general meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Alstom SA (“the Company”) for the year ended 31 March 2020. These financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 11 May 2020 based on information available at that date and in the evolving context of the Covid-19 crisis and the complexity to assess its impacts and outlook. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2020 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. BASIS FOR OPINION Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from 1 April 2019 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. JUSTIFICATION OF ASSESSMENTS KEY AUDIT MATTERS In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. 126 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the financial statements VALUATION OF THE INVESTMENT IN ALSTOM HOLDINGS (Note 2.1 Investments and Note 8 Financial assets) Identified risks As at 31 March 2020, the net value of the investment in Alstom Holdings amounts to 9 216 m€ and represents 91% of Alstom’s total assets. Alstom Holdings owns directly or indirectly all the entities of the Alstom group. As described in Note 2.1 to the financial statements, investments are recorded at their acquisition cost. The recoverable value of the investments is assessed based on a multi-criteria approach. Alstom records an impairment if the recoverable value of the investments is lower than their carrying value. Determining the recoverable value is based on (i) Discounted Cash Flows, and (ii) values in relation with current or contemplated transactions or any other fair market values, if available. This impairment test relies on significant management estimates, such as the group’s business plans and terminal growth rate. Accordingly, we consider the measurement of the recoverable value of the investment in Alstom Holdings to be a key audit matter, due to the amount of the investment recorded in the balance-sheet and the inherent uncertainty of certain inputs, in particular the likelihood of achieving forecast results included in such measurement. Our response We performed a critical review of the methodology applied by management to perform the impairment test. Our procedures mainly consisted, notably in the Covid-19 crisis context, in: yy Understanding process and controls implemented by Alstom SA; yy Assessing the consistency of the assumptions used for the impairment test (projected future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates) with the historical and current performance, the existing backlog of contracts and the economic environment in which Alstom SA operates; yy Assessing the reasonableness of the assumptions used to determine values in relation with current or considered transactions or any other fair market values, if any; yy Reviewing sensitivity analyses to key assumptions. SPECIFIC VERIFICATIONS We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents provided to Shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. We attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to the payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce). Report on Corporate Governance We attest that the Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L. 225-37-3 and L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L.225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. STATUTORY AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: yy Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. yy Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. yy Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements. yy Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. yy Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. 128 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM Financial statements Statutory Auditor’s report on the financial statements Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM 133 Risk factors, Internal Control and risk management 4 Operational and strategic risks Due to its multiple facilities throughout the world, its diverse activities and product ranges, and its development, the Alstom group is exposed to various risk categories, the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on its activities, financial situation, results or prospects. This chapter presents the principal risks the Group considers it is exposed to as of the date of this Universal Registration Document. Risk assessment and management are embedded in the Group’s operational and strategic objectives. Alstom regularly reviews the risks it faces within the framework of risk management and controls as described below in the section entitled “Risk control environment”. In the framework of the provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council, within each of the risk categories referred to below, the risk factors Alstom considers to be the most significant as of the date of this Universal Registration Document are presented first (and identified by an asterisk), based on an assessment that takes their impact level and probability of occurrence into account as well as actions and measures designed to manage and mitigate risks implemented by the Company. For a description of the Company’s risk management policy, see the “Risk management and internal control” section of this Universal Registration Document. It is possible that certain risks that have not been mentioned or identified as of the date hereof may potentially affect the Group’s activities, results, objectives, image or share price. Alstom’s assessment of the significance of these risks can change at any time, in particular should new internal or external facts or circumstances materialise. ●●OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT(*) Trends in the markets in which Alstom conducts its business depend for transport infrastructure projects. The availability of financing for large on a set of complex and interdependent factors that are outside of the transportation infrastructure projects and the costs of such financing Group’s control, such as economic growth, political stability, and credit also impact the level of public orders. In particular, such financing may supply.

Long-term variable compensation The characteristics of the performance share award policy applied to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for the 2020/21 fiscal year are as follows: Performance conditions All performance shares are subject to performance conditions which are internal and/or relative. In the event of a major change in the Group’s strategy or structure, the Board of Directors commits to adapting these performance conditions to the new challenges highlighted for the coming years, both as regards the nature of the conditions and results to be achieved, all continuing to be highly demanding and transparent about those changes. Vesting and performance Satisfaction of the performance conditions is assessed at the end of the third fiscal year following the grant date. period The Board of Directors will not assess whether the performance conditions have been achieved or deliver the shares under a given plan prior to the end of such third fiscal year. Limits applicable to the At its meeting held on 11 May 2020, the Board of Directors defined the following principles regarding grants to grant executive corporate officers: yy The IFRS 2 value (which is used to establish the Group’s consolidated financial statements) of any annual grant shall not exceed one year of annual fixed gross compensation and target short-term variable compensation, which corresponds to the compensation obtained when achievement are strictly aligned with the set objectives. Thus, performance share compensation is capped at 100% of maximum short-term compensation (fixed and on-target variable), i.e. 200% of fixed short-term compensation. yy The aggregate amount of annual grants to corporate officers cannot exceed 2.5% of the overall amount authorised by the Shareholders’ Meeting for grants of performance shares within the Group, nor 10% of the total grants under the relevant plan. Holding requirement Since 2007, for each grant, the Board of Directors has set the number of shares corporate officers must hold until the end of their terms of office. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is thus required to hold in registered form 50% of the performance shares that have vested during the entire term of his appointment (as renewed, as the case may be). This holding requirement ceases to apply when the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer reaches a shareholding target of shares held in registered form corresponding in value to three years of his last annual fixed gross compensation. For the purpose of calculating the cap on the holding obligation, the following is taken into account: yy the annual fixed gross compensation applicable on the date of the most recent acquisition of performance shares; and yy the respective market price of the shares at the time of each acquisition of performance shares held in registered form by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The holding requirement was satisfied on 31 March 2020, as Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge held a number of registered shares on that date representing a value of more than three years of his last annual fixed gross compensation. Prohibition on hedging The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer formally undertakes not to use hedging instruments in respect of the instruments performance shares granted by the Company during the entire duration of his term of office. To the Company’s knowledge, no hedging instrument has been put in place. Blackout periods No transaction involving the Company’s securities may be carried out during the 30-calendar days preceding the publication of the Company’s half-year and annual results (which period is reduced to the 15-calendar days for quarterly results) and up until the second trading day following this publication. During periods where trading is authorized, the Group’s internal rules of good conduct create an obligation to consult the Compliance Officer, in the event of any doubt prior to conducting a transaction.

However, as Alstom is the only pure player among its direct competitors (business focused solely on the rail industry), the Board considered that it would be against the Company’s interests to publicly state the Company’s objectives and performance as regards margin on orders received, as this would give competitors strategic information.

The maximum performance level is reached if the Company is among the 5% of companies in the comparable group which achieve the best performance, which was the case for the third consecutive year in 2019 (96th percentile). yy With respect to objectives tied to specific action plans, based on four performance criteria (measurable whenever possible), it was appropriate to assess the achievement level at 41.96%.

UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM 187 Corporate governance 5 Report of the Board of Directors on corporate governance Achievement level Comments Target for the fiscal year INDIVIDUAL OBJECTIVES 40% Launch of Alstom’s new The goal set by the Board of Directors was to define the new strategic positioning of 12% 15% strategy the Group, including the launch of a specific plan for the Signalling activity, ensuring its acceptance by both internal and external stakeholders, and implementing its first steps. Acknowledging the successful launch of the Alstom in Motion plan and its good reception by financial markets, the relaunch of the Signalling activity and its outstanding growth results, the continuation of the digital transformation program and the review of the strategic external growth options of the Group and the decision to initiate the acquisition of Bombardier Transportation, the Board of Directors established that this objective was deemed achieved at its maximum level, at 125% Teams and organisation The goal set by the Board of Directors was to partially renew and stabilize the 12% 10.8% Executive Committee of the Group, to define a succession plan for its members and ensure the creation and development of a talent pool aiming at preparing the succession of the senior management. The Board of Directors has considered, following the several appointments taking place among the Group Executive Committee (five new members during FY 19/20), that the issue of its renewal and stabilization was under control and did not present any short-term risk. The Group capabilities in terms of internal succession for the executive team still having to be reinforced, the Board of Directors established that this objective was deemed achieved at 90%. Sales performance The goal set by the Board of Directors aimed at maintaining the positive commercial 8% 8.8% trend of the Group in spite of a reduced number of opportunities, securing several major projects (notably in Argentina, the United Kingdom, Germany, Greece or Colombia) and the order intake for the Signalling activity (with at least one major project). Considering the FY 2019/20 order intake (above €9.9 billions), despite the cancellation or non-award of some of the initially targeted projects (balanced by some other commercial successes), and notably the remarkable commercial performance of the Signalling activity, the Board of Directors established that this objective was deemed achieved at 110%. Operational and financial The operational and financial performance goals set by the Board for the Chairman 8% 7.36% performance and Chief Executive Officer are based on nine operational performance indicators, the stabilisation of the Working Capital, the development of the most critical projects (PRASA, Ryadh, e-loco, Amtrack, Dubai, ICNG, Pop) and the delivery of key Signalling projects (Lille, Singapore, Hong-Kong). The Board of Directors, having considered that the operational performance indicators have reached a satisfying level, that the execution of the key projects has improved in a significant manner and that the stakes relating to the improvement of the gross margin and working capital are under control (control of costs remaining an area to be improved), established that this objective was deemed achieved at 92%. 2019/20 OVERALL ANNUAL PERFORMANCE 41.96% Therefore, at its meeting held on 11 May 2020, the Board decided that Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2019/20 would amount to €906,015 corresponding to an achievement level of 109.8% of his objectives. 188 UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019/20 — ALSTOM Corporate governance Report of the Board of Directors on corporate governance Over the past three years Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s annual fixed and variable compensation has changed as follows: Awarded with Awarded with Awarded with respect of fiscal year respect of fiscal year respect of fiscal 2017/18 2018/19 year 2019/20 (in €) (in €) (in €) Annual fixed gross compensation 750,000 750,000 825,000 Annual variable gross compensation(*) 1,072,500 1,020,975 906,015 (%/ fixed) (143%) (136.1%) (109.8%) TOTAL 1,822,500 1,770,975 1,731,015 (*) Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s variable compensation is paid during the fiscal year following the one in respect of which it is awarded.

However, it is not our responsibility to comment on: yy The entity’s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions, in particular the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax evasion legislation; yy The compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations. Nature and scope of our work The work described below was performed in accordance with the provisions of articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code determining the conditions in which the independent third party performs its engagement and with the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (“CNCC”) applicable to such engagements , as well as with ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information.

We believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Means and resources Our work was carried out by a team of 6 people between October 2019 and April 2020 and took a total of 8 weeks. We were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted one hundred interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement representing Sustainability and CSR, Marketing, Compliance, Quality, Human resources, Health and safety, Environment and Purchasing departments. Conclusion Based on our work, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial information statement is not in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.
