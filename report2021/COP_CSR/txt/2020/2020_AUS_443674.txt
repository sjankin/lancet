H.E. António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations NEW YORK NY 10017 USA 16 October 2020 Dear Secretary-General, Orora Limited United Nations Global Compact Communications on Progress 2020 Orora’s approach to sustainability is founded on the Orora Way and its values of Teamwork, Passion, Respect and Integrity. Based on these values, sustainability is managed through three focus areas – People, Planet and Prosperity – by delivering shared benefits for our communities, our environment and our customers, as well as our operations. Guided by the Orora Values, Orora reaffirms its commitment to the ten UNGC principles on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of Orora, I am pleased to present below the highlights of Orora’s third Communications on Process (COP). After Orora successfully met its 5-year EcoTargets in 2019 a new set of Eco Targets were launched in 2020, all to be achieved by 2024, reducing: o Greenhouse gas emissions by 5% per tonne of production/floor space square meters; o Waste to Landfill by 5% % per tonne of production/floor space square meters; o Water use by 5% % per tonne of production/floor space square meters. Orora made significant company and employee contributions to bushfire relief following the devastating fires in Australia in late 2019 and early 2020. Orora proudly increased its use of recycled glass in its Beverage business. Orora invested heavily in enhanced health and safety initiatives to keep employees safe during the covid-19 crisis. This year Orora is again presenting its COP as an index, demonstrating actions and outcomes as communicated in Orora’s 2020 Annual Report and Orora’s Corporate Governance Statement. Orora continues to advocate for the principles of the UNGC in its business, policy and community interactions. I am proud to lead a company that is part of such an important global initiative.
