GRI CONTENT INDEX 76 CONTENT OF THE NON-FINANCIAL 81 GROUP REPORT LEGAL NOTICE & CONTACT 82 Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 4 FOREWORD GRI 102-14 DEAR READERS, Never before has the subject of sustainability been so widely discussed in the business world and in the media as it was in 2019. Of course, this development also heavily influences businesses. And can be keenly felt in very different ways, not only by our customers, investors and partners, but also our employees and applicants. While customers are requesting to be kept more informed about sustainable measures in their calls to tender, employees are also actively asking about our role in society. It is clear from their questions that they are now much more aware of the connection between economic, ecological and social factors than just a few years ago. Enterprises no longer solely bear responsibility for their employees, but also for society and this recognition and the measures derived from it are laid down in this Sustainability Report. Even though sustainability is firmly established at Bechtle, the subject is in constant flux and we have realised that we need to expand existing processes, address new aspects and determine further key figures. As a listed company for 20 years, we are used to confirming transparency with figures. Sustainability brings many benefits for both our stakeholders and for us because it forces us to deal with the developments objectively and on a valid basis. In particular, it shows the companies are well-advised to align themselves with reporting standards as they provide meaningful structure, enable comparability and address developments. For this reason, the obvious step was to adapt the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) principles for our reporting, which are regarded internationally as the highest standards for structured and comparable sustainability reporting and are used for the first time in our 2019 Sustainability Report. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 5 With this report, we invite you to discover more about Bechtle’s extensive sustainability measures and to see to what extent we have pursued and achieved the goals set in previous years and how they are now being superseded with new, more ambitious ones, such as revenues of 5 billion euros, which we hit in 2019 and had been a goal since our Vision 2020 was announced 12 years ago. In doing so, we also fulfilled one of our promises for a successful future based on sustainable growth. But that’s not all. Our goal has been updated with our new blueprint for the future: the Bechtle Vision 2030 has laid the foundations for the fourth Vision in Bechtle’s 37-year history. It’s our new guiding star that shows us the way to the future with long-term, measurable objectives. The Bechtle Sustainability Report also follows this principle of setting and achieving targets and then raising the bar. And just as visions demonstrate the courage to openly communicate long-term goals; clarity, transparency and candour in setting targets contribute to achieving great things, which conveys the relevance of sustainability for Bechtle. Our strategy for the entire group in general, but particularly for its individual segments is the most important tool we have to achieve our goals. It is the focus of our annual Bechtle strategy conference held at the beginning of the year and attended by around 1,500 colleagues, whose content is available to all employees on the intranet in the form of videos. Communicating the strategy is essential for achieving our economic, ecological and social sustainability targets. In addition, we have also reviewed our Sustainability Code, made adjustments and published it in this report. Alongside the UN Global Compact Principles, this Sustainability Code is an essential guideline for the whole Bechtle Group, which illustrates our understanding that the topic transcends all areas that can only be approached jointly with each individual department and location. Only in this way can we make a significant contribution to the global challenges of the day – particularly climate change and digitalisation – and our company objectives by reviewing supply chains and promoting diversity. It’s clear that this is a task which we all need to play a role in. We aspire to make a valuable contribution. The following pages illustrate our activities and objectives and we welcome the opportunity to discuss these with you, because we can learn from each other.

Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 9 RESPONSIBILITY AT BECHTLE. GRI 102-16 Our group strategy is geared towards corporate responsibility and financial security, both of which are important pillars on which sustainable corporate development can be built. At the same time, our Vision 2030, which was published in December 2018, has become our guiding star, showing us the way in a time characterised by speed, uncertainty, complexity and change. The Vision doesn’t just give us direction and provide orientation beyond our daily business, but also gives customers and vendor partners the security that they have a partner they can rely on in the long-term. Furthermore, the Vision provides the capital market with a clearly defined and quantified look into the future of Bechtle. BECHTLE VISION 2030.

Integrity, determination, reliability and inspiration have been the corporate values that shape how Bechtle acts for many years. They define our corporate culture and are reflected in our corporate guidelines. The Bechtle Code of Conduct also forms part of the foundations for how our daily business is conducted. We comply with legal regulations and respect the established customs of the countries in which we do business. Integrity is part of our self-image. That means we’re opposed to all forms of corruption. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 10 C orporate G overnance BECHTLE’S SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY. GRI 102-16 For a business to develop successfully, it must take into account the expectations of various stakeholders. However, these demands are not static, but can change over time, resulting in a dynamic blend of interests that requires constant compromise and continuous evaluation to ensure a fair balSee Stakeholder engagement. ance. Incorporating the concept of sustainability within this context means that competing objectives must be carefully weighed, and different company divisions included in the decision-making process. It compels businesses not only to treat partners and employees with respect, but also to pursue profitable growth, secure a competent future workforce, maintain a transparent supply chain, and set an example. Structured approach. At Bechtle, we take a pragmatic, structured approach to sustainability. That’s why we created an interdisciplinary working group to address the topic of ecological, economic and social sustainability. Sustainable business is a cornerstone of our corporate philosophy. The first step was to investigate the current situation: what environmental protection efforts are already in place? Who already supports social projects, and how? Who is already involved in their community? What does Bechtle currently do to promote a healthy work-life balance? How do we evaluate our supply chain? Based on the results, the working group determined the material topics and objectives, resulting in 2014 with the Bechtle Sustainability Code agreed with the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and then the first Bechtle Sustainability Report in 2015, laying the foundations for sustainability management and reporting at the group. Responsibility and credibility count. It’s important for us that our reports are honest and transparent as we would like to be viewed as a credible and responsible European group. Although sustainability should be a matter of course for responsible enterprises, our goal is to make both our employees and various stakeholders aware of aspects including, for example, economic sustainability being one of the fundamental objectives of business activities. This is how sustainably successful companies are able to support their customers and offer them future-oriented solutions. They refrain from excessive profit withdrawals and pay their employees a decent salary. They don’t shirk their responsibilities or base their decisions solely on quarterly results. They treat their business partners fairly and their employees with respect. They live out their core values and develop long-term, clear visions. All principles that Bechtle follows. Reliable compass for sustainable management. Since we began systematically working with the topic of sustainability, our highest priorities have always been to remain authentic and credible. Our goal has always been to embrace sustainability in all its facets, and, wherever possible, to make it quantifiable and traceable. The Bechtle Sustainability Code is a reliable compass for a responsible, future-oriented corporate governance, which must be transformed into a sustainable corporate strategy in the future, based on reporting which has been continuously developed over the previous years. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 11 Bechtle Sustainability GRI 102-16 In its current form, the Sustainability Code. Code is part of the Sustainability Report (2019) and therefore accessible for everyone. Sustainable corporate management. Sustainable corporate management means taking responsibility for the economic, eco­­logical and social implications of our business decisions. Corporate goals. Bechtle is a company that strives for sustainable, profitable growth. Only companies that make a profit and continue to grow have a future. And only companies that have a future can fulfil the expectations of stakeholders – particularly when it comes to creating and securing attractive jobs. Binding principles of conduct. All of our employees are bound to certain standards of conduct, which are outlined in the Bechtle Corporate Philosophy, Bechtle Code of Conduct, Bechtle Leadership Principles, and Bechtle Guidelines for Social Media. Valuable transparency and open communication. Identifying and reporting on the social and environmental ramifications of our business dealings is important to us as a socially-responsible company. Wherever required, our decisions and the resulting actions should be transparent to the public wherever possible. Accountability and responsibility. Accountability at the highest level of management means regularly informing the appropriate stakeholders of all significant developments at Bechtle in a prompt, comprehensive manner. The most important publications in this context are Bechtle AG’s Annual Report and the Sustainability Report (including the Non-financial Group Report). These standards are regularly evaluated, along with the group’s business development, by the supervisory board. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 12 C orporate G overnance Sustainable employee development. Sustainable employee development is essential for ensuring our company’s long-term economic success. Training and education. Providing vocational training for the younger generation not only prepares a qualified workforce for the future, it is also a way for us to meet our social obligations. In addition, Bechtle maintains its competitive position through further development opportunities and high employee retention. Work-life balance. A healthy balance between one’s job and private life is the foundation for ensuring high motivation and sustainable performance. In today’s dynamically changing professional world it is important to recharge and make time for personal development. Management. Our leaders know the high significance of employee happiness and motivation and have a vested interest in retaining employees for the long term. They support them – in line with the Bechtle Leadership Principles – in realising common goals. Diversity and equal opportunities. We are in favour of equal opportunities and against discrimination of all employees and seize upon diversity and equal opportunities to enrich the group. Occupational health and safety. We believe that it is Bechtle’s duty to take a proactive approach to promoting and protecting the health of our employees and their ability to work. However, we also require that our employees demonstrate responsibility for their own health and safety. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 13 Sustainable commitment to human rights. Sustainable commitment to human rights means acknowledging and fulfilling our duty to protect human rights within our sphere of influence. International standards. Our definition of human rights is based on globally accepted standards, in particular the United Nations’ International Bill of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization’s Core Labour Standards and the 10 UN Global Compact principles. This commitment is reflected in our corporate values, as well as the guidelines contained in the Bechtle Corporate Philosophy, Bechtle Leadership Principles and Bechtle Code of Conduct. Promotion of and compliance with human rights are basic components of daily interactions at Bechtle. Bechtle condemns any form of forced, compulsory or child labour in the strongest terms. Discriminationand harassment-free workplace. Discrimination of any kind, at any level and in any division is strictly prohibited by our Bechtle Code of Conduct. We maintain an atmosphere of respectful cooperation that excludes all types of discrimination, bullying, and personal harassment. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 14 C orporate G overnance Sustainable, principled business practices. Sustainable, principled business practices such as honesty, fairness and reliability underscore Bechtle’s integrity, and govern our conduct within the company and towards our external partners. Code of Conduct. Bechtle denounces corrupt business practices of any kind – without exception. Giving, authorising and accepting gifts and donations is subject to clear rules in order to guarantee the strict separation of business relationships and private interests. All employees, regardless of position, are bound by these rules, which are laid out in the Bechtle Code of Conduct. Competition. Even in the daily battle for market share, Bechtle adheres firmly to the principle of integrity. Although it may be difficult when standing in direct competition to another provider, we place a premium on treating our competitors and partners fairly. Furthermore, we comply with all applicable competition acts and anti-trust laws. Arrangements that unlawfully restrict free and open competition or that affect prices or conditions are prohibited at Bechtle. Corporate culture. A strong, entrepreneurial attitude defines our corporate culture and permeates all corners of the company. The four defining values of our corporate culture are integrity, determination, reliability and inspiration. They are reflected in our corporate culture – the definitive guide to how our daily business should be conducted. We’re honest, fair and trustworthy, inside and out of the company. The open, dependable, just, and straightforward nature of our corporate culture sets us apart. We treat each other with respect and tolerance, have open, trusting communication, and view sharing of knowledge as a given. Intellectual property and data protection. Bechtle complies with all regulations regarding intellectual property, data protection and data security. Moreover, we handle not only our own assets but also those of our business partners in a lawful and responsible manner. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 15 Sustainable customer relationships. Sustainable customer relationships are only possible if we place our customers’ needs and satisfaction at the heart of all we do. Customer focus. “We empower business”. This statement is one of the key components of the ­Bechtle Vision 2030. Since our founding, we have always put customers first. We pride ourselves on maintaining close ties with our customers who benefit from our focus on quality, future-oriented solutions and responsible management. We also know that happy customers are the foundation for our success. Not only do we want to recognise their requirements and expectations early on, we want to intensify our working relationship with them. This is what makes us a future-proof IT partner for our customers. With our innovative products and solutions we have created added value for businesses and public-sector customers. Our focus is on establishing clear processes and ensuring ultimate reliability – internally, but also throughout the entire value creation chain. We are continually checking our services and processes. Externally too, together with our partners, we progressively work on optimising our offering. We are always considering the benefit for customers. We choose our partners very carefully, because partnership together with solution-oriented collaboration for the benefit of our customers has the highest priority for us. A conscious and sensitive approach to data protection and information security is especially important to us. All of our employees are obliged to maintain confidentiality. We meet all required measurements to protect customer, partner, and employee data. The opportunities of complaints management. Our quality management includes the qualified management of complaints and queries. Proactive complaints management provides important insight into our strengths and weaknesses. This information allows us to continually improve our service quality and, consequently, customer satisfaction. Out-of-line management. Even the most sophisticated and optimised processes are not immune to occasional errors and evolving requirements. Bechtle’s out-of-line management coordinates with customers and all in-house and external contacts to reach fast, flexible and holistic solutions that meet customer needs. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 16 C orporate G overnance Sustainable environmental awareness. Sustainable environmental awareness is the first step towards fulfilling our obligations not only to this generation, but also to the next. Business and the environment. Ecology and economics are inextricably linked, as demonstrated by the direct and indirect impact of business activity on the environment. This may result in costs that, in some cases, are borne not by the responsible entity, but by the entire community. Bechtle AG environmental management system. Bechtle educates its employees about the ecological and economic consequences of resource consumption. By implementing an ISO 14001-certified environmental management system, the Bechtle Group’s central subsidiary, Bechtle AG, has laid the groundwork for a structured approach to environmental management. We measure our environmental performance with the goal of limiting our resource consumption, emissions and any other negative environmental consequences. Preservation of natural resources. Bechtle handles natural resources consciously, using them sparingly – especially when it comes to using lights, heating, and air-conditioning. We expect all of our employees to do their part while at the workplace. We sort and recycle reusable materials in order to protect our planet’s resources. Our publications boast climate-neutral printing, and Bechtle also uses only FSC-certified paper from responsibly-managed forests and sustainable colours. Reducing carbon emissions. We promote vehicles with low CO2 emissions, e-mobility, and alter­ native means of transportation, such as company bikes. Our employees are also encouraged to use modern technology to streamline their business travel, taking only those trips that are necessary. Webbased training, for instance, is common at Bechtle. Likewise, video conferencing is also routinely used not only for collaborating with colleagues but also increasingly with customers. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 17 Sustainable solutions. A sustainable solutions portfolio is guided by the principle that information and communications technology should be environmentally friendly and resource-efficient throughout its entire lifecycle – from the initial planning stages to operation and end-of-life recycling. Sustainable product portfolio. When choosing products for our portfolio, we look for compliance with human rights, availability, high quality at affordable prices, innovation, security, environmentally friendly operation and “green” packaging. We offer our customers IT solutions over the course of the entire life cycle – from the system’s design and operation to its end-of-life recycling. Ecological IT hardware procurement. As an IT company, we are fully aware of our duty to lead by example. Green IT is the best approach to introducing the notion of sustainability into our customers’ projects. Consequently, we also pay attention to energy efficiency also when procuring equipment for our own in-house use. When we consolidated our data centre and moved it to a particularly secure and energy efficient data centre with e-Shelter in 2019, we put our high standards into action. Moreover, sustainable information technology is an essential component of our portfolio. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 18 C orporate G overnance Sustainable social responsibility. Sustainable social responsibility is an integral part of our business paradigm. Commitment. As a multinational company, we engage with other regional stakeholders on a wide range of topics, both as an employer and customer. We thus have the obligation and opportunity to help shape the society around us. Our goal is to create value for all of our stakeholders and contribute to the economic competitiveness of each local area. Our social commitments revolve primarily around supporting non-profit groups, and donating to select organisations. Social commitment. For Bechtle, social commitment is our chance to influence the development of society in accordance with our rules and values. Globalisation links companies, organisations, people, products and services, thus changing the requirements placed on us and influencing how we do business. Long-term success is only possible if we create value for all of our stakeholders. Our social involvement, driven by high standards, is therefore part and parcel of our business activities. And we set our quality standards bar high. Prioritising. Bechtle’s social commitment focuses on supporting science and education, as well as carefully chosen charitable projects. By sponsoring educational, cultural and sports initiatives, we selectively promote the sustainable development of these areas within our various communities. We also regularly support organisations to which the company’s founders have a strong connection. Donation and sponsorship guidelines. Bechtle strives to contribute to society in a meaningful, concrete way and to continuously expand our commitment. In doing so, we focus our efforts on specific areas according to specific criteria. Through clearly defined structures and responsibilities, we also ensure the highest degree of transparency possible when providing resources. To this end, guidelines are being developed in 2020 to outline clear award criteria and guarantee that all legal regulations and ethical standards are met. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 19 THE FUTURE. In 2020 the Sustainability Code will be put to the test. A sustainability strategy with measurable goals will replace the Sustainability Code in the mid-term. Moreover, it will strategically identify sustainabledevelopment.un.org and link the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the goals of the ­Bechtle Group. An overview of the United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 20 C orporate G overnance SUSTAINABILITY REQUIRES COMMITMENT. GRI 102-12 UN Global Compact. In addition to the Sustainability Code, which is aimed within Bechtle, we have directed our gaze outwards by signing the UN Global Compact on 13 September 2018. The UN Global Compact is a United Nations strategic initiative for companies that orients business unglobalcompact.org activity around ten principles. 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; 2. Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. Business should advocate the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; 5. Business should advocate the effective abolition of child labour; 6. Business should advocate the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; 9. Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 10. Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The progress made on the principles defined in the Global Compact (Communication on Progress) can be found in the Bechtle AG Sustainability Report. WIN Charta. Bechtle is also a signatory of the WIN Charta, a volunteer-based sustainability win-bw.com ­management system that aims to raise awareness of and encourage action on sustainability issues in companies in all industries across the state of Baden-Württemberg. By signing the WIN Charta, companies acknowledge their economic, environmental, and social responsibility. Bechtle documents this progress in their own WIN report. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 21 ESSENTIAL NON-FINANCIAL RISKS. GRI 102-11, GRI 102-15 For all topics identified as essential in the five topics identified in section 289 c Para. 2 HGB, Bechtle Sustainability Management performed a CSR risk assessment in accordance with section 289c Para 3 HGB. This investigated whether our business activities or relationships, products, and services directly or indirectly cause substantial CSR risks. In our investigation we considered the likelihood of the risk as well as the extent of the damage. No reportable CSR risks were identified. The classification was conducted during the preparation of the group-wide Sustainability Report in January 2020. MATERIAL TOPICS. GRI 102-42, GRI 102-46 The sustainability working group, created in 2013, performed the preliminary work for the first Bechtle Sustainability Report. In 2015, a detailed analysis identified the following stakeholder groups as key See Stakeholder engagement for Bechtle: owners/shareholders, employees, customers, suppliers/partners. Subsequently, members of all stakeholder groups were questioned about their interests and needs in individual interviews. The questions were oriented around the 25 most important sustainability factors that were previously determined as the foundation of the GRI G4 Reporting Guidelines and the EU Non-financial Reporting Directive. The subsequent evaluation and weighting of sustainability topics was undertaken with a scoring model. The insights gained served as the starting point for determining the materiality of the first Bechtle AG Non-financial Group Report, 2017. An interdisciplinary team made up of members of the Sustainability See Bechtle Sustainability Report 2017 Committee and representatives of other relevant departments led a series of workshops, carrying out detailed material analyses to determine the significance of sustainable topics for Bechtle’s business activities. Additionally, the effects of business activities on the reportable aspects in accordance with Section 315b, paragraph 2, HGB (environmental concerns, social concerns, employee concerns, issues related to human rights protection and anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures) were also taken into account. The team presented, discussed and validated the results together with the Executive Board. GRI 102-46, GRI 102-48, GRI 102-49 In the 2019 reporting year, we verified the Materiality Matrix by taking a new look at the topics. The expectations of stakeholders and the influence of the company were taken more into consideration. The reason for reconsidering the matrix axes was due to using the GRI Standards framework in this report – a first for Bechtle. The aim was to combine the materiality requirements of GRI 101 and CSRRUG. We brought the foundation topics from the previous year’s report to the forefront, conducted a document analysis (such as public sector tenders, customer requirements, or supplier surveys), and gathered further information from ICT sector databases. On this basis, the expanded 2019 Sustainability Committee conducted a workshop on materiality analysis. The departments of Quality Management, Human Resources, People Development and Academy, Legal and Compliance, Logistics Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 22 C orporate G overnance ­Management, Environmental Management, Facility Management, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, the Public Sector business unit, Bechtle’s ARTICONA brand and the CIO organisation of the Bechtle Group were all represented. Following the workshop, we consolidated the individual interviews together with those responsible for the material topics and evaluated management approaches. The results were then presented to the CEO and discussed before being validated by him. The analysis of the material topics helps us to prioritise and mirror our activities and identify optimisation potential. In the following matrix, you will find the materially defined topics in the right upper segment. BECHTLE MATERIALITY MATRIX.

The reporting carried out within the framework of the Annual and Sustainability Reports form the foundation of our stakeholder communication. In these reports, we describe our economic, social and ecological performance and impact based on qualitative and quantitative performance indicators while also providing an insight into the Bechtle Group’s processes and structures. We have always viewed Bechtle’s success as stemming from our close and trusting collaboration with our stakeholders. This fundamental philosophy is firmly rooted in Bechtle’s history: the company’s founders remained in the driving seat for twenty-five years, and their traditional values became engrained in our identity, which is characterised by integrity, determination, reliability and inspiration. OUR STAKEHOLDERS. GRI 102-42, GRI 102-43 Within the framework of preparations for the first Sustainability Report in 2015, we used a materiality See Material Topics section analysis to identify the most important stakeholder groups and topics. For this year’s report, materifor more details ality validation processing determined that the general public now also represents an important stakeholder group for Bechtle. GRI 102-40 Important stakeholders for Bechtle are: � Owners/shareholders � Employees � Customers � Suppliers/partners � General public Each stakeholder group has its own interests, expectations of the company, and objectives that could also be contradictory. It is therefore crucial for a company to balance these between the stakeholders, but also with its own interests and objectives to identify potential effects on business activities. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 25 GRI 102-44 The following table presents an overview of the most important sustainability topics for our stakeholders: Stakeholder groups Expectations of Bechtle/material topics Shareholders/owners* � Profitable growth � Customer satisfaction � Expertise in new technologies Customers* � Information security and data protection/confidentiality � Customer satisfaction/maintaining sustainable customer relationships � Vocational and further training Employees* � Climate and environmental protection** � Occupational health and safety** � Diversity and equal opportunities** � Corporate culture and values** Suppliers/partners* � Information security and data protection/confidentiality � Fair competition � Profitable growth General public*** � Social responsibility/commitment in the region � Transparent reporting � Climate and environmental protection *The prioritisation of sustainability aspects is based on the results of the 2015 stakeholder survey and the scoring model used (See Material Topics section for more details) Cf. scoring models: Kühnapfel, J.

STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE. GRI 102-43 How we involve and communicate with our stakeholders is described below according to group. OWNERS/SHAREHOLDERS. The Annual General Meeting is the largest event during which we communicate with our Bechtle shareholders. In 2019, 660 shareholders and 200 visitors attended. We also invite our private shareholders to a biannual event at the company headquarters in Neckarsulm. Every year, over 100 take up the invitation, gaining an insight into the company through a presentation, guided tour and personal talks. The Investor Relations (IR) department are also in regular contact via phone and e-mail. Currently, 14 banks currently report on Bechtle in detailed studies and brief analyses. Bechtle has regular, constructive contact with all 14, strengthened by analyst visits to the company headquarters, various conferences and roadshows. The IR department is in continual communication with institutional investors and 2019 saw numerous contacts with existing and potential investors. In 2019, a total of eleven roadshows and investor conferences were held to detail the company’s economic situation, business strategy and future prospects in a variety of one-on-one and group meetings. The Capital Market Day, which once again took place in Frankfurt at the Bechtle IT Forum Rhein-Main-Neckar, once again proved very popular and 26 C orporate G overnance focussed on Bechtle’s international strategy. Moreover, numerous investors took the opportunity to learn more about Bechtle during a visit to the headquarters in Neckarsulm. IR is also responsible for informing shareholders about the publication of compulsory announcements, press releases, the Annual Report, half-yearly reports and quarterly statements. To mark the publication of reports, we offer analysts and institutional investors the opportunity to talk directly to the CEO in a telephone conference. We also provide detailed information about the company, share price and list personal IR contacts on the website. CUSTOMERS. We empower business. We can only do so with high levels of customer satisfaction and long-term partnerships. That’s why we don’t just work for our customers – first and foremost, we work with them on an equal footing. Good communication demands proximity which is why we are represented with over 100 regional systems integrators and specialists throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland. We also have branches across Europe that ensure personal, country-specific customer approaches. Trade fairs and events bring together customers, vendors and Bechtle colleagues. The largest customer fairs are the Bechtle Competence and Experience Days which take place annually at the company headquarters. Bechtle also holds the IT Forums North, West, Rhein-Main-Neckar and Switzerland to enable specialist knowledge sharing and networking. The largest customer fair to take place abroad in 2019 was Experience in Paris, organised by Inmac Wstore S.A.S. In total, Bechtle Events Management planned over 200 events including the IT Security Days, informal get-togethers and vendor events. Our customers stay informed through personal contact with the subsidiaries and via our social media bechtle.com/news/ channels, website and the digital or printed customer magazine Bechtle update. bechtle-update The two-day Bechtle Competence Days that takes place in spring is Bechtle’s largest customer event. Alongside presentations, innovations and products, there are opportunities for networking at the group headquarters. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 27 Bechtle’s Claims Management. To achieve customer satisfaction, there needs to a combination of correct deliveries, low complaint rates and avoiding additional transportation and packaging. Bechtle’s Returns Management department is responsible for key tasks relating to return logistics, which entail planning, controlling and verifying the flow of goods, money and information between the customer making the return and the product’s supplier. The department focuses on providing customer-oriented, effective services that flow in the opposite direction to the usual supply chain. Our objective is to help our customers quickly and with little red tape in the case of a complaint. Return rates are also increased by incorrect deliveries when goods are delivered damaged to the customers. To avoid such an event, protective and strong packaging is essential. In order to professionally process any complaints, the logistics hub utilises an SAP tool. Our goal is to consistently reduce return rates and we can see that the measures implemented in previous years are having an effect. The number of returns has reduced despite increased revenues: RETURNS. 2018 2019 Return rate in % 0.70 0.68 Returns 40,143 38,491 Value of returns (average) € 344 392 Returns Management develops measures to avoid or at least reduce returns to an absolute minimum. This includes carefully selecting our suppliers and vendors plus carrying out comprehensive supplier evaluations, regular customer surveys to evaluate our services and adapt to new requirements, a monthly returns analysis for product range management and the continuous optimisation of our processes. Returns resulting from damaged goods provides information on packaging optimisation. PA R T N E R S / V E N D O R S . We treat our partners and vendors with the respect they deserve. They can always count on us: we’re a reliable business partner, we make clear agreements, and we stick to them. We discuss our plans with our strategic partners on a regular basis as we continue developing our business model. We maintain close partnerships with the IT industry’s leading distributors and vendors and hold almost exclusively the highest partner status certifications. We have established a strategic concept with the most important vendors at the heart of which is a Vendor Integrated Product Manager (VIPM), who knows and represents the interests of both the vendor and Bechtle. The advantage of the VIPMs is that they can forward vendor information centrally and quickly to the responsible employees in the procurement, sales and services departments. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 28 C orporate G overnance By standardising logistics processes and harmonising ERP systems between Bechtle and its partners, additional synergies can be realised. This doesn’t just result in a broadening of our product range with an increase in availability of the goods, but also boosts Bechtle’s attractiveness for other distributors and vendors, opening up the opportunity for our company to increase efficiency and optimise costs. Personal exchanges are also very important for us and we were able to welcome numerous management board members of our most important vendors to Bechtle Platz 1 in 2019. A variety of partner awards and certifications underscore our successful collaboration. Our Executive Board and Executive Vice Presidents are also represented on the advisory boards of our most important vendors. We also maintain contact with our partners with regard to the subject of sustainability. Within the See Bechtle Sustainability framework of a Green Procurement public sector analysis, we conducted guided interviews with those Report 2017 responsible for sustainability at our five most important vendors and have already begun working on joint projects. One of these projects is our now established Bechtle Box® – a multi-use box for secure transportation that saves on space and packaging. EMPLOYEES. All Bechtle employees contribute to our success through their expertise and dedication. Bechtle’s corporate structure is like a game of tug-of-war between decentralised structures and independently run subsidiaries and the group as a whole with its centralised processes. As much as we want this tension, we don’t let it get in the way of our distinctive team spirit, which, since STRAT 2019, has the motto #onebechtle. The strategy conference (STRAT), takes place every year in February and is the largest internal event with some 1,500 employees from the Bechtle Group attending. The event sees new initiatives and forward-looking strategies being presented with employees being able to subsequently view videos of the event on the intranet. Our company’s decentralised structure means that clear communications processes are indispensable. These are top down, which means that supervisors should maintain regular contact with their employees alongside the annual appraisals. Corporate Communications keeps employees up-to-date via the intranet, where company news, the digital employee magazine, Bechtle inside; press releases and important tools and links are shared. Any critical information is e-mailed to all affected e ­ m­ployees. Employee Happiness Surveys are a fantastic tool to gain an insight into employee satisfaction, the working environment and the mood in the individual companies. Central People Development support managing directors in communicating with employees and in collecting, statistically evaluating and presenting results. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 29 GENERAL PUBLIC. We keep the media and interested parties informed about Bechtle via our communications channels and publications. We set great store in keeping regular contact with those in the areas surrounding our companies, lobby groups, NGOs and universities. For this reason, we are an active member of the Bitkom industry association, regularly visit relevant events, and implement projects with research institutes such as the Karlsruhe Institute for Technology (KIT) and the Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences. At the group headquarters, we are in close contact with local companies and mobility admins of the city of Neckarsulm. Dr Thomas Olemotz welcomes 660 shareholders to the 2019 Annual General Meeting at the Harmonie Festival Hall, Heilbronn. STRAT, as photographed here in February 2019 at Messe Stuttgart, is the largest internal event which welcomes participants from across the Bechtle Group to discuss the coming year’s strategy and innovations. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 30 BUSINESS ETHICS. TAKING RESPONSIBILITY IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. Previously, we only partially considered environmental standards in the supply chain, such as renewable energies or packaging in the logistics hub. A holistic look at the supply chain has, however, been set as a long-term goal. It is essential for us to work towards protection of the environment even outside of our direct sphere of influence. We want to exercise our responsibility in all sustainability areas, which we have addressed in many ways, such as signing the UN Global Compact and the WIN Charta. In terms of our customers, we increasingly feel the desire to disclose our activities in the area of environmental standards via supplier assessments such as EcoVadis, IntegrityNext or questionnaires. Our public sector customers in particular, set great store on environmental protection. The revision of the Green Public Procurement (GPP) criteria at EU level anchors environmental aspects even more explicitly in the procurement process of IT solutions. THE FUTURE. It is our aim to analyse the topic of environmental standards in the supply chain, to form an approach, define control, and develop targets and corresponding measures according to GRI 308 1-2. LABOUR AND SOCIAL STANDARDS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 The topic of labour and social standards in the supply chain is a central criteria in the awarding of contracts by public sector and industrial customers. The increasing number of requests for supplier information from industrial customers or new public procurement directives are reflected in the operative area. The German government makes clear the requirements of German companies with the National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights (NAP). Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 31 As a reliable and responsible partner, it is particularly important to us that we comply with fundamental labour and social standards in the manufacture and transport of IT hardware and software sold by Bechtle as well as performance of IT services (e.g. financial, managed, and professional services, in addition to remarketing and training). This basically means that the standards are defined by international law (convention of the International Labour Organisation, ILO) or the relevant applicable national law in the country of manufacture or service provision. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 We work closely and reliably with our suppliers to make our contribution to protecting human rights within our sphere of influence. We regularly seek out dialogue with expert groups, public bodies, NGOs institutions, and customers in order to help shape the topic at various levels. Bechtle was, for example, involved in the delegation of Bitkom negotiators (GRI 102-13) at the German Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior for the revision of the declaration for social ­sustainability. Above all, the public sector has been demanding concrete measures from its suppliers for years to continuously improve labour and social standards along the supply chain. As a long-term partner of public sector customers, we’re not just familiar with what customers want, but are also experienced in trusting working relationships with suppliers. In 2014, the Purchasing and Legal Departments designed a Code of Conduct for suppliers of goods and services as a control mechanism. This code is based on the principles and minimum requirements of the ILO Convention of Core Labour Standards. All new suppliers and those that have not yet signed this Code of Conduct are prompted by Purchasing to do so on an annual basis or to supply their equivalent of it. Bechtle’s ARTICONA brand, launched in 2018, offers a wide range of IT accessories such as keyboards, cables, plugs, and protective monitor films. Based on Bechtle’s Supplier Code of Conduct, ARTICONA has provided their own to their suppliers. In order to comply with our own labour and social standards requirements, we place great importance on cooperation with the producers for Bechtle’s ARTICONA brand. In 2019, four Bechtle Logistik & Service GmbH employees visited a total of 16 production facilities around the world in order to form their own opinions of the conditions on site. GRI 414-2 As at 31/12/2019, all vendors had signed the ARTICONA Code of Conduct based on the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct. GRI 414-2 As at 31 December 2019, 67 suppliers and 54 vendors have signed the Bechtle Supplier Code. As in the previous year, five suppliers and 18 vendors have presented their own policies, which overlap with our own code in all essential respects. In total, this amounted to 90.6 per cent of the purchase volume. 32 business ethics FEEDBACK. GRI 103-3 To monitor our suppliers’ compliance with social and labour standards, Bechtle focuses on examining business-humanrights.org/de audit results on a project-related basis, for example reviewing supplier-provided audit, inspection and sustainability reports. In sustainability management, regular reports checking our key partners are made to the Business Human Rights Resource Centre. OUTLOOK. Our aim for 2020 is to align the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct with the amorfi BSCI Code of Conduct and the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and rework it if required. Moreover, various supplier evaluation systems and auditing processes will be scrutinised. IT companies are increasingly having to ensure their supply chain is transparent. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 33 HUMAN RIGHTS, DUE DILIGENCE AND LABOUR CONDITIONS. Human rights are inalienable and indivisible rights that every person is entitled to. Bechtle is aware of the particular responsibility it carries to adhere to and implement these rights. Bechtle has a strict non-acceptance policy of child, forced, and compulsory labour. This responsibility is something that we exercise in our business locations and processes and expect our business partners to do the same. It is Bechtle’s declared intention to protect human rights in our company. We conform with the UN Global Compact Principles and the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). Ensuring fair working conditions is a fixed component of the Bechtle Corporate Culture and anchored in the Bechtle Code of Conduct. We also expect vendors and partners to protect human rights and therefore ask our suppliers to either sign the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct or present us with their own equivalent. Bechtle direct UK has also published a statement in line with the “UK Modern Slavery Act” that condemns all forms of modern slavery, forced and child labour, exploitation, and discrimination. Bechtle complies with all laws and legal requirements that govern aspects such as employee freedom of association and collective bargaining. Infringements of human rights can be reported to the Bechtle Compliance Board by employees or third parties via the whistle-blower system. Reports made to the Compliance Board will be checked and measures taken if necessary. In terms of our business partners, we trust them to sign and comply with the Bechtle Supplier Code of Conduct. In order to respect human rights along the supply chain, in 2019 we sought advice via the helpdesk of the German National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights (NAP). OUTLOOK. In the mid-term, we are checking various instruments and methods that could help us to ensure human rights are respected along the entire supply chain in a more transparent way. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 34 business ethics COMPLIANCE. DATA SECURITY AND PROTECTION. OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 Information security, data protection and confidentiality are among the most important aspects of Bechtle’s business. Since information security and data protection cover many of the same issues or at least overlap in several areas, these are consolidated. For Bechtle, compliance with legal requirements (EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) and the high risk to our reputation in the event of a security breach are of utmost importance, as these topics concern the core of Bechtle’s business model. Breaches therefore pose a great danger to our commercial success and can lead to a huge loss of reputation. Furthermore, the materiality results from the requirements of the certification for information ­security according to DIN EN ISO 27001. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 Documents applicable group-wide contribute to raising awareness among all Bechtle employees of the principles of data protection, information security, confidentiality and other important regulations, as well as to ensuring compliance with legal requirements. Relevant documents include the Bechtle Code of Conduct, which comprises binding rules of conduct for all employees, general training documentation on the GDPR and our data protection policy. Documents that are relevant to information security and whose applicability is limited to the scope of ISO 27001 certification – and therefore to the group’s high-security areas – include the central information security guidelines, the central IT compliance policy and the information security policy for employees. As required by ISO 27001 certification of the Information Security Management System (ISMS), a mandatory ISMS management review (MMR) is compiled and updated every year. This guarantees a high level of awareness among executive management as the competent Executive Board member is personally involved in both the compilation of the MMR and the ISMS audits. Bechtle has also implemented processes to report information-security and data-protection ­incidents. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 35 In the areas of security, governance, risk, and compliance, we focus on data processing, information flow, e-mail traffic, and customer and Bechtle data in our data centres. These are located in Frankfurt and Rüsselsheim, at Bechtle in Neckarsulm and Friedrichshafen, as well as the local data centre of Bechtle Hosting & Operations GmbH (BHO). All of these data centres, including the BHO and Bechtle IT Systems Integrator Neckarsulm, are certified to DIN EN ISO 27001. Every two years, we write a test plan which defines regular security tests to be performed by the certified data centres. These are part of the security measures which are constantly required and include penetration tests (pen tests), which check the security of as many system components, network or software system applications as possible. There are also ad-hoc tests that we conduct based on ­varying services, developments, or innovations. In the area of data protection, we concentrate primarily on compliance with the requirements of the GDPR. The GDPR’s objectives are to protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, in particular their right to the protection of personal data, as well as the continued free yet secure flow of personal data. It’s not only personal data that has to be specially protected. Bechtle AG is certified according to DIN EN ISO 27001 standards and can, therefore, offer the highest levels of security. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 36 business ethics FEEDBACK. GRI 103-3 In order to ensure group-wide compliance with the GDPR, our data protection officer conducts data protection audits at all Bechtle subsidiaries, identifying unresolved issues and formulating suitable measures. As in previous years, employees in Germany continue to complete data protection training via our online iLEARN platform. The training courses are regularly updated to reflect current requirements and include a final exam to ensure that the essential principles have been properly understood. By the end of 2018, more than 40 per cent of our employees had participated in data protection training courses. In 2017, the proportion was over 25 per cent. In January 2019, new GDPR training began for all internal Bechtle Group employees. In September 2019, an audit on information security was conducted in accordance with DIN EN ISO 27001 for the data centres of Bechtle AG, BHO, and the Bechtle IT Systems Integrator in Neckarsulm. For the BHO, the scope was broadened: in addition to the Neckarsulm and Friedrichshafen branches, the Bochum and Dortmund locations were also certified. OUTLOOK. Bechtle’s declared goal, in addition to adhering to compliance requirements, is to increase the overall level of security. Additionally, certification of additional locations needs to be checked for compliance with DIN 27001 and TISAX (a standard for information technology defined by the German automotive industry/VDA). Training of employees in the existing certification area is also planned for 2020. COMBATTING CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY. OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 In order to avoid enterprise corruption and bribery, ethically correct and legally compliant behaviour is a must for all. Misconduct and breaches in this context will not just lead to loss of orders and severe financial penalties for the Bechtle companies concerned, but also be highly damaging to the reputation of the entire Bechtle Group. It is especially important, therefore, to increase every individual’s awareness of this as part of preventative measures. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 Combatting corruption is part of the Bechtle compliance system, which encompasses all subsidiaries of the Bechtle Group as well as Bechtle AG’s central departments. Applicable since 2010, the Bechtle Code of Conduct is an integral part of compliance at Bechtle. This is a binding commitment to integrity for all Bechtle employees. These general compliance provisions continue to be reviewed with Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 37 respect to different scenarios and specialist departments, in order to adapt them to specific contexts and provide more concrete detail. For instance, a binding company-wide policy for dealing with incentives from business partners has been in place since 2011. In addition to this, there is an easy-to-use decision-making aid for employees on how to appropriately handle and behave when receiving and giving gifts – with special consideration for the specific situation with regard to public-sector customers. Whistleblowing procedure. Employees can contact the Compliance Board – consisting of the entire Bechtle AG Executive Board and a permanent representative from the central legal department – with all types of questions on the topic of compliance, but especially to report relevant compliance breaches via a dedicated hotline or alternatively via a dedicated e-mail account.

Moreover, every new employee receives a physical copy of the Bechtle Code of Conduct as an integral component of the onboarding process. During the year, the Bechtle Compliance Board, sends out special e-mail notifications on a case-by-case basis to potentially affected employees and to the managing directors of the Bechtle entities. The sole purpose of these e-mails is to increase employee awareness of compliance issues. Articles published on the Bechtle intranet on 31/10/2019 – Compliance at Bechtle – provide more information on this. Combatting and minimising all potential risks of corruption and bribery are the fundamental aims of the processes and measures built into the compliance system. Compliance for Bechtle means fully complying with the Bechtle Code of Conduct, the differentiated regulations and compliance instruments, and adherence to all relevant laws and provisions. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 38 business ethics All managing directors are obliged to report all potential risks and corruption as a risk factor to ­central risk management, based in the central controlling unit of Bechtle AG. GRI 205-2 Personalised training enabled the entire leadership of Bechtle direct Germany and the Bechtle Public Sector to be instructed by the legal department during the Public Sector Competence Meeting 2019 (with some 170 participants). GRI 205-1 Although the Compliance Board also internally documents figures such as the number of violations or reported incidents and reports these to the respective committees, they are by nature confidential and cannot therefore be published. Compliance reporting encompasses all operative and legally independent members of the Bechtle Group (117 in 2018) as well as all central divisions of Bechtle AG. GRI 205-3 In 2018, there were no known cases of suspected corruption in the Bechtle Group. For the 2019 reporting period, not all compliance reports were available before publication of this report. Both internal and external parties can use the compliance hotline to report breaches. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 39 FEEDBACK. GRI 103-3 To ensure the effectiveness of the Bechtle compliance system, all managing directors of the group subsidiaries and the heads of the central departments are required to report incidents, i.e. identified violations of the Code of Conduct or applicable law, to the Compliance Board in the form of an annual compliance report. In terms of software, there is also a background check of all Bechtle business partners (including employees) via our central SAP system in accordance with relevant EU Directives on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing (Directive (EU) 2018/843 and (EU) 2015/849). Subsequently, the Compliance Board prepares a consolidated overall compliance report and submits it to the Supervisory Board of Bechtle AG. OUTLOOK. The Bechtle Code of Conduct is currently being updated and the new version is set to be published at some point in 2020. Compliance training will continue. For the mid-term, Bechtle plans to design and offer an e-learning tool on compliance for all employees. QUALITY MANAGEMENT. To ensure that our customers’ requirements are systematically recorded and that we are able to fulfil them, we introduced a group-wide ISO 9001 management system back in 1996. This management system makes sure to take into account the complex requirements of a decentralised business model based on a strong regional presence, while operating with the efficiency of a centrally organised company in areas such as logistics, warehousing and product management. Bechtle’s quality management system is regularly assessed by Bechtle’s quality management officer using internal audits as well as by external experts from independent certification organisations. Every year, DQS GmbH, a company specialised in auditing management systems, examines all of the processes and procedures in place at Bechtle’s central units as well as three to five randomly selected, rotating Bechtle Group locations. In addition to the annual audit, DQS conducts what are known as recertification audits every three years with the next due in 2020. All previous audits have yielded only positive results. In spring 2017, we successfully transitioned from the outdated DIN ISO 9001:2008 standard to the new DIN ISO 9001:2015 version within the framework of matrix certification – one of the first companies in Germany to do so. This has noticeably improved the quality of our internal processes even further. The new version is closely aligned to practical realities, reflecting the requirements of rapid technological and economic change. By improving the quality of our processes and identifying risks and opportunities, as required by the standard, we have been able to deepen our relationships with customers and other stakeholders. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 40 EMPLOYEES AND SOCIETY. EMPLOYER ATTRACTIVENESS. OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 It is very important for us, both from a strategic and an economic perspective, not only to recruit highly qualified people, but also to keep them long term. It’s important that our employees are able to develop and grow at Bechtle and also feel at home. As a future-proof employer, we have much to offer our employees: the freedom to take the initiative guided by clear goals, mutual esteem and unity in a powerful team with support from experienced specialists in order to keep a healthy work-life balance. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 Our approach is echoed in Bechtle’s Vision 2030. “We are professionals. We strive to excel and we have what it takes. Bechtle is a place where great people accomplish great things.” Flat hierarchies enable early handover of responsibilities and promote entrepreneurial thinking in all employees. Measures to boost employer attractiveness are generally guided by Human Resources, whose expert teams set targets, tackle individual topics, and pilot targeted measures in close coordination with the Executive Board. The Managing Directors of the Bechtle Group companies bear the responsibility for implementing measures in their own spheres of responsibility. GRI 401-2 Keeping the balance. We set great store on our employees’ work-life balance. We want to enable them to manage the requirements of work alongside their leisure time, family or changing personal situation. Flexible working hours, part time work, and mobile working are the most important and most popular tools for this, roles permitting. We embrace the variety of modern working styles and strive to enable employees to choose the best time and place to get the job done and accommodate their particular situation. One concrete work-life balance measure was implemented in 2019 for employees across Germany when the holiday allowance was supplemented by two extra days, bringing the total up to 30 per year. And those who wish for a longer time out than the annual holiday provides can agree this with their team and manager. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 41 Childcare is also a considerable challenge for many families in terms of keeping the balance between being a parent and employee, and this is one reason many take advantage of parental leave when their children are young. GRI 401-3 In the reporting year, 363 employees in Germany took parental leave. On average, parental leave taken by women increased by 3.4 to 24.5 months (compared to the previous year), which is significantly higher than men, who took an average of 1.7 months leave. PARENTAL LEAVE: 2018 2019 No. of employees 347 363 Percentage of women in % 51 53 Average no. of months 21.1 24.5 Percentage of men in % 49 47 Average no. of months 1.67 1.7 Once their parental leave has ended, many employees opt to start working part time (see further below for the percentage of part time employees). In this vein, we are also seeing increased demand for part-time models for employees in leadership roles. GRI 401-2 For families with older children, Bechtle headquarters in Neckarsulm has been offering all-day summer holiday activities for employees’ children between five and 12 years of age since 2018. Together with Haus der Familie, a non-profit organisation in Heilbronn, the children can play and have fun for a period of between one and three weeks. Bechtle takes care of coordination, provides the required facilities, and subsidises some 75 per cent of each child’s participation costs. In the reporting year, 107 places were taken for one week at a time. Beekeeper, Markus Zettl, explains to the children taking part in the holiday programme about the Bechtle bees’ life buzzing around the head­ quarters and how important flowering plants are for their survival.

On 31/12/2019, 392 company bikes were being leased. Working environment. New, attractive and flexible working environments and room to unleash their creativity are important for all employees to feel comfortable in their workplace. Alongside the right technical equipment, the modern work concept provides for shared desks, noise combating measures, communication oases, and a new office furniture concept, the latter spanning modern and ergonomic office furniture such as desks with motorised height adjustments. We purchase the furniture from a family-run company in the Heilbronn-Franconia region. All newly-constructed or newly occupied Bechtle office spaces subscribe to this concept. Social security. We provide our employees in Germany with a range of attractive offers in terms of pension plans and other insurance. Since 2019, we have been offering an occupational disability insurance policy with attractive conditions and with no health check required. A further option for retirement planning is drawing up a direct insurance policy. Although it only became obligatory to provide deferred compensation to the amount of the social security savings for new contracts in 2019 – and is not required for existing contracts until 2021 – Bechtle has been providing a 15% subsidy to the amount of the deferred compensation for all employees who have taken out a policy since 2018.

OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 We want to provide our employees with a safe and productive working environment in which they feel at ease and which avoids work-related injuries and illnesses. It’s essential that we take our responsibility as an employer seriously and ensure that the company is a safe and healthy place to work. Compliance with legal regulations is critical for us and we also attach great importance to occupational health and safety. As independence is an important component of Bechtle’s corporate culture, we aim to raise our employees’ awareness of potential risks and negative effects on their health. The ever-changing world of work challenges every single one of us – including occupational health management, which is why we encourage our employees to lead a healthy life both at work and at home. We implement suitable measures to support occupational health and safety plus awareness raising. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2, GRI 403-2 – GRI 403-5 With Bechtle’s connected dispersion model, responsibility for the occupational health and safety for all employees (including all leasing staff) lies with the managing directors of the individual companies. This rule applies to all companies of the Bechtle Group. GRI 403-3 Occupational safety. The German Bechtle companies are supported by a centralised coordinating unit at Bechtle AG. The managing directors of the branches outside of Germany are also responsible for occupational health and safety, but due to the various legal requirements in different countries, the coordinating unit in Germany can only play a limited role. The coordinating unit remains in contact with the commissioned occupational health service, which regularly visits the German branches to identify potential dangers and supports companies to reduce risks. Together with the occupational health service, the coordinating unit trains managing directors across Germany on their obligations and provides e-learning materials for employees (e-learning covers the basics of occupational safety, ergonomics, health, first aid and fire protection), and also draws up guidelines for occupational health and safety and fire protection. Bechtle Belgium is also supported by a coordinating unit. All employees take part in regular occupational safety training and can view the Occupational Health and Safety Act via the intranet. The Occupational Safety Committee meets every quarter to check the current situation, discuss current developments and decide on any necessary measures to be taken. General measures tend be piloted at the headquarters before being rolled out across the group. In addition, each German branch has its own Occupational Safety Committee made up of local occupational safety experts and members of the management who meet four times a year. Short-term and acute measures such as employee suggestions are implemented immediately. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 49 Occupational health. Bechtle established Corporate Health Management (CHM) at the Neckarsulm headquarters in 2013. CHM takes a holistic approach to the subject of health and is a part of the Human Resources department. On the one hand, the CHM team plans and coordinates measures at the headquarters and on the other, is in regular contact with the responsible parties at all Bechtle locations – both domestic and outside of Germany.

OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 We’re a dependable employer in the future-oriented industry of IT. Due to racing digitalisation on one hand, and the increasing need for specialist staff on the other, it is of strategic importance for our financial success to not only attract qualified individuals, but also keep them at Bechtle in the long term. We place great importance on our employees’ continued personal and professional growth. Following our target of training our employees to be the best in the business (Bechtle Corporate Philosophy, p.14), we want to increasingly be able to cover the growing need for specialist and management staff from our own ranks. Training and education in addition to knowledge management are therefore very important at Bechtle. M A N A G E M E N T.

People Development centrally plans and organises development programmes, leadership training courses, programmes accompanying vocational training and integrated study, and the trainee programme for all of the Bechtle Group companies. The Bechtle Academy rounds off the offering with a wide portfolio of training courses for all employees. In line with Bechtle’s connected dispersal business model, the managing directors of each Bechtle Group company and their management are the first point of contact for training and education. Employee training is of special importance for Bechtle and this is why it is firmly rooted in the Corporate Philosophy as well as the Bechtle Group Leadership Principles.

GRI 103-1 Our employees form the basis of our corporate success. Alongside their qualifications and high levels of dedication, it’s the diversity of the Bechtle employees that is a key factor for successful teams and an excellent understanding of both customers and markets, with the aim of cultivating a long-term relationship between our employees and Bechtle. We encourage our employees to bring their individual experiences, skills, and potential to the group and we provide them with a respectful working environment where appreciation is at the fore. We speak frankly and turn our backs on discrimination due to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religious beliefs, world views, ethnic background and nationality, illness and disability. This principle has been firmly anchored in our Code of Conduct which applies to every single employee. For potential applicants, it’s crucial that their new employer is open-minded and honest. MANAGEMENT GRI 103-2 We expect that all of our employees are treated equally as laid down in our Code of Conduct and the corporate values we live every day, which demand we treat each other fairly and respectfully. Each leader must act as a role model and ensure diversity and equal opportunities in their departments. The Bechtle Academy offers numerous seminars on the subject of diversity, ranging from intercultural skills to leadership training, while Human Resources employees are specifically trained in application and employment processes.

Initiative for the advancement of women 2019. Bechtle took part in the WoMent² mentoring programme at the University of Applied Sciences in Heilbronn for the second time in 2019. During this hs-heilbronn.de/woment programme, three mentors each support a female student in their final year of study with the goal of motivating them to aim for a leadership role. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 60 E mployees Moreover, the Superwomen Academy took place for the first time in Germany and was held at the superwomenacademy.com Bechtle headquarters. This initiative helps companies gain more female employees using many different methods, including analysing external communications and designing a company’s employer communications and image to make them equally attractive to women and men. Wendy Broersen, from the Netherlands, has been marketing this concept for three years. The event at Bechtle’s headquarters in Neckarsulm was aimed mainly at raising awareness among HR decision-makers. With Girls’ Day, which was held at Bechtle Platz 1 and some of the other companies, Bechtle AG gives pupils the opportunity to find out more about careers and courses of study in technical fields. Bechtle AG is also a member of the federal government’s Nationaler Pakt für Frauen in MINT-Berufen komm-mach-mint.de (National Pact for Women in STEM jobs). FEEDBACK. GRI 103-3 Any breaches of our Code of Conduct are reported to the Compliance Board before they are checked and appropriate measures taken. Diversity transcends all areas of the group. OUTLOOK. The Bechtle IT Systems Integrator in Hamburg signed up to the German Diversity Charter back in April 2019. We are currently reviewing if we can sign up Germany-wide to further underscore our commitment to diversity and equal opportunities. This is an opportunity for us to carry out a fundamental analysis of the subject of diversity within the company. In terms of gender diversity, in 2020 we are working on concept with binding controls, targets and measures to support us in increasing the percentage of women, particularly at management level. Superwomen Academy at Bechtle: “Equalitypoly” is the name of the game in which players experience the positive effects a diverse corporate culture can have. During the game, the players discuss topics ranging from recruiting and employer branding to corporate culture, management and, of course, revenues. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 61 SOCIAL COMMITMENT. Social commitment is part of our corporate responsibility and a key component of our sustainable company culture. Bechtle AG and its Bechtle Group companies sponsor various community projects that serve the community in many different ways. Consequently, Bechtle AG has been concentrating its social commitments in the areas of children/ young people, education and sports since 2014, This triad, which formed the basis for a group-wide strategy in 2017, continues to be an excellent fit with Bechtle’s corporate culture, values, Vision 2030 and brand foundations. B E C H T L E A G ’ S C O M M I T M E N T. In accordance with social commitment policies, Bechtle AG acts as a reliable partner for select projects for at least three years. Three concrete examples of long-term commitment to our partners are: in 2009, Bechtle founder Ralf Klenk launched the foundation “Big Help for Little Heroes” (Große Hilfe für kleine Helden) and Bechtle has been supporting them from day one, donating 30,000 euros in 2019. Bechtle has been co-funding an endowed professorship at Heilbronn University since 2009 with a focus on logistics. Since 2010, the annual financial contribution has been 10,000 euros with further financial support being confirmed through to September 2020. As a sign of our commitment to the region, we have a co-operation with the Neckarsulm Sport Union Club, which is significant in the region both in terms of its size and its professional organisation. Our contribution to the development of young talent also fits in perfectly with our focus on sponsoring education, young people and sports. That’s why we have been sponsoring a youth co-ordinator at the club since 2014 with a donation of 12,000 euros yearly. We have also been supporting the Neckarsulm Sport Union’s youth camp since 2016 with an annual donation, which amounted to 1,500 euros in 2019. In addition to this, in 2019 Bechtle also held a Christmas tree campaign, the 1,625 euros proceeds of which were also gratefully received by the young footballers. The contract, which initially ran to 2018, was extended in the reporting year. BECHTLE AG’S NEW COMMITMENT IN 2019. Bechtle AG has been a partner of the Experimenta in Heilbronn since May 2019 with a sponsorship contract running until the end of April 2022. Germany’s largest science centre, Experimenta has been a success since it opened in 2009 with its interactive and experience-oriented approach that aims to get all generations excited about science and engineering. In March 2019, the hands-on museum added a new, highly modern structure – a significant expansion to some 25,000 square metres offering children and adults alike a world of learning and experiences featuring 275 interactive exhibits, four creative studios and nine laboratories in addition to an observatory and a science dome that puts on science shows. Bechtle has been onboard at Experimenta as an IT partner since 2009. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 62 E mployees The science centre – with its modern technology landscape and close relationship with its long-term IT provider – is a fantastic opportunity for Bechtle to position itself as a strong IT partner in a future-oriented project. Experimenta’s concept and aims match with two focus points in Bechtle’s sponsoring strategy – children and education – and also play into Bechtle’s desire to further strengthen its roots in the region. A C T I V I T I E S S P O N S O R E D B Y B E C H T L E G R O U P C O M PA N I E S . With over 100 subsidiaries, Bechtle is active in its local communities as an employer, contractor and business partner. We are most active in the communities where we are located as this is where we can make the biggest difference. An important principle is therefore embracing our corporate social responsibility locally – maintaining a high level of authenticity and sponsoring projects that complement Bechtle and reflect our values and culture, perfectly complementing the above triad and our regional responsibility. Each of our commitments is characterised by a firm sense of duty and a high degree of continuity, with the individual managing directors deciding what to focus on. In total, the social commitments of the subsidiaries outweigh those of the parent company by a considerable margin. As a group, Bechtle donated a total of 286,272 euros to charities and community projects and over 282,432 euros for sponsorship in 2019. Many of our employees volunteer and are involved personally in various community projects. Above and beyond the legal provisions for granting a leave of absence for volunteer work, Bechtle supports these efforts wherever possible. The revamped Experimenta in Heilbronn is Germany’s largest science centre. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 63 Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 64 ENVIRONMENT. A company’s long-term success doesn’t just depend on its economic performance, but also careful harmonisation with nature and its resources such as the soil, air, water, biodiversity, and raw materials. As a socially responsible company, the environment holds a very special significance in our sustainability activities. By optimising our business processes, we can minimise our emissions, save resources, and reduce our effect on the environment. This is our contribution to protecting the environment and climate. Resource efficiency is also a requirement for our customers who expect eco-management that ensures compliance with legal and other regulations. Our aim is to work together with vendors, partners, and customers to contribute the best we can to protecting nature and the environment. ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND EMISSIONS. OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 In November 2016, the German Federal Government announced the 2050 climate protection plan which envisages a far-reaching greenhouse gas neutral climate balance by 2050. This sees Germany align itself with the aim of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to reduce global warming caused by humans to under 2 degrees Celsius. The Madrid Global Climate Summit (December 2019) stepped up this target to “not more than 1.5 degrees Celsius” in its final report. Carbon dioxide is the most well-known greenhouse gas which, according to the German Federal Enviumweltbundesamt.de/ ronment Agency, accounted for 88% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2017, produced in particular by daten/klima the burning of fossil fuels. For customer advisors, consultants, and IT specialists at Bechtle, it’s particularly important to be mobile. The Bechtle vehicle fleet therefore accounts for a considerable proportion of the company’s CO2 emissions. And in addition to this are the high energy costs for the air conditioning needed for the Bechtle data centre and maintenance of office buildings and warehouses. IT trade also entails energy consumption and emissions as part of the supply chain in production, ghgprotocol.org transport of goods, and when customers operate the products. In its infancy, Bechtle’s sustainability reporting concentrated on emissions categories (scopes) 1 and 2 in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 65 M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 By introducing a certified environmental management system in 2011 as part of Bechtle AG’s central functions, we laid the foundations for structured environmental management. An Environmental Management Manual forms the basis for Bechtle AG’s environmental strategy. The aim is to limit resource consumption and its resulting emissions as well as other effects on the environment. With some 1,700 employees at the end of 2019, the Bechtle headquarters is the largest branch2 of the group by some margin. The central functions of Bechtle AG based there serve as the driver for sustainability topics, including the environment. Individual projects are generally piloted at headquarters and then rolled out across the group as a whole. The managing directors of the companies are responsible for the implementation of measures, and are also the go-to contact for issues. The companies certified to DIN EN ISO 14001 standards have environmental officers who handle all related enquiries. The following Bechtle Group companies are certified in accordance with DIN EN ISO 14001: Bechtle AG in Neckarsulm and Gaildorf since 2011; PP 2000 Business Integration AG with branches in Stuttgart and Kornwestheim since 2015, Bechtle direct B.V. in the Netherlands with branches in Eindhoven and Breukelen since 2016 as well as the E-Commerce company Bechtle direct Public Sector since 2017, whose offices are located at headquarters in Neckarsulm. 2 The largest companies at the headquarters in Neckarsulm: Bechtle AG, Bechtle Logistik & Service GmbH, Bechtle GmbH IT-Systemhaus Neckarsulm, Bechtle Onsite Services GmbH, Bechtle Hosting & Operations GmbH, Bechtle Managed Services AG, Bechtle Systemhausholding AG, Bechtle direct/Bechtle direct Public Sector GmbH Deutschland.

Founded in 2017, Hamburg-based Bechtle Mobility GmbH is a service company within the Bechtle Group dedicated exclusively to managing mobility at Bechtle. In 2018, Bechtle Mobility managed 3,305 vehicles in Germany. The overseas companies manage their vehicles themselves. In 2018, this was a total of 77 vehicles in the Netherlands and 26 vehicles in Belgium. Other overseas companies were not included in the 2019 sample.

We were unable to reach the original target of 10 per cent over three years, set in 2016, due to manufacturers’ limited supply availability. This target is laid down in our hybrid strategy, which is entitled “inEmotion” and is included as part of the company car pool strategy. One measure to reduce the number of journeys and distance driven is the consistent expansion of web and video conferencing solutions which we started five years ago. We have used the month of July as a reference month and in this period, there was a year on year increase of 3,106 meetings using ­Cisco’s WebEx web and video conferencing solution. We expect a moderate increase in the number of web and video conferences in the coming year. USE OF THE WEBEX COLLABORATION PLATFORM OVER A ONE-MONTH PERIOD.

There are no comparable Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 68 E nvironment ­values from the previous year. In the coming reporting year, we plan to standardise the determination of key figures, meaning that the data basis will probably change. The calculations in this report are regarded by Bechtle as the short-term status quo and as a foundation to develop a climate strategy.

The aim is to develop a sustainable, group-wide climate strategy derived from measurable, quantitative figures. Additionally, we need sufficient data transparency as part of holistic figure reporting. Reliable data on energy and emissions (as required by GRI 302 or GRI 305) are currently available from certain branches and in varying quality of data. The aim is to set up the processes required for the collection of figures by 2020. In the mid-term, it should be possible for us to be able to professionally and efficiently record and analyse the required figures. In terms of the car pool, we are retaining the goal of ten per cent electric and hybrid vehicles in our service fleet in the coming three years. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 69 FEEDBACK. GRI 103-3 In addition to providing transparency, recording environmental indicators at headquarters helps us identify areas for improvement, develop a plan of action, monitor success and provide a public account of our efforts and progress. As part of regular internal and external audits, the companies certified in accordance with DIN EN ISO 14001 are regularly checked, evaluated, and new goals defined for them. The results of the Bechtle AG and Bechtle direct Public Service audits are then presented to the Bechtle Executive Board in charge of environmental issues. For other DIN EN ISO 14001 certified companies, their Managing Directors are responsible. As part of the Energy Conserving Regulation, between August and December 2019, a Germany-wide energy audit was conducted by the BFE Institut für Energie und Umwelt GmbH in accordance with DIN EN 16247-1. The final energy report contains essential components from the field of energy planning, the recording and analysis of the energy sources used and the energy-intensive systems and equipment. The data basis was total energy consumption in the period from 1 January to 31 December 2018. The result of the energy audit in accordance with DIN EN 16247-1 will be analysed over the course of 2020. The results will feed into the climate strategy as well as into individual operative measures. They will provide some of the first pointers towards Bechtle’s ecological footprint. Moreover, Bechtle is annually evaluated by EcoVadis. EcoVadis is a sustainability application platform for procurement chains. EcoVadis scorecards make it possible to understand, monitor and improve ecovadis.com corporate environmental as well as social and ethical performance. Bechtle AG (Group) and its subsidiary ITZ GmbH in Essen, InmacWstore S.A.S. in France, and Bechtle direct N.V. were all awarded silver by EcoVadis in 2019. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 70 E nvironment ENERGY-EFFICIENT IT. The topic of energy-efficient/green IT was once again evaluated as essential in the 2019 materiality See Materiality Analysis analysis and, for the first time, was placed in the area defined as reportable for the non-financial statement. Previously, Bechtle had considered green IT on a project-by-project basis. An example is the “BW-PC” framework agreement between the state of Baden-Württemberg and Bechtle from 2015 and renewed in 2017. Central procurement was able to supply 54 universities and higher-education organisations in the region of Baden-Württemberg with particularly energy-efficient PCs tailored to the customer’s needs. A group-wide consultation method was developed in Consulting Services that enables customers to roll out their application and IT infrastructure architecture in accordance with holistic sustainability criteria. Sustainability criteria have been an element of internal IT strategy since 2019. Since summer 2019, a CIO Organisation project group has been investigating the following questions: how efficient and sustainable is the IT we use? How can we be aware of the aspects of a circular economy? Which of our user-friendly services lead to sustainable user behaviour for our customers? What application and infrastructure architecture makes a sustainable contribution for our customers? How can we develop the ideal cloud/on-premise mix in order to reduce companies’ ecological footprint? The working group developed a consulting concept that evaluated the sustainability of customers’ IT infrastructures and has since become part of the IT service portfolio. E N E R G YE F F I C I E N T I T I N B E C H T L E ’ S D ATA C E N T R E S . Energy consumption in the Bechtle data centres for operations and air conditioning results in high CO₂ emissions. Virtualising data storage and processing is one measure taken to save energy. Over past years, the number of virtual systems and the degree of virtualisation have increased successively, while the number of physical systems has risen at a slower rate. By moving internal IT from Bechtle branches to the data centre in Frankfurt/Rüsselsheim and the short-term parallel system operation it entailed, the number of physical servers in 2018 was higher.

GRI 103-1 The Bechtle logistics hub in Neckarsulm functions as the central cog in the flow of commodities. A large amount of the IT hardware ordered by Bechtle arrives here, is consolidated with other orders for the same customers, temporarily stored for projects, or installed with IT software. Complaints are also processed in the logistics hub. Some 14,500 parcels leave the warehouse in Neckarsulm each day. Original packaging, transport packaging and printing of shipping documents all amount to a high quantity of refuse and therefore consumption of raw materials, and emissions. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 In 2019, a quality management team was set up in the logistics hub. Moreover, the warehouse employees regularly determine and analyse the packaging volume. Together with the management level and See Waste and recyclables GRI 103-2 supply chain and innovation management, savings potentials are elicited, new solutions found, tested, and implemented. In the packaging area, the products ordered by customers are packed in a way that effectively protects the items while using as little packaging material as possible. High quality standards are ensured through regular training – some of which is conducted in cooperation with our transport service providers – on how to properly package and load goods. Packaging-optimised warehouse logistics. In the past few years, Bechtle Logistik & Service has implemented various measures, in particular at its logistics centre in Neckarsulm, to reduce energy See Stakeholder dialogue Returns management consumption and CO₂ emissions throughout the entire supply chain – from its suppliers to end customers. Compared with the quantity of goods handled, it was able to cut the amount of packaging and reduce the volumes of outgoing shipments as well as the total number of shipments. We expect this not only to improve the environmental impact of our business activities, but also to increase customer satisfaction and retention and to optimise overall costs. In future, we will continue to identify, analyse, evaluate and implement further savings opportunities where possible and useful. GRI 301-1 MATERIALS.

OUTLOOK. Our goal in logistics is to reduce the amount of packaging materials and manage those we do use sustainably in order to reduce our impact on the environment. We therefore assess the use of ­various materials such as cellulose, foam, cardboard, or steel. Furthermore, we want to intensify the dialogue with vendors in order to optimise the topic of packaging. We also plan to use the ­Bechtle Box more often. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 73 The use of smart glasses in the warehouse facilitates the picking of small parts. Around 14,500 parcels leave Bechtle’s Neckarsulm logistics hub every day. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 74 E nvironment REFUSE AND RECYCLABLES. OUR APPROACH. GRI 103-1 The Bechtle companies mostly operate administrative offices, with there being few warehouses other than the logistics hub. The Bechtle Group office buildings mostly produce municipal, paper, and electronic waste, alongside used toner cartridges. Reducing waste is one way to conserve resources. M A N A G E M E N T. GRI 103-2 EU and local law have to be respected when disposing of waste. Data on waste generated is collected by the branches themselves and recorded in their accounts. This data forms the basis for identifying trends and potential for improvement. Because of the varied local impact and regulation of refuse management, these topics are predominantly processed locally in the respective companies. The topic of waste and recyclables at the headquarters in Neckarsulm is based on a disposal concept created within the bounds of Bechtle AG’s DIN EN ISO 14001 certification and encompasses the entire site. Facility Management and the environmental officers check the concept and update it as required on an annual basis. All employees at Bechtle Platz 1 have to complete annual environmental management training that provides them with the fundamentals and raises awareness of conscious handling of the topic with new employees trained as part of their onboarding. The environmental officers implement between 10 and 20 ideas annually. Three years ago, paper takeaway cups were replaced with multi-use ceramic ones at the request of our employees. The ceramic multi-use cups have become part of the everyday life at the Bechtle headquarters, saving us over 50,000 paper cups every year. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 75 One measure to optimise the volume of waste is centrally purchasing all consumables that are then made available to the individual departments. In order to lower paper consumption used for admin, we also introduced digital pay slips with the secure IncaMail service in 2018. By 31 December 2019, 4,409 employees in Germany (not including those of Modus Consult GmbH and Coffee GmbH) had opted for digital pay slips, while in Switzerland the number was 1,290.

GRI 103-3 As part of our internal and external audits in accordance with DIN EN ISO 14001, the disposal concept at the group headquarters has been evaluated and updated as needed over the last nine years. Reports from the waste management company on each material group enable us to have a transparent overview of developments. Each container is weighed and recorded, along with the rates of incorrect sorting, which represents the success of the work implemented daily. OUTLOOK. We aim to use materials sparingly and avoid waste, therefore saving resources and making a contribution to climate protection. We want to increase the proportion of certain materials in order to reduce municipal waste. Bechtle AG Sustainability Report 2019 76 G R I C ontent I N D E X GRI 102-55 GRI CONTENT INDEX.

The GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emission 68 calculation follows the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and is shown as CO2 equivalents. An operative control approach is used that balances both rental objects and leased vehicles in Scope 1. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, a calculation of Scope 2 emissions as a result of electricity consumption is only based on location-based emissions factors. For the location-based method, the factors are based on a specific geographic area (e.g. a country). The calculation of location-based greenhouse gas emissions is based on the 2018 International Energy Agency’s (IEA) factors; all other factors are based on the UK’s DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) emission factors for 2018.
