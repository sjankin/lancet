Therefore, the waste sent to landfill equates to 0.8% (2018: 0.6%) of the total waste generated. In 2019 the Group used 195,385 tonnes of recycled materials within its products equating to 131% of the waste it generated. Of this recycled material 33% (2018:23%) was from its own waste with 67% (2018:77%) coming from other industries. The generation of hazardous waste across the Group is generally limited to plant maintenance items such as used oils, filters and other components. The hazardous waste generated across the Group in 2019 was 211 tonnes (2018: 163) which equated to 0.1% (2018: 0.3%) of total waste generated. 39 / United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2019 40 / United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2019 Packaging Biodiversity Target reduce by 2% per annum, over a three year rolling cycle, while Target – to maintain legal compliance and work collaboratively ensuring that the pack and product safety is not compromised. with relevant bodies.
