St Barbara’s 2019 Sustainability Report Welcome to the St Barbara Sustainability Report. Highlights in sustainability this year include: • Welcoming Atlantic Gold to the St Barbara Group in July 2019. Atlantic’s sustainability performance was key in our due diligence. In particular, Atlantic Gold has been nominated for Nova Scotia safety awards in its first two years in operation. • Our injury frequency rate has disappointingly increased this year, although most of the injuries suffered have been relatively minor. Although our safety performance remains significantly better than our peers, we are committed to improving this very important metric. • Also in this report you will find increased reporting about water recycling, greenhouse gas emissions (where we are in the top efficiency quartile globally) and our continued efforts to set up our Simberi community for life after mining. Sustainability is a founding and ongoing focus, central to our Company culture. I am proud of St Barbara’s considerable financial and sustainability achievements, and I look forward to continued improvement and success in all measures.

Source: Shooting Stars. Shooting Stars – Case Study Higher res? Gwalia Processing plant Gwalia – Underground mining Truck Edwina is a Year 6 student at Leonora District High School. Edwina joined the Leonora Shooting Stars program in Term 3, 2018 not long after it began with significant St Barbara support. Edwina had not attended school during the 2017 and 2018 school years. She was initially shy and unsure about the Shooting Stars program, but when she chose to take a leap of faith, her progress was rapid. She began to attend more regularly and participated well in weekly netball sessions both before and after school.

Incident investigations have identified inexperience of both supervisors and injured persons as being a recurring contributing factor. This is consistent with an increase in turnover across Australian mining, with overall turnover up from 9.8 to 13.8%2.

In 2019, 423,000 tonnes Gwalia’s tailings (68% of total tailings) were deposited permanently underground by this method. This also prolongs the life of the existing TSF, by creating space for the deposit of new tailings.

The Group works closely with regulators and local government on an ongoing basis regarding Summary potable ‘town’ water usage (less than 3.5% of total mine usage). In 2019 the St Barbara Board considered climate change risk and governance as part of its strategic planning. The Simberi mine is currently expected to close in 2021. The mine’s use of water does not impact the community or the Governance environment due to the very high rainfall associated with the tropical climate. The Board has determined it will retain oversight of climate change related issues rather than delegate it to a Board subcommittee. Strategy The Board considered risks and opportunities regarding climate change. A summary of these are available below. It was concluded that the major ‘operational’ impacts of climate change (changes to weather patterns, sea level increases) fell beyond the anticipated mine-life of the Group’s longest life mines (Gwalia, Western Australia, 2031) and therefore were not material for the current financial reporting period. Regulatory risk and the possibility of changes to regulation of carbon emissions in Australia pose the strongest climate related risk to the Group. These risks could impact the profitability of the Group:  through the requirement to purchase carbon credits (or equivalent schemes); or  through increased operational costs from the requirement to purchase renewable power (or through directly investing in renewable power). The Board noted benchmarking data showing that the Group production emissions intensity (metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, per ounce of gold produced) was currently amongst the most efficient of any gold producer declaring the information publicly (presentation at the start of this report, slide 53). It was acknowledged that this advantage may erode. The Group’s dominant mine is building additional power generation capacity to facilitate deeper underground mining and production is unlikely to increase commensurately, increasing emissions intensity. Page 22 ST BARBARA LIMITED 2019 Sustainability Report The Board directed Management to investigate the sensible inclusion of renewable power in its power consumption mix.

Total potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is estimated at between 25% and 33%. Emissions intensity is likely to increase over time at Gwalia.

Page 25 ST BARBARA LIMITED 2019 Sustainability Report Targets The Group is satisfied with its current performance, being one of the best performers in intensity of emissions in the gold industry globally (see chart in the presentation earlier in this report, slide 53). In the short term, the Group will target remaining in the top two quartiles for intensity versus the gold industry globally. The Group is considering specific greenhouse gas reduction targets for future adoption, including consideration of guidance provided by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI)1. The Group has engaged with representatives of the SBTI and sought guidance regarding the appropriate measure for targets for the gold industry and it was confirmed as per published guidance (here, page 19) that the appropriate measure is ‘production intensity’ as part of a ‘Sectoral Decarbonation Approach’. The intention of the SBTI in their guidance is that market supply (global gold production) will stay approximately static, meeting consumer demand, while associated emissions reduce in line with global requirements for emission reductions. An important element is that globally all producers ‘converge’ to a best practice level (here, page 21). 1 https://sciencebasedtargets.org/ Page 26 ST BARBARA LIMITED 2019 Sustainability Report Performance Data Notes FY17 FY18 FY19 Target Governance & Economic Performance Governance Governance performance reported in Annual Annual Annual Annual Report Report and Corporate Governance Report Report Statement (CGS).

The consequence component of this matrix is shown below. ‘Total’ incidents include all types of incident except ‘insignificant’, i.e. Minor, Moderate, Major, Critical. Insignificant Minor Moderate Major Critical Reversible environmental Widespread Very low environmental Reversible harm extending beyond environmental impact, Widespread irreversible impact environmental impact, site boundary, not immediately environmental harm. (e.g.: localised spill) immediately contained immediately contained. contained. 6 A reportable incident is where a licence or regulatory condition requires certain events to be reported. Typically, any environmental incident that impacts beyond the mine lease borders must be reported. Some events within the mine boundary must also be reported, for instance, discovery of certain hazardous materials in landfill. Relatively low impact environmental events can therefore sometimes be reportable.

Page 39 ST BARBARA LIMITED 2019 Sustainability Report GRI GRI Ref1 Core Item Discussion UNGC3 met2 402 Labour management Though important, the Group holds that this area is not a material impact for 3 relations the Group. Employees at both our Australian and PNG mines have wages and conditions far exceeding the norm in those countries because of market factors (such as possession of in-demand skills and difficulties in attracting labour to remote locations). Mining and Metals Number of strikes and lock-outs exceeding one week’s duration – Though also supplement MM4 important, the Group holds this area to be of low materiality. No strikes or lock outs of this duration have occurred at any location in the Group’s ownership in the period covered by this report. 406 Non-Discrimination The Group has appropriate anti-discrimination policies, annual training for 1,2 managers and staff, a whistle-blower service, and in Australia, is a national award winner and recognised industry leader in gender diversity. Notwithstanding this, the Group holds that this area is not a material impact for the Group. 407 Freedom of association Though important, the Group holds that this area is not a material impact for 3 and collective bargaining the Group. Employees at both our Australian and PNG mines have wages and conditions far exceeding the norm in those countries because of market factors (in-demand skills and difficulties in attracting labour to remote locations). In PNG Labour relations with local employees are also regulated via mining licence type regulation where certain levels of local employment are mandated. Mining and Metals The Freedom of Association areas in the Mining and Metals supplement supplement under ‘Human Rights’ are also excluded for the same reasons. 408 Child Labour Children are forbidden from entering (as well as working in) the Group’s 5 operations. The Group holds that this area is immaterial because the assessed risk of incidence is low. 409 Forced or Compulsory The Group holds that this area is immaterial, as the assessed risk of related 4 Labour issues is low. 410 Security Practices The Group holds that this area is immaterial, as the assessed risk of related 2 issues is low. 411 Rights of Indigenous This area is considered immaterial. The Group has extensive procedures in 2 Peoples place to ensure the rights of Indigenous peoples are not violated and has had no significant incidents during the reporting period and is therefore considered immaterial. The area is not considered material due to the established nature of the Groups operations, with mining activities confined to areas where mining has occurred for more than a 100 years at Gwalia Leonora WA and for 10 years at Simberi PNG. Mining and Metals MM5 Operations adjacent to indigenous people’s territories. This area is 2 supplement considered immaterial for the same reasons. In Simberi PNG the local community is a party to a ‘Memorandum of Agreement’ along with different layers of government and the Group, in line with mining regulation. 412 Human Rights The long term history of democratic liberal constitutional government in 1,2 Assessment Australia and Papua New Guinea make these important issues of low materiality to the Group, in the sense that the assessed risk of related issues is low. Mining and Metals The Human Rights areas in the Mining and Metals supplement G4 DMA and 1,2 supplement MM5 are excluded also for the same reasons. 413 Local Communities In Leonora, Western Australia, ‘fly-in, fly-out’ and centralised procurement 1,2,3, functions, have reduced the economic relevance of the local community to 6 the mine. In Papua New Guinea mining regulation mandates a high level of involvement. As a result, 1-2% of total costs of the Simberi mine are related to Community support functions, ~45% of the workforce lives locally, and 6% of total costs are spent with local suppliers and contractors. The Group reports on its employment of local community members, it’s contracting with local community companies and its grievance/complaint function in this report.
