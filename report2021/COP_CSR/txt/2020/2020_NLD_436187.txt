I am pleased to confirm that Trinomics B.V. is continuously committed to support to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact Network in the areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to further integrate the Global Impact and its principles in our daily operations, business and corporate culture. Also, we commit to share the information with our stakeholders using the primary channels of communication. Yours sincerely, Koen Rademaekers Managing Director Trinomics 5 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 2 Human Rights 2.1 Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Assessment, Policy and Goals. 2.2 Implementation Trinomics B.V. actively supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and we support all the above-mentioned principles. We highly value that every human being has the same rights, regardless of where they live, their gender or race, or their religion, cultural or ethnic background. We believe that our activities and the way we treat our employees and counterparts promotes human rights. Human rights are integrated in our daily way of doing business and considered an essential part of our work. As an economic policy consultancy working on topics related to (renewable) energy, environment and climate change, we are naturally concerned about human rights and thrive to actively support them with our work. In delivering our work, we aim to ensure that we do not allow the rights of anyone (employees, partners, clients, stakeholders and any other human being) to be harmed in the process. We continuously take actions to actively support human rights in our company and in our work: • As people are central in our company, we actively support employees in creating a positive and open working environment because we truly care about our employees’ happiness, wellbeing and health. These principles are the essence of our corporate culture and anyone is encouraged to voice his or her feelings and opinions in our weekly team meetings, project evaluations and periodical strategy meetings. For new employees or young employees, we have a buddy system to ensure that any they are actively supported in finding their path within the company; • Creating a positive impact on society, including human rights, is one of the key criteria before we accept any type of work. As such, we proactively support human rights through our projects. We encourage diversity, gender equality and we accuse any type of discrimination. 2.3 Measurement of outcomes Internally, our values and principles for human rights resulted in a very diverse team existing of many types of persons in terms of gender (around an equal split between women and men), ethnicity (employees from all over the world), age and personalities throughout all layers of the company. Trinomics has developed a personal learning and growth path for its experts to stimulate personal development and introduce them to the key competencies required along their career path. In addition to the general professional development programme, we also identify and/or provide workshops related to our technical working areas and specific methodologies for policy research (such as economic analysis and impact assessments) to which our professionals are encouraged to attend. Trinomics’ experts attend training programmes such as summer schools, language courses, conferences and webinars on a regular basis to increase their knowledge on topics and methods relevant to their work fields. 6 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 3 Labour Principles 3.1 Principles Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Assessment, Policy and Goals. 3.2 Implementation Trinomics B.V. actively supports the labour rights of its employees and of any other counterparts and we support all the above-mentioned principles. We believe that our activities and the way we treat our employees and counterparts promotes their labour rights. The labour rights are integrated in our corporate culture as we aim to contribute to the wellbeing, happiness and health of our employees and to strengthen the intrinsic motivation through the creation of a pleasant and open working environment. We take continuous actions to actively support labour rights in our company and in our work: • All employees are made aware of their rights and the company policy. Guidelines on the company policy are shared on paper with all (new) employees to further develop our policy on labour principles. In addition, employees are encouraged to voice any labour related issues within the team such that any potential problem can be identified and solved in time; • Any type of discrimination is unacceptable, and we thrive to have a diverse team in terms of ethnicity, gender and age. This applies to all policies and procedures to recruitment, training, compensation, benefits and any other conditions. 3.3 Measurement of outcomes In project evaluations we reflect on any type of concerns on labour rights and working conditions, among others. As such, any type of concern will be known by the project leaders and Trinomics’ senior management. 7 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 4 Environment 4.1 Principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Assessment, Policy and Goals. 4.2 Implementation Trinomics B.V. actively supports the above-mentioned environmental principles. In fact, these principles are naturally integrated in all our business activities as policy advice on environmental issues accounts for a major part of our work. As such, all our employees are not only aware of environmental challenges, they are also intrinsically motivated to actively promote environment friendly policies in our projects on environmental policy advice and beyond. Aside from the policy advice and promoting environment friendly measures (even beyond environmental projects), we also aim to continuously lower our environmental footprint. This is driven by company policy and by initiatives from employees. For instance, we encourage employees (and counterparts) to travel by train/public transport and bicycle instead of by car or plane. In case there is no other option than flying, we compensate the CO2 emissions of our flights. Besides, employees themselves initiated strengthened recycling activities and encouraged the shift towards renewable energy contracts for our offices. Among the ‘basic’ company principles within Trinomics, we make sure that we: • Reduce our waste and then reuse or recycle as much of it as is possible; • Purchase products and services that do the least damage to the environment as much as possible; • Offset all of our CO2 emissions that we have been unable to avoid; • Enhance our local impact on the environment through volunteering programmes; • Minimise energy and water use within our buildings and processes in order to conserve supplies and minimise the consumption of natural resources. • Will include sustainability as a permanent goal in every project. A copy of our environmental policy can be found in Annex A of this Communication. 4.3 Measurement of outcomes We evaluate these goals on a regular basis, and improve issues where possible. For example, in 2019 we have separated about 250 bags of waste of which approximately 150 are recycled. 8 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 5 Anti-Corruption 5.1 Principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 5.2 Implementation Trinomics B.V. actively supports the anti-corruption principle. As many of our projects are granted by public procurement, we comply with the highest standards of commitment and practice regarding anticorruption. Our values and principles in this area are clear and known by our employees, clients and partners. Among our core values and principles, Trinomics makes sure that it: • Supports and respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and will make sure that it is not complicit in human rights abuses; • Respects core labour standards as stated in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (1998); • Has a zero-tolerance approach against any form of exploitation, including sexual exploitation, in particular of vulnerable persons. 5.3 Measurement of outcomes We have never been excluded from any public procurement process due to any corruption-related issues and no corruption intentions have been filed against the company. A copy of our certificate of code for procurement (‘Gedragsverklaring Aanbesteden’), issued by the responsible competent authority in the Netherlands (Ministry of Justice and Security), confirming that Trinomics B.V. has not been in any conviction situation in relation to public procurement processes, can be found in Annex B of this Communication. 9 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 Annex A: Environmental Policy Trinomics is among the leading policy and research consultancies in Europe, focusing on environmental, energy and climate policies. The company was established in 2012 with the vision to support the lowcarbon transition for a sustainable future for everyone by means of providing objective and independent advice to policymakers and helping them formulate the most effective action to reach their goals in this area. Delivering our services in a sustainable manner meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs – is part of our core purpose. Trinomics is committed to play an important role in driving the world’s transition to a global energy system that is sustainable, affordable, and based entirely on renewable resources and we are responsible and pro-active in the way we deal with our own consumption of energy and natural resources. We are committed to assess, manage and implement measures to reduce the carbon footprint of our business activities, by avoiding, reducing and offsetting GHG-emissions. We encourage our employees to make responsible use of energy and other resources (also in their personal lives) and to actively help to reduce the company’s and their own operational environmental impact. Trinomics’ Commitment to the Environment Trinomics contributes to sustainable development not only through our advice and research, but also in the way we conduct our own business. For us, this means not only focusing on our own footprint, but also extending our knowledge and best practices in the relationships we built with our customers, partners and suppliers. Environmental commitment at Trinomics is more than commitment to a single policy. The company staff provides leadership on the issue; by, for example, cycling to work and investing in reused and remanufactured equipment. Our largest impacts are transport-related, and in this arena, we seek to identify less impactful methods of transport. Our support for public transport includes paying for discount cards for all staff and encourage our staff to use bicycles and pay for their maintenance. In addition, whenever we travel by air, we compensate our CO 2 footprint, and we only print materials when necessary and by default print in black and white and two-sided. We are advocates for the process of remanufacturing. Our advocacy is based on our knowledge of the large environmental benefits available from the extension of component and product life through remanufacture. To this end, our office equipment and facilities are made of recycled materials and/or can be labelled as CO 2neutral (e.g. the floors in our office is the first CO 2 neutral office floor in the Netherlands). We commit to the following main environmental policy aims: • Be very efficient in our direct use of energy, materials and water, with objectives in line with or exceeding government targets; • Be compliant with regulation, including that with environmental and social dimensions; • Encourage sustainable products and services by buying them ourselves; • Separate our office waste (paper, plastic, glass) for recycling; • Minimise the amount of waste going to landfill by reusing and recycling materials wherever possible; • Work with customers and partners to define more environmentally sustainable ways of meeting their objectives; • Ensure that our key suppliers and contractors are aware of our policy and that wherever possible they operate to similar standards; • Enable our staff to live low environmental impact lifestyles; • Set targets, report, and review and continuously try to improve our performance. Trinomics’ management team has overall responsibility for this policy, while a corporate social responsibility working group is active in the further development of our sustainability principles and implementing these throughout our company. 10 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 Annex B: Certificate of Code for Procurement (‘Gedragsverklaring Aanbesteden) 11 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 12 UN Global Compact – Annual Communication on Progress 2019 Trinomics B.V.
