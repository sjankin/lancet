2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 1 “Being part of the gatekeepers to reopen America represents for us an unprecedented opportunity to come back stronger than ever.” Scott Salmirs A MESSAGE FROM OUR CEO [102-14] STATEMENT SENIOR DECISION MAKER The past few months have been difficult for for all of us. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public spaces and businesses have closed, people have lost their jobs, many lives have been lost, and countless more have been sickened. Leading a company whose team members are on the front lines fighting COVID-19 has been challenging and rewarding at the same time. Keeping our workers safe has been our top priority. I would like to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams who are working hard to keep our clients healthier. They have been real heroes in this battle and the least we can do is make sure they have what they need to continue performing their jobs safely. As such, I am proud to announce that ABM has joined the Cleaning Coalition of America in order to ensure that the needs of our industry (one that has played a vital role in keeping essential businesses operational) are well represented. Being part of the gatekeepers to help reopen America represents for us an unprecedented opportunity to come back stronger than ever with a strong value proposition for our clients: environmental sustainability. We are committed to practices that will leave behind a healthier planet for our children . We are also aware of the huge opportunity that bringing sustainable solutions to the market and performing sustainable operations represent. 2019 marked a banner year for our sustainability journey and prepared us to better support our clients in low carbon economy transitions. Through our sustainable solutions portfolio, including our GreenCare program of environmentally friendly cleaning services, we’re positioned to be our clients’ partner in achieving their facilities-related sustainability goals. We have strengthened our portfolio of sustainable solutions to effectively mitigate climate change risks and will continue to do so. So far, during 2019 we have reduced more than 247,269.58 MWh across our clients’ facilities, supported fleet electrification with more than 500 electrical vehicle charging stations installations, and reduced over 90,000 tons of CO2e emissions through the installation of the charging stations and the provision of our Energy Performance Contracting services . Finally, just in the same way that we advocate for sustainability on our clients’ behalf through our sustainable solutions, we aim to bring consistency to our internal efforts and in the way we manage our own operations. Conducting business in a sustainable way is a priority. In this report, we illustrate our efforts to ensure a healthy and safe environment for our workers, how we engage in responsible business operations, and how we manage our own environmental footprint. I hope you will join us as we work to ensure a healthier planet. I look forward to seeing our continuous improvements year over year!

Contributing to the Circular Economy – Keeping Things in the System In San Francisco, whenever we have a client that needs to get rid of bins due to a tenant move or because of the switch to centralized waste, we reach out to the San Francisco Unified School District to pick up the bins. That way, the bins are being reused and not tossed out for disposal. In total, we have donated more than 1,000 deskside bins, and the school district reported that all recycling bins are in the classrooms. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 21 DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY ABM’S SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT INITIATIVES [102-9] SUPPLY CHAIN | [102-10] SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS SUPPLY CHAIN ABM uses strategic supplier partnerships to provide a capable, modern supply chain that allows ABM team members to receive the same products used to service our clients in the most responsible manner. ABM’s Supplier Code of Conduct – Using Environmental and Social Criteria for Screening Our Suppliers We have established the ABM Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure that suppliers – including subcontractors that provide services directly to ABM’s clients – uphold the company’s policies. These requirements cover compliance with all applicable local laws, respect for human rights, environmental conservation, and safeguarding the safety of all of the products and services we provide. Our suppliers shall maintain all required environmental permits and Safety Data Sheets, as well as keep a record of the solid waste, wastewater and air emissions generated by their operations. At the same time, they should strive to reduce all types of waste generation, including water and energy consumption, as an overall strategy to implement environmentally friendly business practices. In addition, ABM suppliers shall strictly prohibit any form of corruption, adhere to fair business practice standards, and comply with any applicable anti-corruption law. Partnering With Our Suppliers For Sustainable Procurement Practices We are constantly identifying new products and methods to operate more efficiently for our clients, while staying at the forefront of the most innovative sustainable practices. As an example, we have a strong relationship with Diversey, our industry leading chemical supplier. Both companies have partnered together to implement sustainability initiatives across all of ABM’s value chain. Diversey’s latest innovations in packaging and chemical concentrations have reduced ABM shipping volumes by an equivalent of 40 truckloads over 2019, which has offset about 362,000 kgCO2e of carbon emissions.* Promoting Supplier Diversity ABM recognizes the importance of maintaining supplier diversity. We are committed to providing minority-owned, women-owned, as well as disabled veteran-owned (MWDVE) businesses direct access to subcontractor opportunities and procurement bids. We strongly believe that a robust and diverse supplier base not only helps ABM’s competitiveness in the marketplace, but also fuels the economic vitality across all sectors in our industry. ABM actively participates in supplier diversity initiatives. As an example, ABM Enterprise ABM has provided janitorial services to a large national client for several years now supplier diversity spend: and has offered support to MWDVE enterprises in business development practices through ABM’s mentoring program. Our extensive trainings and introductions to the $128M latest cleaning techniques, supplies and equipment have all played a major role in the success stories where we subcontracted MWDVE companies. * Based on calculations from Life Cycle Assessments, industry knowledge and engineering factors.

SV-PS-230A.1 | SV-PS-230A.2 | SV-PS-230A.3 Our Data Protection Approach ABM utilizes a multi-layer approach for identifying and addressing data risks. Utilizing tools that aggregate and then auto-remediate are the main focus of ABM where we are able to detect and remediate many risks within minutes. We use internal and external tools and resources to watch and respond to ID and data risks. We have been at the forefront for ensuring full compliance with all the newest laws and guidelines brought from General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act and all new guidelines and laws for personal information and retentions.

During 2019, ABM has had Zero data breaches. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 24 DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY TAKING CARE OF OUR PEOPLE AND CLIENTS [403] OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT APPROACH | [403-2] TYPES OF INJURY AND RATES OF INJURY | [416] CUSTOMER HEALTH AND SAFETY MANAGEMENT APPROACH ABM’s mission to make a difference, every person, every day, is evidenced in our approach to risk management and safety. Our programs are designed not only to ensure compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other regulatory bodies, but also to protect the health and welfare of our team members, clients, and client’s clients. The cornerstone of ABM’s comprehensive risk management and safety program is safety awareness to ensure our team members are: Trained in reporting Proficient in procedures to ensure emergency response Educated on how to Trained in hazard appropriate loss procedures to complete tasks safely identification mitigation techniques immediately address are implemented challenges should a loss occur Our ThinkSafe approach to safety includes establishing a safety mindset from day one of Team Members employment by focusing on ABM’s Safety Absolutes. This safety culture is continuously reinforced throughout the Team Members journey through daily Moments for Safety messages, monthly training topics, and unique programs and materials created for our Team Members; like safety playbooks, which contain specific information about how to prevent certain types of work place injuries, how to proactively address potentially catastrophic situation such as hurricanes or tornadoes, and refreshers on the ABM’s Safety Absolutes. One of the cornerstones of our ThinkSafe program is to partner with operations to provide leaders the ability to identify workplace hazards and implement changes to prevent an accident or injury. Through ABM’s “Frontline Leader Training”, leaders are guided as to how to create a culture of caring with Leadership Engagement Tours (LETs) and Safe Work Observations Program (SWOPs) participation to help ensure the health and welfare of our Team Members and clients. The Frontline Leader Training also provides guidance on what to do should a claim occur to ensure Team Members receive the right care at the right time to expediate their recovery. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 25 DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY Health and Safety Policy Safety at ABM starts with a strong partnership with Operations and a local presence. As such, the safety organization is comprised of Safety Managers embedded within our Industry Groups, though Safety does report centrally to the Vice President of Risk Management and Safety. This deployment of safety resources allows Safety Managers to create custom Industry Group solutions to safety challenges that arise out of Operations and to ensure all safety activities are aligned with ABM corporate goals and objectives. This approach allows the Risk & Safety group the ability to adapt our safety program to include client safety requirements and oversee the safety activities of subcontractors. Increasing Awareness ABM programs are designed to increase the safety acumen of our staff. We deliver tailored trainings to our Team Members based on their job requirements, hazards identified through site assessments, and OSHA and client mandated training topics. These topics are delivered through interaction with the Team Members Manager. They can be delivered via Moment for Safety messages in a pre-shift meeting, weekly safety briefings, and/or tailored safety programs for all service lines. These safety interactions are documented for regular safety audits and inspections, including on-site client reviews. The Results Safety programs for FY2019 produced the fourth consecutive year of claim frequency reductions. ABM’s continued attention to safety and aggressive claim management has sustained our Experience Mod Rating (EMR) of .98 and an OSHA Frequency rate of 3.08. For FY2019, ABM was issued four OSHA Citations of Serious and three Other than Serious General Regulatory. Corrective actions were implemented to address the issues outlined in the citations. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 26 DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY Health and Safety Metrics Case Classification Group Industry Super Region Claimant Days Away From Job Transfer or Other Recordable Grand Total Gender Work Restriction Cases Business & BNI Central Female 38 80 74 192 Industry Male 31 41 32 104 BNI Central Total 69 121 106 296 BNI GLNE Female 61 25 58 144 Male 58 14 46 118 BNI GLNE Total 119 39 104 262 BNI West Female 89 150 89 328 Male 68 114 78 260 BNI West Total 157 264 167 588 BNI PARKING Female 24 44 24 92 Male 42 53 44 139 BNI PARKING Total 66 97 68 231 Aviation AVI AIRSIDE WEST Female 12 48 6 66 Male 11 22 6 39 AVI AIRSIDE WEST Total 23 70 12 105 AVI AIRSIDE SOUTH Female 11 55 19 85 Male 6 33 21 60 AVI AIRSIDE SOUTH Total 17 88 40 145 AVI LANDSIDE Female 18 25 11 54 Male 22 20 8 50 AVI LANDSIDE Total 40 45 19 104 AVI AIRSIDE NORTH Female 38 12 17 67 Male 24 12 23 59 AVI AIRSIDE NORTH Total 62 24 40 126 Education EDU Northeast/Midwest Female 36 43 42 121 Male 31 45 38 114 EDU Northeast/Midwest 67 88 80 235 Total EDU West Female 24 28 27 79 Male 11 16 7 34 EDU West Total 35 44 34 113 EDU Southeast Female 33 61 34 128 Male 19 41 28 88 EDU Southeast Total 52 102 62 216 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 27 DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY Health and Safety Metrics Case Classification Group Industry Super Region Claimant Days Away From Job Transfer or Other Recordable Grand Total Gender Work Restriction Cases Technology & TCM West/PacNW Female 16 24 34 74 Manufacturing Male 14 17 14 45 TCM West/PacNW Total 30 41 48 119 TCM Southeast & IFS Female 16 26 8 50 Male 8 17 13 38 TCM Southeast & IFS Total 24 43 21 88 TCM Central Female 7 13 10 30 Male 3 9 9 21 TCM Central Total 10 22 19 51 TCM So West/MT & Nuclear Female 13 33 11 57 Male 6 10 4 20 TCM So West/MT & Nuclear 19 43 15 77 Total TCM Northeast Female 19 13 13 45 Male 13 8 11 32 TCM Northeast Total 32 21 24 77 Technical Solutions ABS Bldg Solutions (ABS) Female 2 1 3 US Male 8 5 5 18 ABS Bldg Solutions (ABS) 8 7 6 21 Total ABS Elec Power Sol (APS) Male 2 1 3 ABS Elec Power Sol (APS) 2 1 3 Total ABS Elec Sol (AESL) Male 1 1 2 ABS Elec Sol (AESL) Total 1 1 2 Healthcare Technology Male 1 1 Healthcare Technology Total 1 1 Corporate CSA CFO Summary Female 1 1 CSA CFO Summary Total 1 1 CSA Total HR Female 1 1 CSA Total HR Total 1 1 Grand Total 834 1,160 868 2,862 ABM UK values: ABM Aviation Aviation: HSE *RIDDOR Frequency rate per 100k hrs worked = 0.22 (hours RIDDOR Specified Injuries = 2 worked based on actual hours worked) RIDDOR + 7days absence = 16 Combined HSE *RIDDOR FR Rate per 100k hrs for the U.K. = 0.17 FS&TS: RIDDOR Category Breakdown – Incident No’s RIDDOR Specified Injuries = 2 RIDDOR + 7days absence = 9 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 28 DOING BUSINESS IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY OUR GIVE BACK APPROACH COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT [413] MANAGEMENT APPROACH LOCAL COMMUNITIES ABMCares Program ABMCares is ABM’s donation matching philanthropy Through ABMCares, the company was highly involved program for all staff and management team members. with youth and hunger elimination programs in 2019.

INCREASING OUR TEAM MEMBER ENGAGEMENT SV-PS-330A.3 ABMVoice Team Member Engagement – YourVoice Program At ABM, every voice matters. We completed for the first time the ABMVoice team member engagement survey as part of one of our 2020 vision goals, which was being able to implement changes that will improve our experience at the company. This engagement survey seeks to understand team members’ engagement with their teams, work, and the organization. Team members were asked to rate 25 items on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Overall, we found that ABM’s team members are highly engaged. To help ABM focus on our efforts to increase engagement, the data showed that if focused on our Drivers of Engagement, ABM can increase our engagement. We received more than 27,000 responses from our team members (60% of our team members with email and 17% of our service workers). As a result, we identified the following Drivers of Engagement (with favorability scores): 89% 81% 74% 69% 64% I understand how I believe ABM The senior The senior leaders of I see professional my job helps ABM will be successful leaders of ABM ABM value people as growth and career achieve success in the future demonstrate the most important development integrity part of the business opportunities Our Executive Leadership Team wanted the organization’s leaders, down to the region level, to focus on our lowest favorability scores. ABM senior leaders value people as the most important part of the business and seek out professional growth and career development opportunities for them. Partnering with Human Resources, regional leaders identified actions to take to improve engagement in these key areas. Our Back to the Floor Program Every year, ABM U.K. runs a month of “Back to the Floor” where we encourage our people to experience a day in the life of our frontline team members around the U.K. The Board of Directors leads the way, spending time with our colleagues and gaining a greater insight into their day to day duties and the challenges they face. This year, our team members were working with technical cleaning teams in server rooms, PRM and cleaning operatives at airports, engineers servicing HVAC units, and more. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 36 ENSURING OUR TEAM MEMBERS’ WELL-BEING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE IS OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE [405] DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITY MANAGEMENT APPROACH | [405-1] DIVERSITY OF GOVERNANCE BODIES AND TEAM MEMBERS | [405-2] RATIO OF BASIC SALARY AND REMUNERATION WOMEN TO MEN Equal Employment Opportunity At ABM, we believe that a diverse workforce is essential to success.

We are currently working on strengthening our environmental reporting processes and have increased the sites reporting and type of information we need. During the 2020 fiscal year, we plan to commit to the Science Based Targets (SBTs) initiative that consists on setting a carbon reduction target in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. Building on work done in previous years we will be setting these targets and setting a carbon reduction pathway with detailed actions. ABM’s overall carbon footprint increased by 1.44%. This can be explained by an increase in the use of natural gas and of the fuel consumption. On the other hand, we saw a slight decrease in the electricity consumption that can be explained by an increase in the procurement of renewable electricity at our U.K. sites.

Because of this, the company will renew its targets in the short term and plans to commit with the Science Based Target initiative. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 40 MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE [102-11] PRECAUTIONARY PRINCIPLE APPROACH | [102-15] KEY IMPACTS, RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES | [302] ENERGY MANAGEMENT APPROACH In addition to mitigating the effects of climate change, ABM continuously evaluates the risks and opportunities that climate change represents for us and for our clients. Potential climate change impacts are identified, assessed and managed as part of ABM’s enterprise risk review, which is reported to the Board of Directors. The company’s management and its Board of Directors continuously monitor the company’s risk profile, including with respect to climate-related risks. Risks Related to ClimateChange Policy, Regulations and Energy Prices Our operations are subject to various federal, state, and/or local laws regulating topics such as discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. As an example, ABM U.K. is subject to the climate change levy that requires the company to report its GHG emissions. Also, some of ABM’s energy efficiency projects are subject to federal and state legislation and policies that support those kinds of projects. Ineffective compliance with current laws and regulations could impact our reputation or generate financial fines that could increase the costs and potential liabilities associated with the conduct of our operations. To ensure compliance, we maintain an environmental policy that provides guidelines on discharge into soil, water,and air, and the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous substances. Technology Peers implementing the latest cleaning and technical solutions related technologies can impact our contract retention and revenues. To manage this risk, ABM’s Strategy department is constantly looking at the latest innovation trends to ensure we provide to our clients the best technology available in the market. Also, regarding our own operations, we have designed a roadmap to increase the electrification of our fleet. Market Clients have expressed an increased interest for sustainability-related services that could help them to improve their sustainability performance, including reduction of energy consumption and waste generation. Inability to provide such services could impact our client retention rates. To manage this risk, ABM has put in place its GreenCare portfolio of sustainable solutions to help clients reach their green cleaning, zero waste, and carbon neutrality goals. Physical Adverse weather conditions can lead to reduced travel activity and might impact service delivery at some of our client’s locations that can generate increased operational costs. To manage this risk, ABM has designed contingency plans, business continuity plans, crisis management procedures, and disaster recovery procedures. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 41 MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT Opportunities Related to Climate Change Development and/or Expansion of Low Emissions Services and Products An increase of clean energy and climate change-related regulations and incentives like rebates could generate an increase of demand of our sustainable services as they contribute to reduce our clients’ environmental footprint. Also, as many of our clients are more actively managing their climate change risks, we may see increased demand for our lower emissions products and services. Many more companies are responding to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and making commitments to the Science Based Targets. ABM has worked hard to be up to date on the latest sustainability trends and client industry regulations to ensure that the company can identify the right opportunities and generate added value through our portfolio of sustainable services. Through our GreenCare program, we have the greatest opportunity to help our clients reduce their environmental footprint with solutions like green cleaning services, energy efficiency services, on-site renewable energy generation, installation of EV chargers and sustainable parking solutions among others. Physical Although weather conditions may lead to increase costs as described above, some weather events might create opportunities for increased services related to clean up and restoration; severe weather situations can also impact our operations in the affected areas related to our offices and our clients’ locations. This could lead to an increase of our tag work and therefore impact positively our sales. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 42 MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT GREENING OUR FLEET As a company that provides transportation services and operates a significant fleet, we are conscious of the environmental footprint that these sources of emissions generate. This is why we are engaged in measuring and reporting the emissions coming from our fleet of 3,400 vehicles comprising of light, medium and heavy trucks, minivans, passenger cars, forklifts and trailers among others. We have started to make a transition to more sustainable fuels or vehicles including hybrids and electric vehicles. We are currently developing a roadmap and public commitment to implement a transition to a more sustainable fleet. So far, we have evaluated the vehicles eligible for transition based on available market options. As the market evolves, we expect to continue the transition with more of our vehicles. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 43 MANAGING OUR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT WHAT WE ARE DOING TO REDUCE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT [302-4] REDUCTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION At ABM we are committed to reduce the climate change impact of our operations and we are currently working on aligning our reduction efforts with climate science based on the COP 21 agreement that intends to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2° C or 1.5° C if possible. While we work on setting a Science Based Target, we still have an ongoing commitment to reduce our metric tons of CO2e per FTE equivalent by 15% from our 2011 base year. It is our aim to bring consistency between our goal of supporting our clients in their transition to a low-carbon/net-zero economy and the way we manage our own business operations to reduce our environmental footprint. We acknowledge the importance of being proactive as a leader of our industry and to set up strategies to reduce our carbon footprint. In the short term, we plan to publicly launch our Science Based Targets commitment and we will be joining the widely adopted best practices to increase the electrification of our fleet. Also, we will be developing a renewable energy procurement strategy for the sites we can directly control and scaling to other offices our waste management pilot that includes proper separation of waste and composting at our main offices. Some of the measures we have implemented so far are: • Office consolidations: some of ABM’s offices are being consolidated and therefore we have substantially reduced duplicated heating and cooling, use of electrical devices, and lighting requirements. • Renewable energy procurement: The majority of our offices in the U.K. purchase renewable electricity considerably reducing their carbon emissions. • Real Estate development: when opening new offices and upgrading current ones, we always seek for opening planning when possible to reduce the amount of construction and overall footprint by not having to provide HVAC to a multitude of spaces, increase the amount of daylight and reduce electricity demand. 2019 CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 44 TECHNICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REPORT TECHNICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE REPORT [102-48] RESTATEMENT OF INFORMATION GHG emissions measure process [102-49] SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS None [102-55] GRI CONTENT INDEX TABLE | [102-56] EXTERNAL ASSURANCE LETTER Technical information related to environmental footprint calculations: Sustainable Procurement Metric from Diversey Calculations were based on ABM 2019 product purchases analyzed.

ABM’s Carbon Footprint The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) and relevant tools were used in these calculations. Data of natural gas use in leased offices was gathered through our annual survey. Office locations in which the utilities are included in common area maintenance (CAM) were estimated based upon similarity to other known offices of that size and region of the country. Fleet data of gallons of fuel used by vehicle and by model year were analyzed. Fuel purchases not directly assigned to a specific vehicle were calculated as a Light-Duty Vehicle (small truck/van) as that is our primary vehicle type within the ABM fleet. Actual data was gathered through our online survey when available. For offices that did not have readily available data or the electricity is included within CAM charges, estimations were made based upon similar sized offices of the same region or previous year data (if available). Scope 1 Data of natural gas use in leased offices was gathered through a survey. Offices in which the utilities are included in CAM were estimated based upon similarity to other known offices of that size and region of the country.
