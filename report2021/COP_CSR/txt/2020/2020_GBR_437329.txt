Since our last submission, Greenstone has become a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) and a supporter of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In 2019 we also committed to setting a Science-Based Target (SBT), demonstrating our dedication to reducing our carbon footprint. This year we are also taking part in the United Nations Global Compact’s Young Sustainable Development Goal Innovators Programme (YSIP) to develop innovative solutions to help both Greenstone and our clients meet their SDG targets. With this Communication on Progress, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects, which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations. We support public accountability and transparency and we are committed to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Yours sincerely, Matthew de Villiers Chief Executive Officer Page 3 of 14 Our commitment to UNGC Principles At Greenstone, we provide software and services that enable our clients to advance their sustainability strategies and become responsible businesses. Through our sustainability software and services, we enable our clients to collect, manage, analyse and report the data required to fulfil their non-financial, environment, health, and safety (EHS), corporate social responsibility (CSR), environmental, social, and governance (ESG), risk and compliance and supply chain reporting requirements. We actively use and promote the UN Global Compact Principles as a standard for our clients and are dedicated to improving the transparency of corporate reporting in the 4 key areas of Human Rights, Labour, Environment and Anti-bribery and Corruption. We also promote engagement with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) across our client base and in our software solutions. Sustainability software – enabling responsible business Through our Enterprise software, we enable organisations to measure, understand and communicate their environmental, frameworks and health & safety performance and impacts. Reporting on sustainability provides transparency to consumers, employees, investors and other stakeholders. It also enables organisations to reduce their environmental footprint, achieve their sustainability goals and become a responsible business. Greenstone is an easy-to-use, secure, software solution used by various organisations to support the collection, management, analysis, and reporting of non-financial data. The user-friendly platform includes Environment, Frameworks, and Health & Safety modules to provide organisations with a complete picture of their sustainability performance, better quality data, and increased confidence in their reporting. Supply chain software – enabling responsible supply chains Through our SupplierPortal software, we are helping our clients to improve transparency across their supply chains. SupplierPortal is an online platform for suppliers and their buyers to track and monitor environmental, labour, health & safety and anti-bribery & corruption information. Using a series of questionnaires, suppliers are able to disclose information about their policies, compliance and procedures that they have in place. This helps buying organisations to get a better understanding of the companies they work with across their supply chain to help them make informed business decisions. Investor ESG software – enabling responsible investing Incorporating ESG performance into investment decisions and portfolio management strategies is becoming increasingly intrinsic to investor decision making. However, although responsible investment and ESG reporting is increasingly being considered, investors are faced with many challenges when it comes to gathering, maintaining and analysing ESG data. Greenstone has developed InvestorPortal as a solution to address this challenge. Through our InvestorPortal software, we enable the collection, management and analysis of customisable ESG data across investments, portfolios and funds. This allows investors to better Page 4 of 14 understand and monitor the ESG performance of their portfolios, helping them make betterinformed investment decisions. The platform is also integrated with the SDGs and the TCFD’s recommendations, which helps investors track their progress, accurately manage climate-related risks and opportunities and assess the impact of their investments. Page 5 of 14 Materiality assessment With the wide range of sustainability topics organisations can report on, assessing which aspects are most material enables Greenstone to focus our reporting. Both internal and external factors are used to determine ‘materiality’ involving organisational stakeholders such as customers or company investors. Materiality is a key part of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting framework. As a member of the GRI GOLD Community we aim to align Greenstone’s Communication on Progress (COP) with the GRI Standards and disclosure aspects. In 2016 we undertook a materiality assessment to determine our key stakeholders: our investors, clients, employees and partners. In our 2020 report we continue to report based on these material aspects. In defining our material aspects we considered the following factors:  Greenstone’s estimated main sustainability impacts  Topics and future challenges highlighted on a sector-wide level  Relevant laws, regulations and international or voluntary agreements  Greenstone’s key organisational values and policies  Expectations or interests of our stakeholders  Significant organisational risks for Greenstone as an SME  Organisational core competencies The assessment of materiality yielded five key areas which were most material to Greenstone and we believe should be reported against and linked to the UNGC Principles. These continue to be included in our 2020 COP submission across Human Rights, Labour, Environment, and Anti-Bribery and Corruption. In 2020 we will be carrying out an updated materiality assessment, which will be used to form next year’s Communication on Progress. As part of this materiality assessment, we will review our SDG actions. Page 6 of 14 Sustainable Development Goals We acknowledge the importance of advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and have identified five of the Sustainable Development Goals where we are committed to catalysing action. SDG 3 Good Health & Well being As tenants of the Crown Estate we are offered free weekly health activities including yoga and mindfulness. We have a roof allotment which employees maintain. Employee wellbeing is an agenda item on our annual team building event. SDG 5 Gender Equality We value our diverse workforce. Our recruitment process allows fair and equal access to employment opportunities. Any acts of gender discrimination will be addressed through existing codes of conduct. We aid our clients to capture CSR metrics which help address gender equality within the workforce. SDG 9 Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure Providing software and advisory services to clients with large commercial assets and infrastructure enabling them to measure and monitor their non-financial data. In this demanding and constantly evolving context – Greenstone provides innovate solutions to enable our clients meet their goals and obligations. SDG 12 Responsible Consumption & Production We encourage responsible consumption within our office and are constantly looking for ways to reduce our plastic and paper use in particular. We are also very focused on mitigating our business travel through modal shift and alternatives such as online conferencing. SDG 13 Climate Action We are all sustainability professionals who are passionate about promoting positive climate change and environmental awareness. Greenstone has been selected to take part in the United Nations Young SDG Innovators Program (YSIP) for 2019 -2020. This ten-month accelerator programme activates future business leaders and change-makers to develop and drive innovative solutions through new technologies, initiatives, and business models and deliver on their company’s sustainability objectives. Page 7 of 14 Human Rights As an employer, Greenstone is committed to providing employees all basic Human Rights guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UN Global Compact Principles. Actions All new and current staff are reminded of the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact and are aware of the commitment Greenstone has made to these principles. Any and all updates in legislation are communicated to employees in a timely manner through education and awareness training. Forthcoming Plans By committing to Principle 2 of the UN Global Compact, Greenstone will strive to ensure we are not complicit in human rights abuses connected with our supply chain. We will therefore, where possible, further strengthen our supplier assessment mechanisms with regards to human rights aspects. Measurement of outcomes Since its inception, Greenstone has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving human rights violations. Due to the scope of our activities and number of employees (19) in our organisation, an external audit on human rights performance is not required. Page 8 of 14 Labour Greenstone’s policies and procedures, including our Health and Safety policy, employment contracts, and non-discrimination policies, comply with both UK and EU employment legislation to ensure that our staff are treated fairly and without discrimination. Equality & Diversity Policy Greenstone has a written equal opportunity policy that complies with its statutory obligations under the Race Relations Act 1976, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, the Equality Act 2006 and the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007. As a team, we have a zero tolerance policy for all forms of forced and compulsory labour both within Greenstone and within our clients and suppliers. We also do not tolerate any form of child labour or discriminatory practices. Measurement of outcomes The rights of all employees are continuously reviewed to ensure that the Greenstone team are happy in their work environment and that they are fulfilled and motivated by their work. We encourage a workplace approach designed to ensure that employees are committed to the organisation’s goals and values, motivated to contribute to organisational success, and are able at the same time to enhance their own sense of wellbeing. Where necessary, we take external advice to ensure that we enforce Labour principles compliant with the Global Compact position. We have never had a breach or complaint about unfair treatment since the Company formation in 2006. Page 9 of 14 Environment Greenstone is committed to acting responsibly and adopting best practice to minimise our environmental impact. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our environmental performance, as part of our overall goal of implementing the principles of sustainable development in all areas of our work. Our aim is to ensure that environmental objectives are integrated into relevant business objectives in a cost-effective manner. Greenstone is continually improving its environmental targets and plans. Our sustainability policy and ongoing goals include:  Comply with all relevant environmental legislation and approved codes of practice in force, co-operating fully with the appropriate regulatory authorities;  Foster an understanding of the environmental issues arising from our business activities among our employees, suppliers, contractors, customers and the local community.  Set out environmental targets for significant activities, and carry out regular environmental audits of these Greenstone activities. Measurement of outcomes We continuously measure and manage our environmental performance (including energy, waste and recycling) using our Enterprise software. We also report our environmental performance publicly on an annual basis to our customers via our SupplierPortal solution. The Greenstone and Barclays collaboration to develop a new software solution to facilitate the monitoring and reporting of initiatives to reduce environmental impacts, was recognised as the 2018 Sustainability Product of the Year. The Initiatives Savings Module (ISM) facilitates the monitoring and reporting of initiatives to reduce environmental impacts across energy, water, waste and paper. It enables organisations to define targets, analyse how projects are contributing towards them and identify projects that could provide CO2e and consumption savings. It can also be used to enable Monitoring and Verification (M&V) calculations to assess actual project savings. Page 10 of 14 Greenstone’s Carbon Footprint As part of Greenstone’s commitment to evaluating our environmental performance, our carbon footprint is calculated across all relevant scopes. Our 2018/19 footprint was 79 tCO₂e. This includes emissions associated with electricity use, business travel, and waste. Our carbon footprint is calculated in Greenstone’s Enterprise software for the period 1st April 201831st March 2019. Overall emissions have increased, which can be accounted for by an increase in FTE and nonoperational emissions associated with flights taken for overseas business expansion. Rail continues to be the single means of travel for client meetings. Total Breakdown of tCO2e by Type Type tCO2e % Energy 10.3 15.4 Supply Chain 3.63 5.45 Transport 52.7 78.9 Waste 0.147 0.221 Total: 66.7 100 Total Breakdown of tCO2e by Scope Energy Type tCO2e % Scope 2 9.49 14.2 Scope 3 56.4 84.6 Scope 3 Transmission 0.809 1.21 Total: 11.8 100 Page 11 of 14 Breakdown by Transport Type Transport Type tCO2e % Air Business 41.8 79.3 Rail Business 0.257 0.488 Rail Commuter 8.81 16.7 Road Commuter 1.83 3.48 Total: 52.7 100 Breakdown by Waste Type Waste Material Type tCO2e % Dry Mixed Recyclables 0.012 8.21 General Waste (non-recyclable) 0.014 9.62 Glass (Mixed) 0.121 82.20 Total: 0.147 100 This reporting period, Scope 3 Emissions have increased significantly compared to the previous year due to non-operational travel taken for essential business trips associated with Greenstone’s expansion in other global markets. This is a concern for Greenstone, however it is considered an interim period of unavoidable emissions linked to establishing new offices and partnerships in other continents. Once established, Greenstone will be able to extend its software and services to a wider number of clients in these markets through locally based teams managed remotely through teleconferencing and significantly reduced travel. On an ongoing basis we will continue to monitor and reduce our operational related emissions where possible. Our Scope 2 emissions are derived from 100% renewable power supply, and electricity and waste reduction initiatives are tracked in our initiative savings module. Page 12 of 14 * Greenstone’s carbon footprint was calculated using Defra 2018 (1st April – 31st Dec 2018) and Defra 2019 (1st Jan – 31st Mar 2019). Scope 2 emissions relate to electricity usage within our main office facility in Regent Street, London. Emissions from external data hosting activity by our tier 1 partner Rackspace have not been included. Data for waste has been estimated across this period based on 2019 data. Data for March electricity has been estimated. Rail and commuter travel as well as data centre data has been estimated based on previous submission data Page 13 of 14 Anti-bribery & corruption Greenstone is committed to operating responsibly wherever we work in the world and to engage with our stakeholders to manage the social, environmental and ethical impact of our activities in the different markets in which we operate. Greenstone does not engage in bribery or any form of unethical inducement or payment including facilitation payments and ‘kickbacks.’ All employees are required to avoid any activities that might lead to, or suggest, a conflict of interest with the business of the Company. We do not make direct or indirect contributions to political parties. Measurement of outcomes The Greenstone Management Team regularly reviews the implementation of this policy in respect of its suitability, adequacy and effectiveness and makes improvements as appropriate. It periodically reports the results of this process to the Greenstone Board, who makes an independent assessment of the adequacy of the policy and discloses any material non-compliance. Greenstone has established feedback mechanisms in order to maintain accurate records which properly and fairly document all financial transactions. Internal control systems are subject to annual audits to provide assurance that they are effective in countering bribery and corruption. Page 14 of 14
