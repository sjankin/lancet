Covering the period from 14 November 2019 to 12 November 2020, this fifth annual Communication on Progress outlines steps taken by CourtHeath to integrate the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to transparency in sharing this information with our stakeholders through our primary communication channels. CourtHeath is a small consulting firm based in Melbourne, Australia. Our business provides probity and procurement advice and associated services to government departments and agencies, local government and not-for-profit organisations. We uphold the principles of the UN Global Compact in our own small-scale operations and have enshrined these principles in our business processes. However, we anticipate that our greatest impact will be our ability to influence the practices and purchasing approaches of public sector agencies, so that government behaviour upholds the Global Compact’s principles. This is likely to be primarily in the areas of: • anti-corruption training, awareness raising (integrity, anti-corruption, whistle-blower protections, etc), upholding labour rights in the supply chain (through our procurement work and particularly through government Social Procurement initiatives which also address human rights and environmental sustainability). CourtHeath supports human rights initiatives relevant to our sphere of operation including workplace diversity and gender equity (including family violence leave and gender pay equity objectives). We also support clients that promote environmental initiatives in Victoria. In 2016 we commenced this journey, establishing our presence in the Victorian public sector as a Global Compact participant and an ethical and values-based organisation. We developed a website giving prominence to the UN Global Compact. Having been appointed to panels providing us access to government probity and procurement business, we are able to raise awareness of the UN Global Compact principles with government purchasers and policy makers. During 2020, CourtHeath was pleased to observe public sector departments and agencies in Victoria, Australia continuing to implement the government’s Social Procurement Framework effective from 1 September 2018 and has joined a Roundtable to improve its efficacy. The social procurement framework objectives span ten areas: 1. Opportunities for Victorian Aboriginal People 2. Opportunities for Victorians with disability 3. Women’s equality and safety 4. Opportunities for disadvantaged Victorians 5. Supporting safe and fair workplaces 6. Sustainable Victorian social enterprise 7. Sustainable Victorian regions 8. Environmentally sustainable outputs 9. Environmentally sustainable business practices 10. Implementation of the Climate Change Policy Objectives.

HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. 1.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS CourtHeath is committed to respecting human rights in its work. Despite being a small consulting organisation, which does not have direct experience of human rights violations, we aim to encourage government agencies to engage in ethical purchasing and effective social procurement. This approach emphasises propriety in allocating public funds to further human rights, the creation of positive and sustainable social externalities, and the mitigation of inequality through empowerment of disadvantaged communities. More broadly, we endorse the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and aim to incorporate its standards in our policy and practice. Through rigorous due diligence, we pledge to avoid infringing the rights of others, and to take steps to avoid negative human rights impacts resulting from our work. We will adhere to international human rights standards in our activities and our relationships. This includes taking steps towards respect, protection and fulfilment for such rights as freedom of association and collective bargaining; the effective elimination of child labour and modern slavery; the elimination of all forms of racial and gender discrimination; and the realisation of a workplace which positively empowers its employees and people of the broader world without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, physical ability, or mental illness. Beyond these basic commitments, we intend to implement measures, which positively contribute to the realisation of human rights, in particular through the creation of a diverse, inclusive and accessible workplace. We believe this pledge places us in line with best-practice international standards regarding human rights. Among the human rights risks in the government procurement sector in which our clients operate are discrimination against disadvantaged groups based on gender, disability, race or ethnicity. Our specific human rights goals are to achieve improved effectiveness of ethical procurement as measured by purchasing agencies including effective tendering provisions. Our participation in the University of Melbourne Social Procurement Roundtable conducted by the Melbourne School of Government that commenced in October 2020 will further this goal. Other attendees include: academics, state and local government, contractors, social benefit suppliers and social enterprise representatives. This supplements a program to evaluate the effectiveness of social procurement and explore opportunities to further improve government policy and practice. “Our specific human rights goals are to achieve improved effectiveness of ethical procurement as measured by purchasing agencies including effective tendering provisions.” Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 4 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 5 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx 1.2. IMPLEMENTATION We have offered all staff practical ethics training provided by the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which has raised staff awareness of human rights risks in procurement supply chain management. We have also trained CourtHeath staff about the Global Compact and its Ten Principles. CourtHeath has articulated responsibilities to respect, protect and fulfil human rights in the Our People policy. The Managing Director, ensuring strong leadership on human rights issues within the company, oversees this policy personally. We have promoted the Victorian government’s Social Procurement Framework, assisting clients to tailor their tender schedules to elicit responses from tenderers that will facilitate involvement in projects of disadvantaged Victorians. 1.3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES This is our fifth year as a member of the UN Global Compact. We have a diverse staff whose needs we strive to accommodate, providing employment for: • Victorians with disability 1,950 hours annually • Victorian Aboriginal people 1,150 hours annually. We have contributed to social justice initiatives globally via our various communication channels. We have a publicly available complaints policy to ensure accountability for human rights issues within our small company and would deal with alleged human rights issues through this confidential mechanism in accordance with Our People and Culture policy. From our complaints policy: CourtHeath Consulting encourages a workplace with appropriate, ethical conduct, and recognises the right for complaints to be made about the conduct of our people, including employees and contractors. CourtHeath Consulting will take all reasonable steps to protect those involved in a complaint from any victimisation, as a result of such a complaint. Complaints will be managed confidentially, discreetly and courteously, and all records pertaining to complaints will be held in confidence. This Policy applies to CourtHeath Consulting personnel as well as clients and members of the public who make complaints relating to CourtHeath Consulting or to CourtHeath Consulting personnel. Our Reconciliation Action Plan states: At CourtHeath, our vision for reconciliation is to support and provide opportunities for the First Peoples of Australia. As employers, suppliers and consumers we have a tripartite role to promote reconciliation and self-determination for the Aboriginal community, in a culturally sensitive and safe manner. We recognise that our business is small, but we lead by example and embrace and celebrate Aboriginal people, influencing others to do the same. One of our Principal Consultants is an Aboriginal woman who is committed to learn more about her culture and help us to do the same.

LABOUR PRINCIPLES Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 2.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS In keeping with the pursuit of equitable, transparent and accountable government and corporate institutions, CourtHeath recognises the importance of collective and individual labour rights. We affirm our commitment to the International Labour Organisation’s Core Conventions, especially to the freedoms of association and collective bargaining and freedom from all forms of employment discrimination. Our work aims to promote ethical sourcing and procurement, working towards the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour, as well as the effective abolition of child labour. We have a diverse staff whose needs we strive to accommodate. We embrace flexible working hours and working from home, where this is the choice of the staff member in question. We are committed to providing compensation and benefits for employees, for instance in the case of workplace injuries. Our policy encourages adherence to the UN Global Compact labour principles from our business partners and suppliers. CourtHeath staff members have participated in committees advocating inclusion, for example digital accessibility for people with a disability and diversity in the legal profession. 2.2. IMPLEMENTATION We have offered all staff practical ethics training provided by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, which has raised staff awareness of labour rights risks in procurement supply chain management. We have also trained CourtHeath staff about the Global Compact and its Ten Principles. Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 8 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx 2.3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES CourtHeath is a small consulting organisation which has had no reported incidents of labour rights violations. Our awareness raising activities relevant to this area have included publishing the following blogs: • Everyone can #dosomething: Vic Gov Suppliers SPF On International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, we discussed how Victoria’s social procurement framework encouraged government suppliers in Victoria to #dosomething to address gender inequality, particularly in relation to women’s equality and safety. https://www.courtheath.com.au/everyone-can-dosomething-vicgovsuppliers-spf/ (Image: UN Women) • Generation Equality: IWD 2020 and 10 years of WEP As part of International Women’s Day 2020, we discussed the importance of Generation Equality and its principles that offer guidance to organisations on how to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the workplace, marketplace and community. https://www.courtheath.com.au/generation-equality-iwd-2020-and-10-years-of-wep/ (Image: Used under licence from shutterstock.com) Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 9 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx 3. ENVIRONMENT PRINCIPLES Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 3.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS CourtHeath has a publicly available environmental policy outlining its commitment and approach to environmental sustainability. This Policy can be accessed through our website at www.courtheath.com.au. We are committed to improving environmental performance across all of our business activities, and encourage our business partners and members of the wider community to share that commitment. We practice sustainable procurement, purchasing goods and services that are less damaging to the environment and human health. As a small business, the major items we purchase (other than during the extensive 2020 COVID-19 lockdown periods when all staff have been required by law to work from home) are commuter transport services, stationery and power. In its professional advisory services, CourtHeath has made a commitment to promote environmental sustainability. Where appropriate, we seek to educate and influence others (clients, community and subcontractors). We are mindful of the opportunities that government purchasers have to set behavioural expectations of suppliers and the supply chain. This opportunity often arises in our procurement advice and particularly as we are drafting market invitation documents. We work with our clients to ensure that the specifications they publish reflect current best practice and identify suitable alternatives (both goods and services) which are environmentally friendly such as energy saving, recycled content, water saving, low toxicity or other significant attributes. We can direct clients to the full range of activities related to purchasing goods and services ranging from contracting for an entire service to purchasing small assets such as office equipment. Green purchasing spans the entire life cycle of the product or service from inception and design through to contract management and disposal of any redundant assets. 3.2. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES We aim to use the following criteria to measure our progress on environmental sustainability goals: • Ensuring that our office equipment and stationery (including lighting and paper products) are sourced sustainably • Ensuring that suppliers (such as website hosting providers and office providers) meet sustainability standards relevant to their various operations • Ensuring that our transport arrangements are sustainable where possible. Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 10 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx Our awareness raising activities relevant to this area included a major commitment to fighting climate change: TAKE2 is Victoria’s collective climate change program supporting individuals, government, business and other organisations to help the state achieve net zero emissions by 2050. (Source) CourtHeath took the TAKE2 pledge in 2018, making a public commitment to tackle climate change as stated on our TAKE2 profile page. Our pledge in part is to “improve our environmental performance across all our business activities, and encourage our business partners and members of the wider community to do the same. We practice sustainable procurement, purchasing goods and services that are less damaging to the environment and human health.” Our awareness raising activities around the Environmental principle included publishing the following blog: • Road to Recovery On Monday, 10 August 2020 we reported on a letter to Prime Minister Scott Morrison issued by the Global Compact Network Australia. Signed by 48 of its members including CourtHeath, the letter called for the Government to use the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals as a framework to create “a socially just and green recovery” as it plans Australia’s recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. https://www.courtheath.com.au/road-to-recovery/ • UN Global Compact’s Leaders Summit In this blog we offered an overview of the Global Compact’s 20th Anniversary Leaders Summit, which was held online due to the global pandemic. The event addressed the private sector’s response to three global, interconnected crises – health, inequality and climate change. https://www.courtheath.com.au/climate-change-reponse-key-to-tender-success/ (Image: Used under licence from shutterstock.com) Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 11 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx 3.3. IMPLEMENTATION We communicate our own environmental practices and achievements to our customers with a view to encouraging environmental impact considerations in procurement activities. Initiatives undertaken by our organisation in reducing our environmental impact include: • We use low energy LED lights to reduce electricity and corresponding greenhouse emissions. • We use recycled paper products where possible. We recycle paper and printer cartridges. We dispose of our e-waste including redundant equipment through recycling depots. We print double-sided to save paper. • We have purchased re-useable “keep cups” for our staff and encourage their use as well as the re-use of coffee trays. • We have retained the services of a secure document destruction service provider that practices recycling. • Our web host was chosen for their environmental credentials, supporting eco-friendly business and donating to the ‘Plant a Billion Trees’ initiative through its carbon offset program. In 2013/2014 Crucial offset its entire year of carbon emissions by sponsoring the Tasmanian Native Forest Protection project “Climate Friendly”. This project sponsors jobs for Australian workers and assists with the protection of large tracts of land and wildlife. Our web host, Crucial, supports “Climate Friendly”. This project sponsors jobs for Australian workers and assists with the protection of large tracts of land and wildlife.

ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 4.1. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS It is CourtHeath’s policy to pursue all its business transactions in an honest and ethical manner. In doing business anywhere in the world, neither CourtHeath nor any person associated with it may offer, pay, promise, authorise or receive any bribe, kickback or illicit payment. CourtHeath has a zero-tolerance policy for corruption, bribery and extortion. We actively promote awareness about anti-corruption practices amongst our public sector clients. Our goals over the next year are to continue to provide education for all staff and relevant clients about corruption, as well as what to do if one should encounter it. 4.2. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES CourtHeath aims to make measurable progress according to the following criteria: • Participation in anti-corruption dialogues and events • Raising awareness of corruption and probity issues through training, social media and stakeholder engagement • Assisting clients to achieve transparent and accountable probity processes. Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 13 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx 4.3 IMPLEMENTATION We have contributed to the local and global conversation around anti-corruption initiatives, including publishing the following blogs: • Corruption begets more corruption: IACD19 To mark International Anti-Corruption Day in December 2019, we attended and reported on the 2019 Australian Dialogue on Bribery and Corruption event, which was presented in Melbourne by the United Nations’ Global Compact Network Australia. Two key themes emerged at the event: • The need for transparency, accountability and integrity as part of anti-bribery and corruption compliance, and • The role corporate leadership ABC compliance and corporate culture. http://www.courtheath.com.au/corruption-begets-more-corruption-iacs19/ • Spotlight on how to help prevent corruption and misconduct We reported on a new public inquiry launched by the Integrity and Oversight Committee of the Victorian Parliament to examine how Victoria’s integrity agencies were combatting the impacts of corruption and misconduct in the state’s public sector. Of particular interest was how Victoria’s integrity agencies educated the Victorian public sector and community about the consequences of corruption and misconduct, how risks could be reduced, and how the agencies could respond. http://www.courtheath.com.au/spotlight-on-how-to-help-prevent-corruption-and-misconduct/ • Personnel screening for VPS consultants and staff On 24 August 2020 we offered an overview of the report issued by the Victorian Auditor General’s Office about pre-employment checks for consultants, contractors and Public Service employees to further strengthen anti-corruption practices across the public sector. Consistent with that initiative, we introduced for our own business and promoted to our clients a personnel screening methodology consistent with the Australian Standard to verify the identity, integrity and credentials of personnel that are entrusted with resources, information or other assets. http://www.courtheath.com.au/spotlight-on-how-to-help-prevent-corruption-and-misconduct/ Pixel Perfect Pty Ltd trading as CourtHeath Consulting ABN 15 006 514 209 Page 14 of 16 CourtHeath UNGC Communication on Progress 2020_FINAL.docx During the COVID-19 pandemic, we published several blogs discussing the unprecedented circumstances faced with managing important anti-corruption issues such as conflicts of interest and legally binding document management while working from home during lockdown. Blogs included Ensuring Tender Probity During a Pandemic, and Signing Procurement Forms During Lock Down.
