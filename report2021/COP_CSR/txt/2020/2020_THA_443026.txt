Farmer Development event Thai Wah also provided support for an event “Cassava Mosaic Virus Prevention and Eradication Day”, organized by Pimai District Agricultural Extension Office (Nakhon Ratchasima province), by dispatching cassava disease experts, providing gifts to the participants, and using agricultural drone to spray non-chemical substance to prevent whiteflies, which are major vectors of cassava mosaic disease. Cassava Mosaic Virus campaign to provide farmers Thai Wah took part in a campaign to provide farmers with knowledge on control of and prevention against spread of cassava mosaic disease, organized by Kalasin Provincial Agricultural Extension Office. บริษัท ไทยวา จำ�กัด (มหาชน) 33 THAI WAH PUBLIC COMPANY LIMITED Thai Wah multiplication program Greenhouse farming project for urgent production of cassava seedlings has been implemented to tackle the spread of cassava mosaic disease in Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia, which has occurred since 2018, resulting in the inadequacy of disease-free seedlings for cultivation. Thai Wah, in collaboration with Tapioca Development Foundation, implemented the project to provide our farmer-members, with technology and knowhow for urgent production of cassava seedlings. In 2019, the Company built three greenhouses for the first time in Rayong province for research and Farmer Development development of new seedlings. The aim is to produce disease-free seedlings of waxy cassava, or any other varieties that withstand the disease, to be distributed to the farmers for cultivation. It is expected that seedling production starts in the early part of 2020. We also have a plan to build three more greenhouses in Nakhon Ratchasima, Udon Thani, and Tak provinces, where the Company’s plants are located. Research and development In 2020, Thai Wah plans to increase disease-free seedling production and will work with the Tapioca Development Foundation in developing and breeding a new variety of waxy cassava. The agronomic characters of the new variety, which are higher yields and higher quality, will contribute to the overall increase of cassava value. The project is in line with the Company’s strategy to promote Thailand’s role at the global level of the cassava industry to increase A specific trait of the waxy variety is identified more economical and export value of Thai cassava. as waxy starch, which could be used in several industrial applications that require high starch paste stability.
