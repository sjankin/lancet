We continue to exercise and disseminate our core values across the global market-place, and strive to imbue them, and the values of the Global Compact, into the commercial DNA of our colleagues, suppliers and customers. There continues to be interest, acceptance and support from stakeholders in what we are trying to achieve, and the way we are going about it. All that we strive to achieve both individually and as a company, is underpinned by our core values. These were shaped and validated by managers during their Company Conference in January 2019, and republished and disseminated, both verbally and in writing, in February 2019 and subsequently again in Feb’20. We aim to show continual improvement, not only in our performance, but also in our management of our Quality Management System (QMS) and our environmental and health and safety processes. In the last year, we have re-validated our ISO9001:2015 & GRS Certification. The Global Compact, Global Recycled Standard Certification and our membership of the Textile Exchange have helped us to achieve year on year business management improvements to our operating procedures. It has also resulted in a more focussed approach to managing our suppliers and resources, which in turn has helped us to deliver better and more efficient food supply solutions across our business.

The four core values are: Honesty and Integrity; being a Reliable Partner, Teamwork and Individual Responsibility; and, Adapting to Change. Research demonstrates that having a strong culture and shared values will enhance our reputation and help us to attract and retain talented individuals who exhibit elevated levels of employee satisfaction and motivation. Value implementation is encouraged and monitored using surveys, communication bulletins and personal feedback. We commission annual staff survey, which includes a questionnaire that covers several tailored questions on induction, training, development, and communication, as well as many other aspects of staff duties. We encourage all staff to participate in the survey to tell us how they feel; it does not matter how long they have worked for us, or where they work, or what role they fill – all views are equally valid and appreciated.

The commercial, technical and product development teams work together with our suppliers to eliminate packaging waste and to reduce overall packaging consumption. Our 6 packaging waste is monitored and recycled as far as possible. We also strongly encourage staff to minimise office waste, recycle and adopt more sustainable office practices; Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.
