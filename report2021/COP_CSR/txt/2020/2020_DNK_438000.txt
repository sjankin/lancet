Vessel value risks Changes in vessel values have a significant impact on the value With a prudent capital structure, NORDEN is continuously focusing on how to allocate capital to optimise the risk-adjusted of the Group, both directly on the value of the owned fleet and return on vessels. indirectly through the value of purchase options. OTHER RISK FACTORS Bunker price risk The Group’s largest variable cost is fuel in the form of bunkers. The Group uses bunker swaps to hedge future consumption of bunkers when entering into COAs in case there is no bunker When entering into cargo contracts at a fixed price, earnings from adjustment clause in the agreement. Based on a new bunker risk framework implemented towards year-end, NORDEN such contracts are very dependent on changes in the bunker price. now hedges its entire direct bunker price exposure including the price risk related to redelivery of bunker. However, the Furthermore, in connection with charter in and out agreements, the price spread risk related to scrubber vessels is not hedged, because the hedging tools available are not considered Group has a bunker price risk in relation to the quantity of bunkers sufficiently effective. onboard and the quantity the vessel must be redelivered with. For vessels where a scrubber has been installed, the Group is subject to a risk related to the spread between high sulphur and low sulphur fuel. Counterparty risks NORDEN engages with a significant number of counterparties NORDEN reduces its counterparty risks through systematic assessment and monitoring of their creditworthiness and (Credit risk and sanctions covering suppliers, tonnage providers, cargo owners, shipyards, etc. sanctions risk. For this purpose, own analyses are applied based on input from external credit rating agencies, sanctions risk) This involves the risk that the counterparty does not perform or is or databases and publicly available information. Each analysis results in an internal rating, which is subsequently used becomes subject to sanctions. in NORDEN’s determination of the allowed scope of the commitment. In connection with newbuilding contracting, it is assessed whether the credit risk in relation to prepayments to the yard should be reduced through repayment guarantees issued by banks with good credit ratings. Vessel related accidents In terms of value, the most material events are oil spills and total loss The Group covers these risks by taking out insurances with recognised international insurance companies. In addition, risks (Oil spill and total loss) (lost value of owned vessels, purchase options and charter parties). are minimised by operating a modern fleet and by investing in the maintenance of the vessels and in staff awareness of both external and internal environments. Piracy In various places around the world, especially West Africa, the NORDEN experienced no piracy attacks on the Group’s vessels during the year. Identifying and managing security risks crew and vessel are at risk of pirate attacks aiming at theft and/or continues to be essential to NORDEN, and to ensure adequate safeguards, NORDEN has in place a company security kidnapping. function that assesses security risks on an on-going basis in conjunction with risk intelligence providers and military organisations.

The useful lives of new assets are as follows: Years Buildings 50 Vessels 25 Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3-10 Land is not depreciated. Estimated useful lives and residual values are reassessed annually. Dry docking costs are recognised in the carrying amount of vessels when incurred and depreciated over the period until the next dry docking. Scrubbers are recognised in the carrying amount of the vessels and depreciated over the remaining lifetime of the vessels. The depreciation period for secondhand vessels is determined on the basis of the condition and age of the vessels at the time of acquisition, but the depreciation period does not exceed 25 years from delivery from the shipyard. Prepayments on newbuildings are recognised in assets as vessels under construction as payments are made. At the delivery of the vessel, it is reclassified to the item “Vessels”. Profit/loss from sale of vessels is stated as the difference between the sales price less selling costs and the carrying amount of the vessel in question at the time of delivery.

Exposures related to voyages west of Suez are hedged by entering into Rotterdam price contracts and exposures related to voyages east of Suez are hedged by entering into Singapore price contracts. Management has based on analysis of the market structure determined that the Rotterdam and Singapore prices, respectively, are separated, identifiable, and reliably measurable, among other things, due to the high price correlation between the two harbours and other west harbours and east harbours, respectively, and the fact that readily accessible transportation exists between the respective harbours. Therefore, the instruments are designated as the risk of the change in the Rotterdam and Singapore component, respectively, of the total bunker price by applying a 1:1 hedge ratio. Differences in timing and credit risk adjustments may cause ineffectiveness.

For these contracts, the estimated non-lease component (daily running costs) is excluded Lease liabilities at 31 December 330.5 from the right-of-use assets. Assessing the consideration attributable to the non-lease component includes a significant accounting judgement, where Management uses market data from an independent Non-current 198.7 service provider. The market data consists of benchmarking reports and allows NORDEN to benchmark Current 131.8 vessel operating costs against a global sample. The measurement of the non-lease component takes several factors into consideration such as operating costs, aging of the vessels, vessel types, etc. In this regard, Management assesses the service provider’s independency, objectivity and qualifications and whether the market data is appropriate for the purpose, e.g. based on sufficient market data. Furthermore, to ensure accuracy and validation of the market data used for the allocation of the non-lease component, NORDEN performs an analysis of the level of daily running costs and compares to internal data.

The share options may be exercised after at least 3 years and no more than 6 years from the respective grant dates. Exercise of the share options is subject to the continued employment with the Company at the exercise date. Special terms apply in case of death and illness. Upon exercise, the Executive Management and some of the executives must reinvest 25% of any net gain in NORDEN shares and keep these for at least 2 years. If the employee already owns shares, this can be included in the determination of the investment amount. The exercise price is determined as the 5-day average of the market price following the grant, less all dividend payments after the grant date plus a fee of 10% (2014-2017), respectively, in proportion to the market price at the date of grant.
