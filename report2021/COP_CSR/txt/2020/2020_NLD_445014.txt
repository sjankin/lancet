............................................................................................................................................................ 39 Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN I am pleased to confirm that Thermopatch BV continues to support the Ten Principles of the Global Compact with respect to human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. Thermopatch BV will renew a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress annually according to the Global Compact COP policy. Sincerely yours, THERMOPATCH BV Mr. J. Bausch Group Managing Director Introduction For over 85 years, Thermopatch constitutes a concept in the world of Laundry and has held a premier position in developing heat seal machines, label solutions, direct imprint equipment, mending material and other related supplies for the laundry, dry clean and garment manufacturing industries. To obtain a challenging position, Thermopatch utilized her knowledge and experience from the Laundry industry and developed herself into a leading company in the promotional market over the years, creating positive brand awareness in Corporate Identity. Today, we are producing crests for a large diversity of markets like for example corporate workwear, promotional clothing and sportswear which require the highest quality and service standards. Promotional wear is an effective and powerful way to promote a business or a brand and contributes to the professional appearance. Thermopatch presents a positive solution to any corporate identity requirement. Product Innovation and Development Product innovation and development; the enhancement of processes and services; and the measurement of operational performances, are fundamental, ongoing activities that help move Thermopatch forward. They solidify the quality and service standards that go into the products Thermopatch manufactures and continue to support customers’ needs. At the same time, Thermopatch is continuously on the look for new products, item formats and design configurations, to build on the large array of embellishment, branding and identification solutions currently available. Environmental Responsibility To maintain a leading role, it is necessary for Thermopatch to continue her research and development activities to meet the demands of her customers and the mandatory requirements set by various authorities. Research and development is an important part of our organization that enables us to produce customer friendly and environmentally products suitable for every need and for every situation. We acknowledge the importance of Thermopatch supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility, and encouraging the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Thermopatch is actively working on reducing the negative impacts of our organizations’ actions on the environment. 5 Integrating Sustainability It is important to effectively communicate our business’s vision of sustainability to everyone in our organization. Each and every individual, regardless of his or her role in the company, needs to understand and embrace that sustainability vision. Integration of sustainability into companies has been difficult, especially because sustainability and corporate social responsibility implementation remain the job of a single person or department within many companies. Staff commitment is a vital component of any sustainability strategy. A company’s employees are the front line in implementation of its Sustainability Management System, and understanding, support and a perceived sense of ownership of the strategy among staff can be the difference between the success or failure of any efforts to implement sustainability practices. Staff engagement begins with education and awareness-raising about the link between us as a manufacturing facility and the environment, local economic development, social conditions and opportunities, and cultural traditions, as well as the company’s policy, programmes and activities. It also involves motivating staff to support sustainable initiatives through their roles at work or as volunteers outside of the workplace. Integrating sustainability across functions starts with engaging staff through internal communication including the types of messages that staff will respond to, how to get the message across and ways to involve staff and get their support for the sustainability programme. One of the ways to do this is creating a digital ‘Green Team’ which gives employees the opportunity to create a sustainability initiative, people can share their ideas and decisions can be made regarding which one of the ideas to implement. 6 The Thermopatch Vision Thermopatch has positioned itself as an industry leader in development, innovation and manufacturing of garment branding solutions. We aim to be a global leader with a clear vision of providing the highest quality emblems, transfers and labelling solutions, through sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing practices. Our practices will continue to develop and improve to ensure that our offering continuously evolves in line with market changes and customer requirements. Thermopatch expects and demands that each of its business units, all of its employees, and its Directors carry out their business and perform their duties to the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all relevant legal principles. This standard of behaviour and performance is maintained in the company’s dealings with employees, customers, suppliers, and all other stakeholders. The company and its employees will at all times demonstrate the highest levels of integrity, truthfulness, and honesty in order to uphold both personal and corporate reputations and to inspire confidence and trust in their respective actions. The company will conduct its business in a competent, fair, impartial, and efficient manner. Role, Mission and Strategy Role We commit to aligning our operations and strategies with the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The company’s core values of Safety and Health, Environmental Stewardship, Highest Ethical Behaviour, and Respect for People are directly aligned with the values set out by the UN Global Compact. We not only strive to achieve the sales goals we set out for ourselves such as high quality and great customer service, we also set out a clear vision of what is required to sharing responsibility to achieve the collective goal of sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing in order to making products safe and available, anytime anywhere and establish the conditions within our organization necessary for as one behaviour to take root and succeed. Mission Doing the right thing – being a responsible business and hold ourselves accountable to Safeguarding Tomorrow’s Environment. Promoting socially, economically and environmentally sustainable development programs, building on our core knowledge and experience with an emphasis on individual policy tools and instruments and their effective combination. Through innovative processes and unique garment branding technology, we continue to differentiate ourselves in the market by providing high quality, bespoke services to all of its customers. 7 Strategy Our strategy is shaping and managing our sustainability priorities within a framework that is integrated into our business model and addressing sustainability topics across a diversified group. We will continue to strengthen our position as a leading company by offering the highest quality emblems, transfers and labelling solutions, through sustainable and energy-efficient manufacturing practices. To maintain excellent performance in the face of external changes and intensifying competitive pressures, we must be able to keep on transforming our organization to deliver in the long term. Creating a culture of continuous improvement will enable our organization to thrive for years to come. Mastering change will ensure we can sustain it and create an organization that can constantly adapt to and shape its environment. Strategy key elements: • To actively build and support partnerships for development • To employ the knowledge, products and expertise of Thermopatch in development projects • To build local capacity and ensure sustainability by working actively with knowledge sharing and training • To support the development of innovative and cost effective products 8 Thermopatch Social Media 9 March 2020 Thermopatch donated Textile for the Citizens’ Initiative ‘Flevoland maakt Mondkapjes’ which consists of a group of volunteers who were sewing facemasks for the non-acute Healthcare Sector. Project started in March and Team Almere officially stopped as per 1st June 2020. November 2020 Thermopatch produced Transfers for ‘Lifestyle Salon & Spa’ in Almere. 10 THERMOPATCH CONTRIBUTION SDG’s In supporting the sustainable development goals (SDG) of the UN Global Compact, Thermopatch focuses on those goals that • Are part of our core competencies • We can exercise a direct influence over and • Have a lasting impact (economy, ecology, social welfare) Of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDG) listed, we are concentrating on the following goals: • Goal 3 : Good Health and Well-being • Goal 11 : Sustainable Cities and Communities • Goal 12 : Responsible Consumption and Production • Goal 13 : Climate Action • Goal 15 : Life on Land The specific measures are described in greater detail in the following chapters: • Labour • Environment 11 Labour Risk Assessment & Evaluation (RI&E) RI&E is mandatory for all business owners with employees under the *Dutch Working Conditions Act since 1 January 1994. Mandatory part of the RI&E is the Action Plan which is stated in the Dutch Working Conditions Act (Arbowet). The Action Plan needs to contain inventoried risks and an indication of the time period in which tangible measures will be taken by the company. Thermopatch appointed a Prevention Officer who is charged with the task to compile an RI&E. The Prevention Officer is part of the welltrained Emergency Response Team (BHV) who can assist compiling the RI&E together with the help of other employees in the company. The law makes it mandatory to have the RI&E reviewed by a Certified Occupational Health and Safety Specialist (ArboNed). The review is carried out by means of a visit to the workplace to check whether all risks are included in the inventory and if the situation of the company is described properly and the latest standards and guidelines have been followed. The Specialist will also give recommendations on the Action Plan. Last inspection: 20th June 2018 * General provisions for employers and employees how to deal with Occupational Safety and Health, f.e. to have a written OSH-policy or Risk Inventory. The Act gives certain powers to the Inspectorate SZW (Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment) like f.e. forcing the employer to stop to work. 12 Preventative Medical Examination (PME) 2021 Every five years, a PME is organized for all Thermopatch employees and conducted by the National Health and Safety Service (ArboNed). Last medical check-up took place in May 2016, due to COVID-19 the next PME is scheduled for 2021. PME provides employees with insight into their physical and mental health, so that any risks can be tackled in a targeted manner. It is important to check regularly whether your employees are able to meet the (heavy) demands that the work places on them, so that they do not endanger themselves and others. An examination can determine whether your employee is healthy enough for their job. A PME that is performed and followed up on satisfactorily leads to healthy and vital employees, less absence and, as a result, lower absence costs. It can also bring considerable benefits, it is a good way to create awareness about health and it proofs that you value the health of your employees, in their turn they feel valued and can work on their own vitality thanks to clear action points. Investigation Exposure Solvents June 2020 As part of the Risk Assessment & Evaluation (RI&E), Thermopatch requested the National Health and Safety Service (ArboNed) to conduct an Investigation Exposure Solvents which has been carried out by their Industrial Hygiene Expert and Higher Safety Expert. A previous investigation took place in 2013 which was also conducted by ArboNed and resulted in a positive outcome. The aim of the investigation is to protect the health and safety of workers from possible risks of all chemical agents, including those such as fume generated by processes and substances that become hazardous because of the way they are used. Standards and assessment: The investigation was carried out in accordance with NEN-EN 482 whereby the analysis results are tested and assessed against the applicable limit values in accordance with NEN-EN 689. Conclusion: • On the basis of a representative measurement day for the exposure to solvents, it can be concluded that the limit values are not exceeded. • The measurement results are below the limit values for both the personal measurements and the stationary measurements (all individual components detected <10% of the limit values). • The exposure index is also not exceeded. • In accordance with NEN-EN 689, the work situation for the relevant workplaces is safe and periodic measurements are not necessary. 13 SBB Accredited Work Placement Company (2018) – 2020 As from September 2018, Thermopatch has become an ‘Accredited Work Placement Company’ within the Cooperation Organisation for Vocational Education, Training (VET) and the Labour Market. Thermopatch considers learning in practice an important combination to make sure that there will be a sufficient number of high-qualified professionals in the future. We are proud of our Accredited Status and are happy to display The National Logo that indicates Thermopatch is training VET-students. Workplace Conditions Workplace conditions are about physical elements and the environment in which the employee works. The productivity and effectiveness of an employee is strongly influenced when the workplace is seen as pleasant and comfortable. A healthy (and safe) workplace environment can contribute to employee engagement and work happiness. Positive influences on employee engagement: • Clear safety rules and procedures • Providing the right technology and resources to perform tasks properly • Placing (purifying) plants in the workplace • Keeping workplace clean Activities implemented 2020: • Investigation Exposure Solvents • Transition to an ISO 9001 Accredited Cleaning Company • Replacing Office Furniture • Placing and renewing plants Replacing Office Furniture November 2020 An office is one place where we spend the maximum of our time and mostly sitting. Hence it is crucial to have chairs (and desks) which are friendly and doesn’t hamper the health of the employees. Moreover, furniture and ambiance in the office play a vital role in the productivity of the employees. Realizing the importance of office furniture, it is essential to modify it by making a shift to ergonomic responsible furniture. Therefore, every desk that needs replacing will be a fully height adjustable one that allows its user ultimate flexibility at their workspace by switching from a sitting position to a standing position. 14 Environment Energy Performance Obligation – November 2020 Beginning January 2023, Energy Labels of the major part of office buildings in the Netherlands will have to be at least in ‘Category C’, because of an amendment to the Dutch Buildings Decree 2012 (Bouwbesluit 2012). This generally means that owners of Office Buildings with Energy Labels from D to G (or without any energy label) should quickly implement energy-saving measures to comply with this obligation. An Energy Label demonstrates the Energy Performance of a building. It also includes a Standard of which energy-saving measures need to be taken to improve Energy Performance. At present, having an Energy Label is mandatory regardless of the category. Starting 1st January 2023, Office Buildings must have an Energy Label in Category C or higher (A or B), an Energy Label below C will be prohibited as of that date. Incentive Supervision In that context, ‘Omgevingsdienst Flevoland & Gooi en Vechtstreek’ (OFGV) supervises Compliance with the Energy Saving Obligation and the Information Obligation Energy Saving (IPWM). OFGV entered into a partnership with ‘Energiepartners’ and both parties performed an inspection visit to Thermopatch with the aim of Supporting, Stimulate, Plan and Coach in a smarter, faster and more effective way with the Energy Saving Task. OFGV introduced this method of inspection as ‘Incentive Supervision’ (Stimulerend Toezicht) which gives you a time frame of three years to implement all legal measures. Prior to the inspection visit, Thermopatch shared the Energy Data with OFGV for which have been given special permission with a view to the current privacy legislation (GDPR). During the visit, OFGV is using a Smart Energy Application and through this Application legal measures are mapped out quickly and effectively. Energy Management System (EBS) After the visit, Thermopatch received an Energy Management System (EBS) which is a Computer Program specially designed for Thermopatch. The EBS links measures to the Consumption Data, so when you start saving energy, you can immediately see this in your Consumption and Costs. Via the EBS it is possible to communicate with the OFGV about the progress. Setting Clear Energy Goals that are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound) serves as a motivator to encourage energy efficient behavior so that savings will be achieved in the coming three years. Ready, Set….Goal! 15 New Cleaning Company May 2020 Thermopatch entered into a new contract with an ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 accredited Cleaning Company. This internationally recognised accreditation is a guarantee that the ‘Quality Management System’ and ‘Environmental Management’ practices are independently checked and certified as being of the highest quality. An ISO 9001 certificate must be renewed at regular intervals recommended by the certification body, usually once every three years. With respect to NEN-2075:2000 which is a Standard that describes the measurement of quality for cleanng performances according to objective criteria, the Cleaning Company provides their own qualified VSR/NEN-2075 inspectors. Engaging in corporate social responsibility also means practice eco-friendly and sustainable cleaning practices in the office. Therefore, using environment-friendly materials is essential. Our Cleaning Company is using 100% biodegradable and soap free cleaning detergent (NJOY). Furthermore, the Cleaning Company endorses the Code of Responsible Market Conduct. This code is a guide, with the emphasis on its application, on getting the commitment of as many parties as possible, on actually influencing responsible market conduct and on achieving improvements (visible or otherwise) on the work floor. https://www.codeschoonmaak.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Code-of-Responsible-Market-Conduct.pdf Sustainable Florist – (2010) – 2020 The ‘Barometer Sustainable Florist’ shows that a florist is Sustainable. He does this through a more Sustainable Business Management and a purchase of more sustainable flowers and plants. The Certification Scheme was created in collaboration with Environmental Organizations, Umbrella Organizations, NGOs, Industry-specific Research Agencies, Florists, Growers, Auction and Wholesale. Depending on the Purchase Percentage of more sustainable flowers and plants in combination with the number of points achieved on the business, the Floristry is certified on the Bronze, Silver or Gold Level of the Barometer. Our Local Florist who has been providing us with Fresh Flower Arrangements for many years, has been Certified as Silver this year and are looking forward to achieve the Gold Level in 2021! 16 Sustainable Packaging For many years now, Thermopatch have been reusing unprinted cardboard boxes received from several suppliers. The initiative on that, came from the Expedition Staff themselves who simply saw a plain brown carton box in a good condition, ready to be reused. What’s not to like? Implementing Sustainable Packaging is no longer an option, it’s a necessity: reduce, reuse, recycle. It’s important to find a Sustainable Supplier who helps business thrive while also helping the environment in one way or another ànd have certifications that prove their dedication to Sustainability, like our current Packaging Supplier: • FSC® Chain of Custody Certification • 90% of the packaging supplied, are FSC®, PEFC™ or SFI™ Chain of Custody Certified • Committed to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Comprehensive Sustainability Guidelines • Supporter of United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Preprinted Kraft Paper Tape – July 2019 Custom Printed Packaging has been the standard for many years, utilizing your packaging to showcase your brand name and logo. Nothing wrong with Brand Awareness, but the need for Environmentally Friendly Packaging greatly increased in the last few years, driven by Customer Awareness and simple conscientious Human Awareness. To maintain Brand Identity, there is an Eco-Friendly Alternative which benefits the Business ànd the Environment: Kraft Paper Tape. Kraft Paper is a naturally biodegradable product, it’s used in a wide range of industrial and commercial operations for packaging and protection. Thermopatch is using Water-Activated Tape (WAT) which is a form of paper tape with a water-based chemical adhesive that is reactivated by water. When the water-activated adhesive is applied to a carton, a capillary action bonds the tape to the carton. WAT Kraft Paper Tape is strong and performs well under all weather conditions. Thermopatch is using this type of Kraft Paper for its outgoing shipments which typically contain heavy boxes. It aids security, branding, environmental impact and simultaneously saving money… 17 Mono Material Packaging – September 2019 One of the main advantages of Mono Material Packaging is its Enhanced Recycling Capacity which favours a Circular Economy, as well as requiring less Energy Consumption to make it which optimizes Production Processes. All consumables used in our Printing Facility (f.e. paint cups/lids for mixing paint) are made of 100% Fully Recyclable Plastic as stated in the Suppliers’ Declaration Recyclability containing all articles supplied to Thermopatch. Plastic Fee Modulation The plastic fee modulated is intended to reward companies that use rigid plastic packaging that has good recyclability with a positive market value after sorting, leading to lower net costs for ‘Packaging Waste Fund’ (Afvalfonds Verpakkingen). For rigid plastic packaging that is sorted and recycled without impediments, and with a positive market value, a lower fee applies. The fees are re-established annually and the relative discount compared to the regular plastic fee will be maintained for a multiannual basis. Due to the use of 100% Fully Recycable Mono Material Packaging, Thermopatch qualifies for a 40% reduction on the Regular Plastic Waste Management Contribution Rate. Plastics Strategy 2021 As with all things, there is always room for improvement. Therefore we will continue looking for Alternative Packaging Products wherever possible, moving towards a Circular Economy where we not only use less packaging, but also look into packaging that can be reused or recycled. In cooperation with our suppliers, we are working on a variety of Alternative Material Options for replacing various Consumable Products like mini grip bags and shrink films. Choosing the best Environmental ànd Commercial choice of product, it is necessary to ask several questions in order to get the correct type of Biodegradable and/or Degradable Product to suit our requirements ànd our customers’ needs. To be continued – 18 Circular Economy: Research Project Reusing Corporate Wear September 2020 Thermopatch has entered into cooperation with ‘Wageningen University & Research’ who started a Research Project, commissioned by the Ministry of Defence, into Recycling of Garments like Corporate Workwear and Safety Clothing. Project Goal: Government Business Wear needs a logo (tax-wise). When an employee leaves, condition of clothing is often too good to throw away, but if badged with a logo, it cannot be used again. When switching suppliers, the logo often changes as well. Home Office has funded the Research Project with climate money. Exploring chemical composition to remove logo’s. Current status of the Project November 2020: Contact is maintained between parties as to the further course and follow-up actions in respect of the Research Project. The Life Cycle of garments is comparatively short and the materials are (in case of Workwear) relatively easy to reuse. Extending the Service Life of clothing will generally lead to major environmental gains as well: cleaning and maintaining the clothing properly will make clothing last longer. It’s not always easy to Recycle or Reuse Corporate Clothing effectively: • Most common problem with recycling garments when using Mechanical Textile Shredding, is that accessories like zippers and buttons first need to be removed before the garment is being recycled. • Security, Branding and Corporate Image can be a big issue: companies do not want their Corporate Clothing being reused inappropriately and/or ending up somewhere which will give them a negative image. Listening to Customer Feedback, it is our responsibility to service the needs of the Customers and help find the best solution to the problem of what to do with the End-of-Life Corporate Wear. Recycling Corporate Wear: Our products are Oeko-Tex Certified which means that they meet the Human Ecological Requirements of the Standard 100 by Oeko-Tex, so shredding the Corporate Wear badged with a Company Logo (emblem), is not harmful for the Environment. Reusing Corporate Wear (in good condition): In order to Reuse Corporate Wear badged with our emblems, it is possible to remove the existing logo and seal the new emblem on the same position as the old one. This exercise can be repeated up to 4-5 times. 19 Collective Action: Circular Future February 2020 Thermopatch is a member of SBBA (Stichting Beveiliging Bedrijventerrein Almere) which is a foundation that consists of companies located in the same industrial area (Industrial Estate ‘De Vaart’). SBBA organized a Workshop to bring Circular Opportunities into sharper focus and to discuss the Circular Future of De Vaart. During the Workshop, two themes were strongly highlighted: Collectivity and Accessibility. Within the theme of Collectivity the main focus was set on entrepreneurs wanting to be more connected with each other. Collectivity can be split into Material Streams and Energy: Collectivity – Material Streams • Entrepreneurs do not know what they can do for each other (what needs exist?), it is not known from other companies: − which incoming and outgoing material streams they have − which possible problems they are being confronted with • Residual Waste Streams from companies are being collected by different processors. − There are opportunities to combine these residual waste streams to minimalize transport. • Several entrepreneurs have indicated that they are open for collective purchasing of both materials as energy, where materials can be purchased locally if these are offered by a platform. Collectivity – Energy • There are opportunities in terms of collective energy production and purchasing. Number of examples were mentioned: Cooperative heat extraction and sharing Sharing residual heat Harness excess energy and turn it into heat Solar battery storage for energy spikes at both the industrial area and residential area Collect water in the area for a collective sprinkler system in the event of fire Entrepreneurs learn from each other by looking behind the scenes and knowing what they can offer each other: Sharing is Caring. 20 Charging Stations Electric Vehicles – March 2020 Although Electric Vehicles (EV) are a relatively new technology, they are becoming a more popular sight on the roads. There is a growing number of employees – and consumers – who drive EV’s. Thermopatch realized it was high time to install EV Chargers at our Headquarters. We want everyone to be able to fill up their batteries at work! 21 Doing our best to bee helpful Thermopatch supports honey bees by adopting a bee hive of sustainable cedarwood containing a ‘Buckfast’ bee colony. By sponsoring a bee hive we are striving to improve bee health and increase food security for people across the globe. Many domestic and imported fruits and vegetables require pollination. Examples include avocados, soybeans, asparagus, broccoli, celery, squash, sunflowers for oil, cucumbers, citrus fruit, peaches, kiwis, cherries, cranberries and melons. Bees are uniquely vital to our natural surroundings and anyone who eats food, needs bees: no bees = no food! And yet, honey bee colonies throughout the world are suffering unprecedented devastation and are dying at an alarming rate. This decline is one of the single greatest threats to our natural environment today. Our world’s most important pollinators are struggling in both agricultural and wild environments. They are facing many threats such as pest infestations like the parasitic varroa mite or toxic pesticides which have been proven to be very harmful and in many cases fatal to the bee population. For every sponsored bee hive in the Netherlands, another bee hive is placed in Nepal or Africa by the Social Enterprise Liquid Nature, founded by Jessica Loudon whose active in various sustainability projects and became a beekeeper due to her fascination for bees. Our own officially bee friendly municipality Almere celibrated World Bee Day on 20 th May 2019 together with Jessica Loudon as being City Hall’s own beekeeper, baking away honey waffels. We are happy to report that our Thermopatch ‘Buckfast’ bee colony are being quite productive and results in harvesting the tastiest honey from our very own backyard which doesn’t hurt either. 22 Ensuring healthy hives contribute to the fulfilment of 2030 Agenda – Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s): SDG 1 No poverty: increasing honey bee populations and beekeeping production systems boost economic growth and reduce poverty and inequalities among communities. SDG 2 Zero hunger: ensuring honey bee populations and production systems contributes to the reduction of hunger and malnutrition. SDG 3 – Good health and wellbeing: increasing quality food intake by including honeybee products in the diet, promotes health by boosting the immune system and quality nutrition. SDG 8 – Decent work and economic growth: promoting the inclusion of beekeeping activities in agricultural livelihoods to increase food production and the income of smallholders and family farmers. SDG 13 – Climate action: combating the effects of climate change through improving a general environmental health and forestation. Bees are a sensitive indicator to environmental changes. SDG 15 – Life on land: breeding hives increase pollination and environmental biodiversity. Breeding hives increase pollination which is able to increase quantity and quality of crops. Breeding hives thus means to guarantee the productions of the other agro-livestock sectors. 23 Waste Water Program H2O-Insight Water Tool (2019 2020) Nike, INC. established the Nike Sustainable Water Program to collectand track data from material vendors in their supply chain in order to encourage suppliers to achieve high water quality standards for their total production volume, not only what they produce for Nike, INC. As Thermopatch being a manufacturing facility, we participate in tracking water quality, quantity and efficiency and commit ourselves to the guidelines as set out by Nike, INC. and yearly report data on our annual water usage through the H2O-Insight Water Tool. Nike, INC. Sustainable Water Program Rating – Annual Review Process 2019: • Thermopatch FACILITY rating for the manufacturing address is BLUE • Thermopatch OVERALL rating water program rating is BLUE BLUE – The facility’s wastewater discharge is less than 50 cubic meters per day. Nike Water Program Guidelines and Ratings 24 Thermopatch supports public accountability and transparency and therefore we commit ourselves to The Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact COP Policy: Human Rights Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2 make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.

Thermopatch puts her awareness of cultural differences into practice by employing staff of different cultural and religious backgrounds. Thermopatch received a Certificate from Social Services for her help and support. 28 Environment Our Policy: We acknowledge the importance of Thermopatch supporting a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, undertaking initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility, and encouraging the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Thermopatch is actively working on reducing the negative impacts of our organizations’ actions on the environment. Actions implemented: ➢ Extension of the digital production Resulting in less usage of chemicals (Ink) and wastage ➢ Double-sided printing On all departments printers are set for double-sided printing as standard ➢ Digital Screen Imaging system An environmentally friendly exposure unit which exposes the screen directly from computer-to-screen, through which the copyroom in the printing department is only using UV LED instead of inks. Minimizing heat, energy loss and fuel usage: ➢ Office lighting We have undertaken a planned replacement of older inefficient office lighting by energy saving (40% off the office electricity bill) LED lighting. All light switches are being replaced with automatic office LED lighting activated by movement sensors (when movement occurs, light switches on). ➢ Window panes All exterior windows of our office buildings contain HR++ Ultra-High Efficient (double pane) glass. ➢ Central Heating Introduction of programmable heating controller (24/7 active clock program for energy efficient central heating) and insulating the water supply system to save energy. ➢ Compressor Replacement of an inefficient compressor for manufacturing purposes by an energy saving compressor which automatically reduces compression levels to the all-zero state and provides production machines only compression when required. ➢ Disposal hazardous waste All hazardous waste is disposed of using special recycle containers 29 Environment ➢ Digital archiving Company has a Digital Archiving Policy to minimize waste of paper and create a paperless office. One way to significantly reduce the amount of paper used and wasted is with e-invoices rather than the more traditional paper ones. Also (machine) manuals are being supplied on a USB stick instead of a hard copy. ➢ Recycling Company has disposal containers for packaging materials for recycling purposes when possible. ➢ Collecting toners/cartridges/batteries for charity purposes ➢ Company cars All new company cars meet the Euro-5 norms and are expected to meet the latest standards requirements concerning low CO2 emissions. Gradually we will exchange all our company cars into hybrid cars. ➢ Public transportation Company supports the use of public transportation during business travelling to reduce the amount of air pollution/global warming and transportation costs for the company itself (parking costs at the airport, car hire) ➢ Waste Water Management To manage our global water program, we have implemented the online reporting system H2O Insight Water Tool. ➢ Awareness Policy We have implemented a policy to create awareness among staff of the necessity and yields from operating energy-efficiently. Development of technologies: ➢ Manufacturing Process Thermopatch maintains environmentally responsible manufacturing processes by using water based materials and reduces wastage by optimizing and/or replacing inefficient manufacturing processes to ensure energy and resource efficient production. ➢ Production Process The technological change of one of our production processes not only makes it possible for us to reduce the price of the raw material and work more accurately, at the same time we are able to drastically reduce the waste materials which creates a better working environment (cleaner, healthier) and save energy consumption. Thermopatch implemented a fully automatic silkscreen-washing machine which meets all environmental requirements and saves the employee from heavy and dirty work. 30 Environment ➢ Oeko-Tex Standard Thermopatch products are certified with Oeko-Tex standard which means all components meet the required criteria (environmentally friendly) and conformity is verified by an independent organization (third party). ➢ European Regional Development Fund A part of our innovations is subsidized with support of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) of the European Commission. ➢ Thermopatch continues changing her manufacturing processes where possible and last year we accomplished a further reduction of 15-20% of ink waste by producing digitally instead of screen printing. Measurement of outcomes: The environmental performance of Thermopatch is set out through our entire manufacturing process and is measured by daily operational procedures. We will continue to strive to the highest level of safety with regard to the impacts of our organizations’ actions on the environment. 31 Environment Principle 9 encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Print Production Process The EU printing sector operates under strict environmental requirements and undertakes ambitious voluntary initiatives to demonstrate its commitment to sustainability. As with all other areas of business, environmental sustainability is not easily solved but the printing industry can make a difference. Thermopatch offers two different methods of printing, screen printing and digital printing which offer unique challenges in creating more eco-friendly products by using less hazardous chemicals and produce less waste during the production process. Screen printing: Screen printing is a process of printing which includes the use of a screen to which layers of ink are applied that will be pressed through a screen onto the printing surface, one at a time. For each new colour, a different screen is used. Digital printing: Digital printing is a process of printing from a digital-based image directly to a variety of textile media using specialized or modified inkjet technology. Digital printing technologies are by nature more sustainable than traditional analog alternatives, and offer a way forward towards clean, efficient, profitable manufacturing. As an industry all sectors of the textile community are embracing sustainable manufacturing practice, from the fabric preparation chemistry that we use to coat and finish, through to the print machinery and inks formulations with which we print. Massive investment has and continues to be made within every sector, many of which now collaborate to further develop innovative new stream-line processes and technologies. Screen printing remains to be one of the most reliable methods and offers many advantages, even though the digital process has to a large extent replaced our traditional method of screen printing. No matter how strong the influence digital technology has on the world of graphic design, there is also the ability of the screen printing ink, like water based inks, to bond over the material of the garment results in a more durable and clearer image compared to digital printing. Heat-dried screen printing inks are also durable enough to handle repeat washing without cracking or fading. Also, additives and coatings can be added to the ink to make it resistant to UV rays, scratches, chemicals and moisture, allowing the products to last for many years. 32 Environment Screen printing with water based inks The textile industry has been known to use a lot of chemicals for the purpose of printing and processing, owing to the growing awareness and demand for eco-friendly inks, have resulted in adopting new alternatives. One such option has been the use of water based inks for screen printing in the textile and apparel industry. Such inks use water as the basic solvent. Water based inks comprise of pigments, binders, thickeners, and eco-friendly solvents. Also water based inks do not need harmful solvents for the cleaning process. The screens after printing can be cleaned using water. However, the screen printing process with water based inks requires an altogether different set of skills, tools, supplies, choreography, speed, and experiences. The shelf life of water based inks are longer than the conventional inks thanks to manufacturers who have devised a technology to encapsulate water in the ink in a way that it does not evaporate until it is printed. Advantages of screen printing with water based inks: 1. It's a cleaner and more environmentally friendly product: water based inks do not contain PVC or other phthalates that can be harmful to the environment and those working with them. 2. Water based inks are breathable: water based inks typically allow the garment to remain breathable even if you are doing a fairly large print, especially suitable for printing on athletic wear. 3. Water based ink prints are extremely long-lasting: the print will typically last as long as the garment! 4. Water based inks feel amazing: in most instances, water based inks simply feel much softer. 33 Environment Principle 8 undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Energy Quick Scan – Climate Neutral Group In 2016 Thermopatch was offered a Customized Energy Quick Scan by our municipality Almere who have a collaboration with Climate Neutral Group. ‘Energy Works’ is the Program Plan that is targeting fully renewable energy for Almere (renewable energy is generated from non-fossil fuels). The ambition is to be fully energy neutral by 2022. This ambition stems from the realization that energy and its transport are increasingly becoming a scarce commodity and, as a result, prices will rise. This creates an additional financial burden for companies, residents and other users of the city. It is possible to significantly reduce the energy costs of schools, associations, residents and businesses in Almere. In fact, they can benefit from it and even earn money. The ultimate goal is to reduce CO2 emissions. Analyzes show that saving and generating more renewable energy is the most effective way to achieve that in the young city of Almere. The Customized Energy Quick Scan has given us insight in our potential energy savings and provided us with a comprehensive list of our energy saving opportunities and necessary information to prioritize and appraise opportunities in a structured way and rank these according to criteria that make most sense for our business. We considered factors such as overall savings and rate of return, cost of implementation and coherence with other planned organizational changes. Our experience shows that even low and no-cost actions can usually reduce energy costs by at least 10% and produce quick returns. Energy conservation can be as simple as using motion sensor light switches, installing standby killers for computers, replacing fluorescent lighting and halogen spotlights into LED lighting, insulating central heating pipes, placing HR foil behind radiator or simply switch off appliances when you do not need them. Solar Panel Scan Climate Neutral Group This year our Municipality Almere offered Thermopatch a Solar Panel Scan, they have set up a Collective Purchasing Program in conjunction with Climate Neutral Group and we are looking into the possibilities of installing solar panels on the roofs of our buildings. First, an independent expert will make a Solar Panel Scan of the roofs to give us insight into the possibilities and business case. We will then receive a design of the Solar System, total costs of investment and the Solar Panel payback period. Budget Depletion – February 2020 In conjunction with our Municipality Almere and Climate Neutral Group, a Grant Application has been submitted on 5th November 2019. On 7th February, a letter was received concerning the decision to reject in respect of Budget Depletion. 34 Anti-corruption Our Policy: Thermopatch acknowledges the importance to work against corruption. We do not offer neither receive any gifts, loan, fee, reward or other advantage to or from any person as an inducement to do something which is dishonest, illegal or a breach of trust, in the conduct of the enterprise’s business. In line with this principle, Thermopatch will include an anti-corruption policy in her Code of Conduct, in which will clearly state that we do not tolerate the direct or indirect offer, payment, solicitation or acceptance of bribes in any form. Facilitation payments are also prohibited. Should we discover that bribery or fraud allegations are imposed against any third party performing work for Thermopatch, we will review our relationship with that party and take appropriate action. Actions planned: Further set-up of anti-corruption policy in our Code of Conduct. This will conduct specific instructions to staff, such as requirements to avoid or declare potential conflicts of interest, and others that concern the offer or acceptance of gifts and hospitality. Measurement of outcomes: There have been no cases of corruption in the line of our work over the course of the organization’s existence. If such a situation might arise, Thermopatch will take appropriate action and ultimately withdraw from the assignment. 35 THERMOPATCH – BUSINESS ETHICS POLICY STATEMENT Thermopatch expects and demands that each of its business units, all of its employees, and its Directors carry out their business and perform their duties to the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all relevant legal principles.
