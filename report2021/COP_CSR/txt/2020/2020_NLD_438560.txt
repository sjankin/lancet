Inter IKEA Group 23 March 2020 H.E. António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Dear Mr. Secretary-General, I am pleased to confirm our continued support for the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to implement these principles. We remain committed to making the UN Global Compact and its principles part of the IKEA strategies, culture and day-to-day operations and to engage in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals. The IKEA Sustainability Report FY19 is reflecting the annual Communication on Progress (COP) and describes the IKEA business’ efforts to implement the Ten Principles. We will continue to show leadership by going beyond our own programmes and operations to advocate global action. We will work both with co-creation, community engagement, stakeholder forums, advisory meetings and partnerships.
