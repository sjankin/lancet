Sustainability is at our core, both in caring for our staff and supporting our clients. As a company, we have always paid exceptional attention to environmental, ethical and safety elements in our strategy, and we will continue to strive to anticipate the challenges of the future, and work towards improving quality of life. In 2019, we strengthened our investment in Human Capital, focusing on competence, professional growth, training, skill development, transparency, integrity and innovation. We continue to encourage an inclusive style of leadership based on trust and responsibility, giving our people freedom and autonomy in the organization of their work. We have adopted ‘smart working’ on a large scale, and in turn received extremely positive feedback in terms of a reduced carbon footprint and an enhanced work-life balance for our staff. Indeed, remote working at RINA’s Italian operations has enabled us to save more than 40,000 hours in commuting time, reducing our CO2 emissions by more than 200 tons, equivalent to the absorption capacity of some 13,000 urban trees. This development has also brought valuable changes to our digital attitude and workspace, ushering in a more flexible and agile way of working. This is underlined by the 2019 unveiling of RINA Consulting’s new headquarters in Genoa, which has been specifically designed to enhance the wellbeing of employees using technological developments and green solutions. Under our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, in 2019 RINA launched three major environmental projects which share the common goals of promoting responsible behaviour both on and off our premises and furthering the aims of the UN 2030 Agenda. I refer to such valuable initiatives as the reduction of plastic consumption, which will include a future ban on single-use plastics at all our sites beginning with Italy. Following the same logic of minimizing and mitigating our environmental impact, we also last year launched a plan to source 100% of our future energy needs from renewables at all our offices worldwide. We aim to achieve this, plus near-zero CO2 emissions, as soon as 2021. In addition, we have already started a programme to reduce paper consumption, and in 2019 developed a programme to roll out this best practice across the group. There are further achievements to mention. Last year also saw the implementation of a new ISO 27001-compliant Information Security Management System, as well as programmes for sustainable Short Sea Shipping Systems and new services for clean energy LNG-fuel cruise ships. We have also been instrumental in developing affordable hydrogen fuel cell technologies that can be deployed in large industrial contexts, and continue to explore all new innovative energy vectors. This report demonstrates how monitoring and reducing our carbon footprint and natural resource consumption remains among our highest priorities. It is our responsibility to our clients, our stakeholders, the industry, the planet, and you. We hope you enjoy reading this report. Ugo Salerno Chairman and CEO, RINA Genoa, April 2020 4 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Our business model RINA is a multinational player that provides a wide range of high-quality, tailored certification and auditing solutions for project lifecycles in the Energy, Marine, Certification, Transport & Infrastructure and Industry sectors. The RINA business model covers the full process of project development, from the embryonic phase to completion. The aim is to guarantee its technical, environmental, safety and sometimes also economic and financial sustainability. The integration of high-level engineering consultancy services with expert ICT (Information and Communications Technology), always in accordance with conflict of interest management policies, ensures the success of initiatives in the areas described above. In a world that is looking for new energy sources, and is overwhelmed by digital transformation, the combination of research-backed innovative engineering skills and quality assurance expertise separates us in the market. This combination ensures, among other things, the sustainability of new solutions. At RINA, we are working continually to deliver services that increase the qualitative standards of the market and improve the wellbeing of society. In doing so, we are building sustainable values for future generations. We believe in the value of visionary ideas and the importance of protecting life and the environment. This is why innovation and sustainability run through the core of our business, enhancing the reputation of both RINA and our customers, who are also committed to sustaining the planet and making a positive contribution to society. RINA at Glance 3,800+ 200+ offices in € 476 M people worldwide 70+ countries turnover 5 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Our approach to sustainability RINA has embedded Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability into its business development strategy. This is enhanced by our Corporate Social Responsibility policy, which formalises our approach through four key pillars: Governance, People, Planet and Innovation. The aim is to drive continuous improvement in each of these areas. In 2019, we launched a significant number of new projects. These included revisions to our ‘mission and vision’ statement and our code of ethics; developments in our approach to human capital; a move towards plastic free and paperless working and greater use of renewables; and the rolling out of smart working and our new agile headquarters. The path towards sustainability involves both internal and external measures: from internal initiatives designed to increase awareness of more sustainable ways to approach our business and carry out our activities; to the development of innovative external services which generate positive outcomes for our customers’ projects and businesses, as well as for our stakeholders, society and the environment. RINA is also actively engaged in rule development processes with a large number of technical associations, committees and working groups at both a national and international level. The purpose is to share research, results, technical knowledge, and best practices. Stakeholders can be assured that the company is managing its social, environmental and economic impact at the highest level. We maintain a proactive and transparent dialogue with our stakeholders in order to understand their expectations, and build shared values. RINA has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2016 and reports according to the UN Global Compact Active Level. We are committed to making sustainability one of the key drivers of our business strategy, and to ensure this approach is reflected in the services we deliver to our clients. We actively support the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact relating to human rights, labour standards, the environment, and the fight against corruption. Progress on implementing these principles is reported annually to our stakeholders. We also participate in national and international forums dedicated to corporate social responsibility (CSR) and sustainability. These include Fondazione Sodalitas, the Italian partner of CSR Europe, as well as Transparency International, which supports voluntary anti-corruption initiatives, and its Italian working group Business Integrity Forum. Our sustainability governance RINA has put in place a comprehensive structure to manage sustainability in the company. The Chief Risk Officer assisted by the Compliance & Sustainability Director develops and overviews the implementation of the corporate strategy on quality, environmental, health, safety, security, social responsibility and personal data protection issues at group level. The CSR Manager develops, promotes, communicates and disseminates RINA’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programme and is responsible for the coordination of sustainability projects, plus stakeholder engagement and the measuring and reporting of sustainability performance. Meanwhile, the Corporate Sustainability Working Group supports the development of the company’s sustainability strategy and proposes suitable targets and methodologies. The Corporate Sustainability Working Group meets quarterly, and more frequently as appropriate. The Group ensures that sustainability is embedded throughout the company’s activities, and that each function operates in line with the overall sustainability strategy, through the coordination of cross function sustainability projects. 6 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Our approach to materiality The relevant sustainability issues for RINA and its stakeholders have been identified using a range of sources: industry benchmarks, national and international best practices, internal documentation sources (Code of Ethics, Model of Organization and Management 231/01; Internal policies), external instruments (in particular GRI-Standards), and national and international principles and regulations related to sustainability issues (eg Global Compact, SDGs, the European Commission Action Plan for Sustainable Finance and parts of Art. 3 of the Legislative Decree no. 254/2016). The materiality assessment was carried out with the direct involvement of the group’s key corporate functions. Meanwhile, a qualitative-quantitative assessment of previously identified sustainability issues was also undertaken, taking into account the expectations of stakeholders. On the basis of these assessments, priority themes for each of the four pillars of the Corporate Social Responsibility strategy were identified. Material aspects § Business continuity § Enhancement of human capital § Compliance with laws and regulations § Fair remuneration § Creation of sustainable economic value § Occupational health and safety § Dimensional growth § Respect for human rights in the value chain § Economic performance and financial solidity § Responsible supply chain management § Ethical business conduct § Training § Privacy and data protection § Welfare § Reputation § Work-life balance § Transparency § Customer satisfaction § Climate change, reduction of CO2 emissions § Digitalization § Energy efficiency § Maintenance of accreditations / notifications § Reduction of raw material consumption § Process innovation § Sustainable mobility § Research § Service innovation 7 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Our Sustainability Programme in 2019 2020 Governance 2019 March.

We are following GRI Standards in preparing the majority of our sustainability performance indicators. The table below shows a selection of KPIs that will be included in the sustainability dashboard. The dashboard will be launched during 2020, and will provide overall information on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performances at group level, as well as at single office level. This will further open the way to including non-financial targets in management objectives. 9 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Sustainability Facts and Figures in 2019 Governance  Sustainability Working Group formally established  Revision of the Code of Ethics  New Integrity Course developed  Code of ethics signed by 100% of suppliers  Zero complaints concerning breaches of customer data privacy  Due diligence carried out on 5,600 third party partners  New Compliance Helpline (to be launched in early 2020)  CEO’s Call To Action signed People  Male employee turnover 10.4%  Female employee turnover 8.7 %  Nearly 60% of employees covered by collective bargaining agreements  Almost 90% of employees assigned work objectives  Around 21,000 hours of e-learning courses completed  Nearly 5,000 courses on managerial skills provided  More than 90,000 hours of training provided  More than €1,250,000 distributed in employee bonuses in Italy through a welfare platform  More than 44,000 hours of commuting time saved in Italy  New Diversity and Inclusion Policy launched  Workforce composition: 69% male and 31% female  100% suppliers qualified on the basis of ethical and social policies  20 security risk assessments carried out for 20 major RINA projects  102 business trips assessed  RINA Safety Day held on 28 April  Safety Driving Course: 937 attendees for e-learning course, 30 attendees for practical training course 10 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Planet  3 Environmental Projects launched: 1.

It followed our contribution to a Business Integrity Forum (BIF) research project in 2018 and the development of a Transparency Index. We achieved a positive evaluation in this index but regardless moved to further enhance performance in this area as part of our continuous improvement, starting with an updated Code of Ethics. Compliance helpline Employees may obtain guidance on any question or matter of concern relating to the implementation or interpretation of the Compliance Programme by contacting either their Line Manager or a new dedicated online Corporate Compliance Helpline (compliance-helpline@rina.org) managed by the Director of Corporate Compliance. Whistleblowing In 2017, RINA established a number of dedicated channels to enable employees to signal potential misconduct. The platform is publicly accessible on the RINA website, together with full information about the procedure. Since the platform was created, it has become the most frequently used method for signalling concerns: in 2018 and 2019, 67% of reports were submitted through the platform, compared to 33% through other communication methods. In this period, the platform has been mainly used by overseas reporters (87% of reports from countries other than Italy). Some 75% of reports were submitted by RINA employees, and 25% by consultants. The large majority, equal to 80%, were signed by the whistleblower, while just 20% were anonymous. Data protection To properly manage the protection of personal data, RINA regularly reviews its Organizational and Data Protection Model, deploying the principles contained in EU General Data Protection Regulation No.2016/679 (GDPR). Among the ‘near-misses’ analysed in 2019, there were no substantiated complaints concerning any personal data breach in any category of data subjects. Meanwhile, after launching an awareness campaign on the subject, more than 80% of the personnel enrolled subsequently attended an e-learning course. Third party Due Diligence During 2019, RINA enhanced control measures relating to third parties with whom it has a business relationship. The aim is to reduce operational, reputational and security risk, and to comply with national and international standards regarding anti-money laundering and anti-corruption measures. During the year, a permanent third-party verification process was implemented, with the aim of checking counterparties related to jurisdictions selected on the basis of specific Key Risk Indicators (sanctions, security, corruption, credit, business strategy). During 2019, over 5,600 compliance and security checks were carried out. 12 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview People Workforce composition The composition of the workforce by gender is: MALE FEMALE RINA TOTAL 69% 31% Breakdown: MALE FEMALE TECHNICAL CAREER STREAM 79% 21% BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CAREER STREAM 75% 25% BACK OFFICE PROFESSIONALS CAREER STREAM 31% 69% MANAGERS CAREER STREAM 79% 21% RINA has a higher percentage of male personnel working for the company overall, and this is particularly evident in the technical, business development and managerial career streams. Female personnel are largely working in back office roles. The statistics for the gender split are typical of technical companies and also apply to many of our competitors. The number of female personnel in technical roles reflects the percentage of females in the application pool. RINA’s Diversity and Inclusion strategy is aimed at attracting more women into technical and managerial roles in order to have a more diverse mix of talent in the workplace. We also recognise that a continuing review of all stages of the employee experience is necessary to ensure that unconscious bias in the workplace is properly managed. Global employee turnover Male employee turnover 10.4% (versus 11.0% in 2018) Female employee turnover 8.7 % (versus 7.9% in 2018) 13 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Training and skills development E-learning is a proven training methodology that has been successfully used within the company since 2006. In 2019, we further expanded our e-learning system by adding new functions and sector-specific training modules. Around 21,000 hours of e-learning courses were made available globally in 2019. Aside from e-learning, in 2019 the group also provided nearly 5,000 hours of e-learning courses on managerial skills. Individual coaching sessions with managers and team leaders were provided on topics such as team management and leadership, coaching for demotivated employees, and how to conduct feedback interviews. In total in 2019, we delivered more than 90,000 hours of training worldwide. This was equivalent to an average of 24 hours of training per person, in addition to the time spent on e-learning courses. As part of our programme of building an effective learning strategy, we significantly expanded and improved our Learning Management System (LMS) platform in 2019. One of the key objectives achieved was the addition of 250 e-learning courses on soft skills to the platform. In 2020, we will launch the application “GoLearn”, which will enable employees to access learning content anytime directly from their own mobile device. Performance management RINA has created an integrated approach to career and performance management based on the following principles: transparency, responsibility and feedback culture. In 2019, some 90% of employees received performance appraisals. Talent management Our people and their skills are the principal keys to our success and our advantage over our competitors, particularly in challenging market conditions. In 2019, we launched a series of initiatives aimed at attracting and retaining the best talent: Talent Management Program: aimed at identifying the best talent in the company. Graduate Program: to enhance the company’s ability to attract the best talent. Job rotation: to offer new challenges and continuous career support to employees. Welfare In 2019, a total of €1,256,298 was distributed as bonuses to employees in the company’s Italian operations through a welfare platform. Of this total, €358,684 was used to offer vouchers to buy gym, holiday and travel passes, plus subscriptions to cinema tickets, magazines and newspapers. Safety driving course A specific e-learning module on safe driving was developed in 2019, and will continue to be mandatory for all new employees. A further practical driving course was given to those employees driving more than a specific amount of kilometres each year. A total of 937 employees attended the e-learning module, and 30 took part in practical training. Improving security for our people In 2019, RINA worked on several programmes aimed at increasing security awareness across the group. All RINA employees have access to a dedicated travel intelligence platform identifing security risks at specific destinations, and providing security advice. In the event of an emergency during business travel, a non-stop 24/7 Assistance Centre is available to provide support and advice to employees on medical and security issues. In 2019, a total of 102 business trips involving 126 employees were assessed for their security risk. Furthermore, security risk assessments were carried out for 20 major projects worldwide. 14 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Planet In order to minimize the environmental impact of our operations, we have made the monitoring and reduction of our carbon footprint and consumption of natural resources a top priority in our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy. In 2019, three environmental projects were launched: Plastic-Free Project We aim to ban single-use plastic products, particularly plastic bottles, at all our sites globally. The expected impact of the above measure at RINA’s Head Office in Genoa is:  40,000 plastic bottles saved per year  1,000 kg of plastic saved  2,600 kg of CO2 emissions saved, corresponding to an annual absorption capacity of almost 3 acres of forest (over 1 hectare) Renewable Energy Project We aim to source 100% of our global energy needs from renewable energy by 2021. The expected impact is a reduction of around 3,500 tons of CO2 emissions a year, corresponding to an annual absorption capacity of almost 1,300 hectares of forest. Paperless Project Our aim is to reduce our yearly paper consumption, and extend our best practices to all our sites globally. The expected impact is around 15 tons of paper saved yearly, equivalent to 15,000 Kg of CO2 emissions, or an annual absorption capacity of about 6.5 hectares of forest. These 3 projects share several common goals:  To support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals  To enhance and confirm RINA as a sustainable brand  To engage with RINA employees, promoting responsible behaviour both on and off RINA’s premises 15 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Innovation Operational Excellence In 2019, RINA launched its Operational Excellence programme, based on Continuous Improvement and Lean Six Sigma. Through Continuous Improvement, we will prepare the group and create the necessary buy-in for the future innovation created by digitalization. In line with the Lean Six Sigma system, the programme certifies participants as different coloured belts according to their knowledge. In 2019, 11 Green Belts and 57 Yellow Belts were developed and certified. Meanwhile, we are close to finalising 11 successful projects in Procurement, Finance and Human Resources. IT and Information security RINA is strongly committed to IT and information security. A vulnerability assessment (VA) and a penetration test (PT) are carried out to test the effectiveness of our system and procedures at least once a year, and more frequently when necessary. In 2019, we implemented a new Information Security Management System, which is ISO/IEC 27001:2013 compliant. Smart Working A total of 1,117 employees working in Italy have taken advantage of Smart Working, completing 32,979 days during 2019. Under this scheme, employees can work from home up to 8 days per month, using RINA equipment and technology, which includes software for video conferencing, group chat and sharing documents. Each employee is given compulsory training before entering the scheme. The scheme enabled employees in Italy to reduce their commuting time by 44,522 hours in 2019, equivalent to 217 tons of CO2 emissions saved. Agile offices At the start of 2019, work was started on new, agile offices in Genoa. The location, via Cecchi, was chosen for its easy accessibility to train, subway and other types of public transport. The 4,000 square metre office space is dedicated to sustainability and welfare. More than 400 employees will have at their disposal open plan working areas, coworking areas, meeting rooms, food courts, green spaces and relaxation areas. The office functions as a smart space, where employees do not have a fixed workstation but can sit wherever they choose. This, one of the largest changes, ensures flexibility, collaboration and productivity, and encourages close integration between colleagues. During the design of the new office, the project focused on achieving environmental sustainability, in order to minimize our overall environmental impact and footprint. Digitalization During 2019 we finalized the application Optimum for fleet performance optimization. This has now been installed on board the ships of several of our main clients. Operational information from the different operating systems on board ship can be shared in a single environment on RINA’s digital CUBE platform, where the information can be analyzed, compared and evaluated. Such information is no longer “confined” to one device. New delivery methods are also being developed for traditional services. One of the most traditional operations on board ship inspection can now be executed in a new way. Our surveyors have been provided with an advanced technology helmet which allows them to share what they see with experts on the ground. This wireless camera brings high quality audio/video communication, integrating optical, thermographic and borescope cameras. In addition, it can share documents and with innovative data compression technology the transmission of very large audio and video files. 16 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Our commitment to the UN Global Compact principles RINA has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2016. As such, we support and apply and share within our sphere of influence the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We are committed to communicating our progress and developments towards realising these goals on an annual basis. Our Sustainability Report is publicly available on the RINA website: www.rina.org. 17 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview Our commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda for sustainable development Sustainability is integral to RINA’s business culture and strategy. The group wishes to contribute to improving economic, social and environmental conditions wherever it operates, and to build value for future generations. It is committed to ensuring this approach is reflected in the services it provides to customers. RINA pursues a model of sustainable business, which revolves around continuous innovation in business processes, and the provision of services that support the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals. We have been among the first 50 Italian companies to respond to the CEO Call to Action for a New Deal for Europe, launched in consultation with the European Commission on the occasion of the Brussels SDG Summit of 7 May 2019. By participating in this important initiative, RINA reaffirms its commitment to pursuing a model of sustainable development in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as well as holding an active dialogue with stakeholders. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) define global sustainable development priorities and aspirations for 2030 and seek to mobilise global efforts around a common set of goals and targets. The SDGs call for worldwide action among governments, business and civil society to end poverty and create a life of dignity and opportunity for all, within the boundaries of the planet. 18 RINA Sustainability Report 2019 Overview 19 info@rina.org rina.org
