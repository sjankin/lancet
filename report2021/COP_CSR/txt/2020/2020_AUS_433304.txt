This year, we have focused our reporting on 10 sustainability areas and the related SDGs that we and our stakeholders identified as the most ‘material’ for our business. We also describe the practical actions we have undertaken to advance the United Nations Global Compact’s key principles, to which we have committed. This report is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards: Core Option and we have used the GRI Reporting Principles to guide us in our how we report on the 10 most material sustainability topics for Yarra Valley Water.
