ABOUT THIS REPORT Our Internal Stakeholders THE INTERNAL WORKSHOPS ENABLED US TO ENGAGE WITH OUR EMPLOYEES REGARDING OUR OPERATIONS, AND TO ELICIT THEIR INSIGHTS, PERCEPTIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF INTERNAL ACTIVITIES. THE FREQUENCY OF ENGAGEMENT WITH OUR EMPLOYEES IS DAILY, WEEKLY, BIMONTHLY, MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY. ALEXBANK’s staff have a high level of involvement in regard to the Bank’s sustainability efforts, but they see the need to increase the level of awareness regarding ALEXBANK’s sustainability efforts through public communication. The level of importance of the Bank’s contributions to economic, social, and environmental sustainability is quite high for ALEXBANK’s personnel. A synopsis of our efforts on behalf of our employees can be found in the “Celebrating Diversity at ALEXBANK” section of this report. Attendees of the “Environmental Performance and Supply Chain Practices” workshop were particularly generous in their suggestions to reduce the Bank’s environmental footprint and assess environmental and supplier compliance further – two of the important material topics we address as a Bank. These are listed in the “Environmental Welfare” section of this report. During the “Overall Approach and Economic Performance” and the “Human Capital and Customer Satisfaction” workshops, the need to further address customer complaints more efficiently and improve customer satisfaction through digitalization and accessibility in our branch networks was discussed. Participants also suggested to maintain the Bank’s focus on Agribusiness and Digitalization moving forward. These recommendations are mentioned in the “About Us” and “Growth for Impact: Our Year in Review” sections. The “Social Investments and Creating Shared Value” workshop allowed us to engage and reflect on our sustainability practices and our methods to create shared value through our multiple sustainability initiatives. This is further elaborated in the “Creating Social Impact and Value” section of this report. Overall, our internal stakeholders were pleased with the achievements that ALEXBANK has made throughout 2019. They made numerous actionable and efficient recommendations throughout the workshops that would enable each department to grow and improve its operations, in order for both stakeholders and the Bank to benefit in 2020.

Today, we were able to see direct positive results of the procurement structure that was approved in late 2017, which ensures the alignment of all our procurement practices with the Code of Ethics.

Fueling the Growth of the Egyptian Economy MICRO, SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSMES) ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED THE ENGINE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH. IN TANDEM WITH THE MAIN PILLARS OF THE 2030 EGYPT’S VISION, THEY CONSTITUTE MORE THAN 95% OF PRIVATE BUSINESSES IN EGYPT AND ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 80% OF EMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTRY. To enable these businesses to realize their full potential and overcome the challenge of adequate access to finance, in 2016 the Central Bank of Egypt announced an initiative to encourage the banking sector to increase its lending to MSMEs. By 2019, banks were expected to have directed at least 20% of their total credit portfolios towards financing SMEs. In the last four years since the introduction of the initiative, we have been deploying our resources to provide our support to MSMEs under the umbrella of a wider, more comprehensive MSMEs lending strategy. By the end of 2019, this strategy culminated in total loans allocated to MSMEs making up 20.49% of ALEXBANK’s total loans portfolio, up from 16.42% in 2018. Indeed, the Bank’s loans to MSMEs increased by around EGP 1.4 billion (approximately 23%), resulting in total lending to MSMEs amounting to EGP 7,657 million vis-à-vis EGP 6,221 million in 2018 as per the Central Bank of Egypt’s reporting.

Our efforts to promote sustainable growth have evolved to embed a dynamic risk management system. It is a cornerstone in our decision-making processes and is facilitated by automated analytical models. The Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) is a core component of our approach to risk management, which better aligns our overall corporate strategy, capital allocation and risk monitoring. ALEXBANK ensures effective implementation of the RAF through regular monitoring, assessment and analysis for any deviation from strategy, ultimately ensuring long-term value creation for all our stakeholders. Despite, or maybe because of, our dynamic operating environment and the fast-paced changes we experience, including those of a regulatory nature, technological advances, macroeconomic disruptions, emerging risks types, and continuous enhancement of our own risk management framework, we are able to report on the following achievements in 2019.

ALEXBANK proactively introduced a new rule-based product for the Small Business segments embedded in the Electronic Credit Application (ECA) covering different business needs for companies, dramatically reducing the time between loan application, approval and disbursal. This builds on the successful application of ECA for corporates and SMEs. Over 2020, with the finalization of the retail workflow, all Bank segments will be subject to a fully automated credit process. Furthermore, we have implemented the Early Warning System application for corporates, SMEs and Small Business segments, which allows for the proactive detection of potentially deteriorating clients following the adoption of the new default definition rules that were issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). The rise and growing support for small businesses in Egypt has contributed to the country’s economic development. 102 29 GRI 102-30, GRI 102-31 Sustainability Report 2019 103 5. RISK MANAGEMENT FOR SUSTAINABILITY 5.2 Reputational Risk OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO APPROVED A NEW REPUTATIONAL RISK POLICY, IN LINE WITH OUR CODE OF ETHICS, IN JULY 2019. REPUTATIONAL RISK IS DEFINED AS THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE BANK’S PROFIT AND CAPITAL DUE TO LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH INDUSTRY SERVICE STANDARDS, FAILURE TO DELIVER ON COMMITMENTS, LACK OF CUSTOMER-FRIENDLY SERVICE, LOW SERVICE QUALITY, UNREASONABLY HIGH COSTS, A SERVICE THAT DOES NOT MATCH MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES OR CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS, INAPPROPRIATE BUSINESS CONDUCT OR UNFAVORABLE AUTHORITY OPINIONS AND ACTIONS.

Key Risk Indicators related to Human Resources, Processes, Fraud and external events, Information Security and the GAF Report were identified and submitted to the Operational Risk Committee to ensure regular monitoring. To further streamline operational risk management across diverse organizational units, the new role of ‘Business Line Operational Risk Managers’ (BLORMs) was created to prepare and update the regulations necessary for operational risk management within their own organizational units as well as to ensure the collection and reporting of information concerning operational risks is up-to-date in order to guarantee the effectiveness and timeliness of mitigation actions related to critical issues. To strengthen awareness and understanding of the significance of operations risk issues, an online awareness training module and quiz were disseminated to all bank employees and several classroom sessions were conducted to train 179 branch managers and regional area managers. Additionally, operational risk is a topic included in the induction program for all new hires.

This year, and in response to the Central Bank of Egypt’s newly enacted rules concerning the Banking Consumer Protection Rules, we conducted a deep analysis to identify areas in need of further observation and development, revealing a limited need for intervention due to the advanced approach established prior. Consumer protection rules are well observed through a comprehensive and stringent framework, considering the principles contained in the Group rules for consumer protection in addition to compliance with the national regulatory context framework. Our internal rules on the matter were approved by the Board of Directors in March 2019. The action plan for the implementation of the rules for customer protection will be fully implemented by the first quarter of 2021. This year, to enhance our customer data protection processes, we are examining the possibility of adopting and implementing the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in cooperation with Intesa Sanpaolo Group and ALEXBANK’s business partners. Moreover, an e-learning course on consumer protection and rights was circulated to all Bank employees who are directly and indirectly engaged with customers. The training aimed to raise staff awareness on internal rules and Central Bank of Egypt requirements to better approach consumer rights. In terms of customer privacy breaches32, we are pleased to report that there have been no leaks, thefts, or losses of customer data. In alignment with our parent company Intesa Sanpaolo Group, our approach to handling complaints is built on the establishment of strong communication channels with our clients that enable all members of our community to raise their grievances and address their concerns.

To reduce the environmental impact associated with cleaning products, the housekeeping team has shifted to using greener cleaning products. This shift enables us to ensure the safety of the environment and the community and fosters strong partnerships with sustainable businesses in Egypt. Measures are also set in place to promote energy efficiency. Our Real Estate Department introduced an initiative focused on lighting to rely on the most energy-saving fixtures.37 Thus far, existing lighting fixtures in Magnifica Lounge Private Lounge Cairo, Garden City, Hurghada, Banha, Nabaroh and Kafr El Zayat Branches were replaced with LED lights. Moreover, LED lighting fixtures were installed in our Loran, Arkan, New Maadi, and Almaza branches. Alongside the LED lighting fixtures, occupancy lighting sensors were installed in the Magnifica Private Lounge at our Cairo Branch as well as the activation of management and control systems for switching systems on and off. Thus far, the transition to LED has prompted annual energy savings of 53,468,125 KWH and an estimated CO2 reduction of 28,712 tons. We have been working on replacing high consumption printing machines with more energy efficient models since 2018, known as multifunction printers.
