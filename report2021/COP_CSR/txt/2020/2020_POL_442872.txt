the President of the Management Board of mBank S.A. I am pleased to present to you the newest integrated report of mBank Group, covering mBank S.A. with its foreign branches in the Czech Republic and Slovakia as well as the following subsidiaries: mLeasing, mFaktoring, mBank Hipoteczny and mFinanse. For another year in a row, we present you the report covering both financial and non-financial information. It has been prepared along with the guidelines of International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC). This report is also consistent with the standard of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In 2019, mBank Group generated its best operating result in the history. The total income of 2019 reached record-high level of PLN 5.5 billion, rising by 13.7% year on year excluding one-offs. One of the key characteristics distinguishing mBank among the continuously consolidating Polish banking sector is our ability to grow organically. We turned this feature into our competitive advantage. 2019 was another year of substantial acquisition of new clients. In the corporate area our client base grew by almost 2,800 corporates and reached around 26,500 customers at the end of the year. We attracted around 217,000 retail clients in Poland and 34,000 in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. As of end of 2019 we were servicing 5.6 million of retail customers on three markets. One of the most important circumstances impacting our activity in 2019 was the intention of our main shareholder to put mBank on the market. The first official information concerning the sale of mBank was communicated by Commerzbank in its announcement on September 20, 2019. In 2020 Commerzbank decided to terminate the sales process and keep mBank’s shares. This decision was partly influenced by the economic disruption caused by an outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic at the beginning of 2020, resulting in multiple challenges for the banking sector. At mBank we want to be among leaders of social responsibility in the banking sector, therefore sustainable growth gains our rising attention. We intend to be a responsible creditor and curb our indirect impact on the environment. Starting from April 2019 we decided to limit funding for hard coal and lignite mines. Earlier, we adopted a focused 4 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Renewable Energy Sources (RES) financing policy. We increased the amount of funds dedicated to RES from the initial PLN 500 million to PLN 2 billion in 2020. The sustainable financing path is followed also by the subsidiaries from mBank Group. For instance, mLeasing provided an offer of photovoltaic panels for SME customers. We do not forget about the social area of our activity. Thanks to the grants, competitions and numerous actions, mFundacja (mFoundation) supports the mathematic education of children and adolescents. We regularly run social campaigns aimed at education about cyber threats and promoting secure behaviour when using the internet. We are a strategic partner and a sponsor of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WOŚP), one of the biggest NGOs in Poland. We provide financial servicing during the finals and channel own resources to support WOŚP. In 2019 we organised a charity art auction from mBank’s collection that added funds to the foundation’s account. In December 2019 we adopted a new Strategy of mBank Group for 2020-2023, titled “Growth fuelled by our clients”. This strategy is our response to the changing market and regulatory environment as well as anticipated, upcoming trends. Its four pillars: focus on clients, development of our platform and application, continued improvement of operational efficiency, and people making up our organisation – reflect the key elements of our business model. For the first time ever, the corporate social responsibility/ESG strategy is an integral part of the document. As a Group we intend to run our business in compliance with the sustainable development rules. We want to educate people, protect the climate and environment, and promote prosperity. We formulated our goals being guided by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), global sustainability goals set by the UN to be reached by 2030. We also constantly support the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact initiative, of which we are a signatory. All of these, and many other aspects of initiatives pursued by our Group are described in this report. I encourage you to reading it. Respectfully yours, Cezary Stypułkowski 5 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 About mBank Group About mBank Key information Since its beginings, mBank sets a path for changes and innovativeness in the banking sector.

The transaction, concluded on March 8, 2019, supplements the Group’s competences with activities in the fintech sector.

Services provided under mBank logo are marked with different colours, depending on the target group of the offer. Our way of thinking about banking is shaped by digital DNA, that is in the centre of mBank’s business model. It affects all internal processes, product development and the tools through which customers use our services. Digital DNA is directly related to intellectual capital – we observe the development of technology by adapting the latest developments and moderating innovations within the Bank. 15 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank Group value model mBank Group activity is based on a value creation model orented for the benefits for customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders. We identify actual needs and implement adequate solutions, responding to current and prospect requirements. mBank’s widely recognised operational excellence is based on the state-of-the-art user interface for online banking, next-generation mobile application, video banking, as well as real-time, event-driven customer relationship management (CRM) based on client behaviour patterns.

This way, we implement the strategic aim of mBank to be the most convenient transactional bank on the market.

We have been operating in the segment of individual clients since 2000, i.e. from the moment of launching mBank, fully online bank – in 2018 we celebrated our 18th birthday, broadly described in previous report. 1986 Establishment of Bank Rozwoju Eksportu as a joint-stock company 1992 Listing of BRE Bank on the Warsaw Stock Exchange 1994 Signing of a strategic partnership agreement with Commerzbank AG 1998 Acquisition and merger with Polski Bank Rozwoju SA Establishment of mBank – the first internet-only bank in Poland – 2000 completed in just one hundred days Launch of Multibank, the second retail arm of BRE Bank, targeting affluent 2001 customers Foreign expansion of retail operations, the first branches of mBank are set 2007 up in the Czech Republic and Slovakia Rebranding – Replacing of three existing brands by one: mBank 2013 New mBank transactional platform is launched 2016 „mobile Bank” Strategy for 2016-2020 is announced Start of mAccelerator fund aimed at the development and 2017 commercialisation of technology for financial institutions Strategic partnership with WOŚP, launch of e-commerce services via 2018 mElements New strategy for 2020-2023 2019 Announcement of the intention to sell mBank’s shares by Commerzbank In 2001, we established MultiBank, which complemented the bank’s business model with servicing clients in the outlet network in the largest Polish cities. Since the very beginning, mBank has relied on organic growth, which means that the current scale of its business has been achieved without takeovers of other banks and financial institutions. mBank is the only bank in Poland with successful track record of rolling out its online retail banking model into foreign markets. Since 2007, we have been operating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In 2013, we unified our brand under mBank name, which is the most powerful of our brands. In 2019, we continued to focus the offer of mBank Group on digital DNA, which underlies our internal processes, tools and services for clients. We have been effectively implementing the strategy aimed at creating a modern and innovative transactional bank, which offers an integrated range of products and services both for individual and corporate clients. Enhancing our offer for SME clients, in 2019 we acquired LeaseLink to 18 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 provide leasing as a payment method for e-commerce. For more information regarding the subsidiaries, please refer to section Key information. Strategy „Mobile bank” strategy In December 2019, we adopted the new Strategy of mBank Group for 2020-2023 titled Growth fuelled by our clients . It is widely described in section “Outlook”, focused on the future business. Adoption of new strategy implies a closure and summary of the “Mobile Bank” strategy, pursued since 2016. It was built on 3 pillars: Empathy, Mobility and Efficiency. Our strategic initiatives and operations focused on clients. We developed our competitive advantage in the mobile area. We continue to improve the resources management. Empathy Empathy is a quality that is rarely associated with the financial sector. We use various tools to instil it in our organisational culture, our employees’ mindsets, and our processes and products. Empathy helps us provide better customer service, improves relations with our partners, and enhances cooperation among our employees. We make sure our products and services meet four core requirements applied whenever we interact with our customers. The requirements include:  addressing customers’ needs – we fulfil customers’ actual needs and solve their real problems;  simplicity – we work in a simple and customer-friendly, almost inconspicuous manner;  customer experience follows mBank’s brand – we inspire positive emotions in line with brand positioning. We are a mobility icon and support our clients anytime and anywhere; 19 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  trust – we make every effort to maintain high level of trust and earn it with every decision we make. GOOD PRACTICE STOPKLATKA In order to help our employees better understand the bank’s strategy, we have created the Snapshot (“Stopklatka”). It is a set of crucial, open-ended questions together with answers, dealing with customers’ legitimate expectations from the bank and the desired way of cooperation within the organisation People are at the core of our empathy-related vision and strategy. That is why we provide our employees with know-how and indicate a course of direction for the bank’s development. Every three months, the Management Board holds open staff meetings which are broadcast for everyone interested. Their objective is to comment on results, discuss strategic projects, and answer questions. We encourage our employees to visit other places in the company for quick “work experience”. Employees gain work experience in places where the bank meets customers: in retail and corporate branches, and the contact centre. 800 line managers took part in workshops on empathy GOOD PRACTICE – AGENTS OF CHANGE The corporate culture is also developed with the help of agents of change, also known as ambassadors. There are approximately 80 ambassadors from the head office, 30 ambassadors from the corporate branches, and 40 ambassadors from the retail branches. They make sure that our employees properly understand the definition of empathy and promote it in their respective units. Ambassadors meet with the members of the Management Board at least once a year to participate in strategyrelated lectures and workshops. The meetings feature inspiring guest appearances. Last year we invited an expert in learning from one’s mistakes, and trained empathy with improvisational actors. Workshops improve our knowledge of the way the bank works as a whole and allow us to test new solutions. Employee engagement surveys show that ambassadors have a better understanding of the concept and significance of empathy in the bank. They are more eager to indicate areas that work well and those in need of improvement to the team responsible for client-centricity and empathy. We know that empathy is in mBank’s DNA. For over five years we have been implementing the rules of simple and empathetic communication in mBank under the “mKanon” project. We believe that good and effective communication is clear, informative, brief, correct in terms of language, honest, empathic and conveyed using the first-person perspective. In the first place we have 20 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 changed communication in the call centre and the complaint-handling team, i.e. areas directly communicating with clients. We have made changes in internal communication in the bank, including the compliance, internal legislation, and security areas. We organise workshops for employees during which we teach them how to write to clients experiencing difficult time, e.g. clients subject to debt collection or whose relative has died. We try to increase employees’ awareness in this respect by cooperating with ambassadors of mKanon (rules of clear, transparent and simplified communication). The group consists of 120 employees who help their co-workers to communicate more effectively. In 2019 we trained approximately 840 employees and organised 32 workshops. Fundacja Języka Polskiego (the Polish Language Centre) audited our communication and awarded measures taken by mBank with a language quality certificate. The President of the Management Board signed a regulation implementing the standard on internal communication in mBank. To promote empathy at mBank, we take, among others, the following measures:  We measure clients' loyalty and satisfaction by carrying out the survey defining the Net Promoter Score (NPS). On this basis, we identify key reasons why clients decide to recommend our brand to their friends and family; we analyse both corporate and retail clients in a relationship survey and at particular points of contact;  We collect suggestions and assessments directly from clients thanks to digital solutions. For two years, we have been collecting customer feedback with the use of the Share your opinion option in the transaction system. In this way thousands of clients can share their thoughts about the bank. In 2019, we received a total of 142,732 scores, out of which 51,826 included comments.  We also introduced the design thinking methodology to design processes and services for clients and employees. Design thinking is a method for launching products and services based on understanding of users' needs and problems. What is important from the point of view of the strategy, the first stage of the method is emphatisation, i.e. gaining broad knowledge about the client. We have appointed a group of mDesigners design thinking coaches who support projects using own expertise. Using this methodology we worked on new mobile app functionalities and cash management for travellers (travel mode). We also designed a tool for checking the status of applications for a mortgage loan in the transaction system and the model of assistance to be applied in retail branches. We also developed new standards for consultants and advisors, designed insurance project and communication project in procedure of mortgage loan granting and servicing. As testers, clients help us design and test new solutions. We encourage our clients to take part in surveys and workshops in 2019, approximately 200 clients attended meetings in our mLab. Within the Client's friend initiative, clients provided us with 7,138 suggestions. We listen to our clients, analyse their needs, and improve our processes, products and services accordingly. 21 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  We make it easier for customers with disabilities by providing them service which accommodates their special needs. The initiatives taken to improve access of persons with disabilities to financial services have been described in section Key information. Efficiency/operations At mBank we strive for efficiency both in serving our customers and performing operations invisible for outside world, but crucial for correct, quick and secure functioning of the bank. GOOD PRACTICE – DIGITALL PROGRAMME In 2019, we continued the initiatives within the scope of the DigitAll programme. We implemented a standardised process maturity and quality matrix in the entire Operations area to continually increase process effectiveness. By carrying out initiatives and ongoing inspections, we optimised processes, thus increasing the efficiency of the Operations area by more than 10%. We finalised the implementation of the Business Process Management System, a platform for managing and automating complex business processes, where subsequent processes are successfully launched in various areas of the bank. In order to ensure ongoing, continual analysis, optimisation, and monitoring of the effects of changes made to processes, we selected the provider of a process mining tool. Its implementation will be continued in 2020. After the verification of the best solutions available on the market, we selected a provider and launched the platform for managing electronic documentation (ECM, Enterprise Content Management). We are migrating data and reducing the scope of existing document repositories. The first migrations were successful. Further migrations and deactivation of repositories are planned. In the IT area, goals in the field of effectiveness were defined in the Effect programme. Within the programme, we focused on optimising the infrastructure use. Last year, we successfully consolidated data centres. We increased the utilisation of current resources (mass storage and servers) and optimised the resource purchasing process. Moreover, under the Effect programme, software must be developed so as to only use the required infrastructure capacity and manage efficiency well. Thanks to these activities, we reduced the IT costs growth rate more than twice. Additionally, changes made to the infrastructure have made its maintenance easier. Moreover, it enhanced infrastructure security and efficiency. GOOD PRACTICE – BANKING PROCESSES’ ROBOTIZATION In 2019, we continued the cooperation with Digital Teammates (DTM) in the scope of robotising back-office processes. Since the beginning of 2018, robots have been working in the Operations area, in particular by supporting teams responsible for payments, monitoring, and instructions. Process automation makes it possible to cope with increased and one-off workloads, e.g. occurring as a result of regulatory requests, 22 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 without the need to raise the headcount. Currently, robots provided by DTM handle 39 processes at mBank. The robots perform, among others, the following tasks: codziennie księgują otrzymane w raporcie Excel koszty, opłaty i prowizje dotyczące płatności. Uzupełniają niezbędne dane w aplikacjach i autoryzują transakcje, zgodnie z wytycznymi;  entering accounts for costs, fees and commissions related to payments (which they receive in Excel files) on a daily basis. They introduce required data in apps and authorise transactions based on relevant guidelines,  supporting employees at the key stages of handling insurance policies (pertaining to mortgage loans and car loans), i.e. registering relevant applications in the app, uploading document scans and entering client data in the archiving app. At the final stage of the process, robots verify if human-entered data were correctly copied to other banking systems and correct them if necessary,  facilitating the preparation of bank references and credit opinions. The robots search for necessary data in the banking systems based on a client’s instruction. Then, they enter the data in the bank reference/credit opinion form, which is then submitted to the client. In parallel to increasing effectiveness in Operations and IT, a project aimed at creating a single data warehouse has been implemented at the bank in the recent years. Thanks to these efforts, Common Data Layer (CDL), a single platform containing detailed data from the areas of corporate banking, retail banking, and brokerage operations, was established. CDL functions as a data warehouse, which uses a logical relational data model to link data from key areas of the bank, such as the general ledger, client data, contracts, agreements, products etc. All data warehouse users can apply uniform definitions of terms available in CDL thanks to the Dictionary of Business Terms. We strive to ensure a high level of CDL data correctness. To this end, we have developed relevant quality principles in cooperation with the Data Quality Management (DQM) project team, which is responsible for enhancing data quality in the whole organisation. Mobility In 2019 we continued our systematic development of the mobile application. During this time, mBank provided 15 application updates, which confirms the organisation's ability to make agile changes and respond to customer expectations. The work on the application was mainly focused on improving usability and communication as well as sales activities. More information on mBank’s mobile app can be found in section “Innovativeness is who we are”. 23 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Financial objectives for 2016-2020 achieved in 2019 mBank Group financial aspirations and their achievement in periods allowing for comparison to the sector are presented in the table below.

It is a collection of inspiring games that help children learn the world of maths from an early age. The objective to avoid social and environmental conflicts indirectly involving mBank as a financial institution was achieved in 2016-2018. In 2019 some environmental organisations in Poland accused mBank of planning to finance the construction of a new coal-fired power plant unit in the Ostrołęka power plant. The We want to be a accusations were triggered by the fact that II. responsible lender. mBank facilitated bond issues for Enea (which owns the power plant). In fact, mBank only arranged the issue, while the proceeds from the issue were used to refinance existing debt. Enea did not receive any new money on that account. Pursuant to the Bonds Act, funds raised from a bond issue cannot be used for any purpose, in this case for the construction of the 28 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Ostrołęka C power plant, as the environmental organisations suggested. In 2016 we adopted the Policy on Servicing and Financing Reputation-Sensitive Industries. In 2018 we adopted the Renewable Energy Bank’s withdrawal from Sources Policy.

Detailed information is available under the address www.bkms-system.net . In 2019 we checked whether our employees know how to deal with ethical dilemmas, i.e. by asking about popularity of channels to report any doubts. The Ethics Officer launched an initiative to create an ethical training. As the Chief Ethics Officer, I want our employees from all levels of the organisation to consider the ethical aspect in every decision they make. We are learning how to talk about mistakes in an open way and learn from them. As part of my job I, among others, take part in creating ethical standards and implement them in the organisation, check if motions to the Management Board are in line with ethical principles, provide employees with analyses of ethical mistakes that we have committed and rectified or avoided together with the Management Board, and promote ethics at all levels of the organisation. Paulina Gasińska Plenipotentiary of the Management Board for Client-Centricity Culture and Client Relations, Chief Ethics Officer 34 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 We implemented ethics in mSygnał as an additional category where our employees can report unethical conduct the same way other wrongdoing can be reported. The Chief Ethics Officer has addressed ethics-related topics and dilemmas in many offsite meetings with employees, including call center consultants, ambassadors of the empathy strategy, and members of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. She also co-organised a manager conference on integrity, compliance and ethics for approximately 700 employees. Our Chief Ethics Officer was in charge of the ethics panel during the European Financial Congress. mBank’s anti-corruption policy 205-1 The policy provides guidelines for the identification and mitigation of corruption risks, the key principles of the code of ethics, and related responsibilities. No Management Board member, manager, employee or associate may justify corruption or bribery by invoking mBank’s interest. mBank follows a policy of zero tolerance for all forms of corruption, including accepting, offering, requesting, granting and giving consent for additional benefits, objects or payments in order to:  unlawfully influence a decision,  obtain or secure an illegal business advantage,  gain personal benefits. mBank’s Management Board and employees are required to avoid conflicts of personal and professional interest. They are prohibited from offering any undue benefits, in particular to central or local government officials, civil servants, and politicians. mBank prevents corruption in a system of three lines of defence. The first line of defence is comprised of the bank’s organisational units. The second line of defence is the Compliance Department which is responsible for setting and monitoring standards of compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations. The third line of defence is the Internal Audit Department, which evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the bank’s anti-corruption system. The bank expects its business partners (vendors, contractors, service providers who work with mBank and with its clients on behalf of the bank) to comply with the policy. Anticorruption provisions are included in each contract between the bank and a business partner. 205-2 In 2019, 69% members of the managing bodies and 100% of employees have been informed and received training on anti-corruption. 35 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 205-3 We identified no corruption incidents in 2019. Fraud Prevention Policy at mBank and whistleblowing The policy defines who, and how, is responsible for fraud prevention. The bank follows a policy of zero tolerance for all fraud and attempted fraud by the bank’s employees, clients, contractors, and third parties. mBank requires fair and lawful behaviour of all its employees, clients, and business partners. mBank’s fraud risk management cycle covers four stages:  fraud prevention risk assessment, early identification, and clear rules and mechanisms mitigating risk;  fraud detection implementation of fraud controls, monitoring systems and reporting channels;  fraud management every case of suspected crime to the detriment of mBank or its client is investigated and necessary steps are taken, including legal measures;  response clear rules for mitigating loss or damage, corrective mechanisms, lessons learned. mBank has implemented an electronic whistleblowing system, which ensures anonymity of whistle-blowers. It is accessible on all internet-enabled devices: https://client.bkmssystem.net/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=2brebank11&language=pol. Whistleblowing rules and the procedures for reviewing reports are defined in internal regulations as follows:  the identity of the whistle-blower and the person concerned is strictly confidential: their data must not be disclosed to third parties unless required by law;  the whistle-blower may set up an anonymous inbox to receive updates on actions taken in reaction to the report and/or to provide additional details;  every whistleblowing report is reviewed by authorised staff to ensure an objective, fair and impartial investigation;  mBank employees who report suspected fraud in good faith are protected from any form of repression. Reports are initially reviewed by staff of the Compliance Department. Filed in the system or otherwise, reports are investigated by authorised officers, as the case may be: employees of the Employee Development and Organisational Culture Department, employees of the Foreign Branches, the Ethics Officer, and employees of the Compliance Department. If a report is confirmed, the case is escalated according to the law and the bank’s internal regulations. The rules for reporting fraud to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are also clearly defined. They cover regular and ad-hoc reports. 36 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 947 63 Cases reported to the Banking Crime Cases reported to the Fraud Section Management Section Each report was investigated, and necessary measures were taken, including reporting to the authorities, freezing accounts. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-terrorism Financing Policy at mBank mBank follows the law and standards set for financial institutions.

We care deeply and consciously about relations as they are an important aspect of our activity. The trust of our stakeholders in financial institutions grows, and so does clients’ openness to new products and services. The quality of relations and the level of social trust are strongly linked with the bank’s operational results. Our mission and values reflect our particular care for social capital. Clients and their needs, emotions, and expectations are the most important for us. Social capital means trust, which is a currency equally important as money. Our products and services are used by individual clients, small and medium-sized enterprises, and big corporations, as well as public sector entities, including local governments. Social capital, therefore, forms a basis for new business and social ventures, investments and infrastructure used by the society as a whole.

We utilise electricity, thermal energy, water, and office supplies (paper and toners). We use electrical devices which must be replaced with new ones every now and then (computers, printers, telephones). Well-developed IT infrastructure requires cooling, which uses electricity. Our employees travel for business using mBank’s car fleet, which causes fuel consumption. We promote mobile banking channels, i.e. handling as many bank-related matters as possible without going to the bank’s branch, which minimises our clients’ potential need to use a car to reach the bank. We also promote electronic communication tools in the workplace by allowing our employees to organise videoconferences in place of going to meetings. As regards our indirect impact, we support sustainable development of others. We implement the policy for financing investments in renewable energy sources. The bank no longer finances new coal mines and coal-fired power plant units. Since 2019 mBank’s Private Banking clients have been able to invest in line with ESG standards in portfolios containing shares and bonds of issuers that generate a positive social or environmental impact.

Many economic indicators hit ten-year lows. This was down to, among others, an abrupt increase in fiscal uncertainty caused by the escalation of the Sino-American trade and economic war; problems experienced by some sectors of the economy (in particular the automotive and semiconductor industries); as well as inherent factors, such as the waning fiscal stimulus in the USA and further weakening of domestic consumption in China. The economy stabilised only in the autumn when a truce was reached in the US-China trade war with global industry indicators starting to grow by the end of the year. The gap between relatively good consumer and services sector sentiment and the sentiment of the industrial sector persisted throughout 2019. The Polish economy was almost unaffected by the condition of the global economy for most of the past year. This was caused by a relatively high increase in domestic consumption, i.e. continued fast growth in the key components of Poland’s economic cycle (i.e. private consumption and investment). However, this does not mean that Poland was totally immune to the global economic slowdown. On the contrary, economic indicators and other short-term economic figures were in a downward trend. GDP growth fell from 4.8% year on year in Q1 to approximately 3.1% year on year in Q4. As a consequence, the Polish economy is likely to have grown by 4.1% in the whole of 2019 compared with 5.1% a year before. 53 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Contributions to GDP growth 9 6,8 6,2 6 5,1 5,0 4,9 5,1 3,9 3,8 4,1 3,6 3,3 3,1 2,8 3 1,6 1,6 1,4 0 -3 2020f 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019f Investment Net exports Consumption Inventories GDP YoY (%) Private consumption and investment were the two main drivers of the economy. The sources of the consumption boom (private consumption continued to grow by over 4% year on year throughout 2019) have been already extensively discussed. It is worth reiterating that it was propelled by favourable situation on the labour market (record-low unemployment), fast-rising household incomes (especially from contract-based employment), unflinching consumer optimism, relatively high immigration to Poland, highly active real property market, and solid growth in consumer credit. In 2019, these factors were reinforced by the fiscal stimulus comprising social benefits and personal income tax cuts (accounting for approx. 1.8% of GDP in total). Investment was volatile and followed a downward trajectory throughout the year. The year began with an over 12% increase in investment spurred by the completion of public investment projects and an abrupt rise in investment projects implemented by foreign companies. It is likely to have ended with a slight year-on-year decrease mainly due to a slowdown in public investment – central and local government investment spending fell compared with the previous year already in Q3 to decrease even further by the end of the year. The past year was marked by a fast increase in inflation, making it probably the most exciting and talked-about Polish economic indicator of 2019. Growth in consumer prices accelerated from 0.7% year on year in January to 3.4% year on year in December. This trajectory was down to several factors. Firstly, 2019 saw a fast increase in food prices, which affected almost all components of the basket, including the most volatile ones. It was caused, among others, by agricultural drought in Central Europe, spread of the ASF virus in Asia, and the impact of rising labour costs on processed food prices. Secondly, core inflation was on an upward trajectory throughout 2019. With 3.1% the December reading was one of the highest in history. The increase in core inflation was down to a combination of factors, including: an increase in regulated prices, the end of price wars on the mobile network and cable TV markets, growing labour costs pushing up the prices of services, and rising prices of public services. Prices of energy carriers and effects of the electricity price freeze (which, as a result of the electricity excise duty cut, were classified by Statistics Poland as a decrease in the price of electricity supplied to households) were among the few factors that pushed inflation down. 54 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 CPI inflation and NBP reference rate 5% 4% 3% 2% 1% 0% -1% -2% 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Repo rate Repo rate forecast CPI inflation CPI forecast Monetary policy 2019 was another year of monetary stability with interest rates remaining flat throughout the year. The Monetary Policy Council’s rhetoric was becoming more dovish along with the deterioration in global sentiment. At the same time, neither the Polish economic data, nor inflation readings encouraged the Council to soften or tighten its stance. Projections assuming weaker growth and inflation remaining close to the target over the next two years added to the rationale for an unchanged monetary policy. At the end of the year, the MPC’s declarations to keep interest rates unchanged were extended by the end of its current term of office. PLN quotations The zloty remained stable throughout 2019. It appreciated against the euro by approximately PLN 0.04 (from PLN 4.30 to PLN 4.26) but slid by PLN 0.10 against the Swiss franc (from PLN 3.82 to PLN 3.92) and by PLN 0.04 against the US dollar (from PLN 3.76 to PLN 3.80 at the end of the year). The changes against USD and CHF derive largely from a moderate weakening of the euro against a basket of other currencies in 2019, whereas the appreciation of the zloty against Europe’s single currency deserves a comment. It can be attributed to both domestic and foreign factors. The former include CJEU’s ruling on foreign currency mortgages and growing concerns about inflation growth in Poland at the end of the year. The latter comprise monetary loosening by central banks, which triggered an inflow of portfolio capital to emerging markets. Nevertheless, the entire year was marked by low fluctuations, compared with both the previous years and other emerging market assets. Consequently, to Poland, being a sound and open economy, the exchange rate is no longer a factor mitigating adverse shocks. 55 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Curency exchange rates in 2019 4,60 4,40 4,20 4,00 3,80 3,60 3,40 Mar.19 Jul.19 Jan.19 Feb.19 Apr.19 May.19 Jun.19 Aug.19 Sep.19 Oct.19 Nov.19 Dec.19 EUR/PLN USD/PLN CHF/PLN Governments Bonds Those who expected market interest rates to decline were again the biggest winners on the market for Treasury debt securities. At the end of 2019, bond yields and swap rates fell from the levels reported at the beginning of the year. In August 2019 yield curves hit a record-low with all rates falling to their lowest since 2015. Despite better sentiment on global markets and the end of monetary loosening conducted by the main central banks, yields on ten-year Polish Treasury debt securities are currently quite similar to the yields on their US counterparts. Throughout the year the market was affected by several trends: mounting fears over global economic growth, especially in the second half of the year; low supply of Treasury debt securities (resulting from strong fiscal performance); inflows and outflows of capital from emerging markets in response to decreases and increases (respectively) of market interest rates in the United States and in Europe. Judging from the performance of the Polish bond market in 2019, it seems clear that it represents features characteristic of a developed rather than an emerging-market economy.

Growth in household loans accelerated from 5.6% to 5.7% year on year (net of the FX effect), whereas corporate lending advanced by 3.3% from the previous year (down from 6.7%). The former category deserves more attention. The strongest growth in retail loans since 2012 was driven by a nearly two-digit surge in consumer credit and recordbreaking sales of real property loans. The quarterly origination of the latter (PLN 16.9 billion in Q3 2019) hit a historic high in the PLN-denominated loans category. The entire 2019 is likely to have seen a record-high volume of new loans, exceeding PLN 60 billion, thereby breaking the 2008 record. It stems directly from the highly active real property market and upbeat consumer sentiment. Consumer credit, in turn, should be treated as a gauge lagging behind the consumption cycle; in other words, it supports consumption at the time of a slowdown rather than fuels it during a revival. The corporate lending segment witnessed a major shift in the lending structure with investment loans systematically replacing real property loans and overdraft facilities (in consequence, the total volume of corporate loans decreased). On the one hand, it was caused by the relatively small role of bank loans in financing investments, and, on the other hand, by lower demand for liquidity due to the waning effects of salary increases and tax system tightening.

Household deposits were rising by 10%-12% in the course of the year, while growth in corporate deposits jumped from 3.7% to 10.3% year on year. Retail deposit stabilisation was largely due to the fiscal stimulus and rotation of households’ assets (high inflow of money to the market for new homes continued). In addition, it was propped up by an increase in the household savings ratio. High growth (in relation to the previous years and close to the multiannual average) in corporate deposits is attributable to lower pressure on financial performance in the enterprises sector (slower growth in salaries accompanied by rising inflation), the weak increase in investment, and waning effects of tax system tightening. 57 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Poland: Household loans and deposits 16% 14% 12% 10% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% Jan.12 Jul.12 Jan.13 Jul.13 Jan.14 Jul.14 Jan.15 Jul.15 Jan.16 Jul.16 Jan.17 Jul.17 Jan.18 Jul.18 Jan.19 Jul.19 Household deposits Household loans Mortgage loans Economy and the banking sector in the Czech Republic Key indicators Key macroeconomic 2019 Banking sector indicators 2019 parameters Real GDP growth rate 2.5% Base interest rate 2.00% (forecast) Nominal GDP per capita (EUR) 19,5001 Loan to Deposit ratio 72.8% GDP per capita in PPS (EU90.5%1 NPL ratio 2.5% 28=100) Average annual inflation rate 2.6% Total Capital Ratio (TCR) 20.3%1 Average annual 2.1% Return on Assets (ROA) 1.2%1 unemployment rate 10.6 Population Return on Equity (ROE) 16.0%1 million Source: Eurostat, Česká národní banka (CNB). 1 Cumulative data for 9 months (as at September 30, 2019) or the latest data available GDP, inflation, interest rates and FX rates Economic growth in the Czech Republic is expected to have slowed down from 3.0% in 2018 to 2.5% in 2019, the main reason being sluggish internal demand, as reflected mainly in weaker growth in investment (down from 7.2% to 1.1% year on year) and a modest slowdown in private consumption increase. Owing to its strong commercial ties with the euro zone and export-oriented nature, the Czech economy benefits when the global economy picks up (like in 2017), but is strongly affected during a slowdown (like in 2019). At the same time, a tightening labour market (Czech Republic has the lowest unemployment rate in the EU) and robust growth in salaries bode well for private 58 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 consumption. The inflow of EU funding fuels public investment, while easing trade tensions are expected to boost private investment. Czech GDP is expected to grow by an average of 2.1% annually in 2020-2021, which is roughly in line with the potential output growth rate. A dynamic increase in salaries and relatively fast economic growth (compared with the potential GDP growth rate) keep inflation high. The average annual inflation rate stood at 2.6% in 2019, while core inflation readings were even higher. In view of the mounting risk of inflation being persistently above the target in the medium term, the Czech National Bank (CNB) continued its monetary policy normalisation throughout 2019. At the end of 2019, the CNB’s reference rate stood at 2.00% and is among the region’s highest (only Romania has a higher rate). As the external environment of the Czech economy was in equilibrium, the start of monetary policy normalisation did not cause rapid appreciation of the koruna. The CNB is expected to abide by its current policy in the quarters to come, although at a reduced pace. Banking sector The favourable developments recorded in the Czech financial sector in past years continued into 2019. Good economic conditions were reflected in growth of the assets of the banking sector, which managed to maintain high profitability. Czech banks benefited mainly from rising monetary policy rates and their slower transmission to deposit rates than to loan rates, which allowed for a rebound of net interest margin. This, together with growing volumes, resulted in a double-digit increase of net interest income. A six-year downtrend of net fee and commission income was halted in 2018, but persisting competitive pressure has hindered any visible improvement of the line. Profits of the Czech banks have been also boosted by exceptionally low risk costs thanks to minor default rate, good recovery performance and some sales of impaired receivables. Asset quality remained very resilient as demonstrated by a further decrease of NPL ratio to 2.5% at the end of 2019 from 3.3% observed a year earlier, which is the lowest level compared to other countries in the CEE region. Funding and liquidity profiles continued to be solid with the sector’s loan-to-deposit ratio of 72.8%. Czech banks have been very well-capitalized. However, responding to the risk associated with the phase of the business cycle, the central bank (ČNB) has been gradually rising the countercyclical capital buffer rate. It amounted to 1.50% in H2 2019, and starting from January 2020 was raised by 25 basis points to 1.75%, while another increase to 2.00% has been announced with effect from July 2020. 59 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The Czech Republic: Household Loans and Deposits (YoY dynamics) 12% 10% 8% 6% 4% 2% 0% Dec.10 Jun.11 Dec.11 Jun.12 Dec.12 Jun.13 Dec.13 Jun.14 Dec.14 Jun.15 Dec.15 Jun.16 Dec.16 Jun.17 Dec.17 Jun.18 Dec.18 Jun.19 Dec.19 Household deposits Household loans Mortgage loans The growth in total loans to households maintained above 6% in 2019, but the annual dynamics decelerated slightly compared to the 2 preceding years. The development was predominantly driven by mortgage loans, which expanded by 9.3% from December 2018, while the volume of consumer and other loans showed a much slower increase during the same period. The ČNB tightened mortgage lending conditions as of October 2018, stating that the loan should not exceed nine times the net annual income of applicants, who should also spend no more than 45% of their net monthly income on debt service. The ČNB also recommended that the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio should not exceed 90% and that a LTV of over 80% should be for only 15% of loans provided by banks. The share of nonperforming loans in the total volume of loans to households was 1.7% in December 2019, declining from 2.1% at the end of 2018. After a slight slowdown in Q1 2018, the annual growth pace of household deposits regained to 8% in December 2018 and then it inverted again, approaching to 6.5% at the end of 2019. The maturity structure of deposit base was evolving significantly in 2013-2018, with demand deposits rising at double-digit rate and term deposits falling on average by 5% annually. However, 2019 brought some reversal of this long-lasting trend as inflows to term deposits reappeared.

After an acceleration at the turn of the year, the annual dynamics stabilized in the range of 3-4% in H2 2019. The share of nonperforming loans in the total volume of loans to non-financial corporations has been constantly declining since 2011 and amounted to 3.2% at the end of 2019, compared to 3.6% a year earlier. Corporate deposits decelerated visibly during 2018, reaching near zero growth pace in September. Then, the dynamics restored and oscillated around 5% in H2 2019. Economy and the banking sector in Slovakia Key indicators Key macroeconomic 2019 Banking sector indicators 2019 parameters Real GDP growth rate 2.7% Base interest rate 0.00% (forecast) Nominal GDP per capita (EUR) 16,5001 Loan to Deposit ratio 104.5% GDP per capita in PPS (EU73.1%1 NPL ratio 2.6% 28=100) Average annual inflation rate 2.7% Total Capital Ratio (TCR) 18.3%1 Average annual 5.8% Return on Assets (ROA) 0.6%1 unemployment rate Population 5.4 Return on Equity (ROE) 6.5%1 million Source: Eurostat, Národná banka Slovenska (NBS). 1 Cumulative data for 9 months (as at September 30, 2019) or the latest data available GDP, inflation and interest rates The Slovak economy continues to grow steadily. After a 4.0% increase in GDP in 2018, the country’s economy is estimated to have grown by 2.7% in 2019 due to weaker growth in investment and private consumption. The slowdown in investment was driven by lower inflow of EU funds and mounting trade tensions. Private consumption, in turn, has slowed down compared to the record highs in 2017, but still remains strong. It benefits from the continuous improvement in the labour market, subdued inflation, and the resulting growth in real disposable incomes. As an Eurozone member, Slovakia has its reference rate set by the European Central Bank (ECB). In 2019 there was only one change in interest rates, i.e. a cut in the deposit facility rate. The inflation rate stood at 2.7% in 2019, up from the 2.5% rise in consumer prices observed a year before. The reading was inflated by some components of the core part of the inflation basket. Inflation in Slovakia is thus higher than the Eurozone average. The unemployment rate has been falling gradually since 2014 thanks to growing economic activity and creation of new jobs. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stood at 5.8% in December 2019 which represents a year-on-year decrease. 61 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Banking sector Although Slovak banks have operated in a relatively supportive economic environment in recent years, their profitability has remained lower than in many countries of the CEE region. The protracted period of ultra-low interest rates has continued to put pressure on their business model. In 2019, a further expanding lending activity was not enough to compensate for falling net interest margin, what resulted in negative dynamics of net interest income and consequently a marginal decline of total banking revenues. In addition, banks in Slovakia have been paying the special levy, which at present is set at 0.2% of total liabilities per year and costs the sector around 18% of its net profit on average. A key counterbalancing factor has been development of loan impairment provisions. The credit risk costs have descended significantly over the past years and is now at a historically low level, but the default rate has stopped falling. The improvement of asset quality was mainly the result of both dynamic expansion in loans and a decline in the stock of non-performing receivables. The NPL ratio for Slovakia is among lowest in the CEE region, reaching 2.6% at the end of 2019 and dropping from 2.7% a year earlier. The overall loanto-deposit ratio continued to be above 100% in 2019, but did not materially change compared to the end of 2018. The Slovak banking sector’s resilience has been strengthened by its increasing capital adequacy. However, at its meeting in July 2019, the Board of Slovak National Bank decided to increase the countercyclical capital buffer rate for Slovak exposures by 50 basis points, to 2.0% of risk weighted assets, with effect from August 2020. Slovakia: Household Loans and Deposits (YoY dynamics) 18% 15% 12% 9% 6% 3% 0% Dec.10 Jun.11 Dec.11 Jun.12 Dec.12 Jun.13 Dec.13 Jun.14 Dec.14 Jun.15 Dec.15 Jun.16 Dec.16 Jun.17 Dec.17 Jun.18 Dec.18 Jun.19 Dec.19 Household deposits Household loans Mortgage loans The growth rate of total loans to households gradually moderated in 2019, to 8.0% at yearend. The slowdown was particularly large in the case of consumer loans. Its main causes were the central bank’s tightening of regulatory lending requirements and the incipient saturation of certain market segments. The volume of new housing loans has surged, partly due to borrowers taking advantage of lower rates to refinance or top up their existing loans. The portfolio expanded by more than 10% for most of the year. The continuing high loan growth has largely reflected strong demand supported by a longrunning uptrend in borrowing capacity. According to the local central bank, thanks to 62 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 wage growth and falling interest rates, the loans that borrowers can afford are one-third higher now than they were in 2016. This increase is roughly consistent with the rise in residential prices over the same period. The share of non-performing loans in the total volume of loans to households remained broadly stable and reached 2.9% in December 2019. Development of retail deposits showed a constant downward trend from mid-2016 and bottomed out in Q1 2018. Then, client inflows accelerated, what translated into faster annual dynamics, which stabilized at around 7% in H2 2019. Since the mid-2013 the structure of household deposit base has been changing. The volume of term deposits has been mostly decreasing over the past years, what was more than compensated by strong growth of retail demand deposits, which continued to expand by more than 10% in 2019. Slovakia: Corporate Loans and Deposits (YoY dynamics) 20% 15% 10% 5% 0% -5% -10% Dec.10 Jun.11 Dec.11 Jun.12 Dec.12 Jun.13 Dec.13 Jun.14 Dec.14 Jun.15 Dec.15 Jun.16 Dec.16 Jun.17 Dec.17 Jun.18 Dec.18 Jun.19 Dec.19 Corporate deposits Corporate loans In 2017, the corporate credit market was in the expansionary phase of its cycle, with the average annual growth rate oscillating at around 7-8%. For most of 2018, the volume increase remained slightly decelerated to mid-single digit, while the pace advanced to 7.0% in December. The Slovak economy’s recent slowdown had an impact on the activity of enterprises in H2 2019. The year-on-year increase in total loans to this segment decelerated to around 4%, mostly driven by lower financing granted for investments and contracts with terms longer than one year. The share of non-performing loans in the total volume of loans to non-financial corporations decreased to 3.3% at the end of 2019 from 3.7% in 2018. After an acceleration of corporate deposits from mid-2017 to a local peak in Q1 2018, the year-on-year dynamics visibly slowed down and finally recorded 0% in April 2019. In H2 2019, the annual growth rebounded and ended the year at around 5%. 63 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Market and regulatory environment mBank Group is an active participant and often a leader of changes introduced in expectation of and in response to developments in its environment, including the area of regulations and technology. The Group employees spare no effort in proactively adjusting the offer and principles of operation to new challenges, always with an eye on building top quality relationships with stakeholders. Some of the requirements imposed on mBank and the Group subsidiaries do not affect clients directly, but still involve a heavy workload connected with adjusting internal processes. Below we discuss selected key developments significantly affecting mBank Group observed in 2019 or expected in the nearest future. Capital requirements and regulations on accounting and reporting standards have been addressed in dedicated sections of the report. Clients and products Ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union dated October 3, 2019, in case C260/18 (Dziubak vs Raiffeisen Bank International AG) On October 3, 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued the ruling in the prejudicial mode regarding a mortgage linked to the Swiss franc granted by a Polish bank. The submitted prejudicial questions were to determine, among other things, if a generally applicable custom can be used where there is no provision in domestic law that could replace an abusive exchange rate clause. In accordance with CJEU’s ruling, the question of abusiveness will be decided by Polish courts. CJEU did not refer to this issue. In addition, CJEU did not make a clear-cut decision regarding the consequences of an exchange rate clause being considered abusive by a domestic court. However, the possibility of a credit agreement being performed further in PLN and with interest calculated according to LIBOR was found doubtful by the Court. If an exchange rate clause is found abusive, a domestic court must decide whether the agreement in question can be performed further or should be declared invalid, taking into account the client’s will and the consequences of invalidity for the client. CJEU approved the application of a disposable norm (in the bank’s opinion article 358 of the Polish Civil Code referring to the NBP fixing rate can be considered to be a disposable norm), if the invalidity of the agreement would be unfavourable for the client. CJEU rejected the application of general provisions referring to a custom or equity principles. There are individual court proceedings initiated against mBank by its customers in connection with CHF loan agreements. Out of the individual proceedings, 2,902 proceedings with the total value of claims amounting to PLN 430.1 million related to indexation clauses in CHF loan agreements and include claims for declaring invalidity of the loan agreements in part (i.e. to the extent that the agreement contains contractual provisions related to indexation) or in whole. The final rulings to-date in the indexation clauses proceedings are favourable to the Bank in the majority of the cases. As far as the legal proceedings relating to indexation clauses in mortgage and housing loans in CHF are concerned, in the opinion of the Management Board of the bank, the current state of judicial decisions is unstable and the line of verdicts is not consistent, 64 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 hence it is extremely difficult to estimate the level of provisions for the legal risk associated with this portfolio of loans. The bank believes that currently observed market practice of implementing of portfolio approach towards creation of provisions for legal risk relating to such cases is to some extent the response to ongoing public debate and position of audit firms. These methodologies are burdened with numerous doubts and assumptions that reflect current court cases statistics and the level of understanding of extremely diversified judgments that cannot yet be interpreted as a shaping line of verdicts at this stage. In the opinion of the Management Board of the bank a large part of court judgments unfavourable to banks results from misunderstanding of the essence of banking activity, which is reflected in the content of justifications for judgments issued. They undermine the basic paradigms of banking activity and regulatory directives to which banks are subject, which can lead to a deep redefinition of banking activity and questioning the current understanding of such categories as loan and interest. Detailed information concerning proceedings before a court, arbitration body or public administration authority are described in the Note 32 of the mBank S.A. Group IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements 2019. mBank Group’s approach to the calculation of legal risk provisions related to the indexation clauses in the CHF loans agreements is described in greater detail in Note 4 Major estimates and judgments made in connection with the application of accounting policy principles. Real estate financing – Recommendation S of PFSA On December 3, 2019, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) passed amendments to Recommendation S, a best-practice guideline for the management of mortgage-backed credit exposures. The amended recommendation sets out new principles for offering fixed rate or semi-fixed rate mortgages by banks and allows clients to change their existing floating rate loans into fixed rate (or semi-fixed rate) loans. In addition, the recommendation introduces a new “key for debt” option, under which a client who transfers the ownership of a real property financed by a bank loan to the bank has his/her debt cancelled by the lender. However, the new Recommendation S does not oblige banks to offer this new solution, but only sets out the best practice for its application. When launching a new product, in particular fixed rate (or semi-fixed rate) loans, banks are obliged to provide clients with full information about the product and the risk it carries as well as to sell the product to clients according to their needs and understanding. Commercial banks must comply with the amended Recommendation S by December 31, 2020. Act on Amending the Act on Assistance to Home Loan Borrowers in a Difficult Financial Situation and Certain Other Acts On July 4, 2019, the Sejm passed the Act on Assistance to Home Loan Borrowers in a Difficult Financial Situation, which entered into force on January 1, 2020. The new regulation modifies the eligibility criteria for borrowers, in particular, by raising the minimum income entitling borrowers to apply for assistance, increasing the monthly support from the Fund from PLN 1,500 to PLN 2,000, and extending the period of assistance from 18 to 36 months and the period of interest-free repayment from 8 to 12 65 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 years. In addition, the act provides for a partial cancellation of debts owed to the Fund, in particular, for borrowers who repay their instalments in a timely manner. Moreover, a borrower who sells a property financed by a bank loan may apply to the Borrower Support Fund for an interest-free loan when the proceeds from the sale are too low to cover the borrower’s debt in whole, on the terms and conditions applicable to borrowers applying for assistance in the repayment of credit instalments. The said regulations apply to borrowers who took out loans in the Polish złoty and in foreign currencies. Ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union dated September 11, 2019, in case C-383/18, announcement of the Polish Bank Association on starting work on amending the Consumer Credit Act, resolution of the Supreme Court dated December 12, 2019 In its judgement of September 11, 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that Article 16 (1) of Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC must be interpreted as meaning that the right of the consumer to a reduction in the total cost of a credit in the event of early repayment of the credit includes all the costs imposed on the consumer. The CJEU ruling, its consequences, and their implications are currently subject to economic and legal analyses. Detailed information about actions taken by mBank to comply with the ruling is provided in Note 4 to the mBank S.A. Group IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements 2019. Act of August 30, 2019, on Amending the Bankruptcy Act and Certain Other Acts The purpose of amendments to the Bankruptcy Act passed in 2019 is to simplify and facilitate the consumer bankruptcy process. The amended regulations apply to consumers unable to repay their debts. They serve to write off the debts of insolvent debtors and help creditors recover (collect) their receivables. Most of the new regulations will enter into force on March 24, 2020. The potential consequences of their introduction include a rising number of consumers declaring bankruptcy and new restrictions on debt collection under bankruptcy proceedings that may be imposed on banks. Secure banking Strong customer authentication under PSD2 On September 14, 2019, banks implemented strong customer authentication in accordance with the Payment Services Act of August 19, 2011 and EU regulations on payment services and strong customer authentication. It introduces an additional security step for clients logging in to their accounts and for payment transactions. Strong authentication uses at least two of the following three elements: something the user knows (e.g. PIN), something the user has (e.g. phone app) and something the user is (biometric data). For more information about mBank’s actions taken to implement the new regulations, go to our website: https://www.mbank.pl/psd2/strona-glowna/. Register of Beneficial Owners 66 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The Ministry of Finance has published on its website a Central Register of Beneficial Owners (Polish: CRBR) in accordance with the Act of March 1, 2018 on Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing. The purpose is to collect and process information on beneficial owners of companies, i.e. natural persons controlling companies, either directly or indirectly. By April 13, 2020 selected companies are obliged to register in CRBR, while information on new companies and changes in data registered in CRBR must be provided within seven days from the date of incorporation or the date of registration in the National Court Register (KRS), whichever applies. The purpose of maintaining a public register offering free access to information on beneficial owners is to improve confidence in the financial market and participants of business transactions. Act of August 30, 2019, on Amending the Code of Commercial Partnerships and Companies and Certain Other Acts The act provides for mandatory dematerialisation of shares of non-public joint-stock companies and limited joint-stock partnerships. It means that every shareholder will be mandatorily entered in registers kept by entities indicated in the act, e.g. banks or brokerage houses. The amendments serve to improve the transparency of the capital market, give tax authorities enhanced access to shareholder information, and to counteract money laundering. In addition, the act obligates joint-stock companies and limited joint-stock partnerships to run their own websites for the required communication with shareholders. Stance of the PFSA on the application of EBA Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements On September 16, 2019, the Office of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) announced its intention to apply the Guidelines on outsourcing arrangements published by the European Banking Authority (EBA) on February 25, 2019 (EBA/GL/2019/02). The guidelines set out principles for managing outsourcing arrangements, in particular critical or important functions outsourced to service providers. Among others, the guidelines set out detailed requirements concerning the minimum content of outsourcing arrangements as well as principles of selecting service providers, developing exit plans, and managing risk inherent in the process. Banks have been obliged to comply with the guidelines by June 30, 2020 with the exception of cloud outsourcing, which will be governed by a national framework. Apart from facilitating the management of outsourcing arrangements at banks, the revised guidelines also seek to address the technological development and digitalisation in the sector. Act on Strengthening Financial Market Supervision and Protection of Investors July 1, 2019, was the effective date of new tighter regulations on bond issues and the resulting disclosure obligations introduced under the Act of November 9, 2018 on Amending Certain Acts in Connection with Strengthening Financial Market Supervision and Protection of Financial Market Investors. Aiming at greater transparency and security of bond issues, the regulations stipulate, among others, mandatory dematerialisation of securities and their registration in the securities depository, and 67 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 oblige issuers to involve an issue agent in the process, i.e. a professional entity tasked with verifying whether an issue complies with law. Organisational changes arising from new regulations Act on Employee Capital Plans On January 1, 2019, the Act on Employee Capital Plans (Polish: PPK) entered into force. It establishes legal framework for a universal and voluntary pension savings system. In line with the assumptions of the government’s Strategy for Responsible Development, PPK may increase not only the individual pension savings of employees, but also the overall savings in Poland and give a positive boost to the capital market. On July 1, 2019, employees of the largest companies were the first to join the programme. The act affects the operation of banks both directly (with banks being employers withholding PPK contributions) and indirectly (via its presence on presumably revived the capital market, on which financial institutions play an active role). Recommendation B restricting banks’ investment activity On March 26, 2019, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority released the amended recommendation on investment risk management at banks. The recommendation reflects supervisory expectations and good practices regarding banks’ proprietary investments in financial instruments or shares in companies, but not in derivatives. Among others, the recommendation outlines expectations about investment strategy and policy, staff qualifications and internal procedures that banks must have in place, in keeping with the proportionality principle. Act of January 17, 2019, on Amending the Act on the Bank Guarantee Fund, Deposit Guarantee Scheme and Resolution and Certain Other Acts (the “BFG Act”) On March 7, 2019, the amended BFG Act setting out detailed principles of banks’ resolution entered into force. Its purpose is to streamline the resolution procedure and strengthen the deposit guarantee scheme. In particular, a new category of claims satisfied from the bankruptcy estate of a bank was added to Bankruptcy Law in order to improve the effectiveness of the bail-in tool. Moreover, the PFSA was further empowered to decide on the takeover of a bank by another bank when the conditions set out in law materialise (e.g. when a bank’s own funds fall below the required minimum) and the BFG was authorised to support this process. At the same time, mortgage banks were exempt from certain provisions of the act and the obligation to include the bail-in clause in the terms and conditions of issue and in financial instruments agreements was limited. In April 2019, the PFSA permitted the BFG to set up the first bridge bank in Poland (“Pierwszy Bank BFG”) as its sole owner. In December 2019 another bridge bank was set up, under the name “Bank Nowy BFG”. In accordance with the BFG Act, a bridge bank, being one of the resolution tools, allows for continuing the critical functions of a bank 68 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 placed under resolution and protects the financial stability of the banking sector after the resolution procedure has been instigated. In January 2020 a dedicated part of cooperative bank Podkarpacki Bank Spółdzielczy, which is under resolution, was moved to Bank Nowy BFG. CRR 2 and CRD 5 On June 7, 2019, a package including CRR 2 and CRD 5 was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. The regulations govern long-term liquidity (introduction of NSFR), market risk in the trading book, leverage ratio, interest rate risk in the banking book, proportionality principle and special approach to financing SMEs and infrastructure projects. The broad scope covered by the package requires banks to make numerous adjustments, e.g. as far as measurement of capital used by products or stress testing are concerned, but the transitional provisions give banks time to gradually adjust to the new regulatory framework. At the same time, discussions about the Basel IV areas not covered by the CRR 2/CRD 5 package, in particular the revision of the standardised approach and the IRB approach for credit risk, are underway. Banks take active part in analysing the proposed solutions. IFRS 16 Starting from January 1, 2019, institutions applying the International Financial Reporting Standards are obliged to comply with IFRS 16 Leases. The obligation to recognise lease contracts in the balance sheet (not in the off-balance sheet as before) affects the level of financial ratios. At mBank we have analysed all contracts falling within the scope of the standard. We adjusted our accounting policy and operational procedures. Moreover, we modified our IT systems to improve data collection and processing. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/482 of March 22, 2019, amending Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1368 establishing a list of critical benchmarks used in financial markets pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council On March 26, 2019, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/482 entered into force. Under the regulation, the Warsaw Interbank Offered Rate (WIBOR) was recognised by the European Commission as a critical benchmark. The decision was an element of a broader reform of benchmarks used to determine the price of many financial instruments and financial contracts. Since WIBOR was recognised as a critical benchmark, the period for bringing it into compliance with the EU Benchmarks Regulation (Regulation 2016/1011 of June 8, 2016 or BMR) was extended by two years. As a result, GPW Benchmark S.A. (WIBOR administrator) is obliged to implement all necessary modifications by the end of 2021. On July 19, 2019, the PFSA published its stance on the standard for the provision of benchmarks arising from Regulation 2016/1011 in which it emphasized the need to remain flexible in determining benchmarks due to the volatility of financial markets. In accordance with the PFSA’s stance, lenders are obliged to inform consumers about the names of benchmarks and their administrators, 69 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 while the responsibility for defining and formulating the method for determining benchmarks rests with benchmark administrators. mBank Group’s market position of segments mBank vs sector Net interest margin Cost-to-income ratio 2.63% vs 2.51% 50.5% vs 55.4% *including banking tax Return on Assets Return on Equity 0.66% vs 0.75% 6.6% vs 7.1% Our objective is to provide an attractive offer to a wide range of clients while achieving business and financial goals.

Its stake increased gradually from 21.0% in 1995 to 50.0% in 2000 and 72.2% in 2003. Starting from 2005, Commerzbank’s stake has declined due to the implementation of the managerial options programmes at the bank. As at the end of 2019, Commerzbank AG held 69.31% of shares and votes at the General Meeting. The remaining 30.69% of mBank shares in free float are held mainly by financial investors, including Polish pension funds, and Polish and foreign investment funds. Nationale-Nederlanden Otwarty Fundusz Emerytalny holds the largest stake. Periodically, i.e. by 28 January and from 24 September to 16 October 2019, Nationale-Nederlanden OFE held more than 5.0% of shares and votes at the Annual General Meeting of mBank. The third largest shareholder of mBank was AVIVA Otwarty Fundusz Emerytalny AVIVA BZ WBK. Performance of shares in 2019 The situation on the WSE is largely affected by the situation on foreign stock markets and by foreign investor sentiment towards the emerging markets basket. In 2019 shares listed in the US were affected, among others, by fears of a bear market after a long growth period and tensions between the US and China in the aftermath of tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by the US administration. In Western Europe, sentiment on stock markets was driven, in particular, by Brexit, economic slowdown, and the European Parliament election. Despite all the risks, most global and European indices rose in 2019. The rates of return on the WSE indices fell behind the developed stock markets and emerging markets from our region. 2019 was a mixed year for the WSE. Compared with 2018, broad-based WIG Index remained practically unchanged (+0.2% year on year). Only a few companies could boast robust rates of return. This was the case mainly for small companies, especially from the IT industry, game producers, and photovoltaic firms. In 2019 there was no strong demand stimulus on the part of foreign investors or domestic institutional investors. Pension funds continued the sell-off of Polish shares. Investors redeemed their shares in investment funds in response to the GetBack case and issues connected with investment funds associated with the troubled debt collector. Shares of large corporations performed disappointingly. Throughout 2019 WIG-20 Index sank by 5.6%. Only seven companies included in WIG20 generated positive rates of return. 74 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The large supply of shares observed on the WSE resulted from a rebalancing of emerging market indices towards a reduced weighting of Polish assets. This was coupled with fears of bank earnings being pushed down by potentially large provisions for legal risks. Throughout 2019 WIG-Banks Index sank by 9.2%. Only 4 out of 14 companies included in WIG-Banks at the end of 2019 generated positive rates of return. Fears of a decrease in banks’ financial performance sparked a downgrade from analysts. The key risk factors threatening the banking sector included: uncertainty about the cost of provisions for FX mortgage loans, impact of the CJEU ruling on reimbursement of fees paid by clients who repaid consumer loans ahead of schedule, and the risk of low profitability and capital shortage faced by certain banks. In addition, the sector’s profitability has become more likely to come under pressure from rising contributions to the Bank Guarantee Fund, the expected economic slowdown and its potential adverse effect on risk costs. 180 Relative changes in mBank's share prices and WSE indices 170 (December 31, 2015 = 100) mBank WIG WIG-Banki 160 150 140 130 120 110 100 90 80 12.07.2016 14.08.2016 15.09.2016 18.10.2016 21.12.2016 24.02.2017 29.03.2017 02.06.2017 07.09.2017 16.02.2018 22.04.2018 05.12.2018 17.05.2019 21.07.2019 22.08.2019 26.10.2019 27.11.2019 11.11.2017 04.03.2016 08.05.2016 30.04.2017 10.10.2017 15.01.2018 25.05.2018 26.06.2018 29.07.2018 30.08.2018 01.10.2018 03.11.2018 14.04.2019 23.09.2019 19.11.2016 06.08.2017 08.02.2019 13.03.2019 18.06.2019 31.12.2015 01.02.2016 06.04.2016 10.06.2016 23.01.2017 04.07.2017 13.12.2017 21.03.2018 07.01.2019 30.12.2019 mBank’s share price at close of trade in 2019 (December 30) stood at PLN 389.40, which represents a decline by 8.2% compared with the last trading day of 2018 (December 28). The strong downward trend observed since late June was driven predominantly by investor concerns about court rulings on CHF-indexed housing loans becoming increasingly favourable to clients. The trend was bucked in mid-August after the price to book value ratio reached a level appealing to investors. In Q4 2019, mBank’s share price outperformed WIG-Banks on news that Commerzbank intends to sell its majority holding in mBank announced on 20 September. Seven out of 11 bank analysts and brokers actively monitoring mBank’s financial performance and issuing recommendations concerning mBank shares advised investors to sell their shares in the company. The remaining four analysts issued “hold” recommendations. mBank’s capitalisation amounted to PLN 16.5 billion (EUR 3.9 billion) as at the end of 2019 compared with PLN 18.0 billion (EUR 4.2 billion) at the end of 2018. P/BV (price/book value) 75 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 for mBank Group stood at 1.0 compared with 1.2 at the end of 2018.

Reliable and transparent communication with stakeholders and equal access to information help build confidence of the market. mBank has been actively communicating with capital market participants, which includes activities addressing and adjusted to the needs of individual groups, in accordance with the best market standards and practices. The bank contacts its stakeholders in Polish and English at meetings, during teleconferences, via e-mail and through regularly updated information published on the official website of mBank. Investor relations website (https://www.mbank.pl/en/investor-relations/) features information divided into categories, in particular periodic reports, financial results and selected business data, presentations and video recordings of earnings conferences, data on shareholders and share price of mBank on WSE, consensus of forecast results of the Group, compendium of knowledge for new investors, current reports, information on AGMs, ratings and debt instruments. The website gives investors access to historic results of the Group and the bank (periodic reports, presentations and video recordings of earnings conferences) and to an archive of Annual General Meetings. Analysts and mBank’s investors are kept abreast of the major developments in mBank Group in a monthly Newsletter and ad-hoc e-mails. Conferences In 2019 investors and stock market analysts participated in four earnings conferences announcing mBank’s financial results, both in person and online. Every conference was attended by about twenty representatives of brokerage houses and investors. All meetings with the Management Board accompanying the announcement of quarterly figures were broadcast on the Internet in Polish and English and posted on the bank’s 76 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 website. Relations with analysts, shareholders and potential investors are also strengthened through meetings at conferences in Poland and abroad. In 2019, mBank participated in three conferences in Warsaw and four conferences abroad (in London, Athens, Frankfurt and Prague). Moreover, the bank organised one roadshow in Vienna. Throughout the year, apart from meetings at conferences and roadshows, the Management Board members and/or the Investor Relations team held individual meetings with investors and analysts. Meetings with rating agencies analysts Just like in previous years, in 2019 the Management Board representatives met with analysts from rating agencies. Moreover, the bank has been in regular contact with rating agencies through teleconferences and emails exchanged with analysts. Annual reports Each year mBank publishes integrated annual reports online. This is the broadest and most mature form of reporting, compliant with international standards and best practicies. In “The Best Annual Report 2018” contest organised by the Institute of Accountancy and Taxes (IRiP), the results of which were announced in October 2019, we won the title “The Best of the Best” for the best annual report in the category of financial institutions for the seventh time in a row. The aim of the competition is to promote annual reports of the best value for shareholders and investors. Credit ratings of mBank and mBank Hipoteczny mBank has solicited ratings assigned by S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch). These ratings are based on data provided to the agencies and talks between rating analysts and mBank’s representatives. mBank has also ratings based on publically available information assigned by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), Capital Intelligence Ratings (CI Ratings) and EuroRating. mBank Hipoteczny is rated by Moody’s and Fitch. Moody’s has assigned rating for mortgage covered bonds issued by mBank Hipoteczny (a solicited rating). Ratings of mBank and mBank Hipoteczny assigned by S&P Global Ratings On September 25, 2019, S&P Global Ratings lowered mBank’s long-term issuer credit rating from “BBB+” to “BBB” and long-term resolution counterparty rating (RCR) from “A” to “BBB+”. The short-term rating was affirmed at “A-2”. At the same time S&P changed the rating outlook from negative to developing. As a result of the above rating action, the long-term issuer credit rating of mBank corresponds to is stand-alone credit profile (SACP). Before the rating action, the longterm rating of mBank was higher than its stand-alone credit profile by one notch. It resulted from S&P’s assessment that mBank is a strategically important subsidiary of Commerzbank, which implies a high likelihood of extraordinary support. The agency verified this assessment in connection with the announcement of Commerzbank’s 5.0 77 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 strategy, which provides for the sale of a majority stake in mBank. The developing outlook indicates that the rating agency may raise, lower, or affirm the ratings over the next 12-24 months, depending on the implications of the sale process of mBank. S&P Global Ratings Ratings of mBank Long-term issuer credit rating (foreign currency) BBB (developing outlook) Short-term issuer credit rating (foreign currency) A-2 Stand-alone Credit Profile (SACP) bbb Rating of unsecured debt issued under the Euro BBB Medium Term Note Programme (EMTN) Long-term resolution counterparty ratings (long-term BBB+ RCR) Short-term resolution counterparty rating (short-term A-2 RCR) Ratings of mBank and mBank Hipoteczny assigned by Fitch Ratings On October 15, 2019, Fitch Ratings lowered the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of mBank from BBB to BBBand placed the rating on Rating Watch Positive (RWP). The downgrade reflects Fitch's verified assessment of mBank's potential parental support after the announcement of the new strategy 'Commerzbank 5.0'. According to Fitch, mBank is no longer a strategically important subsidiary for Commerzbank AG. As a result of the above rating action, the Long-Term Issuer Default Rating of the Bank corresponds to its individual rating, i.e. viability rating ( bbb). The RWP indicates that the ownership change should be positive for mBank's credit profile. This reflects Fitch's expectation that the Polish regulator will require Commerzbank to retain the risks associated with mBank's portfolio of foreign-currency mortgage loans (primarily CHF loans). Along with the lowering of mBank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating, the following ratings were changed:  Short-Term Issuer Default Rating: downgraded from F2 to F3 ;  Support rating: downgraded from 2 to 3 ;  Long-term senior unsecured debt rating: downgraded from BBB to BBBand  Short-term senior unsecured debt rating: downgraded from F2 to F3 . mBank Hipoteczny is rated by Fitch Ratings. On May 28, 2019, mBank Hipoteczny terminated the agreement on covered bonds' rating concluded with Fitch. On August 19, 2019, Fitch affirmed mBank Hipoteczny's mortgage covered bonds at A . Fitch has subsequently withdrawn the covered bonds' rating. On October 15, 2019, Fitch downgraded mBank Hipoteczny's long-term rating from BBB to BBBand its short-term rating from F2 to F3 . The support rating was affirmed at 2 . As in the case of mBank, mBank Hipoteczny's ratings were placed on Rating Watch Positive. 78 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Ratings of mBank Fitch Ratings Ratings of mBank Hipoteczny Long–term IDR (foreign currencies) BBB(RWP) BBB(RWP) Short-term IDR (foreign currencies) F3 F3 Viability rating bbbSupport rating 3 2 Rating of unsecured debt issued under the Euro Medium Term Note BBBProgramme (EMTN) Ratings of mBanku i mBanku Hipotecznego assigned by Moody’s Investors Service On May 24, 2019, Moody’s raised mBank's long-term deposit rating from Baa1 to A3 and changed the rating outlook from positive to stable. The upgrade of mBank’s longterm deposit rating was driven by the upgrade of the Bank's individual assessment baseline credit assessment (BCA) from ba1 to baa3 . In the opinion of the agency it reflects the bank's continued strong performance and improving risk profile. As a consequence, adjusted BCA was upgraded from baa3 to baa2 . In addition, Moody’s has upgraded the long-term mBank’s Counterparty Risk Rating (RCR) from A3 to A2 and the short-term RCR from Prime-2 to Prime-1 . On May 27, 2019, Moody’s assigned “Baa2” long-term and “Prime-2” short-term issuer ratings to mBank Hipoteczny. Long-term and short-term counterparty risk ratings (CRR) were assigned at A3 and Prime-2 respectively. On the same day Moody's assigned rating for covered bonds issued by mBank Hipoteczny at Aa3 . It is the highest rating possible to obtain for financial instruments issued from Poland (local and foreign currency bond ceilings for Poland). The Aa3 rating (equivalent to an AArating on the scale used by Fitch and S&P) is two notches higher than Poland’s sovereign rating. On September 27, 2019, Moody's affirmed mBank’s long-term deposit rating at “A3” and changed its outlook to negative from stable. The bank's short-term deposit rating was affirmed at “Prime-2”. Other ratings, including Baseline Credit Assessment, remained unchanged. Following the announcement of the new strategy of Commerzbank, Moody's has lowered the probability of parental support to mBank from high to moderate. However, this did not affect mBank’s long-term rating, which includes a one notch uplift resulting from potential parental support. The negative outlook on the longterm deposit rating reflects the downward pressure that could develop on this rating in case mBank is finally sold, provided that the acquirer has a weaker credit profile than the current parent company and/or the rating agency views the probability of such acquirer providing support as low. In addition, on September 27, 2019, Moody's affirmed the “Baa2 /Prime-2“ ratings for mBank Hipoteczny adjusting its long-term rating outlook from stable to negative. 79 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Ratings of mBank Moody’s Investors Service Ratings of mBank* Hipoteczny Long-term Deposit Rating (foreign A3 (negative currency) outlook) Short-term Deposit Rating (foreign Prime-2 currency) Baa2 (negative Long-term Issuer Rating (foreign) outlook) Short-term Issuer Rating (foreign) Prime-2 Long-term Counterparty Risk Rating A2 A3 (foreign currency) Short-term Counterparty Risk Rating Prime-1 Prime-2 foreign currency) Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) baa3 Adjusted Baseline Credit Assessment baa2 Rating of covered bonds issued by Aa3 mBank Hipoteczny * rating based solely on publicly available information mBank’s rating by Capital Intelligence Ratings On June 28, 2019, Capital Intelligence Ratings upgraded mBank's long-term rating from BBB+ to Aand affirmed its short-term rating at A2 . The outlook of long-term rating is stable. In addition, CI Ratings assigned for mBank's standalone rating (BSR) of bbb+ and the core financial strength (CFR) at bbb+ . In the opinion of CI Ratings, mBank's rating reflects its strong capital base (capital ratios among the highest in the sector), and thus high loss absorption capacity, as well as a relatively low non-performing loans (NPL) ratio compared to the peer group.

In the area of e-commerce API, where mElements provides a unique credit API solution on a European scale, the company continued to grow its customer base, establishing cooperation with one of the largest online payment entities in Poland. In 2019, mBank launched the API platform supporting access to payment initiation services and access to account history, as required by PSD2 (Payment Service Directive 2). Its test environment is provided by mBank's so-called “sandbox”, which is a special IT system designed for third-party developers, i.e. TPP (Third-Party-Provider). mBank obtained the approval of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority to act as TPP in July 2019. TPP, which is related to the financial market, will be able to use the banks' systems in the future to provide alternative services, e.g. to initiate payments or aggregate information about client transactions. The mBank’s sandbox is available at https://developer.api.mbank.pl/. The whole production, delivery and development of this platform was the responsibility of the mElements team, and after the launch, the quality and stability of the solution was appreciated by the market according to mBank's API estimates, it is the most frequently used API on the market. As a result of the PSD2 directive, several important innovations were also introduced in September 2019, including a change in the way of logging into the account (the so-called strong authentication), confirmation with a PIN code of selected contactless transactions (up to PLN 50), mobile authorization available in a separate application (mBank Token), 82 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 the possibility of adding a computer or tablet to trusted devices or withdrawal of the list of one-time passwords. All relevant information for our individual, corporate, SME and corporate customers in the PSD2 area is available at http://www.mbank.pl/psd2 . In addition to the work on API development, in 2019 the company focused its efforts on creating and launching a strategically important business area for mBank Group payment processing in e-commerce. In September, we completed a project lasting several months to create the required technological infrastructure for a product operating under the Paynow brand. In October, after a license process lasting several months, we received permission from the Polish Financial Supervision Authority to operate as a National Paying Authority. In the second half of the year, together with mBank, the company launched friends and family tests of Paynow's services, which resulted in the participation of several hundred customers and the successful launch of full acquisition activities. Moreover, in 2019 mElements also became a member of The Chamber of Electronic Economy, which associates the largest entities operating for the development of ecommerce in Poland. The company is ending the year 2019 with a mature product portfolio, whereas the year 2020 will be marked by dynamic acquisitions and development aimed, among others, at taking advantage of the options launched under the PSD2 directive. mAccelerator mBank’s way to support start-ups mAccelerator has been the first investment fund in Central and Eastern Europe supporting the development and commercialization of new technologies. It was equipped with a budget of EUR 50 million (an equivalent of over PLN 200 million). The fund invests in start-ups which later should become partners for financial institutions from around the world. It focuses on cybersecurity, biometrics, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), artificial intelligence and digital marketing (in particular chatbots and communicators). There are currently 6 companies in the fund's portfolio:  Digital Fingerprints (a company offering a cyber-security solution based on passive biometrics);  CyberRescue (a service supporting customers in terms of their network security);  Digital Teammates (specializing in Robotic Process Automation);  ChatForce (communication platform allowing automatic exchange of information with customers from mobile communication platforms);  Samito (formerly SaveCart, a company offering marketing automation tools for online shops);  HCM Deck a technological HR platform acquired in 2019, which supports HR and L&D departments in managing, automating and analyzing processes related to 83 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 employee development in larger organizations. The platform focuses on three areas, which are learning, communication and feedback. New features of online banking The year 2019 brought many changes, including those in internet banking. On 28 October mBank clients could see a brand new desktop after logging in. In addition to its clear and simple design, the new view gives the opportunity to adjust the elements visible on it to the user's requirements. One of the most important changes after a thorough change of the service is undoubtedly the resignation from the “finance bar” thanks to which our clients no longer have to choose between the list of recent operations and the list of their accounts. Instead, users can see primarily such products as the basic account or a shortened version of the operation history. We have also shortened the list of messages all to make the most important information more visible. In the new desktop the users can decide for themselves what information they want to see immediately after logging in. This applies not only to the products they have, but also to the order of their presentation. In 2019, we implemented a number of changes in the internet banking service, including:  Feature Switch i.e. the innovative process of implementation of changes is carried out in stages, enabling the analysis of comments made by customers. The solution enables us to publish new parts of the internet banking service to selected customers. It also allows to selectively enable and disable new functionalities in case of critical errors;  SCA in the internet banking service a new standard of logging in to the transaction service with the inclusion of the SCA (Strong Customer Authentication) element, which implements the provisions of the PSD2 Directive. The customer can easily manage his trusted devices registered in the service;  History of operations we have made the new history of operations function available to mBank clients as the first important module of the new generation of internet banking (Internet Banking 3.0). Based on the clients' comments, we replaced two previous views of the history with one. As far as the usability of history of operations is concerned, the important elements are: history presented on one card, the balance visible after each booked operation; full range of filtering in the dedicated filter bar and the possibility to download files with lists of operations. When implementing changes in the internet banking service, we collect ratings and information from our customers. We take into account what is important for them in internet banking, how they evaluate the current service and how they would like to use it in the future. This is our starting point in creating new solutions and facilities. 84 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Mobility In 2019 we continued our systematic development of the mobile application. During this time, mBank provided 15 application updates, which confirms the organisation's ability to make agile changes and respond to customer expectations. The work on the application was mainly focused on improving usability and communication as well as sales activities. Despite a number of challenges related to the PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2), following the suggestions of our users, we introduced a number of improvements to the application, which will make the use of the application easier and more pleasant.  New card details with an option to change the PIN a redesigned card details screen, so that the user can quickly find the most important information and perform important actions for him. Additionally, we have made it possible to change the PIN code for the card;  Option to add new recipients to the address book when making a transfer to a new recipient, the user has the option to save the data to the address book so that he can make subsequent transfers faster;  Refreshed appearance of mKantor, support for new currencies, currency calculator for card transactions these are a number of improvements related to travel and currency handling. The mKantor service has been enriched with new currencies. At the same time, we have rebuilt mKantor's screens to make transactions made on currencies even more intuitive. We have also introduced a currency calculator, thanks to which the client, by entering the transaction amount in the local currency, will receive the equivalent in PLN, converted at current exchange rates;  Extension of transaction notifications with details of operations the customer can decide whether the transaction notifications he receives are to include details immediately: transaction amount, name of the recipient and sender of the transfer and name of the store (for card operations);  Partial withdrawal of funds from a savings target we have made available to customers the possibility of partial withdrawal of funds, without the need to liquidate the target;  Renewing transfers to ZUS and Tax Office we have extended the possibility of renewing transfers from history, for transactions to ZUS and Tax Office. The client, from the level of transaction details to ZUS or Tax Office, has the option of retransfer, which automatically fills in the transfer data based on the previous transaction;  Refreshed BLIK screen a new, more legible version of the screen with the BLIK code, taking into account the existing comments and suggestions of customers and preparing an application to make available subsequent BLIK services (the Ask for a transfer service started in Q1 2020);  mFaktoring service is addressed to corporate clients, giving the possibility to activate a factoring limit, register new invoices and repay debt;  The Your assets screen a screen summarizing the client's finances. 85 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 1,894.7 70% thousand application users active clients This is the highest rate in the Polish banking sector. On average, clients use it ca. 31 times a month. As much as 72.1% of all bank logins come from the application. Currently, we sell 43.6% of travel insurance and 12.5% of cash loans using the application. The value of unsecured loans launched using the application increased by 102.4% compared to 2018. In March 2019, the mBank application was ranked 1st in the nationwide Mobile Trends Awards competition, in the “Banking and Finance” category. At the same time, the application was ranked 5th in the Forrester ranking: “The Forrester Banking Wave™: European Mobile Apps”. 86 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Capital adequacy and funding at mBank Group Structure of own funds including Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital The amount of capital maintained by mBank Group and mBank meets the regulatory requirements and allows for the planned business expansion at the defined risk appetite level. This is reflected in the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio (19.4% at the stand-alone level and 16.5% at the consolidated level at the end of 2019) and the Total Capital Ratio (22.8% at the stand-alone level and 19.5% at the consolidated level at the end of 2019), which are above the levels recommended by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA). The factors which influenced the capital ratios of mBank Group in 2019 are described in details in chapter 4.3. Capital adequacy. Capital requirements for mBank Group decreased in November 2019, along with the decrease of individual additional Pillar 2 capital requirement for risk related to FX retail mortgage loans by PFSA (from 3.64% to 3.11% for the Total Capital Ratio and from 2.73% to 2.33% for the Tier 1 capital ratio). Regulatory capital requirements for mBank Group as of December 31, 2019, are presented below. Countercyclical Capital Buffer is calculated as the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the countries where the relevant credit exposures of the Group are located. Systemic Risk Buffer determined at 3.0% in Poland entering into force from January 1, 2018; it replaced the previous PFSA add-on; for mBank it applies only to domestic exposures. Other Systemically Important Institution (O-SII) Buffer imposed by an administrative decision of the PFSA, in which mBank has been identified as other systemically important institution; its level is reviewed annually. Conservation Capital Buffer is equal for all banks in Poland as introduced by the Act on Macroprudential Supervision Over the Financial System and Crisis Management in the Financial System; the implementation was gradual and it was raised from 1.25% to 1.875% from January 1, 2018 and to 2.5% from January 1, 2019. 87 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Individual additional Pillar 2 capital requirement for risk related to FX retail mortgage loans imposed as a result of risk assessment carried out by the PFSA within the supervisory review and evaluation process (“SREP”); its level is reviewed annually. CRR Regulation minimum level based on Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. Own funds at the consolidated level stood at PLN 16.4 billion at the end of 2019, out of which PLN 13.9 billion (84.8%) was Tier 1 capital. The main components of Tier 1 capital include: share capital, share premium, other reserve capital, undistributed profit from previous years, funds for general banking risk, recognized current profits and accumulated other comprehensive income. Tier 1 capital is strengthened mainly through retained earnings. Tier 2 capital stood at PLN 2.5 billion at the end of 2019, which represents an increase of PLN 26.2 million year on year. The table below presents the balances of mBank Group’s subordinated debt as at December 31, 2019. Type Nominal value Currency Maturity date Tier 2 Capital Loan 250 M CHF 21.03.2028 Yes Bond 750 M PLN 17.01.2025 Yes Bond 550 M PLN 10.10.2028 Yes Bond 200 M PLN 10.10.2030 Yes Subordinated debt with a fixed maturity included in own funds is amortised on a daily basis for five years prior to final maturity. The current structure of the bank’s capital base derives from prior decisions regarding retained earnings and additional capital increases. Between 2002 and 2011, mBank retained all of its earnings by decision of the Annual General Meeting, while the 2012 dividend made up 35% of mBank’s net profit followed by a 67% dividend payment in 2013. The profit for 2014, 2015 and 2016 was included in whole in the bank’s own funds. In April 2018 General Meeting of Shareholders decided on dividend payout of PLN 217.9 million, i.e. 20% of net profit generated in 2017. The undistributed profit from previous years in value of PLN 1.2 billion was transferred to the supplementary capital of the bank. In March 2019 the Annual General Meeting decided not to pay out the dividend from the 2018 net profit. The amount of PLN 248.2 million was allocated to the losses from previous years and the amount of PLN 1,069.3 million was left undivided. More information on capital adequacy are presented in Note 45 of the mBank S.A. Group IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements 2019. Detailed information concerning dividend policy are presented below. 88 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Dividend The ability to pay out dividends is provided for in the “mobile Bank” strategy of mBank Group for 2016-2020 and remained in the strategy for 2020-2023. However, in its decision recommending the dividend payment to the Supervisory Board, the Management Board of mBank mainly considers current recommendations of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority concerning dividend payments by banks. In March 2019 PFSA issued its standpoint concerning dividend policy of commercial banks in mid-term horizon. Its assumptions were maintained in the PFSA’s standpoint from January 2019 referring to dividend policy in 2019. This guidance remains consistent with the PFSA’s recommendation regarding dividend payout for 2018. According to the mentioned recommendations, a dividend could be paid only by banks meeting the criteria below (both on stand-alone and consolidated level):  the bank is not subject to a restructuring programme;  the bank performed well in the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process – final SREP score not worse than 2.5 (master scale – score 1 or 2);  with financial leverage (LR) level higher than 5%;  with Tier 1 capital ratio not lower than the minimum value set for this ratio increased by 1.5%: 6% + 75%*add-on + the combined buffer requirement + 1.5%;  with Total Capital Ratio not lower than the minimum set for this value increased by 1.5%: 8% + add-on + the combined buffer requirement + 1.5%. It is recommended that banks which meet all the above criteria can pay out up to 75% of the profit generated in a year preceding the decision. Moreover, it is recommended to pay out dividend up to 100% of the profit generated in a year preceding the decision by banks meeting all of the above criteria, taking into account, within capital criteria, the bank’s sensitivity to an unfavourable macroeconomic scenario (measured by stress tests For banks with exposure to FX housing loans for households (which have more than 5% of FX mortgage loans for households in their portfolio of receivables from non-financial sector) the dividend rate should be adjusted based on following criteria: Criterion 1 – based on the share of FX housing loans for households in the whole portfolio of receivables from the non-financial sector:  banks with the share exceeding 10% – dividend rate adjustment by 20 p.p.;  banks with the share exceeding 20% – dividend rate adjustment by 30 p.p.;  banks with the share exceeding 30% – dividend rate adjustment by 50 p.p.; Criterion 2 – based on the share of FX housing loans granted in 2007 and 2008 in the portfolio of FX housing loans for households:  banks with the share exceeding 20% – dividend rate adjustment by 30 p.p.; 89 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  banks with the share exceeding 50% – dividend rate adjustment by 50 p.p. Whenever a bank with undistributed profit from previous years intends to pay out dividend, it is obliged to report this plan to the Polish Financial Supervision Authority which will assess it on an individual basis. Only banks which meet the criteria for paying out dividends may apply for such consent. Minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) In accordance with the BRRD and the Act on the Bank Guarantee Fund, the Deposit Guarantee Scheme and Resolution (the “BFG Act”) , banks will be obliged to meet the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL), which is equivalent to the total loss absorption capacity (TLAC) requirement imposed on global systemically important institutions. Both requirements address the need to ensure an adequate level of eligible liabilities (liabilities that can be converted to equity or written down) at times of financial difficulties, and consequently, facilitate resolution without the need to use public funds. In July 2017 the Bank Guarantee Fund (BFG) published a methodology for calculating MREL on its website, which was subsequently updated in November 2018. Banks were ordered to comply with the MREL targets set by the resolution authority by January 1, 2023. Bank-specific MREL targets were communicated to individual banks in the process of developing their resolution plans; the targets varied depending, among others, on the resolution strategy adopted for a given bank. MREL targets present the contribution to loss absorption and recapitalisation as a percentage of total liabilities and own funds. According to information from BFG dated February 5, 2020 the consolidated MREL target to be met by mBank by the end of 2022 is 14.54% of total liabilities including own funds (TLOF), which accounts for 27.515% of the total risk exposure amount (TREA). The requirement has been set taking into account the resolution strategy for Commerzbank AG Group basing on multiple point of entry (MPE) approach. At the same time, mBank was informed how it should progress towards meeting the target. MREL targets to be met at the end of 2019, 2020 and 2021 were set as a percentage of TLOF (9.248%, 11.012% and 12.776%, respectively) and TREA (17.500%, 20.838% and 24.177%, respectively). In accordance with the BFG Act, MREL-eligible liabilities include instruments which have been issued and fully paid up, are not secured or guaranteed and held by the institution itself, and have a maturity of at least one year. Furthermore, BFG expects that MREL targets will be complied with using only own funds and subordinated liabilities which in accordance with Bankruptcy Law rank below class five liabilities in the insolvency hierarchy. It is worth noting that the Act of January 17, 2019 Amending the BFG Act introduced a new class of debt (class six), i.e. non-preferred senior debt, to Polish legal framework (Bankruptcy Law), thereby broadening the catalogue of MREL-eligible instruments. In addition, BFG expects these instruments to be 90 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 available only to professional investors at a minimum nominal value of PLN 400,000 per instrument. In the case of commitments entered into to meet the consolidated MREL target in the part where it exceeds the individual MREL target, BFG requires only that the instruments should be made available to professional investors. The BFG methodology is likely to evolve further, among others, due to the implementation of amendments to prudential regulations for banks and investment firms published in June 2019 (CRD V/CRR II) and the resolution framework (BRRD II/SRMR). mBank Group funding The “One Bank” Strategy for 2012-2016 provided for optimisation of the Bank’s balance sheet in terms of its profitability and structure by increasing the share of client deposits in funding, further diversification of the funding base, and a bigger share of high-yield assets. The “mobile Bank” Strategy, implemented in mid-2016, provided for the strengthening of the funding profile due to the increasing volume of covered bonds and transaction deposits and maintaining the loan-to-deposit ratio on the level of at most slightly above 100% every year (90.3% at the end of 2019). It was reflected in the changes of the structure of mBank Group’s funding in previous years.

We intend to keep the loan to deposit ratio in the range of 92-94%. Bond issued under the EMTN Programme 91 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 After the successful first eurobond issue in October 2012 and issue of CHF bonds in October 2013, mBank Group completed further issues under the EUR 3 billion EMTN Programme in 2014. In 2015, there were no issues under the EMTN Programme, whereas on October 12, 2015, bonds worth EUR 500 million were repaid. On September 21, 2016, mBank, through its foreign subsidiary mFinance France, completed the issue of bonds with a nominal value of EUR 500 million, maturing in 2020. In 2017, there was one issue under the EMTN Programme. On March 28, 2017, mFinance France issued 6-year bonds with a nominal value of CHF 200 million and 1.005% coupon. In 2018 two issuances under the programme took place. On June 7, 2018, mBank issued unsecured bonds at nominal value of CHF 180 million, with 0.565% coupon and four-year maturity. On September 5, 2018, an issue of EUR 500 million, 1.058% coupon and fouryear maturity was completed. Two EMTN tranches were repaid in 2018, CHF 200 million in October and CZK 500 million (a private placement) in December. On April 1, 2019, the tranche on the amount of EUR 500 million was redeemed. Only several days later, on April 5, 2019 mBank issued 5.5-year unsecured bonds in the amount of CHF 125 million with the coupon of 1.0183%. Bonds are subject to the English law and are traded on the Swiss stock exchange SIX Swiss Exchange Ltd.

Total income – calculated as the sum of net interest income, net fee and commission income, dividend income, net trading income, other income, other operating income and other operating expenses. Overhead costs and depreciation – calculated as the sum of total overhead costs and depreciation. Net impairment losses and fair value change on loans and advances – calculated as the sum of impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses from non-trading loans and advances mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss. Net ROA – calculated by dividing net profit attributable to the owners of mBank by the average total assets. The average total assets are calculated on the basis of the balances as at the end of each month. Net profit attributable to the owners of mBank is annualised based on the number of days in the analysed period (the annualisation ratio is calculated as the quotient of the number of days in a year and the number of days in the analysed period). Gross ROE – calculated by dividing profit before income tax by the average equity (net of the year’s results). The average equity is calculated on the basis of the balances as at the end of each month. Profit before income tax is annualised based on the number of days in the analysed period (the annualisation ratio is calculated as the quotient of the number of days in a year and the number of days in the analysed period). Net ROE – calculated by dividing net profit attributable to the owners of mBank by the average equity (net of the year’s results). The average equity is calculated on the basis of the balances as at the end of each month. Net profit attributable to the owners of mBank is annualised based on the number of days in the analysed period (the annualisation ratio is calculated as the quotient of the number of days in a year and the number of days in the analysed period). Cost/Income ratio – calculated by dividing overhead costs and depreciation by total income (excluding tax on balance sheet items of the Group). Net interest margin – calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest earning assets. Interest earning assets are the sum of cash and balances with the Central Bank, loans and advances to banks, debt securities (in all valuation methods) and loans and advances to clients (net; in all valuation methods). The average interest earning assets are calculated on the basis of the balances as at the end of each month. Net interest income is annualised based on the number of days in the analysed period (the annualisation ratio is calculated as the quotient of the number of days in a year and the number of days in the analysed period). The main drivers of the financial results of mBank Group in 2019 included:  Increase in total income, which stood at PLN 5,524.4 million. Net interest income remained its main growth driver. It reached PLN 4,002.8 million and was 14.5% higher than a year ago. This high dynamics was accompanied by further improvement of net interest margin, supported by the changing asset mix and a slight reduction of funding costs. The rise in core income achieved in 2019 twice surpassed the profit from the sale of an organised part of the enterprise of mFinanse recorded in 2018;  Increase in operating expenses (including depreciation) to PLN 2,329.2 million. In particular, contributions and transfers to the Bank Guarantee Fund and staff-related expenses grew in 2019;  Improved efficiency measured by the Cost/Income ratio, which stood at 42.2% in 2019 v. 44.5% in 2018 (net of the impact of one-off events); 96 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  Stable cost of risk at 79 bps, compared with 78 bps in 2018;  Continued organic growth and business expansion as demonstrated by:  Increase in the number of corporate clients to 26,476 (+2,770 clients compared with the end of December 2018);  dynamic growth in the sales of housing loans (PLN 8,176.4 million in 2019, i.e. +77% compared with 2018) and growing sales of non-mortgage loans (PLN 10,260.0 million in 2019, i.e. +14.9% compared with 2018). At the same time, the number of retail clients dropped to 5,603,900, mainly due to the accounts of inactive Kompakt Finanse clients being closed in 2019. Net loans and advances increased by PLN 10,581.7 million or 11.2% compared with the end of 2018 and reached PLN 105,347.5 million. At the same time, amounts due to clients grew by PLN 14,652.1 million, i.e. 14.4% year on year reaching PLN 116,661.1 million at the end of 2019. Consequently, the loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 90.3% from 92.9% a year earlier. The changes in the Group’s results translated into the following profitability ratios:  Gross ROE of 10.2% (12.9% in 2018);  Net ROE of 6.6% (9.4% in 2018). Capital ratios of mBank Group went down in 2019. At the end of 2019, the consolidated Total Capital Ratio stood at 19.5% compared with 20.7% in the previous year. The Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio reached 16.5% v. 17.5% at the end of 2018. The leverage ratio stood at 8.3% at the end of December 2019, compared with 8.6% a year before. Income of mBank Group Total income generated by mBank Group was PLN 5,524.4 million in 2019, compared with PLN 5,079.5 million in 2018, which represents an increase by PLN 444.9 million or 8.8%. Despite the profit from selling an organised part of enterprise of mFinanse in the amount of PLN 219.7 million, which was posted in 2018, the 2019 increase in income significantly exceeded this amount. The increase was mainly driven by improved net interest income, net trading income, and other income. Similarly to 2018, net interest income remained mBank Group’s largest income source in 2019 (72.5%). It reached PLN 4,002.8 million, compared with PLN 3,496.5 million in 2018 (+14.5%). High net interest income was mainly driven by an increase in interest income. Net interest margin, calculated as a relation between net interest income and average interest earning assets, stood at 2.7% compared with 2.6% in 2018. Interest income grew by PLN 553.5 million or 12.5% year on year to PLN 5,071.7 million. With a share of 78.0%, loans and advances were the main source of the Group’s interest income. Interest income from loans and advances increased by PLN 565.0 million or 16.7% on the previous year to PLN 3,953.9 million. The growth resulted mainly from an 97 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 expanding volume of loans and a change in the structure of the loans portfolio, i.e. rising share of higher-margin products with a simultaneous decrease in the share of mortgage loans in foreign currencies characterised by lower margin. In 2019, interest income from investment securities increased marginally (+PLN 12.9 million or +1.9%) and so did the value of the portfolio. Interest income from debt securities held for trading went down by PLN 23.8 million, i.e. 32.9%. This resulted from lower average value of the portfolio in 2019 compared with the previous year.

Interest income from investment securities include interest income on the following items: non-trading financial assets measured mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, including debt securities, financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets measured at amortised cost, including debt securities. In the period under review, interest expenses rose by 4.6%, which was mainly attributable to higher deposit costs (up by PLN 84.9 million or 14.7%). In 2019, we continued to observe a substantial inflow of deposits, especially those of individual clients. Interest expenses related to loans received decreased by PLN 15.6 million or 53.4% mainly due to a drop in the balance of received loans and advances (repayment of mBank’s loans granted by ICBC and EIB). Costs of issued debt securities went down by PLN 24.6 million or 7.7% due to a decrease in the value of liabilities from the issue of debt securities (redemption of an EMTN tranche in the amount of EUR 500 million in April 2019 and of two tranches of covered bonds). 98 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Net fee and commission income, accounting for 17.5% of mBank Group’s total income, dropped slightly year on year. In the period under review, it stood at PLN 964.6 million, which represents a decrease by PLN 11.2 million or 1.2%. The primary reason was an increase in costs.

The largest growth was observed in the credit-related fees and commissions (up by PLN 47.3 million or +12.8%) due to a higher volume of loans sold. Payment card-related fees rose by PLN 45.9 million or 11.8% compared to the previous year. The growth was stimulated by a higher number of clients and issued payment cards as well as by the number and volume of transactions (value of non-cash transactions grew by 22.0% year on year and the number of transactions rose by 23.4%). The development of transactional banking translated into an increase in commissions from money transfers (+9.4%). A 20.4% decrease (by PLN 21.0 million) was reported in commissions for agency services regarding the sale of products of external financial entities due to a limited interest of customers in the investment fund market and regulatory changes in this respect. Fees from brokerage activity and debt securities issue decreased by PLN 17.5 million or 16.7%, which was connected with the unfavourable situation on the capital market and a substantial drop in turnover on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. 99 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Commission expenses rose by PLN 85.5 million (13.1%) in the period under review. The highest growth was recorded in other fees and commissions paid to external entities for the sale of the bank’s products (+PLN 49.1 million or 34.7%). Payment card-related expenses grew by PLN 17.6 million or 12.9% year on year. Dividend income amounted to PLN 4.2 million in 2019, compared with PLN 3.6 million in 2018. Net trading income stood at PLN 440.5 million in 2019 and was higher by PLN 93.2 million or 26.8% compared with 2018.The growth was driven mainly by a higher foreign exchange result (+PLN 58.1 million or 18.0%). Gains or losses on financial assets held for trading rose by PLN 20.2 million or 66.1% and gains or losses from hedge accounting went up by PLN 14.9 million. Other income, including gains less losses from financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss and investments in subsidiaries and associates and gains or losses from non-trading equity instruments and debt securities mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss, grew by PLN 164.2 million in 2019. This resulted from the revaluation of shares of Visa Inc. and other companies (among others, Polski Standard Płatności Sp. z o.o., Biuro Informacji Kredytowej S.A.) Net other operating income (net other operating income/expense) amounted to PLN 73.2 million in 2019 v. PLN 235.0 million in 2018. The negative figure was due to the creation of provisions for future commitments, including potential costs related to settlements with clients who made early repayments of consumer loans and the provision connected with early termination of lease agreements pertaining to two buildings in Warsaw in connection with the planned relocation. In 2018, we generated a profit from selling an organised part of enterprise of mFinanse in the amount of PLN 219.7 million. Result on provisions for legal risk related to foreign currency loans In 2019, provisions for legal risk related to foreign currency loans grew by PLN 367.4 million compared to 2018. This was a consequence of the application of a new methodology of calculating provisions for legal risk related to individual court cases pertaining to indexation clauses in mortgage and housing loans in CHF. The methodology is described in detail in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of mBank S.A. Group for 2019. 100 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Costs of mBank Group In 2019, the total overhead costs (including depreciation) of mBank Group stood at PLN 2,329.9 million, which represents a 7.6% increase on the previous year. The increase was mainly due to higher contributions to the Bank Guarantee Fund and higher staff-related expenses.

They were pushed up by higher remuneration costs, especially the costs connected with selling of the bank’s products and hiring new staff in mBank Group. Material costs dropped by PLN 105.8 million or 14.2% in the period under review, in particular, as a result of implementation of IFRS 16, which replaced some real property administration and maintenance costs (rents) with depreciation and interest expenses. Depreciation rose by PLN 122.9 million compared to 2018. Another important factor that impacted the cost base in 2019 was contribution and transfers to the Bank Guarantee Fund. In 2019 it was higher by PLN 75.3 million, i.e. 41.7% compared to the previous year. The contribution to the Resolution Fund amounted PLN 197.3 million in 2019, while in 2018 it stood at PLN 97.1 million. Development of income and expenses resulted in an improvement of the Cost/Income ratio, which stood at 42.2% (42.6% in 2018). Taking into account recurrent income, the ratio improved even more significantly, as in 2018 it stood at 44.5%. Impairment on and change in the fair value of loans and advances In 2019, net impairment losses and fair value change on loans and advances of mBank Group (calculated as the sum of two items: impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss and gains or losses from non-trading loans and advances mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or 101 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 loss) stood at -PLN 793.8 million. Compared to 2018, impairment on and change in the fair value of loans and advances increased by PLN 99.4 million or 14.3%. Impairment or reversal of impairment on financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss is related to the part of the portfolio of loans and advances measured at amortised cost, while gains or losses from non-trading loans and advances mandatorily measured at fair value through profit or loss is related to the credit risk of the portfolio of loans and advances measured with the use of that method. As a result, the cost of risk in 2019 stood at 79 bps, compared with 78 bps in 2018.

Loans and advances to customers remained the largest asset category of mBank Group at the end of 2019.

The portfolio of treasury and municipal bonds shrank by PLN 1,480.2 million or 5.1%, while the portfolio of debt securities issued by the central bank increased by PLN 2,629.7 million, i.e. more than four times.

From the perspective of funding cost, in 2019 we observed a continuation of a positive trend reflected in higher dynamics of inflows to current accounts than to term deposits. Amounts due to retail customers rose by PLN 11,740.8 million, i.e. 17.8% compared with the end of 2018. Current and saving accounts increased by 20.3%, while term deposits went up by 8.6%. Amounts due to corporate clients increased by PLN 2,791.6 million or 7.9% in 2019, driven mainly by higher volumes on current accounts (+14.9%). Term deposits of corporate clients increased by 1.1% in 2019. The total growth of corporate deposits was partly offset by a drop in the value of repo transactions (-75.4%) and in the amount of loans and advances received (-13.8%), triggered largely by a partial repayment of loans from the 105 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 European Investment Bank. Excluding repo transactions, amounts due to corporate clients rose by 9.6% compared with the end of 2018. Amounts due to other banks slid by PLN 1,942.0 million, i.e. by 62.5% compared with the end of 2018 and at the end of 2019 reached 1,166.9 million. The strongest decline was recorded in repo / sell buy back transactions, whose value decreased by 87.5% compared to the end of 2018. A decrease was also reported in loans and advances received (by 74.6%) and funds from other banks placed on accounts with mBank. The share of debt securities in issue in mBank Group’s funding structure decreased from 12.4% at the end of 2018 to 11.0% at the end of 2019. This change is attributable mainly to the issuances and redemption of bonds under the EMTN programme and covered bonds of mBank Hipoteczny. In 2019, subordinated liabilities grew by 1.1% year on year, which was caused by the impact of the PLN depreciation (vis-a-vis the Swiss franc) on the PLN equivalent of the subordinated loan with a nominal value of CHF 250 million. Total equity went up by PLN 982.1 million (+6.5%) in 2019 as a consequence of an increase in retained earnings, while its share in total equity and liabilities of mBank Group amounted to 10.2% at the end of 2019 (compared with 10.4% as at the end of 2018). Changes in off-balance sheet items, changes in guarantees granted to mBank Group subsidiaries and other agreements More information on significant off-balance sheet items of mBank Group can be found in Note 33 of the mBank S.A. Group IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements for 2019. The funds raised by mFinance France S.A. (mFF) from the eurobond issues under the EMTN programme have been deposited with mBank as a result of the guarantees granted by the bank related to the guarantee payment of all amounts to be settled in respect of debt securities issued under the EMTN Programme. In 2019, the value of the guarantee dropped as a result of redemption of the tranche in the nominal value of CHF 500 million redeemed on April 1, 2019. As at December 31, 2019 mBank S.A. did not have any agreements referred to in Article 141t.1 of the Banking Law Act. 106 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Business segments Retail Banking mBank’s Retail Banking segment serves 5,604 thousand individual clients and microenterprises in Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia online, directly through the call centre, via mobile banking and other state-of-the-art technological solutions, as well as in a wide network of branches.

We develop our offer to cater for the expectations of our clients, especially the young ones, which is reflected by our client acquisition structure. Thanks to our activities, mBank has become the first-choice bank for clients aged 16-20 according to the IQS Tracking survey. In addition, the Miesięcznik Finansowy Bank monthly awarded mBank the main prize in the Bank for the Young and Innovation categories. mBank is among the banks with the largest number of mobile clients. In its Most Mobile Banks in Poland report published on 27 March 2019, cashless.pl listed Polish banks with the highest ability to migrate traditional customer service channels to the modern ones. The results were based on the client mobility ratio. mBank topped the podium with the ratio of 53.5%, which means that more than half of our clients regularly log in to their accounts using smartphones. At the end of 2019, as many as 1,894,700 clients actively used mBank’s mobile app, which represents an increase by 27.6% year on year (1,484,500 in 2018). Currently, 72.1% of all logins to mBank’s systems are from the mobile app. Loans In 2019, we continued to optimise our digital processes under the slogan “digital first” to make our products more attractive and to increase the availability of unsecured loans to individuals. This translated into a substantial increase in sales in direct channels (mobile app and online banking). Cash loan sales in the mobile app grew more than 2.5 times. The focus on direct channels can also be observed in our branches and in the contact centre. Our client advisors and consultants teach clients how to apply for banking 111 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 products using the mobile app and online banking, and how to best utilise the opportunities offered by these channels. Currently, one-fourth of all unsecured loans granted in our branches are applied for by clients who file applications on their own with the help of advisors. New sales of non-mortgage loans to individuals in Poland amounted to PLN 6.8 billion in 2019 compared with PLN 6.0 billion in 2018, which represents an increase by 13.7% year on year. At the beginning of 2019, we introduced the possibility of applying for a cash loan with a discount code. Currently, more than 50% of cash loans sold outside of special offers are purchased with the discount code. In August, we made a new application form for cash loans available. It guides clients filing applications in the mobile app or in online banking in an easy and friendly manner. Thanks to the new application form clients can calculate their creditworthiness even more accurately and adjust the instalments to their capabilities. In 2019 we achieved a significant increase in mortgage loan sales while maintaining excellent pricing parameters. The sales of mortgage loans to individuals in Poland amounted to PLN 6.8 billion in 2019 compared with PLN 3.5 billion in 2018, which represents an increase by 94.0% year on year. It is worth mentioning that in 2019, in line with the adopted strategy, the vast majority of originated mortgage loans again qualified for a transfer to mBank Hipoteczny under the pooling procedure, which allows for funding the assets with a better-matched maturity structure. The ongoing work on enhancing the process of granting mortgage loans to clients is expected to significantly shorten the time necessary to issue a credit decision and improve the scalability of the process. Last year we launched a special offer on mortgage loans for our internal clients. We selected two client groups with the highest activity level. As a result, almost 500,000 clients can now check the special price for a mortgage loan for which they are eligible. The initiative is meant to promote the image of the bank as an institution with an attractive mortgage loan offering, especially for the clients for whom we are the firstchoice bank. The NPL ratio of the mortgage loan portfolio for individuals in Poland dropped year on year and stood at 2.0% at the end of 2019, compared with 2.6% a year before. The graph below presents the structure of the Retail Banking loan portfolio in Poland (including mBank Hipoteczny) at the end of 2019: 112 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Retail loan portfolio in Poland (Household loans, mBank in Poland only) Credit cards and charge cards 4.1% Other loans 2.0% Credit line facilities and… PLN Mortgage loans 39.3% Cash loans 14.9% FX Mortgage loans; 33.5% Savings products As at the end of 2019 the total amount of Retail Banking deposits in Poland stood at PLN 66,837.9 million compared to PLN 55,733.9 million a year ago, up by 19.9% year on year. At the same time, the balance of current accounts and savings accounts rose by 20.5% and 26.0%, respectively. The strong sales results in the area of savings products were possible thanks to a number of initiatives carried out in 2019, including the following:  we implemented a new functionality in the savings account entitling to obtain a bonus for depositing new funds;  we ran two promotional campaigns for the eKonto savings and settlement account offering higher interest on new money;  we launched the savings product “My Goals” for clients aged 13-17, which allows them to regularly save a fixed amount of money and to save money by rounding up purchases;  we ran four promotional campaigns concerning “My Goals” with a preferential interest rate;  we continued the term deposit retention process aimed at rolling-over maturing term deposits. Growth in retail deposits was accompanied by a decrease in investment products. In 2019 we launched a number of initiatives to adapt our activities in the area of distribution of investment funds units to the new legal environment. Among others, we worked on a new distribution fee settlement model. Additionally, we undertook numerous initiatives supporting the development of investment fund participation units sales. For example, we introduced a simplified MiFID survey, which helps clients determine whether given investment products are suitable for their investment profile. 113 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In November, we started offering free-of-charge individual pension accounts (IKE eMakler) and individual retirement security accounts (IKZE eMakler). The accounts allow independent investors to save for retirement by investing in WSE-traded shares and bonds, as well as in shares traded on four leading foreign stock markets and ETFs from London and Frankfurt. This way, they can earn on changes in stock prices of companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, or BP. mBank clients can thus take advantage of increases in stock prices on leading stock markets worldwide, which often take place even when the WSE stagnates. By investing in ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), which track the performance of given indexes, investors can further diversify their investment risk. Apart from lower price volatility, ETFs also offer lower transaction costs than traditional investment funds. Cards and accounts In H1 2019, we launched a simplified offering of accounts for individuals comprising the new personal eKonto account and an account for young clients, eKonto możliwości. Both accounts are free of charge and offer free money withdrawals at all ATMs in Poland and abroad. We offer the most favourable conditions on the market, which pushes us to the top of many industry league tables. eKonto możliwości ranks first in the league table of accounts for young clients compiled by kontomlodziezowe.com, and it is the most frequently selected account by this client group according to kontostudenta.pl. The IQS Tracking survey at mBank’s request showed that we are the first-choice bank for young clients. Thanks to the cooperation with Przelewy 24, we made the quick transfer service available to our clients. It allows clients to transfer money to their mBank accounts from accounts held with another bank. The transferred funds are credited to the client’s account within 15 minutes. In February 2019, we were the first bank in Poland to offer an online emergency service. The Cyber Rescue service provides assistance to users experiencing online security problems. Specialists are available around the clock and they can be accessed conveniently and quickly via Messenger, telephone or text message. Users can request assistance in the case of a hacking attack, problems with viruses, loss of passwords to social media etc. The service is unconditionally free-of-charge for mBank clients. In 2019, we focused on client acquisition in medium-sized towns. The initiative consisting in opening mBank’s ice rinks proved a huge success. In early December, free ice rinks were launched in 10 Polish towns, including Włocławek, Suwałki, and Przemyśl. The inhabitants were also offered the possibility of renting skates and getting an instructor. Within one month from the launch of the ice rinks, client acquisition in the towns covered by the programme grew remarkably. In April 2019, we added the MasterCard card to the multi-currency service. Now, not only VISA card holders can use the service free of charge. It is available for eleven currencies (JPY, NOK, SEK, CZK, DKK, HUF, HRK, EUR, USD, CHF, GBP). Similarly to FX accounts, we do 114 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 not charge any fees for using the service. Thanks to the multi-currency service, a debit card can be linked not only to a client’s main PLN account, but also to FX accounts. In June 2019, we introduced a MasterCard card in the limited Pol’and’Rock edition, designed by Jurek Owsiak. In December, we launched a limited MasterCard card to mark the 28th Grand Finale of the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WOŚP), featuring a special design by Jurek Owsiak. Since September 2, 2019, clients may order debit cards in a portrait format. The new Visa and MasterCard cards are simple and minimalist. They no longer feature client data on the front side. All information, including the name and surname, card number and expiry date are displayed on the reverse of the card. In 2019, the value of payment card transactions made by mBank’s retail clients in Poland amounted to PLN 46.6 billion, which represents a rise by 22.0% year on year. The number of transactions made by mBank clients grew by 23.4% year on year. mBank’s credit cards are also characterised by a very high average number of transactions per client. At the end of September 2019, the market share of transactions by mBank’s cards (by number of transactions) stood at 13.0%. Products and services for affluent clients In 2019, we continued the acquisition of affluent clients, who are the target group of our mKonto Intensive account. The account holders enjoy free cash withdrawals from ATMs all over the world, can make three instant transfers per month free of charge and have access to priority service in the call centre. In addition, mKonto Intensive is the only account that comes with a Visa Świat Intensive multi-currency card and a World MasterCard Intensive credit card. Both cards allow commission-free conversion of transactions, thanks to which clients do not incur any additional costs when making payments abroad or shopping online in a foreign currency. Apart from offering attractive products and services to new clients, we also launch temporary special offers concerning selected products for our existing clients. In 2019, we ran a special mortgage loan offer with a reduced commission and margin for affluent clients being mKonto Intensive holders. We also introduced a promotional savings offer with a preferential interest rate to cater for the special needs of this client group. Brokerage operations and asset management The Brokerage Bureau of mBank (BM) provides a comprehensive range of brokerage services to the largest Polish institutional investors (pension funds, investment funds, asset management companies), foreign funds, and individual and private banking clients. The Brokerage Bureau enables clients to trade in regulated markets in Poland and abroad as well as in the OTC (CFD) market. As part of wealth management services, clients may use investment advisory and asset portfolio management services. The Bureau is an active 115 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 player in the capital market, preparing and conducting public and private offerings (IPO/SPO/ABB). In 2019 we observed a visible decrease in investor activity on the WSE compared with 2018 (-8.0% year on year in the stock market) accompanied by a weakening position of domestic investors and growing domination of global investment banks operating as remote members of the WSE. The turnover of BM on the WSE stock market amounted to PLN 13.4 billion (-23.5% year on year), which made mBank the thirteenth player on the market in terms of total turnover (3.4% market share) and eighth player from the perspective of turnover on the client’s account (5.7% market share). Our clients express systematically growing interest in investing in foreign markets. At the end of the year, the number of brokerage accounts of BM clients amounted to 311,200. The conditions on global financial markets in 2019 fostered growth of assets under management. Wealth Management benefited from the changes introduced in the investment structure in the previous years, moving toward global, diversified solutions. The value of assets under management in discretionary portfolios (i.e. assets managed by BM without clients' active involvement) increased by a third. Aside from the above-mentioned portfolios, we continued to develop white label solutions. Four mBank FIO sub-funds (including one equity, one multi-asset, and two bond sub-funds) joined the existing mFundusz Konserwatywny SFIO, thereby increasing assets accumulated in these solutions by over PLN 230 million in 2019. In 2019 mBank’s Wealth Management pioneered a fully diversified strategy of socially responsible investing for its clients in Poland, in line with the ESG principles. ESG strategy assets accounted for 19% of assets in investment strategies with a comparable investment risk level. Another important issue was the conclusion of an agreement with CFA Society Poland on the implementation and promotion of the Statement of Investor Rights. It stresses mBank’s adherence to ethical aspects of financing. We are the first institution in Poland to enter into this type of cooperation with one of the world’s leading professional certification organisations. Finally, in 2019 Wealth Management offered funds of the global asset management company AllianceBernstein to clients, which confirms our desire to promote diversified, global, and transparent investment solutions. The stock market in 2019 was marked by very low transactional activity, especially in the scope of capital transactions like IPO, SPO and ABB. Despite this, BM concluded four such transactions in 2019, including ABB of Famur shares (PLN 275.9 million) and ABB of Trakcja PRKiI shares (PLN 59.6 million). Furthermore, BM remained an active player and successfully performed ten share buybacks and calls for shares of WSE-listed companies, including ES-SYSTEM (PLN 147.3 million), Ergis (PLN 66.9 million), Neuca (two buybacks worth PLN 80.4 million in total) and Elemental Holding (two buybacks worth PLN 36.5 million in total). 116 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Cooperation with AXA Group In 2019, mBank continued to cooperate with its strategic insurance partner AXA in the area of bancassurance. The partnership covers selling insurance products to mBank clients and focuses particularly on the standalone product segment, including motor, travel, home, and life insurance as well as the segment of products linked to banking products, e.g. loans. The bank continued the transformation of its insurance product portfolio to meet the needs of digital clients who intensively take advantage of direct channels to fulfil their needs and contact the bank. As a result, we refreshed our standalone product mix. All standalone products (i.e. motor, home, travel, and life & health insurance) can be purchased in the bank’s mobile app. Over 40% of travel insurance policies are now sold via the mobile app. Products and services for small and medium-sized enterprises The company account with 24 months’ no fee guarantee was the main product driving client acquisition in 2019. The product was offered on a standalone basis and as part of the “mBank Business Starter” (Firmootwieracz), which enables potential clients to set up a company and open a bank account via mBank. The main assumptions of our acquisition offer (no fees for a bank account, debit card, transfers, withdrawals from selected ATMs, and deposits made at CDMs) remained consistent throughout the year. In 2019, we had to adjust our systems and procedures to new regulations. We expanded the split payment mechanism and implemented the new type of transfer to the Tax Office following the introduction of Individual Tax Accounts. We adjust to new regulations bearing in mind their impact on businesses. Therefore, we prepared a comprehensive information campaign concerning all legal changes introduced in 2019. It included direct communication via online banking and the mobile app, articles published on mBank’s blog, and webinars. We accompany businesses and listen to their needs on a day-to-day basis. Aside from our monthly meetings with businesspeople, we organised an inspirational meeting (OkO w OkO) and photography workshops during the ALIBI women’s fair in Łódź. We made use of our personal hobbies and interests to promote mBank among businesspeople. The event met with a warm reception with participants appreciating mBank for “really helping and giving directions to people who consider setting up their own business”. 2019 was marked by a 19.1% year-on-year increase in unsecured loan sales. Mortgage sales rose by 50.2% compared to the previous year. In April 2019, we launched factoring services for sole traders. A limit of up to PLN 50,000 can be applied for online. The decision comes within 5 minutes. The same amount of time is needed to get an invoice financing decision. The service is tied to the current 117 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 account and enables clients to make repayments manually or automatically. It only takes one click to prolong the repayment deadline by 30 days from the invoice due date. In H1 2019, we launched EUR and USD Visa Business currency cards for business clients with free-of-charge ATM withdrawals and no currency conversion when paying for company expenses abroad. In August 2019, we enhanced the mKsięgowość (mAccounting) service with new features, including the option to upload document images (e.g. invoices) using the CashDirector mobile app. We also added a financial liquidity analysis tool, which shows clients if their financial liquidity could be at risk within the next four weeks. Retail Banking in the Czech Republic and Slovakia mBank’s operations In 2019, our branches in the Czech Republic and Slovakia put the greatest emphasis on deposit products, acquisition of active clients, lending growth, and process optimisation. The branches completed several projects aimed to increase sales capacities and sales process excellence. The product mix was expanded with new scenarios, which strengthened and increased the range of available solutions. mBank continued to reinforce its leading position in mobile banking. The year was marked by further development of mobile banking. The branches added new solutions and enhanced the existing ones. We improved communication in the app and increased its security with the new mobile authorisation tool mKlíč (mKey). The tool offers a higher level of security and more comfortable authorisation of transactions. The application tells the client why their transaction has been rejected and how they can avoid this in the future. The Slovak branch launched express payments. The service allows faster money transfers to beneficiaries in other banks. In February, our Czech branch launched the innovative Visa World (mKarta Svět) card. The card is very popular with clients who travel and pay abroad. The card has become the new standard debit card for the mKonto account. The card combines the best exchange rates on the market (compared with debit cards offered by other banks) and commission-free payments with comfort offered by a local bank. In addition, the Czech and Slovak branches launched mSaver (My Goals), an automatic savings product developed on the basis of customer behaviour analysis. In H1 2019, we were the first on the market to launch new solutions which had been expected by many clients. We introduced modern payment methods, including Apple Pay, Garmin Pay, and Fitbit Pay, on both markets in 2019. Both branches acquired 34,200 clients in 2019. The total number of clients served on both markets went up to 958,600 at the end of 2019 (291,500 in Slovakia and 667,000 in the Czech Republic). As part of the strategic partnership with Broker Consulting, a Czech independent financial service broker, our products and services were available in 45 co118 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 branded advisory centres (OK Points) specialising in banking services. The OK Points were equipped with mBank’s cash deposit machines. mBank’s business in the Czech Republic and Slovakia won several major awards in 2019. We again took top spots in the Zlatá koruna (Golden Crown) contest, winning a total of four awards, including the main awards in the two most important categories – Retail Clients’ Choice and Entrepreneurs’ Choice. Our mobile app ranked third in the league table of online and mobile banking channels. mBank’s mortgage and mKonto won the golden and silver awards in the Finparáda – The Financial Product of the Year contest, respectively. The contest is based on an evaluation of annual market data conducted by Scott & Ross analysts to determine the best products from the point of view of benefits offered to clients in the previous year. mBank’s business in the Czech Republic received the Superbrands award for the fourth consecutive time, while the Slovak branch won this distinction for the third time. The awards confirm mBank’s position among the strongest brands in both countries. Loans and deposits The growth rate of mBank’s loan portfolio in the Czech Republic and Slovakia demonstrates the positive development trend. As at the end of 2019, the loan portfolio was worth PLN 5,083.8 million, up by PLN 374.9 million or 8.0% compared to the end of 2018. The growth was again driven primarily by non-mortgage loans. New nonmortgage loan sales initiatives accompanied by product and origination process enhancements allowed the foreign branches to increase non-mortgage loans’ sales by 11.3% year on year to PLN 788.4 million. Sales of non-mortgage loans in the Czech Republic amounted to PLN 585.0 million, up by 12.2% year on year. Sales of nonmortgage loans in Slovakia increased by 9.1% year on year and stood at PLN 203.4 million. Increases were reported in all sales channels. The increase in the share of cash loans sold via the mobile app from 5% to 10% in the whole of 2019 is particularly worth mentioning. Our mortgage loan sales efforts in 2019 were focused on reviving lending in our Slovak branch, which was impacted by the introduction of the Polish banking tax, and maintaining previous sales levels in the Czech Republic. Total new sales of mortgages in the foreign branches amounted to PLN 844.8 million in 2019, up by 12.0% year on year. We successfully increased mortgage sales in Slovakia to PLN 311.8 million, up by 88.9% against the previous year.

The year 2019 saw an increase in corporate loans and deposits. The corporate loans market grew by 2.6% year on year, whereas the corporate deposits market expanded by 9.7%. mBank outperformed the market with its loan and deposit volumes up by 17.0% and 20.9%, respectively. At the end of 2019 mBank’s shares in the market for corporate loans and deposits reached 7.5% and 9.9%, respectively. In 2019 the bank further intensified its efforts to attract new corporate clients, which resulted in high acquisition of new companies: the corporate client base (K1, K2 and K3) grew by 2,770 companies year on year to 26,476. Consequently, client acquisition grew by 11.7% year on year. Successful client acquisition pushed current account deposits held with mBank up to PLN 24.8 billion at the end of 2019, which represents an increase by 14.9% year on year. The high volume of current deposits is a springboard for continued 123 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 development of transactional banking, which is of special relevance to the bank due to its growth potential and further tightening of cooperation with clients. Interestingly, the number of factoring clients grew by 37.5% compared with 2018. In 2019 the bank conducted another Corporate Client Satisfaction Survey. It is a relationship exercise designed to comprehensively assess clients’ cooperation with the bank. We believe that feedback from clients is a highly valuable indicator of measures that should be taken in order to enhance our image as a bank offering the very best solutions for demanding corporate clients. When measuring customer satisfaction, our key focus is always on the Net Promoter Score (NPS). The NPS for corporate clients who indicated mBank as their main bank stood at 41, which is similar to the previous year’s figure. mBank fared much better than the market average of 17 (source: Kantar Polska, August 2019). The most important element of the NPS programme is the closed-loop feedback process: mBank advisers talk to representatives of the surveyed corporate clients immediately after the survey to collect more detailed feedback and uncover the reasons for detractors’ reluctance to recommend the bank and for promoters’ willingness to suggest mBank to their business partners. The sound level of NPS in the Corporate and Investment Banking segment is a result of active measures taken as part of the mSatisfaction project (“mSatysfakcja”). The main goal of this initiative is to increase the level of genuine satisfaction with mBank’s offer and services among corporate clients, listen to clients, and improve their relationship with the bank in the context of promoting one of the most significant values fostered by mBank – empathy towards clients. The mSatysfakcja project involves, among others, transactional surveys. We ask clients how satisfied they are with individual products and processes offered by mBank and how likely they are to recommend them. 2019 saw further growth and development in the small and medium-sized enterprises segment (SME K3), as evidenced by a 37% year-on-year upturn in the number of new clients. Advanced corporate banking services coupled with state-of-the-art tools, including the modern electronic banking system mBank CompanyNet, were highly popular with clients. Digitalisation processes enable greater self-service for current account holders. The state-of the-art electronic banking system features, in particular the Administrator’s Centre enabling clients to easily manage users and rights. This solution has already been used by as many as 60% of SME clients. In addition, the Virtual Branch allows clients to apply for products and services. mBank’s initiatives and actions introduced so far in the K3 segment have been well received by clients, which is reflected by customer satisfaction survey results (NPS of 37 for entrepreneurs that indicated mBank as their main bank). In addition, the proportion of corporate clients satisfied or very satisfied with mBank’s services stood at 75%, which is similar to last year’s figure (source: Corporate Client Satisfaction Survey K3 Segment, September 2019). 124 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In order to respond to challenging market conditions, mBank has been continuously enhancing its SME customer service processes and adjusting its product portfolio to client needs and the legal environment. For example, we launched new packaged deals for SMEs. Clients can choose from three deals offering key banking products and services (Growth (“Rozwój”), Balance (“Równowaga”) or World (“Świat”), depending on which suits their business best. More than 60% of clients have already chosen to take this offer. We introduced a new customer service model dedicated to business clients who have so far not been actively using banking products or seeking support from advisors. The new service is provided by a team of virtual advisors entitled to render the services of traditional advisors. Thanks to this new solution every SME client, regardless of the scale of business, can receive help from advisors and gets in touch with the bank more readily. 2019 was the second year when Corporate Banking launched an offer dedicated to the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WOŚP). As part of the campaign entitled You Don’t Grow Out of Good Things (“Z dobrych rzeczy się nie wyrasta”) 228 corporate clients decided to open an account with mBank and donate all bank account and transfer fees due for the period from January to June 2019 to WOŚP. mBank’s Corporate Banking was awarded by the Global Finance international magazine and took top spot in two categories: the World’s Best Treasury and Cash Management Banks and Providers 2019 and the Best Corporate Digital Bank 2019. Furthermore, the bank was also named the best digital bank for corporates in Central and Eastern Europe in the World’s Best Corporate/Institutional Digital Banks 2019 contest. The Cashless Poland Foundation (Fundacja Polska Bezgotówkowa) once again recognised mBank for its efforts to promote cashless payments in Poland. The bank was awarded in the category of entities with the highest sales of contracts under the Cashless Poland Programme in 2019. In October 2019 the Euromoney magazine announced the results of its annual survey in which clients assessed the quality of services offered by their banks. Once again mBank was among the leaders of the Euromoney Cash Management Survey and ranked second in Poland in the Best Services category. The financial services offered by banks were assessed by finance managers CFOs, treasurers and accountants. mBank has been at the top of this league table for several years, which shows clients’ appreciation for the quality of services, innovative solutions, and personalized approach offered by the bank. In H1 2019 mBank was also a laureate of the Financing Bank of the Year award of the Polish Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (Polskie Stowarzyszenie Inwestorów Kapitałowych, PSIK) for its achievements on the Polish private equity/venture capital market. In the Financing Bank of the Year category mBank was also awarded the Investment Diamonds prize for the most professional bank supporting investment. 125 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The key objective of Corporate and Investment Banking is to continue the dynamic growth in the K3 segment and maintain a strong position in the K2 segment. Moreover, we put an even greater focus on streamlining processes, simplifying documentation, and introducing improvements to enhance our clients’ everyday comfort. The solution enabling clients to cross-check accounts against the white list of VAT payers developed in 2019 can serve as an example. Starting from 2020, a new law provides for sanctions for corporate clients transferring more than PLN 15,000 to an account not included on the white list. On January 7, 2020, mBank enabled its clients to cross-check the accounts of their beneficiaries against the white list in mBank CompanyNet. The service is free of charge regardless of the transfer amount. This way mBank responds to the needs of its clients and makes doing business in the ever-changing legal environment easier for them. Digital Client Onboarding („Cyfrowy onboarding Klienta – COBRA”) is another innovative project launched at mBank to digitalise the client onboarding process. The project will deliver an electronic sales platform offering the majority of transactional banking products, in particular bank accounts, payment cards or cash service, and facilitating innovative interactions with clients. The primary goal of the project is to add real value to clients by reducing the time needed to open a corporate account with the bank and by digitalising the process, i.e. getting rid of paper applications, agreements, and signature specimen cards. The project is expected to boost efficiency by creating an acquisition process that reduces the workload for advisors and by migrating all the processes operated by advisors to one single system.

The BGK guarantee limit for mBank stands at PLN 780 million. As at December 31, 2019, the limit utilisation level reached PLN 648.4 million. European Union financing On July 10, 2019, the bank signed a new agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) on opening a EUR 125 million credit line (SMEs and MID-CAPs and Climate Actions) dedicated to financing projects and liabilities related to the production cycle of SMEs (entities with fewer than 250 employees) and MID-CAPs (entities with a headcount ranging from over 250 to fewer than 3,000 employees). One-third of the credit line will be allocated to climate action projects.

The solutions streamline daily financial operations, enhance effective cash flow management, and help to optimise interest costs and income. 128 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank's vast and ever-expanding range of cash management products and services supports long-term relationships with clients.

Detailed information on the services for corporate clients introduced at mBank in relation with PSD2 is available at www.mbank.pl/psd2/mspkorporacje . Cash deposit machines for businesses To address the needs of businesses and the market, mBank develops a service called the smart cash deposit machine.

The service has been increasingly popular with our clients: 186 deposit machines were set up in 2018 compared with 262 machines in 2019 (up by 41% year on year). Each product is tailored to the needs and nature of a given business. Furthermore, to address the unique demands of its clients, mBank also offers a more complex machine consisting of a cash recycler which dispenses particular banknotes, and a cash deposit machine which allows clients to deposit their revenue. The service is also available in the standard version featuring basic functionalities, dedicated to less demanding clients. 130 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Financial Markets Financial results In 2019 the Financial Markets segment generated a profit before tax of PLN 151.8 million compared with PLN 83.4 million posted in 2018, marking an increase by PLN 68.4 million, i.e. 82.0%, year on year.

At the same time, the core income decreased year on year: net interest income by PLN 18.0 million (-7.1%) mainly due to lower yields on treasury bonds and net fee and commission income by PLN 6.3 million (-62.7%) due to an increase in commission costs;  Drop in operating expenses (including depreciation) by 7.2% year on year to PLN 101.4 million as a result of lower material and personnel costs;  Tax on the Group’s balance sheet items at PLN 36.8 million, i.e. similar to the level from 2018 (+0.8% year on year) Activity of the Financial Markets segment in 2019 In 2019, the activities of the financial market products sales area were focused on the preparation and running of projects aiming at improving customer service and increasing the number of clients using digital channels. The work resulted in the desk for managing 131 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 clients who independently conclude transactions on the currency platform (mPlatforma Walutowa). We also provided new margin policy for the clients of Corporate Banking. Additionally, the Financial Markets Sales Department undertook activities that affected the volume of transactions and income generated from the bank’s cooperation with clients:  Low volatility made it necessary for sales teams to step up their efforts in acquiring new clients over the phone, which eventually pushed the margin on telephone transactions with corporate clients up by 14.8% year on year;  The margin on transactions of corporate clients concluded via the currency platform grew by 15.9% year on year;  Intensive acquisition measures in Retail Banking resulted in margins going up by 24.9% in this segment. Almost 26,000 corporate clients (an increase by 12.6% year on year) and more than 116,000 individual clients (an increase by 131.4% year on year) used the currency platform. The number of new private banking clients using the DSM offer totalled 250;  99.1% of FX transactions in Retail Banking were concluded via digital channels (online banking – 42.0% and mobile banking – 57.1%);  For the first time ever, the Commodity Transactions Sales Division exceeded the PLN 10 million threshold margin on commodity price hedging transactions concluded by corporate clients (PLN 10.5 million), which accounted for a 35.1% increase year on year. Organising the Polish day of the London Metal Exchange (LME) in Warsaw (in cooperation with the LME) and participating as a speaker in the event held in London helped mBank reach an even greater number of clients in Poland and make a name for itself abroad. Owing to the almost finished project of automating transaction recording and confirmation, the commodity business will reach a higher level and continue to grow dynamically in 2020;  The sales projects team processed over 100 structured finance and CRE projects jointly with specialised entities from the corporate banking area and mLeasing, thus increasing income from commodity price hedging transactions by more than 20.0% year on year. In mid-2019, new rules for cross-selling of derivatives were developed to bring the sales of such instruments into compliance with requirements of MIFID II. mBank’s market shares in specific financial instrument markets as of November 30, 2019, are presented below: Treasury bills & bonds IRS/FRA mBank 11.3% 15.1% Financial Institutions The Financial Markets area covers relations with financial institutions, focusing mainly on raising capital from other banks and placing excess funds with them. 132 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 As at December 31, 2019, mBank had 9 active received loans in the amount of PLN 4,044 million, of which the utilized value stood at PLN 3,579 million.

At the same time, the bank was still serving banks from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and offering them medium-term loans secured with KUKE (Export Credit Insurance Corporation) insurance policies. Custody services mBank provides services including settlement of transactions in securities registered in local and foreign markets, safe-keeping of clients’ assets, maintenance of securities accounts and registers of securities in non-public trading, maintenance of asset registers of pension funds and investment funds, monitoring the valuation of their assets, and processing corporate actions. mBank’s custody clients are mainly financial institutions, in particular investment and pension funds, local and foreign financial institutions, banks offering custodian and investment services, insurance companies, asset management institutions and non-financial institutions. In 2019, the number of served investment funds increased by 11% year on year. 133 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Business activity of selected subsidiaries Summary of financial results of mBank Group subsidiaries In 2019, the profit before tax generated by mBank Group subsidiaries amounted to PLN 210.8 million, compared with PLN 522.7 million in the previous year. The year-on-year decrease was attributable to, among others, changes in the Group’s structure. Key driver was sale of an organised part of mFinanse enterprise in 2018. Higher results were recorded by mLeasing, mBank Hipoteczny and mFaktoring. Decline of the result of “Other” position was mainly related to the sale of real estate previously owned by Garbary subsidiary in 2018. The table below presents the profit before tax posted by individual subsidiaries in 2019 compared with 2018.

In the period under review, mFinanse reported also an increase in cash loan sales by 3.6% (PLN 632.2 million against PLN 610.3 million a year before). The profit from selling car loans dedicated to car dealers rose year on year by 42.3% (PLN 451.1 million compared with PLN 324.4 million in 2018). In 2019 the subsidiary’s sales results in the area of car leasing increased by 5.0% (PLN 133.9 million against PLN 127.6 million 2018). In 2019, mFinanse continued its sales network development project aimed at placing new outlets (mKiosks). It is oriented on improving the scope of physical presence of mBank and mFinanse in the regions where we were absent before. During the period under review, number of mKiosks managed by mFinanse increased by 23, up to 166 outlets at the end of 2019. The subsidiary’s profit before tax in 2019 amounted to PLN 33.3 million compared with PLN 364.4 million a year before. The profit before tax generated in 2019 originated mainly from the core activity of the subsidiary in scope of financial intermediation. Significantly higher result recorded in 2018 was, to a large extent, influenced by sale transactions of organised parts of insurance business. The value of contracts executed by mLeasing in 2019 amounted to PLN 5.3 million compared with PLN 6.1 billion in 2018, which represents a decrease by 13.1% year on year. Sales deterioration in 2019 originated mainly from decline in the vehicles sector, observed on the whole leasing market. Its primary reason was the high reference base, meaning bigger value of transactions in 2018. It was partially justified by changing legal provisions in scope of leasing which took place in 2018. The value of contracts regarding movables concluded in 2019 amounted to PLN 5.0 billion compared with PLN 6.0 billion a year before (i.e. -16.1% year on year), while the value of contracts concerning real estate stood at PLN 0.3 billion compared with PLN 0.1 billion in 2018 (i.e. +127.1% year on year). The profit before tax of mLeasing in 2019 amounted to PLN 96.1 million and was higher by 47.7% compared to the result generated in 2018, of PLN 65.1 million. In 2019 we observed continuation of increasing cost of funding expressed in higher margin on loans received by mLeasing. On March 8, 2019, mLeasing concluded an acquisition of 100% shares in LeaseLink. The subsidiary operates in the fintech sector and specialises in funding of business owners’ 135 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 purchases online and in stationary shops. Transaction enhances mLeasing’s position in funding of small and medium enterprises. It also opens the subsidiary up to new possibilities of funding smaller-value assets. mLeasing is the only owner of LeaseLink. In 2019, profit before tax of LeaseLink amounted to PLN 2.6 million. 2019 was our best year concerning new business of CFM (Car Fleet Management). New agreements worth PLN 1 billion were concluded. According to the CEPIK, central register of vehicles and drivers, mLeasing is the second market player in scope of the number of new cars acquired for CFM in 2019. The “Leasing in Retail” project continued in 2019. The initiative is dedicated to mBank’s business clients and enables them to conclude a leasing agreement using special leasing processes. Thanks to the combined efforts of Retail Banking and mLeasing, in 2019 mLeasing financed fixed assets obtained in cooperation with Retail Banking worth PLN 395.6 million according to their purchase price. In 2019, mBank Hipoteczny (mBH) placed 2 issues of mortgage covered bonds in the total nominal amount of PLN 1.4 billion. Details concerning covered bonds issue are described in chapter 5.2. mBank Group funding. Covered bonds issues in 2013-2019 700 710 2,032 1,541 1,580 1,378 1,004 870 417 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Private placement Public programme The gross loan portfolio of mBank Hipoteczny totalled PLN 11.9 billion at the end of 2019 (i.e. +6.0% compared to 2018). That change was driven mainly by a systematic rise in the retail portfolio, which expanded over the year by 21.1%. The growth results from conclusion of eight pooling transactions, totalling PLN 1.9 billion in 2019. In 2019, stand-alone profit before tax of the subsidiary remained at the level close to the previous year. Gross profit of 2019 amounted to PLN 61.3 million compared to PLN 60.7 million a year before. The highest impact on the generated result was driven by the stronger trading result and growth of net interest income (+5.7%). It is linked, among others, to the higher prepayments in the corporate portfolio by 8% than year ago. Moreover, due to the lower 136 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 value of corporate loans, mBank Hipoteczny recorded a decline of loan loss provisions by 2.4%. In 2019, the company was growing dynamically, breaking new business records. Turnover (the value of purchased invoices) increased by 16.3% compared to 2018. It reached historically high level of PLN 22.3 billion. The company was growing at similar pace that the domestic factoring market. Thanks to this the company ranked fifth on the factoring market in Poland, ascending by 1 position compared with 2018. Our market share was 7.9%, according to the Polish Factors Association. In 2019 mFaktoring acquired nearly 200 new clients and currently serves over 750 customers. All corporate branches actively participated in development of factoring portfolio, adding PLN 1,057 million of new factoring limits. Structure of clients distributed by corporate segments was as follows: K1 – PLN 384 million (9 clients), K2 – PLN 506 million (76 clients), K3 – PLN 168 million (138 clients). Dynamic business development positively contributed to an improvement of subsidiary’s financial results. The profit before tax of mFaktoring amounted to PLN 25.3 million compared to PLN 21.0 million in the previous year. 137 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Investments The investment projects run by mBank in 2019 were aimed primarily to support technological development and, in consequence, further organic growth of the bank. We put the greatest emphasis on solutions enhancing customer satisfaction and experience. With PLN 424.1 million spent in 2019 (vs. PLN 363.5 million in 2018) the Group’s investment spending was lower than in the past years. As in the previous years, the biggest portion of mBank’s investment spending was allocated to IT (PLN 339.9 million). We further enhanced our mobile banking app by launching new features such as the finance navigator for private banking clients and factoring financing for small and medium-sized enterprises. Other important investments which began in 2019 and will be continued in 2020 include the development of mInvest, an investment app, and mDM Mobile, a brokerage services app that will replace the current one. Our digitalisation efforts focused on, among others, automation of the mortgage process for individuals, improvement of customer interaction in the chat platform, direct invoicing in online banking, and client onboarding via video chat. We continued to invest in cost optimisation and process efficiency improvement projects. We streamlined our lending processes for businesses and implemented a new centralised onboarding and after-sales service model in Corporate Banking. We increased our operational advantage through internal process automation and procurement platform development. Furthermore, we carried out a number of projects adjusting the bank’s processes and systems to new regulations, such as MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive), PSD2 (Payment Services Directive), EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the new definition of default (changes affecting default triggers and parameters), and changes in Polish tax regulations (clearing house ICT system (STIR) and split payment). 138 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 With PLN 41.2 million, the real property area ranked second in terms of investment spending. In 2019 we continued the One Network project adding two light branches to the existing network (in Warsaw and Katowice). Investment plans for 2020 Investments scheduled for 2020 will focus on further digital transformation. We will be optimising and automating customer service and internal processes to strengthen our competitive advantage. The projects will support our digital first approach and omnichannel customer service. We will further enhance our mobile app in 2020 by offering clients new features and improving the existing ones. Our investment efforts will be aimed at the development of transactional elements, such as the BLIK service, regular payment management, payment assistant, and personal finance manager. We also plan to integrate the app with additional services, such as parking, public transport, and motorway payments. We will continue to invest in the development of our online banking platform. We plan to launch new transaction navigation, simplify money transfers sent to beneficiaries in Poland and the EU, and adjust the main scenarios to the needs of blind clients. The new Warsaw headquarters of mBank and mBank Group subsidiaries located in the Mennica Legacy Tower will be one of our most important investments in 2020. The project is planned to be completed in 2021. We will also continue to optimise our branch network. Two additional branches and four initially scheduled for 2019 will be opened in 2020. We will also focus on ensuring full compliance of our business with the applicable legal requirements. 139 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Environment (E) Management of the environment area We consciously manage our environmental impact and try to reduce the negative impact. 102-11 For the first time in mBank’s history environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives have been made an integral part of the business strategy. Commitment to protect the climate and the environment are among our priorities. We wish to reduce our direct and indirect impact on the environment. We will promote attitudes that will help stop and reverse negative climate and environmental changes among our clients. We will pursue an active credit policy towards entities seeking financing for environment-friendly industrial, infrastructure, and residential investments:  project financing, e.g. for renewable energy systems  issuing sustainable/green bonds and covered bonds We will implement investment strategies based on ESG analysis and offer products building environmental awareness among our clients. Our objectives include:  mBank’s presence in the WIG-ESG index,  implementation of the internal credit policy on sectors relevant to the EU climate policy,  launching incentives for clients encouraging them to shift to renewable energy sources. 140 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 We implement objectives related to reducing our impact on the climate mainly through credit policies governing our approach to financing industries which are crucial from the point of view of climate change. CO2 emission To reduce our direct impact on the climate, we measure and will gradually reduce our total carbon footprint. We save water and energy, sort waste, and run educational campaigns for employees. We also promote sustainable growth among our partners. OUR OBJECTIVES INCLUDE:  reducing mBank’s carbon footprint,  reducing the consumption of electrical energy and natural gas,  reducing the environmental footprint of the car fleet,  saving water, paper, and office supplies in mBank’s head offices and branches,  recycling,  introducing a supplier selection and cooperation system incorporating ESG aspects. Direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1): 4,211.39 t CO2e in 2019, 4390.86 t CO2e in 2018* * data for 2018 have been updated (compared to the data presented in the mBank Annual Report 2018) with the consumption of gasoline and diesel fuel 141 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased and consumed electrical energy, steam, heat, and cooling (Scope 2): 11,210.61 t CO2e in 2019, 11,943.6 t CO2e in 2018 In 2019 we consumed 33,208.03 MWh of energy from non-renewable sources, compared with 34,428.08 MWh in 2018. Restrictions on coal financing We decided to cut financing for the coal power industry and coal mines. In March 2019 we decided to change the rules of lending to the mining and coal power industries. On 1 April 2019 mBank stopped financing new coal mines and coal-fired power plant units. In addition, we will not enter into relationships with companies in which more than 50% of electrical energy comes from coal (the share will be measured based on the power generation capacity). Support for renewable energy sources In H2 2019 we decided to substantially increase funding for renewable energy projects – from the previous PLN 500 million to PLN 1 billion. We will finance investments implemented under the auction-based support scheme. In addition, we are interested in projects operating on market terms, e.g. based on power purchase agreements (PPA). So far, a substantial part of the funding has been granted to the wind power sector, while the remaining portion has been used to support the development of solar energy. We wish to focus on financing projects operating within the government’s support system. 142 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The key projects in 2019 included the signing of the biggest solar energy financing contract in Poland worth PLN 90 million. The money was used to start the construction of 34 solar power plants with a capacity of 33 MW covering an area of approx. 70 hectares. The project will generate approx. 35,000 MWh of energy a year, which is enough to power 15,000 homes, and will reduce CO2 emissions by 30,000 tons a year. Our subsidiary mLeasing has also launched financing for solar panels. The solution is addressed to small and medium-sized enterprises allowing them to cut electricity bills by as much as 70% thanks to green energy. In line with the new regulations enterprises can be prosumers of electrical energy. Importantly, the initial financial contribution of an enterprise to a solar power investment is low, while lease instalments can be classified as tax deductible expenses. Enterprises using solar panels can largely avoid the consequences of rising energy prices The new solutions launched by mBank’s leasing company allow enterprises to finance photovoltaic systems worth up to PLN 250,000 with a maximum capacity of 50 kW. The maximum lease period is 6 years. The enterprise is required to make a financial contribution of 10% of the value of the investment. The decision to grant financing is issued by mLeasing within one business day. Environmental awareness among consumers and businesses is rising. Therefore, increasingly more companies are choosing renewable energy sources for ethical or marketing reasons. Our new solutions offer them easy access to green energy. mBank Group is committed to protecting the environment. As part of this commitment, we stopped financing companies from the conventional energy industry and support the development of green energy. Our new leasing solutions reflect this strategy, helping other companies to become greener. Cezary Raczyński, CEO of mLeasing 143 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Our approach to client relationships (S) Our clients Our approach to client relationships Since 2018 we have been designing new products and services and developing the existing ones together with our clients using the design thinking approach. We have been conducting in-depth individual and group research and asking clients to assess the preliminary versions of our solutions. We set up a group of moderators specialising in design thinking, an approach to creating products and services based on profound understanding of the needs of their end-users, and developed methods for using the design thinking toolkit in our business projects. The group is composed of 16 people from various areas and departments. We created mBank Lab, a space where we hold meetups, creative workshops and interviews with clients. This new approach allows us to deliver solutions which address the needs of clients even better. By the end of 2019 we cooperated with nearly 200 clients. Client satisfaction is our priority. We conduct regular satisfaction surveys among retail and corporate clients. 102-43 Retail clients At mBank we monitor client satisfaction at the following levels: Strategic: Operational:  Four times a year in cooperation with  We defined 13 key touchpoints with the TNS KANTAR, a research firm, we bank for which transactional NPS is survey the loyalty of our clients using a monitored. Based on the results, we dedicated metric: relational NPS. precisely identify the major needs and Based on the survey results, we expectations of our clients. identify the key reasons why clients  We continuously measure the recommend mBank to their friends satisfaction of clients using individual and family as well as areas that need contact channels. We analyse the development. In 2019 the relational feedback from clients and swiftly react NPS stood at 13. to their expectations. 144 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Corporate clients As part of the “mSatysfakcja” (“mSatifcation”) project we survey the satisfaction of corporate clients twice every year. In addition, we compare our relational NPS with the industry average.  The relational survey is addressed to all clients. We ask clients how likely they are to recommend mBank to their business partners (which is measured by the NPS) and how satisfied they are from their relationship with mBank. This is how we identify the key reasons why clients recommend our services and areas that need improvement. In 2019 the NPS was 33 for all corporate clients and 41 for clients who named mBank their first-choice bank (market average: 17; source: Kantar Polska, August 2019). In addition, the proportion of corporate clients satisfied or very satisfied with mBank’s services stood at 75%, which is similar to the 2018 figure.  The transactional survey evaluates specific processes or clients’ interactions with the bank. We defined 13 touchpoints for which transactional NPS is measured. Based on the results, we improve products and streamline processes. The conversations between mBank advisors and representatives of corporate clients held immediately after the survey are the most important element of the NPS programme. The purpose is to obtain more detailed information from clients and find out why they recommend mBank to their business partners or advise them against it. Access to financial services We provide financial services to clients all over the country: nearly one-fifth of all our branches are located in sparsely populated or economically disadvantaged areas. Wherever there is Internet access, clients can access our online banking and app-based mobile banking. FS13 Number Number of 2019 of retail TOTAL mKiosks branches: Total number of points of access to financial 143 166 309 services offered by the bank Number of points of access to financial services located in low-populated1 or 36 43 79 economically disadvantaged** areas Percentage of points of access located in lowpopulated or economically disadvantaged 25% 26% 25,60% areas 1 According to Statistics Poland (GUS) the lowest populated regions in Poland include: Podlaskie, WarmińskoMazurskie, Lubuskie, Zachodniopomorskie, Lubelskie, Opolskie and Świętokrzyskie. 145 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 2 According to the Local Data Bank, regions in Poland with the lowest economic activity include: Lubuskie, Opolskie, Podlaskie, Pomorskie, Warmińsko-Mazurskie, Zachodniopomorskie and Świętokrzyskie. Principles of lending to the defence sector When cooperating with the defence sector, mBank takes into account political, social, ethical and environmental issues which may negatively impact its reputation. In principle, we enter into transactions with public entities from the defence sector, i.e. government agencies and state-owned companies. Policy on providing services and financing to entities operating in areas that are particularly sensitive in terms of mBank’s reputation risk The policy imposes restrictions on providing services to companies from sectors which are controversial from the social perspective and break the Ten Principles of UN Global Compact. The restrictions apply to opening accounts for and lending to companies, including mBank’s existing clients, that:  operate based on child labour, forced labour or otherwise grossly abuse human rights,  are oriented towards economic exploitation of areas of great natural interest,  threaten the global cultural heritage. We do not establish business relationships with entities operating in countries covered by UN sanctions. “PRZYJACIEL KLIENTA” (“CLIENT’S FRIEND”) The “Client’s friend” project is a response to our clients’ and employees’ willingness to contribute to building mBank. We gather ideas and suggestions about the range of products and services offered by mBank, analyse them to find the most expected changes and design potential solutions together with competent organisational units. Every client can share their ideas via online banking or any other access channel (mLinia, branches, email, chat) and social media (Facebook, Twitter). To offer ideas, one does not need to identify themselves or even be a client. Having registered an idea, the author receives an automatic thank-you message. In 2019 we introduced an additional thank-you message (push) sent within 48 hours after a client contributes an idea. We analyse every suggestion and inform the authors once their ideas are implemented. Also our employees can tell us about their ideas, comments and expectations, using a dedicated form available on the intranet. The employees receive individual replies to their suggestions. 146 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In 2019 we analysed over 6,000 ideas proposed by our clients. MEETINGS WITH SME CLIENTS  When designing or modifying our products, services and processes, we tend not to rely on metrics only because we perceive our clients, first and foremost, as living human beings. This is why we organise meetings as part of the “Oko w oko z klientem firmowym” (“Eye to eye with SME clients”) programme. Every month we invite one client to share their business story and talk about the challenges they face. It is all the more important because the employees of the bank’s head office and business lines do not contact clients on a daily basis, despite being the ones who prepare offers or service procedures. We estimate that approx. 350 employees took part in the meetings in 2019.  In 2019 we extended the initiative to include also meetings and design thinking workshops with students and pupils and interactions with e-commerce representatives, enterprising women, and the 50+ generation. Client data security To companies operating in the financial industry effective protection of client data and privacy is a prerequisite for credibility. At mBank this area is governed by the Personal Data Security Policy developed in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It stipulates the principles laid down in the GDPR and the rights of data subjects. We appointed a personal data officer who can be contacted at: inspektordanychosobowych@mbank.pl. For more information on how mBank protects data of its clients, go to our website. 418-1 In 2019:  8 complaints about breaching client privacy and losing client data filed by external parties were confirmed by the organisation (all complaints concerned mFinanse)  1 complaint was filed by the supervisory authorities (concerning mFinanse)  39 cases of client data leaks, theft or loss were identified by the organisation (36 at mBank, 1 at mBank Hipoteczny and 2 at mFinanse) 147 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Innovation is our middle name The most innovative bank in Poland Our efforts have been recognised by industry institutions. Banking Awards is a competition for banks from all over the world. In 2019 mBank won the award for the most innovative retail bank in Poland. The jury hailed mBank as a trendsetter in online and mobile banking in Poland. Our mobile app as well the broad range of mobile payment options (Google Pay, Apple Pay, and BLIK) were also appreciated. Moreover, we were recognised for our cooperation with fintechs in developing innovations, including ones addressed to retail clients. Mobile app In 2019 we continued to develop our mobile app. Throughout this time the app was updated 15 times, which shows that we are agile in introducing changes and responding to client expectations. The work on the app was focused mainly on improving its utility a well as communication and sales activities. Despite numerous challenges connected with Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), we introduced a number of improvements making the app even more user-friendly.  New card details and PIN change option the card details screen has been redesigned, enabling users to quickly find important information and take actions. In addition, users can now change their card PIN in the app.  Option to add new payees to the address book. When making a transfer to a new payee users can now save the payee’s details in the address book for quick future use.  New look and feel of mKantor, new currencies, currency calculator for card transactions A number of improvements useful to travellers and all those in need of currency exchange. The mKantor service has been enhanced to cover new currencies. At the same time, we redesigned the mKantor screens to make currency transactions even more intuitive to users. We also introduced a currency calculator converting amounts entered by clients in foreign currencies into PLN according to current exchange rates.  New details in transfer confirmation message Clients can decide to include the following details in the transfer confirmation messages: transaction amount, payee and payer, merchant’s name (for card operations).  Option to partially withdraw funds from a savings goal. Clients are allowed to withdraw a part of their savings without cancelling the savings goal.  Option to repeat transfers to the Social Security Institution (ZUS) and the Tax Office. Clients can repeat payments to ZUS and the Tax Office selected from their 148 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 account history. The new repeat option available in the operation details section automatically completes the details of a new transfer using the details of a selected previous transfer to ZUS or the Tax Office.  New BLIK screen. New, easy-to-read BLIK code screen designed in line with comments and suggestions from clients; it also paves the way for new BLIK services to be introduced soon (the “Request a transfer” service was launched in Q1 2020).  mFaktoring service. Enables SME clients to activate a factoring limit, register new invoices and repay debts.  “Your Assets” screen. A summary of a client’s finances. At the end of 2019 the app had 1,894.7 thousand users, which accounts for more than 70% of active clients. This result makes mBank the leader in Polish banking. On average a client uses the app about 31 times a month. As many as 72.1% of all logins into mBank originate in the app. We sell 43.6% of travel insurance policies and 12.5% of cash loans in the app. Compared with 2018, the value of non-secured loans granted in the app grew by 102.4%. In March 2019 mBank app won the Mobile Trend Awards competition in the “Banking and Finance” category. At the same time, our app ranked fifth in the Forrester league table (“The Forrester Banking Wave™: European Mobile Apps”). Complaints We prevent complaints from arising We analyse complaints filed with the bank and – together with business experts – develop initiatives to reduce their number. In addition, lessons learnt from complaints are used in the process of designing new products and services. Complaints from retail clients Our objective is to resolve problems communicated by clients in a manner satisfactory to the complaining client during the first contact. For example, if possible, we credit the funds complained about to the client’s account while they speak to our consultant. If it is not possible, we spare no effort to resolve the case as quickly as practicable. In 2019 we resolved 59% of complaints within only one business day. We want our clients to be satisfied with how we handled their problem. The high percentage of complaints resolved in favour of clients (82% in 2019) proves that we are successful in achieving this objective. Once we resolve a client’s complaint, we ask the client to complete an NPS questionnaire and rate how satisfied they are from how we handled the complaint. We use the answers given in the questionnaires to change in the directions expected by clients. 149 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Complaints from corporate clients Every complaint provides us with valuable information. We use the knowledge from complaints filed by corporate clients to perfect our existing products and services and design new ones. Corporate clients can file complaints by phone, email, in writing or in person at a bank’s branch or via mBank CompanyNet. If they choose mBank CompanyNet, they receive an acknowledgement of their complaint which is sent directly to the unit in charge of handling complaints. Our response is also sent electronically. In 2019 we resolved 80% of complaints in favour of clients. We resolve complaints as quickly as possible within not more than 15 business days. If the case is particularly complex, it takes a maximum of 35 business days. We are committed to minimising the negative impact of the events complained about on our clients. Committed employees Our employees mBank’s employees – their knowledge, experience and commitment – are our organisation’s capital. They allow us to generate innovations and respond to our clients’ needs more and more effectively. We make sure that the rules governing recruitment, remuneration, promotion and HR management are transparent, motivating and empathic. Employment and HR management are governed in particular by the Work Rules of mBank S.A., the Remuneration Policy of mBank S.A. and the Rules for Awarding Bonuses to mBank S.A. Employees. The internal regulations are supplemented by procedures pertaining to recruitment, development, and employee evaluation. As far as the characteristics of the conducted business do not require exceptions, the solutions adopted at mBank are subsequently applied in mBank Group subsidiaries. We ensure effective cooperation and communication across mBank Group using the Management by Objectives (MbO) System. 4,841 3,383 8,224 of our employees are of our employees are men total number of women employees How we ensure commitment 404-2 DEVELOPMENT FRIDAYS 150 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 On every first Friday of the month we organise diverse development activities for our employees: workshops, lectures, presentations, meetings, and consultations, during which we present to them development opportunities offered by our organisation and encourage them to adopt a wider perspective as regards increasing their potential. We also present development tools powered by new technologies. At most of these meetings, mBank staff shares their knowledge; however, we also eagerly draw on the know-how of the invited guests. In 2019, 180 meetings and consultations attended by more than 3,100 persons took place as part of the project. LOG IN TO DEVELOPMENT As part of the “Log in to Development” programme, we give interested employees access to reliable materials supporting individual development. The materials help them broaden their knowledge in areas related to their daily tasks, acquire additional skills (e.g. social skills, such as communication and assertiveness) and encourage personal development (e.g. materials on raising children, well-being, fiction reads). We thus support the work-life balance and create a workplace that is conducive to inquisitiveness, learning and broadening one’s horizons. Available materials:  news and development materials available online on a dedicated website  over 20,000 online courses and additional materials from LinkedIn Learning  e-books and audiobooks from the catalogue on the Legimi platform  archive of publications of Harvard Business Review Polska  mobile English and German courses – eTutor app  text messages presenting new vocabulary and development content The goal of the “Log in to Development” programme is to change the perception of remote development tools. We want to convince our employees that systematic, bite-sized learning is more effective. Using the 70/20/10 model, we demonstrate how important it is to experiment with newly gained knowledge and supplement it with hands-on experience.. Dorota Weyna Chief Specialist for employee development DRIVE TO DEVELOPMENT The goal of the programme is to increase the engagement of the Direct Engagement Department employees, support their development and, most importantly, promote outstanding attitudes. Our aim is to praise exceptional behaviours towards co-workers and clients. As part of the programme, we grant awards in the team category and in five individual categories (client’s friend, helping hand, simplifier, digital master, team leader) 151 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Incentive system 401-2 404-2 We motivate employees, regardless of their employment type, both under our remuneration policy and by way of non-salary benefits, e.g. by providing them with professional development opportunities. The incentive system plays a key role in acquiring and retaining competent employees, which allows us to build a competitive advantage.  We support the development of our  We have a comprehensive approach to employees. the remuneration policy.

We offer employees fair terms and conditions of employment, in every aspect. We offer employees of individual Group subsidiaries a very similar range of benefits, e.g. we cofinance private healthcare and the MultiSport card. 152 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Diversity We believe that diversity of employees – in terms of age, knowledge, education, interests etc. – constitutes our company’s additional asset. The basic elements of the diversity policy have been incorporated in our HR policy for many years. Moreover, elements of the diversity policy are present in various other regulations, procedures and processes. mBank treats people equally regardless of their sex, age, material status, family background, physical abilities, nationality, country of origin, sexual orientation, and political and religious beliefs. We take into account all factors which can give rise to direct or indirect discrimination. We offer a workplace that helps the staff make use of and develop their unique features and skills, e.g. through participation in training activities and clubs that bring together people with similar interests. Diversity management contributes to the creation of an organisational culture based on tolerance, where everyone is offered career development opportunities. We strive to ensure equal participation of both sexes in external and internal recruitment and when planning succession in key positions. We observe the equal treatment principle when hiring new employees. Our recruitment process involves a selection method that ensures objective assessment of candidates’ skills. Each employee of the bank can be promoted to a managerial position if they have a relevant professional track record. Evaluation of job positions is based on objective criteria, which prevents discrimination. We apply the Policy for the Assessment of Qualifications (Suitability) of Members of the Supervisory Body, Management Body and Key Function Holders at mBank S.A. (Suitability Policy) with respect to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Suitability Policy lays down criteria for appointing persons having appropriate knowledge, skills, experience, qualifications and reputation to key positions. The policy includes a separate chapter dedicated to the diversity policy. mBank takes into account diversity when selecting Members of the Management Board and proposing candidates for Members of the Supervisory Board: With respect to the Management Board  When deciding on the composition of the Management Board, the Supervisory Board makes every effort to ensure its diversity, especially in terms of age, education, professional experience and participation of women. With respect to the Supervisory Board  The age structure of the Supervisory Board should be diverse. Moreover, we aim at ensuring that its members have diverse educational background and professional experience. We also want to ensure appropriate participation of women. At the end of 2019, there were two women among ten Supervisory Board Members. 153 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Supervisory Board of mBank 31 Dec 2016 31 Dec 2017 31 Dec 2018 31 Dec 2019 number % number of % number of % number of % of members members members members Woman 2 17% 2 17% 2 17% 2 20% Men 10 83% 10 83% 10 83% 8 80% Total 12 100% 12 100% 12 100% 10 100% There is one woman among seven Management Board Members.

It is recommended that at all times, at least one woman should sit on the Management Board. mBank’s managers graduated from different fields of study in Poland and abroad, including economics, technology, IT, law, philology. The management consists of people with diverse experience in Polish, European and American financial and non-financial institutions. The managers are aware of how important diversity is to the workplace and are trained in how to identify differences and make the most of them. The Success Insights method is used to identify employees’ abilities and skills. The method helps to identify personality traits that can be used at work. In January 2018 we signed the Diversity Charter, an international initiative for social cohesion and equality launched in Poland by the Responsible Business Forum. As signatories of the Charter, we have undertaken to support diversity and counteract workplace discrimination. MBANK IS A WOMAN “mBank Is a Woman” is a series of seminars launched in 2008, addressed to women being owners of enterprises and managers. Each seminar consists of a professional part hosted by mBank’s experts and representatives of leading companies, a lifestyle part and a meeting with a successful woman (so far the seminars’ special guests were, among others, dr Irena Eris, Teresa Rosati, Jolanta Kwaśniewska, Beata Tyszkiewicz, Katarzyna Grochola, Krystyna Janda, Beata Pawlikowska, Urszula Dudziak, Maria Czubaszek, Ewa Kasprzyk). The topics of the meetings and the choice of special guests are determined by the participants. The programme often includes panels on work-life 154 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 balance. The project is aimed at inspiring, educating and supporting woman entrepreneurs. It also helps mBank deepen its relationships with clients. In 2019, four events took place in Bielsko-Biała, Olsztyn, Szczecin and Wrocław as part of the series, gathering approximately 320 women. Counteracting workplace harassment We make every effort to create a workplace free from harassment and other forms of violence, both on the part of managers and other employees. mBank’s Anti-Harassment Policy emphasises the following issues:  We do not accept workplace harassment or any other forms of violence.  Our employees are obliged to refrain from any actions and behaviours that fit the definition of workplace harassment or bear the hallmarks of other forms of violence.  Any person who creates situations that encourage workplace harassment or engages in it violates the basic employee duties. In such a situation mBank as the employer may impose sanctions which are stipulated in the labour law or in mBank’s internal work rules. The policy describes criteria of workplace harassment and the complaint process (anonymous, if preferred) for employees who believe to have fallen victim to workplace harassment. The complaints are analysed by the Anti-Harassment Committee. It is composed of directors of the following departments or persons designated by them: Employee and Organisation Culture Development, Compliance Department, Legal Department, Communication and Marketing Strategy Department, and the Chief Ethics Officer of mBank. Persons whose legal or actual relationship with the employee making a complaint could affect the objectivity and impartiality of the Committee are excluded from its work. If an employee does not feel up to reporting workplace harassment formally and under their own name, they can use mSygnał. In 2019, the Committee received and handled five reports (including one report filed at the end of December 2018). One case of workplace harassment was confirmed and relevant steps were taken in this regard. In 2018-2019 we trained a total of 280 managers in counteracting workplace harassment (100 managers were trained in 2019 alone). In 2020 we plan to launch e-learning training for all employees and workshops for the remaining managers. Ergonomics and security at the workplace At mBank, occupational health and safety management starts with a proper assessment of occupational risk. It is performed by occupational health and safety specialists in consultation with the bank’s employees. Every year, we analyse work accidents and update the risk analysis. 155 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Occupational health and safety 403-2 We cannot allow our employees to be exposed to any health and safety hazards, which is why we implemented a comprehensive occupational health and safety management system covering the entire mBank Group. It is based on general provisions (Labour Code and regulations) and functions on the basis of the following rules:  Involvement of the management and all the employees in shaping and implementing the occupational health and safety policy.  Planning activities aimed at implementing the adopted occupational health and safety policy. Meetings of the Occupational Health and Safety Committee take place once a quarter.  Creating conditions for implementing action plans: ensuring the budget for specific goals, identification of hazards and occupational risk assessment.  Monitoring the implementation of plans and system operation and applying corrective and preventive measures, including: monitoring the occupational health and safety conditions and analysing reasons for accidents at work.  Optimising the occupational health and safety management system through periodical reviews and checks of the company’s branches by an occupational health and safety specialist.  Induction and periodical training in occupational health and safety, during which employees are informed about the possibility of refraining from work if their health or life is threatened. On our intranet we added a tab dedicated to occupational health and safety. It contains contact data of specialists to whom we can report accidents or potential accidents. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY AUDITS We conduct an annual audit of our branches in terms of occupational health and safety. We inspect them with regards to safety and office work ergonomics, we check buildings, rooms, workstations and machines. Based on the acquired knowledge, we eliminate the identified hazards, deficiencies and irregularities in individual buildings. In 2019 we audited ca. 200 branches. 156 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Remuneration principles The remuneration principles are set forth in the Remuneration Policy of mBank S.A. The Policy was introduced, among others, in order to build high commitment of employees by providing them with a remuneration package that is adequate to the market and the input of work, retain top employees in the organisation and attract talented people through the internship and apprenticeship programmes. The Policy also stipulates the principles guaranteeing the protection of rights and interests of bank clients and preventing conflicts of interest. The Management Board is responsible for the development, implementation and observance of the Policy. The Supervisory Board approves the document, consulting it with the Remuneration Committee, if in doubt. Employees holding managerial positions are also obliged to follow the Remuneration Policy for Employees Having a Material Impact on the Risk Profile of mBank S.A. In addition to the Remuneration Policy, mBank applies the Remuneration Rules of mBank S.A. and the Rules for Awarding Bonuses to mBank S.A. Employees. 405-2 Ratio of basic salary of women to men (mBank) 2019 2018 senior management 77% 86% middle management 82% 82% other employees 75% 74% Ratio of remuneration of women 2019 2018 to men (mBank) senior management 74% 86% middle management 79% 78% other employees 74% 72% The presented structure of earnings is affected mainly by the fact that more women hold operational positions, while most managers are men. Initiatives taken at the bank aim at reducing the gender pay gap and promoting women. The solutions introduced should eliminate, in the long term, the gap between average remuneration of women and men. Over the last years we have observed a significant increase in the number of women in managerial positions. The gender gap has been reduced also in terms of senior management. 157 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Supporting society Solutions for persons with disabilities At mBank each client with a disability can count on customer service providing for their special needs. Each year we launch new initiatives to improve access of persons with disabilities to financial services. In 2019 we implemented the following initiatives for the benefit of persons with disabilities:  We introduced the possibility of ordering documents in forms accessible to persons with special needs, in line with the amended Banking Law Act.  We cooperated with the Integration Foundation (Fundacja Integracja). Sixty mBank employees took part in workshops organised by the Foundation to share the knowledge gained with their co-workers.  Clients who consented to the processing of data concerning their disability are automatically redirected by the call centre to a qualified consultant. Clients with hearing disabilities are offered the option of video calls in the Polish Sign Language.  Clients can give their consent for the processing of data concerning their disability when contacting the call centre and, in special cases, when using our chat or video chat.  We continued our co-operation with the Polish Association of the Deaf, which provides sign language interpreting for clients and consultants at branches and via video chat. We also have solutions for deaf clients who do not know the Polish Sign Language. Once such clients consent to processing data concerning their disability, they may file their instructions via chat.  We supported partially and fully deaf youth from Special Education Centre No. 1 in Łódź. 158 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank Foundation mBank Foundation implements programmes supporting mathematics education. The “m jak matematyka” (“M for maths”) strategy sets the foundation’s goals until 2020 and addresses the ever growing gap in science education. PLN 3 million Spent on supporting mathematics education in Poland (the cost of performing the foundation’s statutory tasks) In 2019, we pursued our mission, among others, through:  subsidising development projects in the area of mathematics education, such as the “mPotęga” (“mPower”) grant programme, the competition for the best maths thesis called “Krok w przyszłość” (“Step towards the Future”) and the “Mistrzowie matematyki” (“Masters of Mathematics”) scholarships;  competition for secondary schools called “Wielcy polscy matematycy znani i nieznani” (“Great Polish mathematicians: know and unknown”) organised to mark the Year of Mathematics;  book entitled “Child’s Play Maths”;  partnering with and financially supporting external initiatives promoting maths education: “Matematyka się liczy”(“Mathematics Counts”) and “Festiwal Matematyki” (“Festival of Mathematics”), organised together with the “Gazeta Wyborcza” We strongly believe that mathematics provides the foundation for logical thinking and is vital to understanding the world around us. Mastering it helps us take informed financial decisions or follow the academic path in scientific subjects, and thus contributes to economic growth and professional success. “mPower” grant programme, the sixth edition “mPower” is a grant programme aimed at popularising mathematics among young people by showing them that mathematics is very useful in everyday life. We also want to encourage teachers, parents and maths enthusiasts to break the routine and go off the beaten track. In 2019, 111 projects from all around Poland received grants for creative maths education. In total, mFoundation earmarked almost PLN 665,000 for the grants. Since the launch of the programme in 2014, over 1 million Polish students have taken advantage of the grant-funded projects. Most grants are awarded to schools in small 159 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 towns located across the country. This way, we contribute to creating equal opportunities for schoolchildren from small towns. For more information on the programme go to mPower website. Competition marking the Jubilee Year of Mathematics The Polish Senate designated 2019 as the Year of Mathematics to mark the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Polish Mathematical Society. To celebrate the jubilee, mFoundation announced a competition entitled “Known and unknown: great Polish mathematicians”. Its goal was to popularise the achievements of Polish scientists among teenagers. The competition encouraged secondary school students to cooperate with maths and history teachers. The task was to prepare a work, in any technique, about the life and scientific accomplishments of mathematicians from Poland’s five largest scientific centres. The participants could draw inspiration from articles published in “Gazeta Wyborcza” daily and “Ale Historia!” weekly. 146 entries were sumitted in the competition, out of which the jury selected 18. Their authors received grants ranging from PLN 3,000 to PLN 6,000. 9th Klementyna Hoffmanowa High School in Warsaw won the Grand Prix and PLN 10,000. For more information on the competition go to programmes website. “CHILD’S PLAY MATHS” – MFOUNDATION’S NEW BOOK The book is dedicated to parents of children aged 0-6. It is neither a guide nor a methodological textbook. Rather, it is a collection of inspiring games that parents can play with their children to familiarise them with maths from an early age. The activities are divided by age groups and adjusted to subsequent child development stages. The book premiered at the 6th Mathematics Festival in November 2019. The participants had a chance to obtain a book (we handed out a total of 500 copies) and talk to the authors. In Q1 2020, we made the book available in 312 mBank retail banking branches and mKiosks. Those interested in the book could order it with delivery to a selected mBank branch. 160 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Let’s play with WOŚP! In 2019 mBank again provided its banking services to the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity (WOŚP). We serviced the 27th Grand Finale of WOŚP, which took place on January 13, 2019, as well as financial operations the foundation made throughout the year. During the 27th Grand Finale of WOŚP mBank was responsible for:  organising cash transportation from  equipping WOŚP collection centres 1,700 locations across Poland, as well with coin counters, as counting and depositing cash in  establishing an mBank outlet in the the Foundation’s bank account, main collection centre nearby the  delivering 700 terminals to WOŚP Palace of Culture and Science in volunteers and mBank branches, Warsaw, and training over forty and accepting and calculating persons servicing the outlet. donations made via terminals Over 1000 mBank employees from various areas were involved in the above initiatives. Apart from servicing WOŚP, we donated PLN 3.7 million to the foundation: PLN 2 million as part of the campaign “100 tys. zł za 100 wpłat” (“PLN 100,000 for 100 donations”) and PLN 1.7 million from the auction of over 40 works of art from mBank’s collection. Every day starting from 25 December 2018 until the 27th Grand Finale of WOŚP, mBank donated additional PLN 100,000 for every 100 donations made daily by our clients. Since mBank clients willingly participated in the campaign, we donated PLN 2 million in total. During the 27th Grand Finale of WOŚP, the first auction of works of art for the benefit of WOŚP took place in DESA Unicum auction house. We donated over forty works of art from our collection built over many years. The entire amount from the auction (PLN 1.7 million) was donated to the purchase of state-of-the-art medical 161 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 equipment for specialist pediatric hospitals. On a day-to-day basis, we provide our services to the foundation. Thanks to individually negotiated terms and conditions, the foundation can use the collected funds with maximum effectiveness. POL’AND’ROCK FESTIVAL In 2019 mBank again acted as a strategic partner for the Pol’and’Rock music festival (formerly known as Woodstock Festival Poland), organised in Kostrzyn nad Odrą by WOŚP as a way of saying thank you to all volunteers and benefactors of the charitable drive. An important element of the festival is the Academy of Finest of Arts, which fell under the patronage of mBank. mBank employees helped in its organisation as Peace Patrol volunteers. The Academy is a place of meetings, discussions, workshops, educational and social activity inspired and organised by several dozen NGOs. We also prepared a surprise for the festival goers: special bank accounts for new clients with a PLN 140 bonus for being an active account holder, and 10,000 debit cards featuring the festival’s logo designed by Jurek Owsiak. The card was available to both existing and new clients. 162 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Governance (G) Corporate governance Application of corporate governance principles The general corporate governance principles applicable at mBank, i.e. regulations and procedures determining the guidelines regarding the bank’s authorities’ actions, in particular towards stakeholders, arise from statutory regulations, in particular from the Code of Commercial Companies and Partnerships and the Banking Law Act, the provisions regulating the operation of the capital market and the rules laid down in the following documents: “Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016”, “Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions” issued by the Polish Financial Supervision Authority on July 22, 2014 and the “Code of Banking Ethics” issued by the Polish Bank Association. In 2019, we applied the corporate governance principles contained in the “Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016”, issued by the Warsaw Stock Exchange by way of Resolution No. 26/1413/2015 of the Supervisory Board of Giełda Papierów Wartościowych w Warszawie S.A. (the Warsaw Stock Exchange) dated October 13, 2015. The text of the “Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016” is available on the website of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, in the section dedicated to the corporate governance of listed companies. The “Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions” are available on the website of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority. 163 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016 From among the detailed principles of the Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016 , we do not apply principle no. VI.Z.2., which reads as follows: To tie the remuneration of members of the management board and key managers to the company's long-term business and financial goals, the period between the allocation of options or other instruments linked to the company's shares under the incentive scheme and their exercisability should be no less than two years . The principles for granting variable components of remuneration at mBank are compliant with the Regulation of the Minister of Development and Finance of March 6, 2017, on the Risk Management System, the Internal Control System, the Remuneration Policy as well as the Detailed Method for Banks' Internal Capital Assessment (Journal of Laws of 2017, item 637) and EBA's Guidelines on sound remuneration policies (EBA/GL/2015/22) of June 27, 2016, which do not provide for the premise indicated in item VI.Z.2 of the Best Practice. Moreover, from among all recommendations specified in the Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016 , we do not apply the following recommendations:  items 2 and 3 of recommendation IV.R.2, which refer to conducting a General Meeting with the use of means of electronic communication. Item 2 concerns ensuring twoway communication in real time during the General Meeting allowing shareholders to speak from a different location. Item 3 is related to exercising the voting right in person or by proxy during the General Meeting. For many years, we have broadcast General Meetings in real time, however, without the possibility to engage in two-way online communication by allowing shareholders to speak during the General Meeting from a different location. The Bank's By-laws and the Standing Rules of the General Meeting do not provide for the possibility to actively participate in General Meetings with the use of means of electronic communication. Moreover, in the opinion of the Management Board of mBank, the organisation of General Meetings with the use of means of electronic communication involves additional legal, organisational and technical risks.  recommendation VI.R.3. concerning the remuneration committee. The recommendation stipulates, among others, that it is required that at least the majority of the committee members be independent. At mBank, the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board as at the end of 2019 was composed of three members, including one independent member. Two members do not meet the criterion of independence. Despite changes in the composition of the Remuneration Committee, independent members did not represent a majority at any point throughout the year. 164 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions The “Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions” cover relations with shareholders and clients, issues relating to the organisational structure, rules for ensuring an effective and efficient internal control system, as well as the risks of business activities. We have adopted the “Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions”, excluding the principles listed in Article 8 (4) and in Article 16 (1). The principle in Article 8 (4), which reads as follows: “A supervised institution, when justified by the number of shareholders, should strive for facilitating the participation of all shareholders in the meeting of the General Meeting of the supervised institution, among others, through ensuring the possibility of electronic active participation in the meetings of the General Meeting”, is similar to recommendation IV.R.2 of the “Best Practice for WSE Listed Companies 2016”. As a large part of our shareholders are represented at General Meetings, with a view to mitigating the risk inherent in active participation in General Meetings with the use of means of electronic communication, we have decided that departure from the rule defined in Article 8 (4) is justified. Likewise, we do not apply the rule defined in Article 16 (1), which reads as follows: “It is proper that meetings of a management body shall be held in Polish. In case of need, necessary assistance of an interpreter should be ensured.” The departure derives from the fact that all Members of the Management Board speak fluent English. Communication without an interpreter is more effective as discussions and decisions can be made without the participation of a third party (interpreter). In some circumstances, the participation of an interpreter could make discussions at Management Board meetings more difficult or prolonged due to the complex nature of issues under discussion as well as the specialised language. Furthermore, given that Management Board meetings review information that constitutes the company’s secret, it is legitimate to limit to the bare minimum the participation of non-members of the Management Board in its meetings. At the same time, most of the Management Board Members speak Polish, which means that the bank can be represented whenever participation of Management Board Members is required including communication in Polish without an interpreter. Minutes of Management Board meetings, as well as resolutions of mBank’s Management Board, are prepared in two language versions, ensuring compliance with the provisions of Article 16 (2) of the “Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions”. The stand of shareholders as regards the “Principles of Corporate Governance for Supervised Institutions” was presented in resolution no. 31 of the 28th Annual General Meeting of mBank S.A. of March 30, 2015. In the above resolution, the shareholders undertook:  to participate in the performance of the statutory objectives of mBank, ensuring security of its operations and with its interest in mind;  not to violate the powers of other statutory bodies of mBank; 165 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  to immediately solve any potential conflicts between shareholders to prevent infringing the interest of mBank and its clients;  not to make decisions resulting in transferring assets from mBank to other entities, and in acquisition or alienation of or in conclusion of other transactions leading to mBank disposing of its assets under conditions other than market conditions or posing a threat to the security or interest of mBank; the individual rights will be granted to the given shareholder or shareholders when justified on the grounds of achieving significant objectives of mBank and not causing hindrance to proper functioning of the bodies of mBank or discrimination against other shareholders and reflected in the By-Laws of mBank;  to provide, if needed, additional capital or grant financial support to the bank to the extent to which it is possible and compliant with authorisations, whereas it will only take place after the analysis of the entirety of reasons which led to such a necessity; the shareholders will take into consideration the possibility of providing support from the point of view of their financial situation, provisions of law and supervisory regulations the shareholders are bound to respect and considering the best interest of mBank and its clients;  to make decisions with regard to dividend payment, depending on the need for maintaining an appropriate level of equity and on the achievement of strategic objectives of mBank and to take into consideration general and individual recommendations issued by the supervisory authorities; and  to implement the recommendations of the PFSA regarding the election of Members of the Supervisory Board of the bank. Code of Banking Ethics Apart from the corporate governance principles, we have for many years complied with the best banking industry practices, developed by the Polish Bank Association (ZBP). The currently applicable version of the “Code of Banking Ethics” was approved at the 25th General Meeting of the Polish Bank Association held on April 18, 2013. The “Code of Banking Ethics” is a set of principles referring to banks, their employees and persons acting as intermediaries in banking activities. The “Code of Banking Ethics” includes two parts: the “Code of Best Banking Practice” and the “Code of Employee Ethics”. The “Code of Banking Ethics” is available on the website of the Polish Bank Association. Model of values and behaviours of mBank employees and the rules on conduct towards business partners Our employees apply the Code of Conduct, which establishes the standards applicable in interactions between the bank’s employees and the bank’s business partners. This is meant to contribute to mutual trust. The guidelines related to behaviour include, among others, being guided by mBank’s values, creating a sustainable corporate culture, corporate social responsibility, pursuing a responsible credit policy, treating relationships with clients in a responsible way, honesty in business relationships, applying established 166 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 standards in relationships with clients and in internal relationships, avoiding conflicts of interest, responsible use of social media and simplifying communication. It is also worth mentioning that we have defined behaviours which are most important from the perspective of the organisation and which facilitate achieving individual and team results and contribute to customer satisfaction. mBank’s model of values and behaviours, which sets mBank’s work standard, is based on the following organisational values: “client-centricity”, “looking ahead”, “simplifying”. Information policy We pursue a transparent, open, and reliable information policy, which builds mutual trust and loyalty of investors. When implementing the information policy, we comply with requirements arising from information confidentiality and security laws, which we must abide by as a public company and a supervised institution. Our high ratings and awards for widely understood corporate governance and investor relations bespeak transparency and effectiveness of our information policy. In May 2019, we again won a distinction of the Institute of Accountancy and Taxes and Gazeta Giełdy Parkiet daily in the category “Transparent WIG20 Company of the Year.” In June 2019, we won the Złota Strona Emitenta (Issuer’s Golden Website) contest organised by the Polish Association of Listed Companies in the category “Leader of Online Communication” for large companies (listed companies included in WIG20 and mWIG40). The main means we apply in our information policy with regard to investor relations include:  current and periodic reports;  meetings, teleand video-conferences of representatives of the Management Board and the Analysis and Investor Relations Department with investors and analysts, both in Poland and abroad;  quarterly presentations of financial results for investors and analysts provided directly and through interactive webcasts and teleconferences;  an ongoing contact by phone or e-mail with analysts and investors, including sending Newsletters on a monthly basis and, if necessary, other informational materials;  participation of our representatives in domestic and foreign investor conferences and road-shows in selected European countries and in the United States of America;  the company’s website with a comprehensive investor relations section where we published information on, among others, our shareholders, the composition of the Management Board and Supervisory Board, General Meetings (including video recordings of General Meetings), ratings, the Euro Medium Term Note Programme, price of mBank’s shares on the WSE, analysts’ recommendations, the consensus on mBank Group’s expected performance and the target share price. On our website, there are annual, periodical and current reports and presentations, including presentations of the results of the Group for equity analysts and investors as well as presentations for investors interested in the bank’s debt securities, online versions of 167 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 integrated annual reports enabling interactive access to the audited financial data, and an Investor’s Calendar. Open communication with shareholders during the General Meetings manifests itself, among others, in the following aspects:  providing stakeholders with answers and explanations by the members of the bank’s governing bodies;  broadcasting the General Meeting online;  participation of media representatives in the General Meeting. Internal control and risk management systems with regard to the process of preparing financial statements of mBank mBank is equipped with an internal control system which supports bank management by ensuring efficiency and effectiveness of the bank's operations, reliability of financial reporting, compliance with risk management rules of the bank, as well as compliance of the bank’s operation with the law, internal regulations and market standards. The internal control system encompasses the following:  control function whose task is to ensure observance of control mechanisms concerning in particular risk management at the bank and which covers positions, groups of people and organisational units responsible for performance of tasks assigned to the function;  compliance unit (Compliance Department), whose task is to identify, asses, control and monitor the risk of non-compliance of the bank’s activities with the law, internal regulations and market standards and report in this respect;  independent internal audit unit (Internal Audit Department), whose task is to examine and assess, impartially and objectively, the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management system and the internal control system, excluding the internal audit unit. The control function is a part of the internal control system comprised of all control mechanisms in processes running in the bank, independent monitoring of the application of such control mechanisms and reporting on the issue. The control function is based on the following principles:  guaranteeing access to important, real, up-to-date and complete information by decision makers;  organising and maintaining adequate IT systems that ensure proper storage and processing of data, facilitate the evaluation and monitoring of different risk categories and generation of information useful in decision-making process;  determining the information circulation rules in order to ensure that relevant information is submitted to competent persons. 168 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The process of preparing financial data for reporting is automated and based on the accounting data of the bank. Preparation of data in source systems is subject to formalised operational and acceptance procedures. Creating a collection of accounting balances on the basis of the system of general ledgers of the bank takes place within a process covering respective internal mechanisms and controls. The mechanisms consist, among others, in verification and reconciliation of reporting data with books of accounts, sub-ledger accounts, and other documents on the basis of which financial statements are drawn up, as well as with the applicable legal provisions pertaining to accounting principles and the preparation of financial statements. Manual adjustments are subject to special controls. We continuously monitor changes in the law and external regulations related to the preparation of financial statements, update internal regulations on an ongoing basis and adjust our IT systems where necessary. We have implemented mechanisms which effectively ensure the security of IT systems in the process of monitoring the operational risk which occurs in the preparation of financial statements in the bank. We have in place a business continuity plan which covers also the IT systems used in the process of preparing financial statements. Financial statements of mBank and the Group are prepared by the Financial Reporting Department. We draw up consolidated financial statements based on data submitted by Group subsidiaries. The Financial Reporting Department monitors the reporting packages prepared by the subsidiaries in terms of their correctness, completeness and coherence of data. The Accounting Department controls the coherence and completeness of the bank’s books of accounts and manages the model chart of accounts. Both Departments report to the Vice-President of the Management Board, Chief Financial Officer. Financial statements are submitted to the Management Board of mBank for verification. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board receives quarterly financial statements before they are published. After consultations with the bank’s external auditor and the Members of the Management Board of the bank, the Audit Committee recommends whether the Supervisory Board should approve or reject annual financial statements. The annual and semi-annual financial statements of mBank are respectively subject to an independent audit or review by a statutory auditor. The selection of the statutory auditor of the bank requires a resolution of the General Meeting. The Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board issues an opinion on the selection of the statutory auditor. In the subsidiaries, supervisory boards decide on the selection of the statutory auditor. The procedures of co-operation of mBank and the external auditor ensure that all the important issues related to the recognition of economic events in the books and financial statements are being consulted on an on-going basis. The aspiration to ensure the highest standards of financial statements is reflected in the high quality of reporting. In “The Best Annual Report 2018” contest organised by the Institute of Accountancy and Taxes (IRiP), the results of which were announced in October 2019, we won the title “The Best of the Best” for the best annual report in the 169 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 category of financial institutions for the seventh time in a row.

The “Remuneration Policy for Employees Having a Material Impact on the Risk Profile of mBank S.A.” (“Risk Takers Remuneration Policy”) adopted in 2018 specifies remuneration rules for persons identified as employees having a material impact on the risk profile of the Bank („Risk Takers”) by determining fixed and variable remuneration components. Total remuneration of the Members of the Management Board includes a fixed and a variable part. For the Members of the Management Board the relation between variable remuneration and fixed remuneration should not exceed 100% of the annual basic remuneration, with the proviso that variable remuneration exceeding 100% (not more than 200%) of the annual basic remuneration is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of the Bank. The basic remuneration of the Members of the Management Board is determined by the Supervisory Board taking into account the following information:  the resolution of the Management Board on the division of powers between the Members of the Management Board of the bank (with a particular focus on changes in powers),  long-term results achieved as at the assessment date,  available internal market data (e.g. internal comparison of mBank Group), 183 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  available external market data (e.g. information on remuneration of management board members of other WSE-listed companies, additional market benchmarks). A detailed description of the rules of the incentive programmes for the Management Board based on shares is presented in Note 41 of mBank S.A. Group IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements 2019. On April 12, 2018, the resolution regarding the implementation of the incentive programme and determination of the rules for conducting it, and the resolution regarding the issue of subscription warrants, conditional share capital increase with divestment of the existing shareholders’ pre-emptive right to subscription warrants and shares and amendments to the Company’s bylaws and on applying for the admission of shares to trading on the regulated market and share dematerialisation were adopted at the 31st Annual General Meeting of mBank. The new Incentive Programme replaced two other programmes: the employee programme dated October 27, 2008 and the incentive programme of mBank dated March 14, 2008 for Members of the Management Board. In line with the Incentive Programme dated April 12, 2018, the bank will issue no more than 934,000 ordinary bearer shares with a face value of PLN 4.00 each. In order to grant the rights, the bank will issue 934,000 registered subscription warrants. The Incentive Programme will be implemented until December 31, 2028 or until all shares are taken up, if it happens before that date. The existing programmes are being gradually terminated. No new shares are granted under the 2008 programmes, and the bank only meets its obligations arising from deferred tranches under these programmes. Warrants are offered to the group of Risk Takers, composed of Members of the Management Board of mBank and mBank Group’s subsidiaries and selected employees of mBank. The bonus of a Management Board Member is paid in the following way:  40% of the bonus in the calendar year in which the bonus amount is determined (non-deferred part);  60% of the bonus in equal tranches in the five subsequent calendar years following the calendar year in which the bonus amount is determined (deferred part). The non-deferred part: 50% is paid in cash in the month following the month of the Annual General Meeting; the other 50% is paid in the form of subscription warrants issued not earlier than twelve months from the date of the AGM. The value of one subscription warrant will equal the Average Market Price minus PLN 4.00. The deferred part is paid in five equal tranches in the five subsequent calendar years: 50% of each tranche is paid in cash in the month following the month of the AGM of mBank which approved the consolidated financial statements of mBank Group for the previous calendar year, but not later than by 31 July of the year in which the AGM of the bank was held; 50% is granted in the form of subscription warrants issued not earlier than after the 184 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 lapse of 12 months from the AGM which approved the consolidated financial statements of mBank Group for the previous calendar year. The value of one subscription warrant equals the average market price minus PLN 4.00. The bonus amount granted to a Risk Taker for a given calendar year is calculated individually for this Risk Taker and depends on the amount of the bonus pool. Bonuses are calculated on the basis of economic profit. The remuneration of the Members of the Management Board in 2018-2019 is presented in the following tables.

Group to the Supervisory Board. The statutory auditor is elected by the AGM based on a recommendation submitted by the Supervisory Board. The recommendation is prepared in accordance with an election procedure which takes into account the applicable laws. The procedure for selecting an audit firm to audit mBank's financial statements approved by the Audit Committee in 2018 meets the requirements of Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of financial statements of public-interest entities. The policy for selecting an audit firm in mBank S.A. approved by the Audit Committee meets the requirements of the Act of May 11, 2017 on Statutory Auditors, Audit Firms and Public Oversight and Regulation No. 537/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 (Regulation No. 537/2014). The policy incorporates the principle regarding the rotation of statutory auditors. The duration of total uninterrupted statutory audit engagements referred to in Article 17 (1) paragraph 2 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 carried out by the same audit firm or an audit firm related to this audit firm, or any member of the network operating within the European Union to which these audit firms belong, must not exceed five years. The key statutory auditor may carry out a statutory audit again in the bank after at least three years of the completion of the last statutory audit. In the case of a statutory audit, the first agreement on statutory audit is concluded with an audit firm for the period not shorter than two years with an option to extend it for another two-year period. The policy on the performance of permitted non-audit services in mBank S.A. by the audit firm carrying out the audit, by entities related to the audit firm and by a member of an audit firm network approved by the Audit Committee meets the requirements of the Act on Statutory Auditors, Audit Firms and Public Oversight and Regulation No. 537/2014. Pursuant to the policy on the performance of permitted non-audit services in mBank S.A. by the audit firm carrying out the audit, by entities related to the audit firm and by a member of an audit firm network, a statutory auditor or an audit firm carrying out the statutory audit, or any member of the network to which the statutory auditor or the audit firm belongs, do not directly or indirectly provide to the audited entity, to its parent undertaking or to its controlled undertakings within the Union:  any prohibited non-audit services in the period between the beginning of the period audited and the issuing of the audit report;  any services that consist in designing and implementing internal control or risk management procedures related to the preparation and/or control of financial information or designing and implementing financial information technology systems. Under Article 136 of the Act on Statutory Auditors, prohibited services do not include the following: 197 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 1. services that consist in: a. conducting due diligence procedures with regard to economic and financial condition, b. issuing comfort letters in connection with prospectuses issued by the audited entity, in accordance with the national standard of related services and by means of agreed procedures, 2. assurance services with regard to pro forma financial information, forecasts of results or estimated results, published in the prospectus issued by the audited entity, 3. examination of historical financial information of the prospectus, 4. verification of consolidation packages, 5. confirmation of fulfilment of conditions of the concluded loan contracts on the basis of analysis of financial information coming from financial statements audited by a given audit firm, 6. assurance services in reporting concerning corporate governance, risk management and corporate social responsibility, 7. services consisting in the assessment of compliance of information revealed by financial institutions and investment companies with the requirements for disclosing information concerning capital adequacy and variable remuneration components, 8. certification concerning financial statements or other financial information for supervision bodies, the supervisory board or another supervisory authority of the company, or owners, exceeding the scope of the statutory audit, to help these authorities to perform their statutory duties. Provision of the said services is possible only in the scope not related to the tax policy of the bank, after the Audit Committee evaluates hazards and safeguards for the independence. The audit firm auditing the financial statements of mBank and mBank Group provided the permitted non-audit services to mBank. Therefore, the Audit Committee each time assessed the independence of the audit firm and granted its consent to the provision of the services. The Audit Committee held 4 meetings in 2019. Risk Committee The Risk Committee has, among others, the following tasks: exercising permanent supervision over credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk and non-financial risks, including operational risk.

The risk management process is conducted at all levels of the organisational structure, starting at the levels of the Supervisory Board (including Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board) and the bank’s Management Board, through specialised committees and units responsible for risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reduction, down to each business unit. Risk management roles and responsibilities in mBank Group are organised around the three lines of defence scheme:  The first line of defence is Business (business lines), whose task is to take risk and capital aspects into consideration when making all business decisions, within the risk appetite set for the Group;  The second line of defence, mainly the risk management area, Security and Compliance function, is responsible for determining framework and guidelines concerning managing individual risks, supporting Business in their implementation as well as supervising the control functions and risk exposure. The second line of defence acts independently of the Business;  The third line of defence is Internal Audit, which independently assesses risk management activities performed by the first and the second line of defence. In the communication between organisational units in the risk management area and business lines in mBank as well as between the bank and the Group subsidiaries an important role is played by the Business and Risk Forum of mBank Group which is constituted by the Retail Banking Risk Committee, Corporate and Investment Banking 202 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Risk Committee, and Financial Markets Risk Committee. The main function of these committees is to develop the principles of risk management and risk appetite in a given business line, by making decisions and issuing recommendations concerning in particular: risk policies, risk assessment processes and tools, risk limit system, assessment of the quality and profitability of the portfolio of exposures to clients, approval of introducing new products to the offer. The management function at the strategic level and the function of control of credit, market, liquidity and operational risks and risk of models used to quantify the aforesaid risk types are performed in the risk management area supervised by the Vice-President of the Management Board, Chief Risk Officer. Pillars of risk management Risk management framework in mBank Group rests on three pillars concept:  Customer Focus which means striving to understand and balance specific needs of the risk management area’s various stakeholders (Business, Management Board, Supervisory Board, shareholders, regulatory authorities).  One Risk understood as an integrated approach to risk management and responsibility towards the clients for all types of risk defined in the Risk Catalogue of mBank Group.  Risk vs Rate of Return perspective understood as a support for the business decisionmaking process based on the long-term relationship between risk and the rate of return, avoiding tail risks. VISION OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT AREA Engaged and happy employees manage the risk efficiently, boldly and safely. Mission of the risk management area The Mission of the risk management area is to be actively involved in the initiatives and actions undertaken while realization of the strategy of mBank Group. This support is organized around challenges facing the risk management area:  Employees – I work in a collaborative environment, which develops people who are curious and look for solutions. I acquire new knowledge and skills;  Client – I operate efficiently based on the real needs of different customer groups. I make and verify bold hypotheses;  Strong balance sheet – In partnership dialogue, we shape risk appetite which ensures a balance between the level of capital, liquidity and profitability of the bank. I operate on the basis of friendly processes, consistent data, functional tools, reports, clear regulations. 203 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Main risks of mBank Group’s business The Management Board of mBank takes measures to ensure that the Group manages all material risks arising from the implementation of the adopted strategy of mBank Group, in particular, through approving strategies and processes for managing material risks in the Group. The following risks were recognized as material in the Group’s operations as of December 31, 2019: credit risk, operational risk, market risk, business risk (including strategic risk), liquidity risk, reputation risk, model risk, capital risk (including risk of excessive leverage) and regulatory risk. The following sections present the rules of monitoring credit, market, liquidity and operational risk in mBank Group. The detailed information on managing the abovementioned risks as well as information concerning the management of other risks (business risk, reputational risk, model risk, capital risk and regulatory risk) are presented in Note 3 of the mBank S.A. Group IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements 2019. Credit risk The bank organises credit risk management processes in line with the principles and requirements set out in the resolutions and recommendations of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) (in particular Recommendation S, T and C) and CRR/CRDIV, which address issues related to credit risk management. Tools and measures Credit risk inherent in financing of mBank Group clients is assessed based on shared statistical models developed for the AIRB (Advanced Internal Rating-Based) approach and uniform tools, and is based on common definitions of terms and parameters used in the credit risk management and rating process. The bank ensures their cohesion at the Group level. The Group uses different models for particular client segments. The rules governing clear assignment of clients to a system are defined in the bank and the Group subsidiaries internal regulations. In their credit risk management process, the bank and the Group subsidiaries use the core risk measures defined under the AIRB approach:  PD – Probability of Default (%);  LGD (Loss Given Default) – estimated relative loss in case of default (%);  EAD (Exposure at Default) – estimated exposure at the time of default (amount);  EL – Expected Loss taking into account the probability of default (amount);  and related measures including:  RD (Risk Density) – relative expected loss defined as EL to EAD (%);  LAD (Loss at Default) – estimated loss (amount) in case of default (the product of EAD and LGD). 204 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In the decision-making process, for reporting and communication with business units, PD and EL are expressed in the language of rating classes whose definitions (Masterscale) are uniform across Commerzbank Group. In its credit risk management process, the bank also attaches great importance to the assessment of unexpected loss. For this purpose, the bank uses the RWA (Risk Weighted Assets) measure, which is applied, under the AIRB approach, to calculate regulatory capital required to cover credit risk (unexpected loss). In managing mortgage-secured credit exposures the Group uses the LtV ratio (Loan to Value), i.e. the value of the loan to the market value (or mortgage banking calculated value) of the real estate which secures the loan. Stress testing is an additional tool of credit risk assessment. Stress testing of the regulatory capital and economic capital required to cover credit risk is carried out quarterly. In addition to the tools listed above, which are applied both in the corporate and in the retail credit risk measurement, the Group uses tools specific to these areas. For corporate credit risk the Group defines maximum exposure to a client/group of related clients using the following credit risk mitigating measures:  MBPZO (Maximum Safe Total Exposure), which defines the maximum level of financial debt of an entity from financial institutions calculated under the bank’s methodology, approved by the bank’s competent decision-making body. An alternative measure used by the bank to clients applying for small exposure is Borrowing Capacity (BC);  LG (General Limit), which defines the level of credit risk financial exposure to a client/group of related clients acceptable to the Group, approved by the bank’s competent decision-making body. LG includes a structured limit and products granted outside the structured limit. In order to minimise credit risk, the Group uses a broad range of collateral for credit products, which also enable active management of the capital requirement. In the assessment of the quality of collaterals for risk products, mBank and mLeasing use the MRV ratio (Most Realistic Value) reflecting the pessimistic variant of debt recovery from the collateral through forced sale. The RORAC ratio (Return on Risk Adjusted Capital) is applied in the decision-making process and the assessment of profitability of a client in the CRM system. Retail credit risk measures are constructed to reflect the characteristics of this customer segment and, in the case of portfolio measures, the high granularity of the loan portfolio:  DtI (Debt-to-Income) i.e. monthly credit payments to the net income of a household (used for individual customers); 205 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  DPD (Days-Past-Due) a family of portfolio risk measures based on the number of days past due date (e.g. share of contracts which are from 31 to 90 days past due date in the total portfolio by number or by value);  Vintage ratios, which present the quality of cohorts of loans grouped by disbursement time at a different phase of their lifetime;  COR (Cost of risk) cost of risk for a loan portfolio (segment), i.e. ratio of provisions result and changes in valuation of contracts based on fair value approach to the exposure;  Roll-rates, which measure the migration of contracts between days-past-due brackets (1-30, 31-60, 61-90 DPD, etc.). Strategy Corporate and Investment Banking In accordance with the Corporate Credit Risk Management Strategy in mBank Group, the main goal in this area is defining a safe level of risk appetite in sales of risk-bearing products to the Group clients and use synergies by integrating the offer of the bank and Group subsidiaries. The Strategy is realised by credit risk policies, limits reducing the risk and the principles of risk assessment of business entities applying for financing. The bank manages credit risk both at the single entity level and the consolidated level. The Group actively manages credit risk aiming to optimise profitability taking into account the cost of risk. In its current credit risk management and determination of concentration risk, the bank performs quarterly portfolio analyses using a Steering Matrix which incorporates PD rating and LAD. The bank monitors credit portfolio on a quarterly basis including an analysis of the dynamics of change in size and (sector) segmentation of the credit portfolio, client risk (analysis of PD rating), quality of collateral against credit exposures, the scale of change in EL, Risk Density, and default exposures. The Group strives to avoid concentration in industries and sectors where credit risk is considered excessively high. The bank uses internally defined industry limits for day-today management of the sector concentration risk. In compliance with the Recommendation S of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA), the bank has identified a mortgage-secured credit exposure portfolio in retail and corporate banking and applies the Mortgage-Secured Credit Exposure Risk Management Policy. The bank manages the mortgage-secured credit exposure portfolio risk with a focus on defining an optimised portfolio structure in terms of quality (rating), currencies, country regions, tenors, and types of properties. For international companies, non-banking financial institutions and biggest corporate clients, mBank Group promotes innovative products with low capital consumption, in 206 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 particular products of investment banking, transactional banking and financial markets instruments. mBank offers financing alternative to banking loans by arranging public and private programmes and club deals for bonds issued by clients with a stable financial position. Retail Banking Lending in retail banking is a key segment of the Group’s business model, both in terms of the share in total assets and the contribution to its profits. As credit exposures are highly granular (more than 2.5 million active loans), the retail banking credit risk management process is based on a portfolio approach. This is reflected in the statistical profile of risk rating models including the models which fulfil the regulatory requirements of the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based approach (AIRB). The AIRB parameters (PD, LGD and EL) are used widely in order to estimate credit requirements, to determine acceptance criteria and terms of transactions, and to report risks. Furthermore, the Retail Banking credit risk management has the following characteristics:  high standardisation and automation of the credit process, including decisionmaking, both in acquisition, post-sale services, and debt collection;  little (as compared to Corporate Banking) discretionary competences in the decisionmaking process (e.g. no discretionary adjustment of clients’ ratings);  extensive risk reporting system based on portfolio analysis of credit exposure quality, including vintage analysis and roll-rates analysis. The main point of reference in the retail banking credit risk management process is risk appetite defined in correlation with the strategy of mBank Group. The general principle underlying the lending strategy of the Group in terms of sales of retail loans is to address the offer to clients who have an established relationship with the bank or to address it to new clients for whom the loan is a product initiating a long-term relationship of highly transactional nature. Thereby, the bank continues to focus its non-mortgage loans policies on lending to existing clients with a high creditworthiness while systematically growing the acquisition of external clients. As part of these activities, the bank increasingly participates in financing customers making purchases via Internet. To reduce risks of accepting new clients, the bank develops its credit policy using, among others, credit testing and is actively developing its fraud prevention system. The new acquisition focuses on products which may be financed with issue of mortgage bonds. Those exposures will then be transferred to mBank Hipoteczny in the pooling process to enable the issue of mortgage bonds. The conservative policy of assessing borrowers’ reliability and creditworthiness is applied; taking into account, inter alia, current, historically lowest, levels of interest rates, the Group attaches special attention to the application of long-term estimates of interest rate while assessing creditworthiness. 207 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In order to mitigate the risk associated with a decrease in the value of mortgage collateral in relation to the value of credit exposure, the Group’s credit offer is (and will be) directed mainly to clients who buy standard properties within large urban areas. Quality of mBank Group loan portfolio As of December 31, 2019, the share of impaired exposures in the total (gross) amount of loans and advances granted to clients (NPL) decreased to 4.5% from 4.8% at the end of 2018. The change of the indicator applies mainly to retail banking and is caused by the realization of debt collection processes, as well as the increase of the retail loan portfolio. In accordance with the EBA guidelines on management of non-performing and forborne exposures, which came into force from June 30, 2019, Banks are obliged to monitor and manage the NPL portfolio. Banks should strive to maintain the value of the NPL portfolio below the threshold set by the regulator at 5%. As of December 31, 2019, the NPLREG radio (ratio calculated according to EBA guidelines) was at 4.0%.The difference between NPL and NPLREG ratios results mainly from inclusion of central banks’ receivables. Provisions (defined as credit risk costs for loans and advances to customers, i.e. provisions for loans and advances at amortised cost and fair value change of loans and advances mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss) increased from PLN 3,437.4 million at the end of December 2018 to PLN 3,574.2 million at the end of December 2019. The coverage ratio (with provisions as defined earlier) decreased in the analysed period from 62.5% in December 2018 to 60.7% in December 2019. The change of the ratio is caused by the sale of the loan portfolio highly covered provisions. The manner of identifying evidence of default is based on all available credit data of a given client and encompasses all of the client’s liabilities towards the bank. The table below presents the quality of mBank Group loan portfolio as at the end of December 2019 and as at the end of December 2018.

Market risk In the process of organisation of the market risk management, the bank follows requirements resulting from the law and supervisory recommendations, in particular the PFSA Recommendations (among others A, C, G and I) and the EBA guidelines, concerning market risk management. Tools and measures In its operations, the bank is exposed to market risk, which is defined as a risk resulting from unfavourable change of the current valuation of financial instruments in the bank’s portfolios due to changes of the market risk factors, in particular:  interest rates;  foreign exchange rates;  stock share prices and indices;  implied volatilities of relevant options;  credit spreads (to the extent reflecting market fluctuations of debt instruments prices, reflecting credit spread for corporate bonds, and spread between government yield curve and swap curve for government bonds). 209 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In terms of the banking book, the bank distinguishes the interest rate risk, which defines as the risk of an adverse change in both the current valuation of the banking book position and the net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates. For the purpose of internal management, the bank quantifies exposure to market risk, both for banking and trading book, by measuring:  the Value at Risk (VaR);  expected loss under condition that this loss exceeds Value at Risk (ES – Expected Shortfall);  the Value at Risk in stressed conditions (Stressed VaR);  economic capital to cover market risk;  stress tests scenario values;  portfolio sensitivities to changes of market prices or market parameters (IR BPV – Interest Rate Basis Point Value, CS BPV – Credit Spread Basis Point Value). For the banking book, the bank also uses the following measures (described in more detail in the chapter on interest rate risk):  sensitivity of the economic value of capital (delta EVE);  sensitivity of net interest income (delta NII);  repricing gap. Measurement and analysis of market risk takes place in two perspectives (including and without taking into account the modelling of stable parts of equity capital and current accounts, insensitive to changes in interest rates), which allows controlling the impact on the market risk level of the applied strategy for stabilising the net interest income. Strategy The implementation of market risk management strategy involves managing the bank’s positions in a way enabling to maintain market risk profile within the risk appetite defined by the bank. The market risk profile is derived from the strategic goals of business units, the decisions of dedicated committees and the limits on market risk exposures established at the level of the bank’s organisational units, the mBank Group and the Group entities. The limit system reflects the defined risk appetite in a quantitative manner. The bank is focused on meeting customers’ business needs, while reducing trade in derivatives in terms of currency, currency pairs, nominal values and tenors of transactions, as well as applying the principle of lack of commodity open positions. mBank has limited appetite for currency risk, which is expressed through market risk limits. The bank conducts trading activity on well-known markets using financial instruments the bank has adequate expertise in and that have been approved for trading. 210 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The bank stabilises interest income using long-term fixed-rate assets and derivatives and assuming for equity capital the maximum modelled maturity of 10 years and for current accounts the maximum modelled maturity of 5 years. The management of interest rate risk of the banking book takes into account the economic and accounting perspectives, and the financial instruments used for hedging are adequate to the bank’s expertise and have been approved for trading. The main principle stipulates separation between the market risk monitoring and control functions and the functions related to opening and maintaining open market risk positions. In addition, the bank applies the rule of organisational separation between managing banking book and trading book positions. Market risk measurement The mBank’s positions constitute the main source of market risk for the mBank Group. Value at risk In 2019, the market risk exposure, as measured by the Value at Risk (VaR for a 1-day holding period, at 97.5% confidence level), remained at a moderate level in relation to the established VaR limits. The table below presents VaR and Stressed VaR for the Group’s and mBank’s portfolios (including modelling of equity capital and current accounts): 2019 2018 PLN 000's mBank Group mBank mBank Group mBank 31.12.2019 Mean 31.12.2019 Mean 31.12.2018 Mean 31.12.2018 Mean VaR IR 4,294 3,840 3,778 3,759 3,223 3,439 3,248 3,443 VaR FX 767 957 728 961 317 427 341 421 VaR EQ 0 0 0 0 0 51 0 51 VaR CS 21,908 21,927 20,989 21,241 18,234 13,674 17,839 13,255 VaR 22,494 21,999 21,978 21,344 18,155 13,768 17,776 13,436 Stressed 97,073 108,369 94,229 104,269 106,235 93,723 104,743 90,316 VaR VaR IR – interest rate risk VaR FX FX risk VaR EQ – stock price risk VaR CS – credit spread risk The Value at Risk (VaR) was largely influenced by the portfolios of instruments sensitive to the interest rates and the separate credit spread mainly the portfolios of the Treasury bonds (in the banking and trading books) and positions resulting from interest rate swap transactions. Sensitivities measures 211 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The table presents the values of IR BPV and CS BPV (+1 b.p.) for the Group’s and mBank’s portfolios, broken down into the banking and trading books (including modelling of equity capital and current accounts): IR BPV CS BPV PLN 000's mBank Group mBank mBank Group mBank 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 31.12.2019 31.12.2018 Banking 257 -306 263 -237 -8,302 -8,131 -8,075 -7,957 book Trading 56 33 56 33 -504 21 -504 21 book Total 312 -273 318 -204 -8,806 -8,110 -8,579 -7,936 The credit spread sensitivity (CS BPV) for the mBank’s banking book, results in c.a. 40% from the positions in debt securities valued at amortised cost. Changes in market price have no impact on the revaluation reserve or the income statement for these positions. Interest rate risk of the banking book In 2019, in order to expand the existing portfolio of measures to assess the interest rate risk of the banking book, mBank introduced a new risk measure to quantify net interest income volatility in line with the EBA guidelines. The volatility of net interest income is calculated and monitored over a five-year horizon in the bank's base scenario assuming a normal situation and in more than 20 defined stress-test scenarios. The table below presents the volatility of the net interest income within 12 months horizon, assuming an unfavourable 100 bps change of market interest rates (parallel shift of the curves by 100 bps with floor on product level) and based on a stable portfolio over the period. PLN M 31.12.2019 ∆ NII PLN -190.8 USD -2.1 EUR -119.2 CHF +7.9 CZK -40.5 Other CCY -0.6 Total -345.3 Liquidity risk mBank organises liquidity risk management processes in line with the requirements resulting from the law and supervisory recommendations in particular the PFSA Recommendations (among others P, C, H and S) as well as EBA guidelines concerning liquidity risk management. 212 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Tools and measures In its operations, mBank is exposed to liquidity risk, i.e. the risk of being unable to honour its payment obligations, arising from the bank’s balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet positions, on terms favourable to the bank and at a reasonable price. In terms of its sources, liquidity risk may result from internal factors (reputational risk resulting for instance in excessive withdrawal of cash by bank clients, materialisation of credit risk) and external factors (turbulences and crises in the financial markets, country risk, turbulences in the operation of clearing systems). The bank has defined a set of liquidity risk measures and a system of limits, buffers and warning thresholds which protect the bank’s liquidity in the event of unfavourable internal or external conditions. Independent measurement, monitoring and controlling of liquidity risk is performed daily by the Balance Risk Management Department. The main measures used in liquidity risk management of the bank include measures based on liquidity gap calculation in LAB methodology, the regulatory measures (M3, M4, LCR) and also NSFR (Net Stable Funding Ratio) for analysis only. LAB measures reflect the projected future cash flow gap of assets, liabilities and off-balance-sheet commitments of the bank, which represent potential risk of being unable to meet liabilities within a specific time horizon and under a certain scenario. The methodology for measuring the liquidity gap (LAB) includes normal conditions scenario (LAB Base Case) describing the situation under normal conditions, i.e. without specific, negative occurrences. For the purpose of this scenario, no continuation of activity is assumed (the so-called run-off scenario) and stress scenarios, of which the following are limited:  LAB Bank Stress (short-term) – short-term scenario (up to 2 weeks) of the idiosyncratic stress;  LAB Market Stress (long-term) – long-term scenario (up to 2 months) of the market crisis;  LAB Combined Stress I – combined stress scenario that presents the effects of the simultaneous occurrence of short-term idiosyncratic stress and long-term market related stress. Cash flow projections used in LAB measures are based on crisis scenarios, which include among others excessive withdrawal of cash by the bank’s clients and being unable to liquidate some assets due to an external crisis occurring to various extent dependent on assumed scenario. Moreover, the bank has a process of reporting and monitoring of intraday liquidity position including crisis scenario for intraday liquidity. The reverse stress scenario is the complement of the liquidity stress testing system. In order to support the process of liquidity risk management, the bank has a system of early warnings indicators (EWI) and recovery indicators. It is composed of indicators 213 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 monitoring the level of regulatory and internal limits and additionally, indicators monitoring significant changes of market factors, as well as changes in the bank’s balance sheet. Exceedance of thresholds by defined indicators may be a trigger for the launch of the Contingency Plan or the Recovery Plan for mBank Group. LCR calculation and reporting is carried out in accordance with the Delegated Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/61 of October 10, 2014, which has been in force since October 2015. With the respect of NSFR, the bank reports to the NBP according to the standards established by EBA in 2014, and reports to the PSFA in the form of a dedicated questionnaire. Strategy The liquidity strategy is pursued by active management of the balance sheet structure and future cash flows as well as maintenance of liquidity reserves adequate to liquidity needs depending on the activity of the bank and the current market situation as well as funding needs of the Group subsidiaries. The bank manages liquidity risk at two levels: strategic (within committees of the bank) and operational (Treasury Department). Liquidity risk limiting covers supervisory (M3, M4, LCR) and internal measures. The liquidity risk internal limit system is based mainly on defining acceptable level of gaps in stress conditions in specific time horizons and for different liquidity risk profiles (for all currencies in aggregate converted to PLN and for individual foreign currencies). The bank has a centralised approach to the Group’s funding management in order to increase the efficiency of liquidity resources used. The subsidiaries are financed by mBank through the Treasury Department. Additionally, mBank Hipoteczny raises funding in the market by issuance of covered bonds and short-term debt securities and mLeasing raises funding by issuance of short-term debt securities. The bank has the Contingency Plan in case of a threat of losing financial liquidity, which sets the strategy and procedures to be implemented in the event of a situation connected with the risk of losing liquidity by mBank Group and aimed at neutralising this threat. The document defines the division of responsibility for monitoring and identifying threats, and actions during the emergency situation. The Contingency Plan is tested at least annually. The bank limits the volume and term concentration of foreign currency funding of mBank with FX swaps and CIRS. In addition, the limit is decomposed into individual limits for CIRS and FX swaps as well as limits for funding in EUR and CHF. The structure of these limits reflects the bank's preferences for funding structure in those currencies. Measuring mBank’s liquidity risk The liquidity of mBank remained at a safe level in 2019, as reflected in the high surplus of liquid assets over short-term liabilities in LAB measures and in the levels of regulatory measures. 214 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The table below presents the LAB gaps for tenors up to 1M and 1Y and the regulatory measures M3, M4, LCR in 2019: Measure1 31.12.2019 LAB Base Case 1M 14 683 LAB Base Case 1Y 12 849 M3 4,30 M4 1,38 LCR 169% 1 LAB measures are shown in PLN million; M3, M4 and LCR are relative measures presented as a decimal. Measuring the Group’s liquidity risk The Group’s liquidity risk measurement includes in addition mBank Hipoteczny and mLeasing. mBank monitors liquidity risk of the subsidiaries to protect liquidity also at the Group level in the event of adverse events (crises). The Group’s liquidity was at a safe level in 2019, as reflected in the high surplus of liquid assets over short-term liabilities in the LAB measures and the LCR calculated at the Group level. The table below presents the LAB gaps for tenors up to 1M and 1Y and the LCR at mBank Group level: Measure1 31.12.2019 LAB Base Case 1M 16,536 LAB Base Case 1Y 14,925 LCR Group 190% 1 LAB measures are shown in PLN million; LCR is relative measure presented as a decimal. Operational risk mBank organises the operational risk management process taking into account the rules and requirements set out in external regulations, in particular in the Recommendations M, H and D of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA), CRR Regulation and Regulation of the Minister of Development and Finance (on the risk management system and internal control system, remuneration policy and detailed method of estimating internal capital in banks), which constitute a starting point for the framework of the operational risk control and management system in mBank Group. Tools and measures 215 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In order to effectively manage operational risk, the bank applies quantitative and qualitative methods and tools, which intend to cause-oriented operational risk management. The basic qualitative tool is the Internal Control System Self-Assessment carried out by the bank’s organisational units and the Group subsidiaries. The Self-Assessment process aims to provide communication about the need to change and improve control processes, and thus a more pro-active approach to operational risk management and increasing operational risk awareness in mBank Group. The end result of the SelfAssessment is the evaluation of risks, control mechanisms and independent monitoring of control mechanisms as well as the creation of corrective action plans aimed at changing the structure or the optimization of the control mechanisms and their independent monitoring. The bank also prepares scenario analyses describing risks associated with rare operational risk events with potentially very serious consequences. In accordance with the requirements of Recommendation M, the bank has a process for identifying threats associated with operational risk in all relevant areas of the bank’s operations and for creating new and modifying existing products, processes and systems, as well as for changes in the organisational structure. Quantitative tools include mainly collection of data on operational events and effects. With the use of the database available at mBank Group, data on operational risk losses are recorded with an emphasis on the cause. Recorded data are analysed by the Integrated Risk Management Department and at organisational units. This approach allows organisational units to carry out ongoing monitoring of their current risk profile. mBank has an access to external operational loss databases and applies them to analyse operational risk and potential threats, that institutions operating in the financial sector are exposed to. The key risk indicators (KRI) are another tool. Ongoing monitoring of risk factors recognized as key at the given moment allows for prediction of an increased level of operational risk and adequate response by the organisational units in order to avoid the occurrence of operational events and losses. Strategy The organisation of the operational risk control and management system is aimed at enabling effective control and management of this risk at every level of the bank’s organisational hierarchy. The structure of operational risk control and management covers in particular the role of the Management Board of the bank, the Business and Risk Forum, the Chief Risk Officer, the Integrated Risk Management Department, and the 216 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 tasks assigned to persons managing operational risk in particular organisational units and business areas of the bank. The operational risk control and management process at the bank is developed and coordinated by the central operational risk control function while operational risk management takes place in every organisational unit of the bank and in every subsidiary of mBank Group. It consists in identifying and monitoring operational risk and taking actions aimed to avoid, mitigate or transfer operational risk. The operational risk control process is supervised by the Supervisory Board of the bank through its Risk Committee. 217 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Capital adequacy One of the bank's main tasks is to ensure an adequate level of capital. As part of the capital management policy, the bank creates a framework and guidelines for the most effective planning and use of the capital base. The strategic goals of mBank and mBank Group are aimed at maintaining the total capital ratio as well as the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio above the levels required by the supervision authority. This allows to maintain business development while meeting the supervisory requirements in the long perspective. Capital adequacy of mBank 24.62% 24.20% 22.84% 21.51% 20.46% 19.42% 17.75% 14.84% 31.12.2017 31.12.2018 31.12.2019 required level 12.2019 Total capital ratio (%) Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (%) Capital adequacy of mBank Group 20.99% 18.31% 20.69% 19.46% 17.47% 16.51% 17.25% 14.47% 31.12.2017 31.12.2018 31.12.2019 required level 12.2019 Total capital ratio (%) Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (%) The capital ratios of mBank Group in 2019 were driven by the following factors:  inclusion, in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, of the remaining part (not included earlier) of the net profit of mBank Group for the year 2018 as approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders;  inclusion in the calculation of own funds of the amount of impairment or reversal of impairment of financial assets not measured at fair value in the financial result in 2019;  expansion of mBank Group business activity; implementation from January 1, 2019 of the International Financial Reporting Standard 16. 218 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank Group is obligated to maintain own funds on the level exceeding regulatory and supervisory requirements. Consequently the level of the required capital ratios encompasses:  the basic requirement resulting from CRR provisions to maintain the total capital ratio of 8% and the Tier 1 ratio of 6%;  the additional capital charge in Pillar II with regard to FX mortgage loan portfolio – 3.11% at the level of total capital ratio and 2.33% at the level of Tier 1 capital on consolidated basis (and on individual basis 3.62% and 3.71% accordingly), according to the PFSA decision of November 5, 2019, and the subsequent communication of November 18, 2019;  the combined buffer requirement of additional 6.14% (on consolidated basis), which consists of: a. the capital conservation buffer (2.50%); b. the other systemically important institution’s buffer (0.75%) according to the PFSA decision, in 2016 mBank had been identified as other systemically important institution (O-SII) subject to a capital buffer; according to the PFSA decision of October 14, 2019, the capital buffer amounted to 0.75%; c. systemic risk buffer (2.83%) – due to the fact that not all exposures are located in Poland, due to mBank two foreign branches in Czech Republic and in Slovakia, the systemic risk buffer rate applicable to mBank Group amounted to 2.83% in December 2019; d. countercyclical capital buffer (0.06%). On individual basis the value of the combined buffer requirement is 6.13% mainly due to a lower, than at the Group level, value of the systemic risk buffer (2.81%) and higher countercyclical capital buffer (0.07%). Capital ratios, both on consolidated and individual basis, were above the values required throughout the 2019. With a considerable surplus of own funds mBank Group comfortably meets the additional own funds requirement and the combined buffer requirement. The consolidated leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the provisions of the CRR Regulation and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/62 of October 10, 2014, amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the leverage ratio, including provisions regarding transitional period, amounted to 8.25%. The stand-alone leverage ratio amounted to 8.60%. More details on capital adequacy of mBank Group at the end of 2019 can be found in the Disclosures regarding capital adequacy. 219 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Policies and procedures mBank’s personal data security policy Efficient protection of consumers’ data and privacy is a fundamental precondition of credibility of financial service providers.

Reliable conflict of interest management is a part of the corporate culture and a responsibility of mBank employees across all levels of the organisation. In particular, members of the bank’s Management Board and directors of mBank’s units must participate in the identification of conflicts of interest, implementation of measures necessary to prevent conflicts of interest, and management of actual conflicts of interest. Members of mBank’s supervisory board and Management Board have special responsibilities. They are required to report an actual or potential conflict of interests and to refrain from participating in discussions and voting on matters which could cause a conflict of interest in relations with mBank clients or with mBank. According to the policy, the Management Board has made the Compliance Department responsible for management of conflicts of interest in the bank. In particular, it is responsible for monitoring internal regulations and IT solutions, consulting services for the organisation, controls, training, and recommendations. The Compliance Department is responsible for reviewing any reported conflict of interest, issuing recommendations concerning the course of action, and monitoring the implementation of recommendations. The Compliance Department reviews the policy to ensure its adequacy and effectiveness at least on an annual basis. We use information barriers in order to restrict the flow of confidential information, client information and client transactions. 221 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Compliance policy at mBank The compliance policy defines the general framework for compliance of mBank with laws, internal regulations, and market standards. All employees of the bank are responsible for implementation of the compliance policy depending on their responsibilities and powers. mBank employees are responsible for the identification, assessment, estimation, controlling, and monitoring of the risk of non-compliance with laws, internal regulations and market standards, and for quarterly risk reporting to the Compliance Department. The internal control system includes three lines of defence. On the first line of defence, compliance is ensured by operations employees. As a second line of defence, compliance risk is monitored by compliance officers and the Compliance Department. The third line of defence is the Internal Audit Department. The Supervisory Board exercises oversight over the effectiveness of the internal control system. The Management Board of the bank is responsible for effective management of compliance risk and for the evaluation of compliance risk on the basis of annual reports presented by the Director of the Compliance Department. In addition to the responsibilities of the Management Board and the Compliance Department, the directors of organisational units are also responsible for the implementation of the compliance policy. They are responsible for organising their employees in such a way as to ensure compliance with laws, internal regulations, market standards accepted by mBank, guidelines and recommendations of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA) and other authorities competent in the area of the given unit. mBank’s remuneration policy The remuneration rules for mBank employees are defined in mBank’s remuneration policy. The policy is designed to support strong employee engagement by providing market-based remuneration packages adequate to employees’ contribution; to retain the best employees; and to attract talent to the organisation in traineeship and secondment programmes. The policy defines the rules ensuring protection of rights and interests of clients and preventing conflicts of interest. The Management Board of the bank is responsible for the development and implementation of the policy. The Management Board reviews the implementation of the policy on an annual basis and resents proposed amendments for review and approval to the Remuneration Committee of the Bank’s Supervisory Board. The policy is reviewed at least on annual basis by the Internal Audit Department, which presents its findings to the Supervisory Board of the bank. The Supervisory Board approves the remuneration policy and consults the Remuneration Committee if necessary. Employees in management positions who are the bank’s risk takers are additionally covered by mBank’s risk taker remuneration policy. 222 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In addition to the remuneration policy, mBank also follows mBank’s Employee Remuneration Rules and mBank’s Employee Bonus Rules. mBank’s work rules mBank’s work rules define the responsibilities of the employer and employees. In line with labour law, mBank’s work rules govern the organisation of work at the bank and the conclusion of employment agreements. mBank’s work rules define matters relating to full or part-time employment and working hours, work attendance, holidays, remuneration, awards and bonuses, liability for breach of employee’s obligations, occupational health and safety, fire protection, protection of women and minors at work. The President of the Management Board or a Management Board Member or Managing Director authorised by the President oversees the implementation of the rules at the bank with the support of employees of the Employee Development and Organisational Culture Department and directors of the bank’s units who monitor compliance with the rules in their units on an on-going basis. The work rules apply to all employees of the bank working under employment agreements irrespective of position, full or part-time employment, and term of the agreement. They are required to comply with the rules and need to sign a declaration to that effect no later than the first day of work. mBank’s work rules were implemented and are updated in form of an Order of the President of the Management Board. mBank’s Workers’ Council rules mBank employees are represented by the Workers’ Council established under the Act of April 7, 2006, on employee information and consultation. The Workers’ Council is comprised of 7 members elected by all employees for a term of four years. Its responsibilities include consulting the employer on the status quo, structure and expected changes of employment and matters which could cause significant changes to the organisation or the basis of employment. The Workers’ Council operates under an agreement with the bank. Anti-mobbing policy As an employer, mBank strives to create a work environment free of mobbing and other forms of violence caused by superiors and colleagues. The key focus of the policy is as follows:  mBank does not tolerate mobbing or any other forms of violence.  Employees must refrain from any action or behaviour which meets the criteria of mobbing or other forms of violence.  Anyone who creates conditions that encourage mobbing or resorts to mobbing is in violation of the fundamental employee obligations. In that case, as an employer, mBank may impose sanctions under the labour law and mBank’s work rules. 223 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 The policy defines the criteria of mobbing and the reporting process (anonymous or not, at the choice of the reporting employee) for employees who claim that they have been mobbed. Complaints are reviewed by the Anti-mobbing Committee comprised of directors or their substitutes from the Employee Development and Organisational Culture Department, the Compliance Department, the Legal Department, the Marketing Communication Department, and mBank’s Ethics Officer, excluding anyone whose legal or factual relationship with the complainant could affect the objectivity and impartiality of the Committee. Policy for the assessment of qualifications (suitability) of members of the supervisory body, management body and key function holders at mBank S.A. The suitability policy defines transparent and precise procedures for the selection, assessment of suitability, and succession of mBank’s key function holders. It specifies the qualifications required in each position, good repute, and no conflict of interest during employment. The policy sets requirements for succession in key positions and defines the procedure of handling vacancies. The suitability criteria for the Management Board and the Supervisory Board include a comprehensive and diverse membership among others in terms of gender, age, and professional experience. One of the sections in the policy is dedicated to diversity. Regarding gender diversity, the policy sets a joint target of at least 30% women on the Management Board and the Supervisory Board by 2028. It recommends that at least one member of the Management Board should be a woman. We signed the Diversity Charter in January 2018, joining an international initiative for social cohesion and equality supported in Poland by the Responsible Business Forum. As a member of the initiative, we support diversity and prevent discrimination at work. mBank’s anti-corruption policy The policy provides guidelines for the identification and mitigation of corruption risks, the key principles of the code of ethics, and related responsibilities. No Management Board member, manager, employee or associate may justify corruption or bribery by invoking mBank’s interest. mBank follows a policy of zero tolerance for all forms of corruption, including accepting, offering, requesting, granting and giving consent for additional benefits, objects or payments in order to:  unlawfully influence a decision,  obtain or secure an illegal business advantage,  gain personal benefits. mBank’s Management Board and employees are required to avoid conflicts of personal and professional interest. They are prohibited from offering any undue benefits, in particular to central or local government officials, civil servants, and politicians. 224 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank prevents corruption in a system of three lines of defence. The first line of defence is comprised of the bank’s organisational units. The second line of defence is the Compliance Department which is responsible for setting and monitoring standards of compliance with anti-corruption laws and regulations. The third line of defence is the Internal Audit Department, which evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the bank’s anti-corruption system. The Management Board and employees report actual or suspected incidents of corruption to the direct superior or the Compliance Department. Reports may be lodged anonymously in the mSygnał system, which is also available online to third parties. We review all reports with due diligence and in confidence. Units involved in a case of noncompliance take steps to clarify all circumstances and to secure evidence. In case of a suspected crime, the director of the relevant unit provides the file to the Compliance Department, which reports to the law enforcement services if the suspicion is confirmed. The Compliance Department maintains records of corruption procedures. Anyone attempting to engage or engaged in corruption is subject to the procedure defined in labour law and mBank’s work rules. The Director of the Compliance Department immediately reports a corruption case to the member of the Management Board responsible for the given area. In case of high reputational risk or where the incident involves a Management Board Member, the Director of the Compliance Department additionally notifies the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Moreover, the Compliance Department may take independent steps, irrespective of any reports filed by units of the bank, to detect cases of corruption. The bank expects its business partners (vendors, contractors, service providers who work with mBank and with its clients on behalf of the bank) to comply with the policy. Anticorruption provisions are included in each contract between the bank and a business partner. Fraud Prevention Policy at mBank and whistleblowing The policy defines who, and how, is responsible for fraud prevention. The bank follows a policy of zero tolerance for all fraud and attempted fraud by the bank’s employees, clients, contractors, and third parties. mBank requires fair and lawful behaviour of all its employees, clients, and business partners. mBank’s fraud risk management cycle covers four stages:  fraud prevention – risk assessment, early identification, and clear rules and mechanisms mitigating risk;  fraud detection – implementation of fraud controls, monitoring systems and reporting channels;  fraud management – every case of suspected crime to the detriment of mBank or its client is investigated and necessary steps are taken, including legal measures;  response – clear rules for mitigating loss or damage, corrective mechanisms, lessons learned. 225 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank has implemented an electronic whistleblowing system, which ensures anonymity of whistle-blowers. It is accessible on all internet-enabled devices: https://client.bkmssystem.net/bkwebanon/report/clientInfo?cin=2brebank11&language=pol. Whistleblowing rules and the procedures for reviewing reports are defined in internal regulations as follows:  the identity of the whistle-blower and the person concerned is strictly confidential: their data must not be disclosed to third parties unless required by law;  the whistle-blower may set up an anonymous inbox to receive updates on actions taken in reaction to the report and/or to provide additional details;  every whistleblowing report is reviewed by authorised staff to ensure an objective, fair and impartial investigation;  mBank employees who report suspected fraud in good faith are protected from any form of repression. Reports are initially reviewed by staff of the Compliance Department. Filed in the system or otherwise, reports are investigated by authorised officers, as the case may be: employees of the Employee Development and Organisational Culture Department, employees of the Foreign Branches, the Ethics Officer, and employees of the Compliance Department. If a report is confirmed, the case is escalated according to the law and the bank’s internal regulations. The rules for reporting fraud to the Management Board and the Supervisory Board are also clearly defined. They cover regular and ad-hoc reports. mBank’s gift policy mBank’s policy concerning presentation and acceptance of gifts (gift policy) sets clear and coherent standards for the presentation and acceptance of gifts by mBank employees. Gifts, including entertainment, are a lawful customary business practice. However, gifts could also be used to obtain illegal gains. mBank follows a policy of zero tolerance for all forms of corruption. Employees may present and accept gifts only in accordance with the gift policy. According to the policy, mBank employees are allowed:  to accept and present small corporate gifts customary in business relations up to predefined limits;  to participate in conferences organised by business partners. Event topics must be consistent with the participating employee’s professional responsibilities. mBank covers the cost of transport and accommodation at such events. According to the policy, mBank employees are not allowed:  to accept and present gifts in the form of cash or cash equivalents; 226 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  to present or accept any gifts to/from other mBank employees if such gifts could be considered a form of influence over their due execution of relevant processes;  to accept gifts from mBank’s business partners;  to present gifts to central and local government officials in connection with their functions. The Compliance Department maintains records of accepted and presented gifts. The Compliance Department regularly monitors compliance with the gift policy and reports on the implementation of the policy to the bank’s Management Board and Supervisory Board as a part of its compliance risk management reporting. Global sanction policy mBank identifies its clients and monitors persons and entities participating in transactions in accordance with sanction lists of the European Union, the United States, and the United Nations in order to ensure compliance with the applicable laws imposing special restrictions. The Compliance Department provides guidelines and instructions, informs other departments and subsidiaries about business policy restrictions imposed by sanctions, provides advice, and monitors compliance. We comply with sanction regulations by identifying clients and beneficial owners, and by identifying and refusing to execute transactions violating sanctions. We inform clients about sanction regulations and train the bank’s employees accordingly. Every employee of the bank is required to read and strictly comply with the policy. mBank closely monitors existing business relations in sanction countries and takes necessary measures, up to termination of relations. mBank’s disclosure obligations mBank has implemented the requirements imposed among others under the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments, MAR, and the Act on Public Offering. We comply with the disclosure requirements because:  we are a public company, that is, an issuer of securities admitted to trading on the regulated market;  we carry out brokerage activities;  we carry out custodial activities;  we carry out activities referred to in Article 70(2) of the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments. According to the law, information concerning certain events relating to mBank’s activity is classified as inside information. In such cases, we file a mandatory current report with the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (PFSA), the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW), and the Polish Press Agency (PAP). The same concerns certain other events which are not classified as inside information. We are required to file reports with PFSA concerning events relating to brokerage activities, custodial activities, and investment activities. Each 227 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 unit of mBank concerned by or aware of such event is required to report it to the Compliance Department. Failure to report, late reporting, and undue reporting generate the risk of financial penalties for mBank. In that case, the risk of financial penalties also affects:  the persons providing information for a report;  the members of the Management Board responsible for the given area. mBank keeps records of persons discharging managerial responsibilities within the meaning of MAR. Principles for suppliers mBank’s vendors and suppliers are required to comply with the law, labour law, human rights law, to protect the environment, to avoid discrimination, and to comply with anticorruption law. mBank pursues its business according to ethical and responsibility standards defined among others in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organisation standards, and the OECD guidelines (in particular, anti-corruption guidelines). Every supplier participating in procurement or performing a contract with mBank is required to comply with the guidelines and ensure compliance by its subcontractors. The guidelines in particular include: 1) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 2) the International Labour Organisation standards; 3) the OECD guidelines (in particular, anti-corruption guidelines); 4) the Rio Declaration on the Environment and Development – Agenda 21; 5) the United Nations Convention against Corruption; 6) international trade sanctions and embargoes, including sanctions which may apply under resolutions of the UN Security Council according to Chapter VII of the UN Charter, or any sanctions imposed by the European Union; 7) acts of national law implementing the above, as well as rules and regulations, in particular conflict of management rules and regulations. Policy for services and financing of entities which carry out activities in sensitive areas related to mBank’s reputation risk The policy imposes restrictions on the provision of services to companies in socially controversial sectors which are in breach of the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. Such restrictions concern opening of accounts as well as lending in the case of companies, including existing clients of mBank, whose activities:  involve child labour or forced labour or result in other manifest violations of human rights; 228 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019  focus on economic exploitation of valuable natural areas;  pose a risk to the global cultural heritage. We do not establish business relations with any entities operating in countries, on which UN imposed sanctions. Rules of lending to the defense industry In its relations with operators in the defence industry, mBank takes into consideration political, social, ethical, and environmental factors which could affect its reputation. In the defence industry, mBank in general accepts transactions with public entities: government agencies, state-owned companies, etc. 229 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Outlook Growth fuelled by our clients – new strategy for 2020-2023 In December 2019, we adopted the new Strategy of mBank Group for 2020-2023 titled Growth fuelled by our clients . It was developed as our response to the current changes in the market and regulatory environment and the expected trends in the future. We took into account, among others, economic prospects, technological progress, evolution of consumer behaviour and expectations, local constraints as well as internal conditions. Building upon the experience gathered during the implementation of the previous strategy, we confirm that mBank Group’s mission and values continue to be valid under the new plan. The macroeconomic and regulatory environment in Europe is becoming increasingly demanding for the banking sector. Although Poland remains the leader of economic growth and the central bank keeps positive interest rates, GDP growth in subsequent years will be lower than in the past. In the long run, the challenge will be also an ageing population. In addition, banks is also subject to competitive pressure from the so-called fintechs. These entities are characterised by light structures, innovativeness and the use of new technologies. At the same time, they are 230 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 subject to less regulatory rigour, which makes it easier for them to compete with traditional banks in terms of selected products and services. The threat may be also technological giants from the United States and China, i.e. the socalled GAFA (American Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon) and BAT (Chinese Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent). They have an access to unique data in real time and a huge base of potential customers as well as the ability to deal with large volumes of information. This gives the opportunity to analyse and assess the creditworthiness of individuals and companies, which until recently was a competence reserved for banks. It shows that the financial market will undergo an intensifying transformation. In the strategy for 2020-2023, we will focus on 4 areas, corresponding to the key components of its business model:  Client (acquisition and long-term relationships): As a bank, we will be growing organically by constant attracting new clients (especially young and firms) and strengthening our position in the 30-45 age group. We will improve the retention of individual customers by developing products that anchor them in the bank at particular stages of their life cycle. In the corporate segment, we will shape our customer portfolio by anticipating trends and changes in the market environment, while maintaining a high diversification of exposures. We will expand our knowledge of customers in order to more precisely identify and satisfy their needs by constructing a personalised offer. In pursuance of the assumptions of empathy, we will communicate with our clients in an understandable way and distinguish ourselves by the transparency of the offer, including our pricing policy.  Platform (ecosystem and user experience): We will be constantly improving remote bank access channels and promote digital self-service. We will give the leading role to the mobile application, which will have the same scope of functionality as the Internet banking service, while contact center and outlets will play a supportive role. We will be developing the retail platform by supplementing it with value-added services and the offer of selected partners, including non-financial ones. Focused on providing convenience, ease and speed of use, we will build the best digital banking for corporations in Poland.  Efficiency (operational advantage): We will maintain the technological advantage in the financial sector. We will rely on agile interdisciplinary teams to design and deliver end-to-end solutions. We will modify IT architecture using industry best practices. We will increase the digital self-service of our customers while optimising our sales network. We will improve the operational efficiency of mBank by implementing automation on a large scale and simplifying processes.  Employees and organisation culture: We will ensure that the work environment and its organisation in mBank Group will foster efficiency, cooperation, high engagement and the creation of innovative solutions. We want to make managers think outside the box and inspire development, and employees who seek new solutions and take 231 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 care of our clients. We will use technology to relieve employees from routine tasks and implement automated tools to facilitate compliance with regulations. For the first time, the ESG/CSR strategy has also become an integral part of the document. As mBank Group, we intend to conduct our business in accordance with the principles of sustainable development. We want to educate, take care of the climate and the environment and promote prosperity. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are global sustainability targets set by the United Nations to be achieved by 2030, were our guidelines in formulating them. Our activities in the CSR area will be centered around 3 aspects: mBank educates We want to help developing mathematical skills of children and adolescents. We trust that such knowledge affects a high level of competence in adult life and facilitates a good start in professional career. Mathematical thinking also helps in decision-making on personal finance issues. We believe that everyone, regardless of their place of residence and origin, should have equal access to quality education. Through the activities of mFundacja, we will continue to strive to equalize opportunities for students, irrespective of their stage of education and place of living. We will organize national competitions and grant programs. We want to provide the users with knowledge on how to safely use internet and mobile banking as well as make our clients aware of cybercrime threats. For this purpose, we will continue with our social campaigns, informing how to avoid the unwanted consequences of the online activities and protect the finances. mBank cares about the climate and the environment We want to encourage the behaviours that help to stop and reverse adverse climate and environmental changes. We will pursue an active credit policy towards clients who seek financing for pro-ecological industrial, infrastructural and housing investments, including special programs directed to renewable energy sources and issue of green bonds. We will implement investment strategies in instruments based on ESG analysis and offer product solutions that build the pro-environmental awareness of consumers. We will implement credit policy for industries relevant to EU climate policy and strive for further presence in the WIG-ESG index. We will measure and gradually reduce our total carbon footprint. We will limit electricity and energy consumption, thanks to progressive replacement of the current equipment with more modern ones, introduction of innovative solutions in our buildings, use of office space in energy-efficient buildings with high thermal insulation parameters. We will save water and sensitize employees to the need for rational use of it. We will reduce the use of paper and office supplies, modifying business processes in order to further digitize documents. We plan to successively replace our car fleet with low-emission vehicles, and take care of their regular service and technical condition. We will establish a supplier selection and cooperation system that takes ESG aspects into account. 232 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 mBank promotes prosperity We are a signatory to the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact. In accordance with them, we want to grow in a sustainable manner, make the world a better place and contribute to the prosperity of our stakeholders: customers, employees, investors, partners and the society. Investment in health serves the achievement of this goal. Therefore we will continue our cooperation with the Great Orchestra of Christmas Charity, which has been providing hospitals and clinics with modern medical equipment for 28 years. We want to conduct inclusive banking and be accessible to customers with disabilities. We have introduced a service for people with hearing impairments in sign language. We will adjust mBank's transactional services to the needs of visually impaired people. Our outlets and headquarters will be adapted for people with reduced mobility. We speak about our products and services using clear and simple language in accordance with mKanon. We will be guided by ethical values in our dealings with the customers. We also want to promote equality and diversity in our organisation, assisting development of women and eliminating pay inequalities in the same positions. We will carry out activities that support women entrepreneurs. Pillars of the strategy and main directions of development In view of the dynamically changing business and regulatory environment, mBank Group will be monitoring and actively responding to market opportunities and threats. As a universal bank, we will provide a full range of products and services through all access channels. Our growth will be fuelled by new and existing, retail and corporate, clients. Therefore, we will remain focused on acquisition in the target segments and the development of long-term customer relationships. The key challenge for the coming years will be to maintain mBank's market position in the conditions of unfavourable demographic dynamics. In line with the market perception of our brand, we intend to be a modern, technologically advanced and friendly bank, which offers products that are understandable to the customer as well as fast, intuitive solutions. Due to the better use of data, the service will become more personalised. The transactionality will remain a key element of our development, as it is a space of daily, most frequent interactions between the bank and the customer. We will build our offer based on the mobile first paradigm, increasing the share of sales and services in the digital area. We want to be appreciated for our quality, professionalism, innovation, reliability and security. In our 233 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 daily operations, we will take into account the aspects of corporate social responsibility and sustainable development. At mBank, we are distinguished by people , and their commitment, competence and work input are the foundations of our achievements. Therefore, we want to recruit and retain employees with a specific profile that match our values and challenges for the future. Adjustments to the organisational structure, promotion of internal transfers or projects implemented jointly by people from different areas will support the culture of cooperation within the Group. In financial terms, we will focus on building the longterm value of the company, backed by a positive trajectory of the results. Our revenues will be growing faster than costs, translating into further improvement in efficiency. We intend to increase business volumes and our market share and at the same time take care of efficient use of capital. A change in the structure of the loan portfolio and the entire balance sheet will have a positive impact on margin and profitability. Our goal is to ensure a satisfactory return for mBank’s shareholders. Key initiatives and business activities which we intend to undertake and execute in the horizon of this strategy have been grouped into 4 strategic blocks: Client (acquisition and long-term relation development) Our goals:  to grow organically through the continuous acquisition of new customers and strengthen our position in the most profitable age group of 30-45. We want to maintain our advantage in the acquisition in the segment of young people (aged 1328 years) and start-ups, as well as a high share in the e-commerce market. With relatively high penetration in large agglomerations, we want to strengthen our position in mid-sized cities. Leveraging on the social role of parents who are mBank’s clients, we plan to faster enter into relations with clients aged 8-13. We will solicit the segment of professionals providing services for other entrepreneurs (e.g. accountants).  to improve customer retention and loyalty throughout their life cycle. We want to systematically recognise the needs of our customers at every stage of their lives and satisfy them in the most appropriate form, so that they do not look for products and services in other banks. We will make the offer more attractive so that it includes aspects that are important from the point of view of accumulating funds and the challenges of ageing and inheritance. At the same time, we will focus on the products 234 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 anchoring the client in the bank, in particular convenient mortgage loan, savings and investments.  to increase the likelihood of recommending mBank’s services by our clients. We will focus our activities on increasing customer confidence. We intend to provide a sense of security with reliable technological banking solutions and services supporting data and financial security in the digital world. We want to act in a predictable manner and represent a uncompromising business ethics as well as eliminate waiting and unnecessary efforts of the customer. We will appreciate loyalty and personalize clients’ experiences.  to create a platform for cooperation with corporate clients based on partnership, convenience and professionalism. The strength of our relational banking is trust based on advisors' competences and experience, therefore we will promote proactive attitude of our employees and we expect their involvement in understanding the customers' business. We intensify activities aimed at the development of knowledge and the flow of experience. As a bank we want to be useful and perceived as an efficiently operating part of the enterprise.  to shape the portfolio of corporate clients anticipating trends and changes in the environment. Preferred industries, in which we want to develop, include: e-commerce, renewable energy sources and businesses engaged in energy transformation, financing of automation and digitalisation solutions, new technologies, health care and leisure time industry. We strive to assure that our portfolio comprises dynamic companies with an attractive and prospective business profile. At the same time, we will continue to maintain a high diversification of credit exposures in order to ensure the long-term security of the bank.  to extend our knowledge about the customers in both segments. We will organise the available data in order to create useful information that we will use to providing the customers with better service and looking for areas for further growth. We will complement the clients’ assessment models with parameters resulting from the prediction of their behaviour.  to continue the principles of empathy in contacts with customers as well as take care of the transparency of the offer. We will communicate in a clear and understandable way, explaining the circumstances of bank’s decisions and providing the clients with all the necessary information. We will simplify the offer in each business line, including the price list and tariffs.  to shape the positive image of the bank and make the brand appealing for retail and corporate customers. We will maintain the already existing positive associations with mBank and make up for certain shortcomings by adding attributes that we lack. We intend to rely more on the feedback provided by customers (based on the knowledge from contact center, complaints, evaluations and conversations with advisors) in order to excel the organisation in accordance with their expectations. Platform (ecosystem, user experience) 235 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Our goals:  to continuously improve remote bank access channels using the digital first (mobile first) approach. The mobile application, equipped with the same range of functionalities as online banking, will be given a leading role in finance management, whereas contact center and branches will support remote channels and serve to solve problems. We will add digital assistance in the service model. We will accelerate the transformation of the distribution structure to reach an average of 80% of sales in digital channels (own channels and API) and 50% in mobile mode within 4 years.  to develop mBank’s retail platform by complementing it with additional products and services, including non-financial ones, in order to ensure complete customer service. We want to use the transaction-related moments effectively for the contextual presentation of our offer of unsecured loans and their sales through mobile channels. We are striving to provide the most convenient and fast mortgage loan on the market. We will expand our offer through selective partnerships with the use of API and cooperation with mAccelerator fund.  to build the best digital banking offer for corporations in Poland. Our guiding principle will be simplification first and then digitisation. We want to retain only the necessary steps, data and documents. Our work will include improvement of customer contact channels with the bank (internet transactional platform mBank CompanyNet and mobile application), as well as internal sales, after-sales and credit processes (for K3 as well as K1 and K2 clients) and tools for advisors, including CRM. Efficiency (operational) Our goals:  to maintain our technological advantage in the financial sector and optimise our IT architecture using leading solutions. We plan to expand our business-technology team, and working within it interdisciplinary teams will ensure a delivery of end-toend solutions. We intend to migrate our key applications to a modern technological pile based on microservices and containers as well as fully release the potential of a public cloud computing within the framework of existing regulations.  to increase the scope of customer digital self-service and optimise our sales network. We plan to implement a digital assistant and adaptive user interface in the mobile application and transactional service, which will allow for contextual customisation of the customer's screen. We will improve customer experience in the inter-channel service process (omniservice). We will implement significant product and service changes using advanced tests and with the involvement of our customers. After completing the project of physical network development, we will maintain the number of our branches at the 2020 level.  to provide our customers with the highest security standards. We will continue to intensively develop solutions that protect our customers, based on the latest 236 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 technologies, including machine learning, artificial intelligence, biometrics and other emerging techniques.  to improve the operational efficiency of the bank by implementing automation on a large scale and simplifying processes. The main activities assume: centralisation of operational processes, including their takeover entirely by specialised units, elimination of paper documents flow within the organisation and the need to archive them, introduction of a unified methodology for managing operations, supported by a central measurement system as well as analytical and process engineering tools.  to shorten the time of issuing opinions and internal consultations in implementing new solutions, while maintaining full alignment with regulations and compliance requirements. Legal support functions will also be organised according to agile working methods and based on new technologies. This will allow us to more effectively meet the growing number of regulatory requirements without paralysing our business. 237 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Employees and organisation culture The people and culture we create are at the core of our organisation. Cooperation and sincere and empathic relationships allow us to create value that delivers results. We believe that the way we treat our employees, they treat our customers. We build a technology-supported work environment that inspires to be innovative. The main assumptions for the HR area include 3 dimensions: People We want to coach smart managers who know how to inspire development and motivate to care about clients. Through strategic thinking, innovation and willingness to take up challenges, they will simplify and achieve the intended results efficiently. We will encourage employees to look for new solutions, automate processes and be open to technologies. We aim to make them empathic, collaborative and engaged. They are supposed to show a holistic approach to the customers to support them at every stage of their life cycle and to respond to their needs. Our employees will be honest and aware of current and new regulations. Technology We plan to increase work efficiency by providing the best applications, software and IT equipment. We will automate simple and repetitive tasks so that our employees can focus on key tasks and bring value, wherever it is important to build true contact with other people. We will implement RegTech solutions, which help to comply with procedures and regulatory requirements. We will use new HR technologies and predictive analytics to make informed decisions about investing in people. A culture of cooperation We want to promote the particular value of feedback. On the basis of that, we develop and appreciate each other as well as building the culture of cooperation, which is the foundation of our organisation. We have a better understanding of the network of interdependencies and are able to work together. At mBank, we are open to other people, trust each other and believe in good intentions. We clearly show what attitudes and behaviours are expected from our employees, presenting simple and understandable values. We promote agile working methods, focused on breaking down hierarchical organisational structures and operating on the basis of a network of cooperating teams. We are implementing a transparent Objectives and Key Results system (OKR), linked to the strategic directions of the organisation. We will increase the diversity of characters, personalities, experiences, gender and age, which will help us to make decisions from a multilateral perspective and build better solutions. These objectives and business assumptions are part of mBank’s mission, which remains: “To help. Not to annoy. To delight... Anywhere”. Our employees identify themselves with a culture based on empathy towards clients, co-workers and corporate social responsibility. 238 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 Financial targets of mBank Group Strategic assumptions, concerning a product offer, the aim to strengthen or keep a market position in particular categories as well as an assessment of key trends and competitive situation, are reflected in the projections of mBank Group’s financial results. In particular, we intend to further consistently increase the share of higher yielding assets and customer deposits in the balance sheet structure, as well as maintain diversification of funding sources through issuances of Eurobonds (EMTN Programme) and covered bonds by mBank Hipoteczny. Our strategic goal is to keep the position among top Polish banks in terms of key financial metrics. In the mid-term horizon, our profitability shall systematically improve thanks to rising revenues, decent cost discipline and prudent approach to risk management. Favourable changes in the balance sheet structure are going to translate into gradual improvement of net interest margin, while a growth of total income outpacing an inflation of costs will ensure higher efficiency. Consequently, we assume to generate a return for the shareholders that will be attractive compared to other Polish banks. The activities of mBank Group in the coming years will be focused on achieving the following financial targets, defining our profitability, stability and growth: ~3,0% ~40% ~10,5% Net interest margin (NIM), Cost/Income ratio (C/I) Return on equity (ROE net) increase \in 2023, 92-94% 1,5 p.p. ~6% Loans/Deposits ratio: Capital ratios Average annual growth (CAGR) in 2019-2023 at: ~6% for loans and deposits, ~8% for total income, ~5% for total costs. In line with long-term strategy of mBank Group, our goal is to pay 50% of net profit as a dividend. The adopted dividend policy allows for keeping capital ratios at the safe levels. Outlook for the bank’s environment and the sector The abrupt outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 pandemics at the beginning of 2020 changed the economic picture dramatically and caused our macroeconomic outlook published in the Management Board Report on Performance of mBank S.A. Group in 2019 to be outdated. The non-precedent, dynamic situation allows only to make conditional assumptions, which may change depending on the containment of the virus and governments’ response to counteracting economic shock caused by the pandemics. The outlook presented below represents our best predictions as at the beginning of April 2020. 239 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 In our view, current recession is carrying substantial structural change in global economics. It is forecast that the peak in the numbers of infected is to come in May/June. It is yet to be seen how fast various restrictions will be lifted and how the economies are going to be affected. No matter the trajectory, the return to normality will be painfully slow even though we are about to temporarily see strong GDP numbers as economies jump start. We expect 4.2% recession in 2020 and substantial drop of core inflation into year’s end. Seemingly high CPI inflation results from high food prices and possible (delicate) turnaround in oil prices in H2. Q4 2019 GDP level is not to be reached until 2022. Fiscal policy gets actively involved along with central bank support. Polish economy is not an exception. Polish central bank reacted to pandemics with catalogue of measures, primarily with two interest rates’ cuts on March 17th and April 9th, each by 50 bps. Quantitative Easing measures are already in place, meaning purchases of government bonds and bonds with state guarantees. Polish TLTRO is in the pipeline. Now, the vital role is to be played by the government with use of fiscal policy. We estimate that government programmes launched in March and April will be able to save up to 600k jobs. It allows for a stabilization of unemployment rate in Q3 at 10.2% level (official, registered unemployment rate, not LFS). Otlook for the banking sector Household deposits will continue to rise, but the growth rate will decrease gradually. An ailing economy, salary cuts, and the need to finance consumption with savings will push the growth rate of household deposits down to around zero in the quarters to come. However, it is possible that the support programmes launched by the government and the dramatic decrease in consumer spending caused by administrative measures will result in a temporary increase in savings. The large cash withdrawals reported in March (estimated at approximately PLN 30 billion based on NBP data) will not take place again. They were driven by consumers’ fears about the consequences of economic lockdown. As none of the pessimistic visions materialised, the cash should soon turn into corporate deposits or return to the banking sector in the form of household deposits. Consumers’ borrowing activity will soon decrease rather abruptly due to shrinking consumer loans. A slowing economy will soon trigger a contraction in corporate lending. We can expect a decrease in both working capital and investment loans. An alternative, especially to working capital loans, will be offered in particular by the Polish Development Fund’s (PFR) programme, which will provide companies with liquidity support worth as much as PLN 100 billion in the next months. Investment activity will recover slowly, but a structural shift in the economy is expected to increase demand for investment loans. Corporate deposits are expected to shrink in the nearest future due to a significant decrease in revenues. The government support programmes will also be important in this context as they will reduce at least part of operating costs and prevent an abrupt decrease in deposits. 240 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 About the report 102-46 102-50 102-52 The report was prepared in line with the GRI Standards (Core option) with the support of Go Responsible, an independent consulting company. The report was not verified by an external entity. mBank reports on an annual basis. Key topics to be addressed by the report were selected on the basis of a survey on stakeholders’ expectations. It was carried out through telephone interviews in December 2019, in addition to an anonymous online questionnaire conducted in December 2018. Respondents included key bank stakeholders: employees, clients, investors, business partners, social partners as well as potential clients, share analysts and third parties. The organisation strategy, non-financial reporting of the competition and conclusions reached at the meeting with the working team responsible for the report were also taken into account when selecting key topics to be covered by the report. 102-44 Individual and institutional clients of mBank Group subsidiaries regularly provide feedback on their level of satisfaction with particular processes, products, and their components, such as transparency of presented costs and risk or value for money. These issues are addressed, among others, in structured questionnaires including open questions, the “Assess” option in online banking, as well as during workshops. The said surveys and workshops are followed by reports, which are presented to the management, sales force employees and product specialists. Obtained conclusions are used to improve the existing processes and products. Furthermore, clients’ replies are uploaded to the customer relation management system already during a survey. Replies to open questions are analysed by branch directors, and then advisors contact clients to get feedback, reply to questions and address clients’ needs. 241 INTEGRATED REPORT 2019 102-47 On the basis of all the above data, the following relevance matrix was developed: Average External perspective assessment Company’s perspective in scale 1-3 Development and using various 1. forms of contact with our 2 Approach to stakeholder engagement 102-43 stakeholders Counteracting discrimination and caring about the most vulnerable Initiatives enhancing access to financial groups, i.e. the economically FS14 services for the disabled disadvantaged, the disabled, the 2.22 2. elderly, etc., for example by ensuring the availability of services Access to financial services in sparsely through customisation of outlets FS13 and/or the offer populated or economically weaker areas Recruitment and employment relationships, i.e. lawfulness of employment, legal form of New employee hires and employee 3. employment, including e.g. the 2.5 401-1 turnover issue of the so-called junk contracts and lack of discrimination in employment Working conditions and social Benefits provided to full-time employees protection, meaning ensuring that are not provided to temporary or part401-2 decent working conditions with time employees respect to remuneration, working hours, rest periods after the week of Parental leave 401-3 4. 2.53 work, public holidays, pregnancy Programs for upgrading employee skills and maternity protection and the 404-2 and transition assistance programs possibility of reconciling work with Percentage of employees receiving regular family obligations, support in performance and career development 404-3 difficult situations reviews Social dialogue, i.e. a dialogue between employees and the 5. employer through the agency of 1.98 This topic was not selected as crucial for this report trade unions and, e.g. satisfaction studies, etc. Hazard identification, risk assessment, and 6.

In 2018, two organised parts of the undertaking of mCentrum Operacji were separated. One of those was sold to Digital Teammates S.A. (DTM), whose majority shareholder is the Future Tech FIZ fund (established as part of the mAccelerator project). The remaining operations, so far pursued within mCO, were integrated into mBank. In December 2019 the liquidation of mCentrum Operacji Sp. z o.o. (mCO) was completed, which resulted in the subsidiary’s deletion from the National Register of Enterprises (KRS).
