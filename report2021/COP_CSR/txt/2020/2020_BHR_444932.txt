Sustainability and Social Repsonsibuility Report 2019 53 This project was not offered in all schools due to logistical hurdles and insufficient knowledge of the curriculum. Al Baraka Türk’s Add Value for the Future Project has targeted regional schools facing hardships in terms of equal access to opportunities. Under this initiative, various meetups with the themes of mind games, innovation and effective learning were designed. At the selected schools, Mind and Intelligence Games laboratories were composed of 105 built pieces. Consultant teachers were provided with starter trainings on the initiative and games. Furthermore, a booklet was prepared for teachers’ review during the relevant academic year. Meanwhile, digital guidance was provided to students and teachers alike on Al Baraka Türk’s YouTube channel where the rules and techniques of the games were described. Assuming that teachers will continue in these courses, the Bank expects the beneficiaries of the initiative to climb in the coming years. Book Supports: Al Baraka Türk provided library support to 15 elementary schools and high schools. Technology Classrooms: Al Baraka Türk set up technology, computer and robotic coding classrooms at three schools to give young generations access to instruction in digital transformation. 54 Al Baraka Banking Group B.S.C.

Sustainability and Social Repsonsibuility Report 2019 METHODOLOGY Sustainability and Social Responsibility is an integral part of Al Baraka’s Vision and its business model, and it means to be relevant in the prosperity of the communities in which we operate. 1 By this report, we seek to update Al Baraka Banking Group’s stakeholders about our commitment, dedication and contribution towards Sustainability and Social Responsibility . It is our endeavor to implement sustainability and social responsibility through various Al Baraka Sustainability and Social Responsibility Programs (these Programs are explained in detail in this Report). By way of the process, we send questionnaires to our banking subsidiaries along with well-developed guidelines in order to facilitate accurate data collection. We receive both qualitative and quantitative data from the subsidiaries. While with the quantitative data we present information in relation to the amounts spent on various Programs, the qualitative data focuses on the benefits of these Programs. We conduct basic data checks and seek clarifications as appropriate prior to analysis. In order to enable detailed interpretation of the responses, we conduct explanation sessions with the respondents concerned via emails, audio and video conferencing. 1 We measure our impact on the real economy and the communities based on different considerations. Quantitative information includes: education financing and donation, affordable housing project financing and donation, vocational training, arts, culture and literature sponsorship, promotion and development of scholarly works in Islamic law, banking and finance, youth engagement and sports, environmental and sustainable energy related investments, sponsorship for individuals with special-need, economically challenged communities sponsorship, Qard Hasan, industry & mining financing, construction financing, consumer financing, government financing, technology, media and telecommunications financing, general trade financing, agriculture, fishing and forestry financing, transportation service financing, tourism, hotels and restaurants financing, public service facilities financing, scientific and professional equipment financing, transportation equipment financing, machines, equipment and electric accessories financing, basic metal productions financing, lime and cement financing, glass-related and glass products financing, pottery and ceramics financing, plastic productions financing, rubber productions financing, petroleum refining financing, industrial chemicals financing, paper and paper productions financing, clothing financing (ready-made or otherwise), commercial real estate financing, furniture and wood productions financing, shoes productions financing, services financing, weaving and spinning financing, and export and import financing. Quantitatively, we collect a separate set of information on many of the above economic sectors to measure our contribution. In addition, we receive quantitative and qualitative data on our Al Baraka (SDG) Goals including the number of new jobs created, total amount funded and financed to education, healthcare sectors, renewable energy projects and energy efficiency.
