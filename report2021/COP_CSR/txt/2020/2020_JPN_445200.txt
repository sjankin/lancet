Meanwhile, overseas, sales volumes increased in China, prompted by the tightening of environmental regulations, and in Thailand, but lower raw material prices led to a drop in sales prices and net sales revenue was down. In construction resin products, the exterior and interior finishing coat, JOLYPATE, improved over last year, but floor coating materials for factories and warehouses and repair/reinforcing materials for civil works were sluggish, resulting in an overall decline in sales over the previous year. In the Specialty & Performance Materials Business, in which we are focusing our efforts to make inroads into the non-construction sector, UV-curable resins for electronic materials and silicone products performed well in Japan, but Acrylic emulsion and water-based compounds products for coating and textile applications and polymer beads for industrial applications were sluggish, resulting in a decline over the previous year. Overseas, on the other hand, due to the review of low-profit trades by Evermore Chemical Industry, which has been included in consolidated results since the previous year, and falling sales prices due to lower raw material prices, net sales were down over the previous year, but a focus on business with higher profit margins led to a major increase in profit. These results brought about net sales of 103,945 million yen (-4.7% year-on-year). Operating profit (before deduction of unallocated operating expenses) was 8,123 million yen (+9.1% year-on-year). 25 AICA Group CSR Report 2020 Adhesives Expanding overseas business and creating investment effectiveness The AAPH*1 Group accounts for about half of the Chemical Products Business’s net sales.

We are optimizing our portfolio and forging ahead with the goal of achieving 30 billion yen in overseas sales in the Construction Materials Business in the year ending March 2027. We will also expand our range of functional, high value-added products and address a variety of challenges for adapting to a drastically changing society, climate, and environment. One example of this is the Virutect Series of antiviral construction materials that offer “new lifestyle spaces for the new normal.” Yukihiro Iwase AICA’s Vision Director and Senior Managing Executive Officer/Head of the Building & Housing Materials Company Trends in Business Performance ■ Net Sales (billion yen) ■ Operating profit (billion yen) ■ Sales performance by product category 82.3 87.5 16.1 Fittings & Interior Housing Materials 80.8 15.6 15.8 Hihg pressure 76.7 14.4 Foundations of AICA 72.7 Counter/ laminate (HPL) 12.8 Postform 6.1% 22.3% 19.4% FY2019 87.5 billion yen 15.0% 13.2% 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 (FY) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 (FY) Boards, Average annual growth 4.7% Average annual growth 5.4% 24.0% films, etc. Noncombustible CERARL building materials Net Operating FY2020 Targets Sales 85.1 billion yen profit 12.3 billion yen FY2019 Results Sales of high pressure laminate (HPL) in Japan were down year-on-year due to the decline in the area of new building starts in the non-residential sector, but overseas sales were up due to an increase in sales volumes in India and Indonesia. Further, thanks to the contribution of Sois Mendinni Industrial Technology (Shanghai) Co.,Ltd., the Chinese company whose results have been included in our consolidated results from the second quarter of the consolidated accounting period, which enabled us to increase overall sales for the year. In boards and films, our general-purpose decorative polyester plywood boards struggled, resulting in a year-on-year decline. Our melamine noncombustible decorative panel CERARL has steadily captured demand for residential kitchen panel applications, educational facilities, medical and welfare facilities, shops, offices, public facilities, and the like. There has also been increased adoption of CERARL Deodorization Type and CERARL Virutect, a melamine noncombustible decorative panel with embedded antiviral agent, resulting in an increase in sales over the previous year. In noncombustible building materials, thanks to the synergy with AICA-TECH Kenzai Co., Ltd., LUNALIGHT, our decorative acrylic calcium silicate panels, and MACE, our extruded cement panels, are capturing demand in sports facilities, educational facilities, factories and warehouses, hotels, and retail facilities, enabling us to increase sales in this category. In the counter/postform product category, handwashing basin countertops for small children made with our artificial marble, CORIAN, has captured thriving demand in the new construction and renovation of childcare facilities, and our premium engineered stone, Fiore Stone, has also captured demand in kitchens and vanity countertops, resulting in an increase in sales. In fittings and interior housing materials, our U.D. (Universal Design) Comfort Series of functional fittings for medical and welfare facilities performed well, but our range of residential fittings slumped due to a harsh market environment, resulting in a year-on-year decline. These results brought about net sales of 87,555 million yen (+6.4% year-on-year). Operating profit (before deduction of unallocated operating expenses) was 15,874 million yen (-1.8% year-on-year). 27 AICA Group CSR Report 2020 Domestic market Focus on on-site construction products, centered on AS* products ■ Antivirus construction materials ■ Easier construction products ■ Break into new markets About AICA New viruses are being discovered all the The Japanese construction market is facing We will concentrate our efforts on expanding time.

These groups discuss and implement specific action plans, using QC methods and other scientific approaches, to consider ways of achieving operational improvements and implement division policies. These activities have a long history, with their predecessor, the ZD Campaign, starting in 1965 with the objective of raising productivity. The initial aim of that campaign was to achieve “zero mistakes” in the work through careful attention and innovative efforts by individual employees. From 1979, the C&C Campaign was rolled out, taking the initials of the present Corporate principle, Challenge & Creation. The campaign took on a broader meaning to include “promoting initiatives for the achievement of management goals,” which has been passed down to today’s C&C activities. 29 AICA Group CSR Report 2020 QEO Management System About AICA This is a management system that operates with a trinity of quality (Q: ISO 9001), environment (E: ISO 14001) and occupational health and safety (O: ISO 45001).

Ogura: I believe that it is its technological strengths, evidenced Katagiri: I think its speedy technological development capabilby the high regard with which the company is held within the ities are a major strength. R&D is carried out in a position close industry. Its mainstay product, high pressure laminate (HPL), to the users, and its product development takes careful account which has captured a large market share, came about because of the needs of society. Launching a product on the market is of the core technologies it had cultivated in its many years of not the end, and its ability to keep improving its products is developing adhesives. Those technological strengths have another strength. It also provides a stable supply of high-quality since given rise to second and third hit products. Another of products, which has allowed it to build relationships of trust with AICA’s major strengths is the robustness of its financial position end users. When I became an Auditor two years ago, I was in maintaining a high capital adequacy rate and self-financing struck by how my impression of the company from the outside its M&As. differed very little from what it was really like. Q What is your view of the Board of Directors? Ogura: The Representative Director, who serves as Chair, does obtain approval, and the individual Directors giving that approvnot give his own opinion at first, but instead listens carefully al actively express their opinions, the Board has the potential to the opinions of the other Directors before final decisions are to become a place for human resources development that will made, which I think is an excellent, honorable way of running the foster the next generation of executives.

However, I do find that, with many of the motions on the also serve concurrently as executive officers and are each reagenda, while they are very detailed and easy to understand, sponsible for their respective business divisions, but I would like it is difficult to discern the proponents’ intentions. If the propoto see them express their opinions more on motions proposed nents approach the Board of Directors with a determination to by divisions other than their own.

However, as Mr. Ogura just menand authority to express their opinions, I believe it will help to tioned, the Board of Directors should be used as a place for hustrengthen the company’s governance. From my own position man resources development. First, I would like the proponents as an external director, I personally want to make proposals that to approach their presentations with inspiring materials that will lead to AICA’s sustainable development and growth. clearly outline the background and objectives of their motions. If they do that, their arguments will become much clearer, and it Katagiri: Agenda items are submitted in an appropriate and will enrich the discussion among the Board. It would be better timely manner and there is no sense that important matters are if, when the directors with responsibility for the proponents have AICA’s Vision being progressed without us knowing about them, so I believe them prepare their presentation materials, they do so with the that the Board is functioning adequately. The meetings do not sense that they are nurturing their own successors. Q What do you think is the role of the Governance Committee? Ogura: I do not see any problems with the current structure when such as entrusting the authority for business execution to the viewed against the five principles of the Governance Code. President and Executive Officers, strengthening the examination Foundations of AICA However, to improve the supervisory functions of the Board of and approval authority for business execution of the Management Directors, I do believe there is a need to pursue reforms aimed at Meeting, and having the Board of Directors dedicated to the exthe separation of business execution and supervision.

From the pothe structure could be improved by reforming the operations of sition of the Governance Committee, I hope that we can give the Management Meeting and the Board of Directors a little more, advice that will lead to the development of that kind of structure. Q What do you think is the role of the Audit and Supervisory Committee? Katagiri: From the position of Auditors, we are required to check Committee’s relationship with the Board of Directors and speak legality and crisis management. Assessments of future impact up in ways that will raise corporate value, thus helping to benefit tend to be somewhat generous when performed from the inside, shareholders. I also believe that it is the role of the Audit and so I have stated my opinion that measures should be put in place Supervisory Committee to supervise and guide the company to promptly from the assumption of worst-case scenarios. maintain highly transparent management that discloses informaOn June 23, 2020, we will transition to an Audit and Supervisory tion accurately in both good times and bad times.

Q What are your expectations of AICA going forward? Ogura: The Japanese construction market, which is AICA’s marecent years, however, growth of that business in Japan has jor field of business, is clearly shrinking, so to ensure profitability, been sluggish. Losing those foundations would be a major loss the company will absolutely need to increase the percentage for the company, so I hope that it will concentrate its efforts on of its sales in overseas markets. In recent years, the Chemical rebuilding them. Products Business has been leveraging M&As to make steady Katagiri: I have great expectations for the future development inroads into overseas markets, but the Chemical Products of its overseas business, and I believe that AICA also has a role Business has a lower earning capacity than the Construction to play in the development of the Asian region. I look forward Materials Business. The key going forward will be how well greatly to its development of products that take advantage of AICA can pursue overseas expansion in its more profitable the infinite potential of the power of chemistry. I also have hopes Construction Materials Business. It is gradually developing a for the further evolution of AS Products that solve social issues, platform through the commissioning of new plants and the acsuch as AICA Virutect, the high pressure laminate (HPL) with tive use of M&As, so the challenge will be how well it can get embedded antiviral agents that was launched last year. I hope the business on track. This is where my expectations lie. AICA’s AICA will place further efforts into activities aimed at the SDGs core technologies are in the Chemical Products Business. In and that it will pursue them with more concrete targets. This article is based on an interview conducted on June 5, 2020.
