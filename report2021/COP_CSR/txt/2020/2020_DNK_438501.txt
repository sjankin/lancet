UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 1 March 2020 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 1. INTRODUCTION Global Evolution is a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact, a strategic policy initiative for businesses committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten principles in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. The sections below substantiate our: continued support over several years now to the UN Global Compact; • the practical actions to implement the Global Compact principles; • our measurements of outcomes; • as well as how we are communicating and engaging with stakeholders on progress. Positive sustainability screening: Global Evolution has a strategic commitment to impact investment and ESG sustainability as an integrated part of our approach to investment. In terms of our ESG integration approach, we have incorporated ESG dynamics across our investment process through various proprietary quantitative econometric models. Negative sustainability screening: For the full universe of emerging and frontier market countries, we construct proprietary ESG ratings, SDG ratings, ESG-adjusted credit ratings, as well as statistical valuation signals for sovereign credit spreads and currencies based on ESG dynamics. We were early movers with ESG sovereign research and integration of sustainability into sovereign investment process. We continue to play an active role in the public domain through our ESG research agenda and our close collaboration with the World Bank, the UN, and other relevant stakeholders such as the world’s largest pensions funds. 2. CONTINUED SUPPORT TO UN GLOBAL COMPACT Global Evolution is pleased to reaffirm our continued support for [ the UN Global Compact, and we hereby renew our ongoing G commitment to the initiative and its ten principles in the areas of r Human Rights, Labor, Environment, and Anti-Corruption. a b y o u r r e Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com a d UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2 March 2020 3. SUSTAINABILITY RATIONALE Financing the debt that provides macroeconomic sustainability and is spent promoting productivity and raising infrastructure, such as electricity production, health, water, security, transport, and school systems, has a significant impact on reducing poverty levels. Consequently, by not A strong, integrated, and active ESG approach has become a integrating ESG prerequisite for investment managers to operate in today’s dynamics into market, but certainly also an important selection criterion for investment decisions, many institutional investors. At Global Evolution, we have investors would conducted extensive and ground-breaking research into the sacrifice essential relationship between sovereign debt investing and information Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) indicators. There is a clear correlation between the sovereign funding costs and ESG dynamics, with governance and human capital accumulation (under the “S” in ESG), unsurprisingly, the most prevalent. Consequently, by not integrating ESG dynamics into investment decisions, investors would sacrifice essential information. At Global Evolution we therefore recognize the importance of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) considerations for investors and advisors globally and continue to help our investors achieve their individual ESG goals. Global Evolution is an active signatory of UN Principles for Responsible Investment1 and UN Global Compact and continuously publishes research on the relevant subjects of ESG dynamics and investment process integration. In 2018-2019, Global Evolution chaired the UNPRI Advisory Committee on Credit Ratings (ACCR) which actively takes ESG factors into account. 4. PRACTICAL ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES Global Evolution has a strategic commitment to SRI and ESG Sustainability as an integrated part of our approach to investment. Practical actions and concrete processes over the last year to address ESG sustainability in our investment management approach include the following: a. AI driven G index SENTIMENT DRIVES MARKETS; NOW WE CAN MEASURE IT! It is well known that prices of bonds and currencies trade to a high extent on sentiment and political risk. Perception and animal spirits of market actors drive a major part of asset price volatility; as Robert Shiller has taught us with Narrative Economics.2 Historically, market sentiment and political risk have been extremely difficult to observe and quantify, so 1 https://www.unpri.org/signatories; https://www.unglobalcompact.org/participation 2 https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2013/shiller/lecture/ Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 3 March 2020 information for one of the most important factors we every day consider as a central part of our investment process has not been available in a condensed and quantified format. A computer can now help us with this Instead of hiring hundreds of analysts we can get a (strong) computer to read a news related to political risk and assess whether the news is positively or negatively biased. It can even dive into news databases and read news published every day, every year back in time. And, thus, provide us with highfrequent indices (time series) of how political risk has been biased over time. We use Natural Language Processing (NLP) in combination with machine-learning to assess whether sentiment is positively or negatively biased. This gives us an AI-driven sentiment indicator that we never had before! In the case of Brazil, 2.6 million news articles related to political risk was extracted back to year 2007, then read and scored by the computer in a matter of minutes, and a political risk index was estimated (difficult for any team of people to digest 500-1000 news articles per day, per country, and score the degree of political risk without getting tired). In addition to the intriguing nature of the political risk index itself, the correlation to bond prices and the exchange rate in Brazil is astonishing! More than two-thirds of the variation in the currency can be accounted for by political risk. 3 This is such a high correlation that most other financial or economic variables are less correlated. We have even found causal evidence that the political risk index seems to be a leading indicator (using Granger Causality econometrics; Transfer Entropy analysis).4 3 Proprietary evidence (econometric) for this is available for this upon request. 4 Proprietary evidence (econometric) for this is available for this upon request.

Note: left hand axis is a proprietary risk score from -1.5 to +1.5 where +1.5 is low political risk and -1.5 high political risk. Right hand axis shows Argentina-US dollar exchange rate. In the case of Argentina, we saw a massive sell off in the currency and bond prices in early August 2019 up to the primary elections. Few expected such a dramatic sell off. Unfortunately, our AI-driven political risk index was developed a few months after this event. The characteristic of the political risk index as a leading indicator of price movements is astonishing, as the figure illustrates. Notice the daily political risk index (dotted line; left axis) spiking about a month before the primaries, and again about a week before; clearly indicating that political risk was at extreme … our AI-driven levels. political risk index delivers a daily We can now “take the temperature” on sentiment, indicator for political and our AI-driven political risk index delivers a daily indicator for political risk in emerging market risk in emerging countries. Our valuation models suggested ahead of market countries the sell-off that bond prices were leaning to the cheap side, and so did the currency. Unfortunately, we did not at that time have this political risk indicator to integrate into our valuation models; we now integrate the political risk index, and when we back-test the models we observe more depreciated fair value levels; thus, indicating lower positioning or outright zero-weights in Argentina’s bonds at the time. We will now learn from these AI-driven political risk indices across countries in emerging markets and integrate these in our valuation models and our investment process.

SDG ratings A notable innovation of ours is the development of proprietary SDG ratings.5 These were developed throughout 2019 and launched internally and for our clients on January 1, 2020. Since we have Proprietary ESG ratings and Proprietary SDG ratings, we can assign these to all our public and segregated portfolios and their benchmarks to see how our portfolios are doing from an ESG/SDG (sustainability) perspective.

Figure 2 illustrates log-linearized data for the purpose of deriving the percentage change in creditworthiness when sustainability improves by 1%. Sustainability matters for development, for our clients, and for us! The world has embraced the importance of sustainability; and so has the asset management business. In fact, it has become a global mega-trend that makes complete sense from both an ethical and business perspective. But why? Rainbow-washing is a key concern! The extent of “green-washing” and “rainbowwashing”6 clouds the importance of sustainability in many areas. In our view, the discourse about SDGs and ESG is not addressed in an appropriate way by some because they basically use the SDGs and ESG in vain as dubious “marketing stunts” without genuinely taking it seriously in their investment process. There is one reason why sustainability is not taken sufficiently seriously in financial markets! Financial markets still do not comprehend and internalize the business case for integrating SDGs into investment decisions. Until they internalize the return5 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations (https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/) are estimated across the 17 goals with indicators for sovereign ESG developments provided by Maplecroft. The grouping of indicators under each of the 17 goals is proprietary but is available to our clients. 6 Green-washing refers to actions that people and companies take especially in climate-related areas that they would have done anyway with no regard to the climate, but to market their efforts in a pseudo-responsible way they portray themselves as taking climate-related issues into account even if such concerns were never part of their considerations. Similarly, for rainbow-washing which refers to the SDGs and the circular colorful representation of the 17 SDGs. Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 6 March 2020 generating potential, sustainability will not be taken sufficiently seriously, and sustainable development will not gain traction. This includes the importance of climate change mitigation, promotion of human rights, improvement of governance, and many other important sustainability concerns.7 The solution! We continuously communicate to stakeholders why integrating E, S, and G indicators makes sense to. Once widely understood and internalized, a sustainability revolution can gain traction. The figures above illustrate how SGDs drive creditworthiness in emerging markets countries and over time.8 The that SDGs are statistically significantly correlated with spreads with a coefficient for SDGs in its correlation with the spreads of -115 indicating that a one notch SDG Rating increase leads to 115bp spread compression; and a 1% improvement in SDGs improves creditworthiness by 2%: An improvement in creditworthiness implies lower borrowing cost and better debt sustainability metrics, and ultimately a better potential for development (see table below for raw data; source Global Evolution, Maplecroft, Bloomberg). Valuation model integration of SDGs is key! The enhanced potential for emerging market sovereign debt investment performance from integrating SDGs is clear from the analyses above. Our valuation models therefore in econometric detail operate with indicators for sustainability. This is the kind of “business case” for integrating SDGs in an investment process that financial market actors need to internalize for sustainability to gain traction and bring prosperity to the world and returns to our clients. 7 Data for such indicators can be found with Maplecroft, for example. (Maplecroft.com) 8 This strong finding is further enhanced by a panel regression approach to the correlation between SDG Ratings and creditworthiness as measured by hard currency (HC) sovereign bond yield spreads in emerging markets: A panel regression approach is developed for 64 countries regressed on SDG Ratings comprising a proprietary weighted average of ratings across the 17 SDGs with a time dimension covering quarterly data since 201Q1. See table 1 in the appendix for the regressions are illustrated in the figures where the p-values of the SDG ratings is statistically significant and less than 0.01 in both cases.

Engagement Global Evolution wishes to help lift people out of poverty. However, it can be difficult identifying opportunities through an environmental, social or governance (ESG) framework where poor countries almost always score poorly. Our approach to this dilemma is one of positive engagement, choosing the carrot rather than the stick: we think engagement is a more valuable approach than isolation. We can pursue engagement directly, via ongoing individual relationships with governments whose bonds we purchase, or indirectly, via the community of like-minded EM investors and international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. This section offers our philosophy on sovereign engagement and a couple of examples from our portfolio. Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 8 March 2020 Our goal: Positive engagement with poor countries As a company, Global Evolution wishes to do good. We are privileged to have significant investment capital at our disposal to help change the world for the better. We do this by lending money to governments in emerging market (EM) countries to build the physical and human infrastructure necessary to help lift millions of their citizens out of absolute poverty. Yet most poor countries score badly on environmental, social or governance (ESG) measures. Should they be screened out and denied investment just because they are poor? Generally, we strongly favor engagement with poor countries rather than isolation. Throughout history, isolating a country has often led to disappointing outcomes, bringing harm to that country’s citizens and creating greater tension with its neighbors. There are governments who appear to have so little regard for their citizens’ well-being that we choose not to work with them. But we believe most governments are worth engaging, to both improve their governance and encourage policies that are more environmentally sustainable and socially progressive. We want to help governments meet the basic needs of their poorest people. Using access to steer policy for the better We establish relationships with a government once we invest in its bonds. We have ongoing meetings with policymakers and wield some influence over policy in so far as we, along with the broader EM sovereign debt investor community, influence the price at which they raise debt. We understand our investor community responsibility which is why we are active members of the Emerging Market Investor Alliance (EMIA).9 The EMIA was created to help “institutional emerging market investors support good governance, promote sustainable development, and improve investment performance in the governments and companies in which they invest.” Global Evolution has a particular interest in one area of the EMIA’s work: data transparency, which is very valuable to evaluating ESG criteria. Prior to an EM sovereign primary issuance roadshow, the EMIA produces a list of ESG issues (including data transparency) that is distributed to investors. It helps policymakers understand the value our investment community places on these issues. We also participate in seminars connected to International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings at which investors, non-governmental organizations and other academic specialists engage with sovereign policymakers on ESG issues. 9 https://www.eminvestorsalliance.org/ Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 9 March 2020 Frontier local bond market specialists Another area of active engagement with poor country governments is the development of frontier local currency bond markets, which are hugely important to a nation’s broader economic development. They enable governments to mobilize non-tax savings, fund investment without the currency risk associated with hard currency borrowing and provide a key monetary policy transmission mechanism. Global Evolution is one of the very few investors willing to be first movers in embryonic local bond markets, and policymakers often wish to draw on our extensive experience in this arena. Examples of positive engagement Global Evolution’s positive engagement with governments can take a variety of forms. Following are four examples that demonstrate the many ways we work with countries to help bring about positive outcomes. 1) Georgia: Leveraging a broad advisory role In late January 2020, we met with Georgian policymakers in London promoting their local bond market. As the largest existing foreign holder of their local debt, we were invited to engage in very frank discussions about their plans for a primary dealership system (and the advantages of opening this to foreign banks), issuance sizes, benchmarking and tapping, pension system developments, tax treatment and the merits of using ClearStream or Euroclear. While this topic may seem unrelated to ESG, it is the type of engagement through which a relationship is built, allowing us to gain influence on other policy areas (e.g., ESG) as the government’s vested “advisor.” Engagement with Georgia has led to solid improvements in business indicators promoting economy and society-wide developments in the S and G areas. Our ESG and sustainable development goals (SDG) ratings for Georgia also indicate solid improvement over recent years (see Appendix). 2) Pakistan: Addressing capital-gains tax policy In 2019, we met on several occasions with Pakistan’s policymakers as they attempted to attract foreign investors into their local market. We discussed how the country’s capital-gains tax treatment made this almost impossible for foreign investors, and in early January 2020 the authorities simplified the country’s tax structure. This experience is helping us form a long-standing and trusting relationship with the government so that we may gain future opportunities to influence and promote ESG policy. Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 10 March 2020 3) Zimbabwe: Promoting prudent governance Zimbabwe’s Mugabe government borrowed heavily in the 1980s and 1990s to deliver the best healthcare and education system in Africa. While it helped drive very strong social indicators, the nation’s debt became unsustainable and fostered 20 years of crisis economic management from which Zimbabwe is still trying to emerge. Finding appropriate economic policy to deliver longer-term sustainable growth is what most policymakers and investors are looking for, and frank and open dialogue on how to achieve this is helpful. This is a case where our direct engagement (visiting the country in March 2019) to promote prudent governance has still not been fruitful and our efforts must continue. Our ESG data on Zimbabwe is completely flat on several governance indicators but is strongly improving on human rights, freedom of speech and association, and the degree of democracy. Our ESG and SDG ratings are improving. However, continued engagement is required to promote and sustain the progress achieved so far. 4) Uzbekistan: Encouraging broad-based reform After the death of long-term President Karimov in 2016, Uzbekistan has focused on transforming the state-dominated economy into one that is more open, liberal and market-friendly. Our due-diligence trip there in April 2019 helped us see that the reform progress has been very successful and could propel the country into an investment-grade sovereign rating within five to seven years. It is breathtaking how quickly the new president has turned the country into a laboratory of change focused on economic liberalization, greater openness and increased entrepreneurship. The wide-ranging institutional, economic and social reforms are being guided by President Mirziyoyev’s development strategy for 2017-2021, with the aim of improving governance, rule of law and the business environment. Our engagement with country authorities likely influenced reform and we aim to continue engaging and promoting the importance of broad-based socioeconomic developments, with inclusive growth and prudent incentives at the government level. d. Engagement on the ground Furthermore, through 20-25 country missions annually, we conduct extensive on-theground dialogue with policy makers discussing strategies to optimize their funding strategies to promote swift and sustainable economic development. This is partly related to our “direct engagement” with policy makers in the countries in which we invest. We furthermore participated in the World Bank/IMF Spring Meetings in April 2018 with several members of our investment team. This is partly related to our “indirect engagement” with policy makers in the countries in which we invest. Global Evolution ● marketing@globalevolution.com● www.globalevolution.com UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 11 March 2020 e. ESG dissemination and conference participation Ole Jorgensen, Research Director, speaks at a number of conferences regarding integrating ESG into the investment process. Notably, in the USA, Asia, and Latin America during 2019. He spoke at several other international conferences (internal and external) with institutional clients mainly in Europe. 5. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Our ambition includes the development and incorporation into our investment process of proprietary ESG models, as well as instigating a complementary ESG Research Program to inform the investment process and ensure that best practices from investment cases will be extracted for ongoing screening and research purposes. These qualitative targets have successfully been met within the timeframe we had defined in the context of our ESG Research Program which continuously incorporates lessons from market trends and developments. Our proprietary Valuation and Rating Framework which incorporates ESG dynamics is interdependently linked to the ESG Research Program to continuously enhance the screening and investment process. The models and its output for investment decisions are proprietary in nature. Furthermore, in terms of our research on the causality between sovereign bond yields and ESG ratings, countries with higher ESG ratings perform dynamically better in terms of return on investment. This testifies to the important issue that funds incorporating ESG analysis in their investment decision making are likely to outperform traditional funds over time. 6. COMMUNICATING AND ENGAGING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS Our corporate communication is both internal to employees and board members as well as external to stakeholders such as clients and affiliated consultants as well as the media and other stakeholders. With our continued growth, we are increasingly aware of the role we play in the markets, economies and societies in which we practice. Our engagement with stakeholders on the ten principles and our proprietary approach to ESG modeling and country investment selection is consequently essential to our business operations. In client meetings, we consistently stress the significance of our dedication to the Global Compact principles reflected in our choice of ESG factors in our proprietary modeling. In addition, we experience that the interaction with our clients is also cross-directional since clients increasingly display this focus and seek discussions on these important issues. Consequently, our ESG deliberations and careful analysis as part of the investment processes will play a central role in our screening and portfolio allocations going forward.
