The operating segments are: – France (Enterprise excluded); – Spain; – Poland, Belgium and Luxembourg and each Central European countries. The Europe aggregate combines the operating segments of this area; – Sonatel subgroup (gathering Sonatel entities in Senegal, Orange Mali, Orange Bissau, Orange in Guinea and Orange in Sierra Leone), the Côte d’Ivoire subgroup (including Orange Côte d’Ivoire entities, Orange in Burkina Faso and Orange in Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa and Middle East. The Africa and Middle East aggregate combines the operating segments of this area; – Enterprise; – the activities of International Carriers & Shared Services (IC&SS), which contain certain resources, mainly in the areas of networks, information systems, research and development and other shared Group activities, as well as the Orange brand; – Orange Bank. The use of shared resources, mainly provided by IC&SS, is taken into account in segment results based either on the terms of contractual agreements between legal entities, external benchmarks or by allocating costs among all the segments. The supply of shared resources is included in other revenues of the service provider, and the use of the resources is included in expenses of the service user. The cost of shared resources may be affected by changes in contractual relationships or organization and may therefore impact the segment results disclosed from one year to another. Changes in operating performance indicators used in 2019 The Group applies the new standard IFRS 16 “Leases” prospectively from January 1, 2019. The standard evolution has led the Group to change the key operating performance indicators used in 2019. EBITDAaL (for “EBITDA after Leases”) and eCapex (for “economic CAPEX”) are the new indicators used by Group’s management. Adjusted EBITDA, reported EBITDA and CAPEX remain the performance indicators used before 2019. The new operating performance indicators are used by the Group: – to manage and assess its operating and segment results; and – to implement its investment and resource allocation strategy. The Group’s management believes that the presentation of these indicators is relevant as it provides readers with the same management indicators as those used internally. EBITDAaL corresponds to operating income before depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, effects resulting from business combinations, reclassification of cumulative translation adjustment from liquidated entities, impairment of goodwill and fixed assets, share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures, and after interests on debts related to financed assets and on lease liabilities, adjusted for: – significant litigation; – specific labor expenses; Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 157 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements – fixed assets, investments, and businesses portfolio review; – restructuring program costs; – acquisition and integration costs; – and, where appropriate, other specific elements. The measurement indicator allows for the effects of certain specific factors to be isolated, irrespective of their recurrence and the type of income and expense, when they are linked to: – significant litigation: Significant litigation expenses correspond to risk reassessments regarding various litigations. Associated procedures are based on third-party decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and occurring over a different period to the activities at the source of the litigation. By their very nature, costs are difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period. – specific labor expenses: Regardless of the departure plans included under restructuring costs, certain changes in the working hours of employees may have a negative impact on the period during which they are agreed and implemented. This primarily relates to the change in assumptions and the aging effect for the various part-time for seniors plans (TPS) in France. – fixed assets, investments and businesses portfolio review: The Group constantly reviews its fixed assets, investments and businesses portfolio: as part of this review, decisions to dispose of or to sell assets are implemented, which by their very nature have an impact on the period during which it takes place. Since January 1, 2019 the Group includes the gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets (see Note 8.1) under the “review of fixed assets, investments and businesses portfolio”. – restructuring programs costs: The adjustment of Group activities in line with changes in the business environment may also incur other types of transformation costs. They include restructuring costs (see Note 5.3) and depreciation of right-of-use assets (see Note 9.2). These actions may have a negative effect on the period during which they are announced and implemented. For illustrative purposes, and not limited to, this could include some of the transformation plans approved by the internal governance bodies. – acquisition and integration costs: The Group also incurs costs which are directly linked to the acquisition and integration of entities. These are primarily legal and advisory fees, registration fees and earn-outs. – where applicable, other specific elements that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses. EBITDAaL is not a financial aggregate as defined by IFRS and is not comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income or cash flow provided by operating activities. eCapex relate to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding telecommunications licenses and financed assets minus the price of disposal of fixed assets. They are used internally as an indicator to allocate resources. eCapex are not a financial aggregate defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. The Group uses organic cash flow from telecom activities as an operating performance measure for telecom activities as a whole. Organic cash flow from telecom activities corresponds to net cash provided by operating activities minus (i) lease liabilities repayments and debts related to financed assets repayments, (ii) purchases and sales of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets net of the change in fixed assets payables, (iii) excluding effect of telecommunications licenses paid and excluding effect of significant litigations paid (and received). Organic cash-flow from telecom activities is not a financial aggregate defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. Operating performance indicators used in 2018 Reported EBITDA corresponds to operating income before depreciation and amortization, effects resulting from business combinations, reclassification of cumulative translation adjustment from liquidated entities, impairment of goodwill and fixed assets and share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to reported EBITDA, adjusted for significant litigation, specific labor expenses, review of the investments and business portfolio, restructuring and integration costs and, where appropriate, other specific elements. This measurement indicator allows for the effects of certain specific factors to be isolated from reported EBITDA, irrespective of their recurrence and the type of income or expense, when they are linked to: – significant litigation: Significant litigation expenses correspond to risk reassessments regarding various litigations. Associated procedures are based on thirdparty decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and occurring over a different period to the activities at the source of the litigation. By their very nature, costs are difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period. 158 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements – specific labor expenses: Regardless of the departure plans included under restructuring costs, certain changes in the working hours of employees may have a negative impact on the period during which they are agreed and implemented. This primarily relates to the change in assumptions and the aging effect for the various part-time for seniors plans (TPS) in France. – investments and businesses portfolio review: The Group constantly reviews its investments and businesses portfolio: as part of this review, decisions to sell assets are implemented, which by their very nature have an impact on the period during which the sale takes place. The corresponding gains (losses) on disposal affect either reported EBITDA or the net income from discontinued operations. – restructuring and integration costs: The adjustment of Group activities in line with changes in the business environment may also incur other types of transformation costs. These actions may have a negative effect on the period during which they are announced and implemented. For illustrative purposes, and not limited to, this could include some of the transformation plans approved by the internal governance bodies. – where applicable, other specific elements that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and reported EBITDA are not financial aggregates as defined by IFRS and are not comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. They are provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income or cash flow provided by operating activities. 3 CAPEX relate to the acquisition of tangible and intangible assets excluding telecommunications licenses and investments financed through finance leases and are used internally as an indicator to allocate resources. CAPEX are not a financial aggregate defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly-titled indicators used by other companies. Assets and Liabilities Inter-segment assets and liabilities are reported in each operating segment. Non-allocated assets and liabilities for the telecommunications business, mainly include external financial debt, external cash and cash equivalents, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as equity. Financial debt and investments between these segments are presented as non-allocated elements.

Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 167 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements The residual goodwill mainly relates to workforce skills that cannot be 88.2% of the capital of Business & Decision (93.1% including the recognized separately. shares under reciprocal promises). The effect of the acquisition of Business & Decision on revenue in 2018 Changes in the scope of consolidation during 2017 amounts to 108 million euros. No significant change in consolidation scope occurred during 2017. On July 19, 2018, Orange acquired 6.4% of the capital of Business & Decision for 4 million euros. As of December 31, 2018, Orange holds Accounting policies Changes in the scope of consolidation Entities are fully consolidated if the Group has the following: – power over the investee; and – exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and – the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor’s returns. When assessing control, IFRS 10 requires judgment and continuous assessment. Clarifications of when the ownership interest does not imply a de facto presumption are provided in Note 19 which lists the main consolidated entities. Joint ventures and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence (generally corresponding to an ownership interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for using the equity method. When assessing the level of control or significant influence exercised over a subsidiary or associate, the existence and effect of any exercisable or convertible potential voting rights at the closing date is taken into account. Material intragroup transactions and balances are eliminated. Takeovers (business combinations) Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method: – the acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including all contingent consideration, at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are accounted for either through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income, in accordance with the applicable standards; – goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position. Considering the Group’s activity, the fair values of the identifiable assets relate mainly to licenses, to customer bases and to brands (which cannot be recognized as assets when internally developed), generating induced deferred taxes. The fair value of these assets, which cannot be observed, is established using commonly adopted methods, such as those based on revenues or costs (e.g.: the “Greenfield” method for the valuation of licenses, the “relief from royalty” method for the valuation of brands and the “excess earnings” method for customer bases). For each business combination with an ownership interest below 100%, non-controlling interest is measured: – either at its fair value: in which case, goodwill is recognized for the portion relating to non-controlling interests; – or proportionate to its share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets: in which case, goodwill is only recognized for the share acquired. Acquisition-related costs are directly recognized in operating income in the period in which they are incurred. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the acquisition date through operating income. The related other comprehensive income, if any, is fully reclassified to profit or loss. Internal transfer of consolidated shares IFRS do not address the accounting treatment for the transfer of consolidated shares within the Group resulting in changes in ownership interest. The Group applies the following accounting policy: – the transferred shares are carried at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is fully eliminated in the acquirer’s accounts; – the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share in the equity against Group retained earnings, with no impact on profit and loss and equity. 168 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements Assets held for sale The Group qualifies an asset or group of assets as “held for sale” when: – the management is committed to a plan to sell; – the asset is available for immediate sale in its current state (subject to any conditions precedent that are usual in such disposals); and – the sale is highly probable, within 12 months. Thus, when the Group is committed to a plan to sell involving the loss of control or significant influence over one of its assets, it classifies all assets and liabilities of the entities concerned under a separate line in the statement of financial position: “Assets/Liabilities held for sale”, at a value equal to the lower of the net carrying value and the fair value net of disposal costs. In addition, when the asset or group of assets held for sale represents a major line of business, its contribution to the income statement is presented separately (below “consolidated net income of continuing operations”); its cash flow contribution is presented in the statement of cash flows. Note 4 Sales 3 4.1 Revenue of equipment related to integration and information technology services and sales of equipment to external distributors and brokers, The presentation of revenue is disaggregated by category and segment presented in “Other revenue”; in the Note “Segment information” (see Note 1.1). Breakdown of revenues by source is as follows: – IT & integration services: IT & integration services revenue includes unified communication and collaboration services (LAN and – mobile services only: mobile services revenue is generated by telephony, consultancy, integration, project management), hosting incoming and outgoing calls (voice, SMS and data), excluding and infrastructure services (including Cloud Computing), applications convergent services (see below); services (customer relations management and other applications – fixed services only: revenue from fixed services includes fixed services), security services, video conferencing offers as well as broadband and narrowband services, excluding convergent services sales of equipment related to the above products and services; (see below) and fixed network business solutions, including voice – carrier services (Wholesale): roaming revenue from customers of and data; other networks (national and international), revenue from Mobile – convergence packages: these include revenue from convergence Virtual Network Operators (MVNO) and from network sharing, among packages for the Mass market (Internet + Mobile products); others; – equipment sales: all equipment sales (mobile phones, broadband – other revenue: equipment sales to external distributors and brokers. equipment, connected objects and accessories), excluding sales Accounting policies Most revenue falls within the application scope of IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”. Orange’s products and services are offered to customers under service contracts only and contracts combining the equipment used to access services and/or other service offers. Revenue is recognized net of VAT and other taxes collected on behalf of governments. Standalone service offers (mobile services only, fixed services only, convergent service) Orange proposes to Mass market and Corporate markets customers a range of fixed and mobile telephone services, fixed and mobile Internet access services and content offers (TV, video, media, added-value audio service, etc.). Some contracts are for a fixed term (generally 12 or 24 months), while others may be terminated at short notice (i.e. monthly arrangements or portions of services). Service revenue is recognized when the service is provided, based on use (e.g. minutes of traffic or bytes of data processed) or the period (e.g. monthly service costs). Under some content offers, Orange may act solely as an agent enabling the supply by a third-party of goods or services to the customer and not as a principal in the supply of the content. In such cases, revenue is recognized net of amounts transferred to the third-party. Contracts with customers generally do not include a material right, as the price invoiced for contracts and the services purchased and consumed by the customer beyond the specific scope (e.g. additional consumption, options, etc.) generally reflect their standalone selling prices. We have no significant impact related to contract modification for this type of contract. Service obligations transferred to the customer at the same pace are treated as a single obligation. When contracts include contractual clauses covering commercial discounts (initial discount on signature of the contract or conditional on attaining a consumption threshold) or free offers (e.g. three months of subscription free of charge), the Group defers these discounts or free offers over the enforceable period of the contract (period during which the Group and the customer have a firm commitment). Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 169 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements Where applicable, the consideration payable to the customer is recognized as a deduction from revenue in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of each contract. If the performance obligations are not classified as distinct, the offer revenue is recognized on a straight-line over the contract term. The initial service connection in the context of a service contract and communication offer, is a good example. It is not generally separable from the service contract and communication offer and is therefore recognized in income over the average term of the expected contractual relationship. Separate equipment sales Orange proposes to Mass market and Corporate market customers several ways to buy their equipment (primarily mobile phones): equipment sales may be separate from or bundled with a services offer. When separate from a services offer, the amount invoiced is recognized in revenue on delivery and receivable immediately or in instalments over a period of up to 24 months. Where payment is received in instalments, the offer comprises a financial component and interest is calculated and deducted from the amount invoiced and recognized over the payment period in net finance costs. Where Orange purchases and sells equipment to indirect channels, the Group generally considers that Orange maintains control until final resale to the end-customer (the distributor acts as an agent), even where ownership is transferred to the distributor. Sales proceeds are therefore recognized when the end-customer takes possession of the equipment (on activation). Bundled equipment and services offers Orange proposes numerous offers to its Mass market and Corporate market customers comprising equipment (e.g. a mobile terminal) and services (e.g. a communications contract). Equipment revenue is recognized separately if the two components are distinct (i.e. if the customer can receive the services separately). Where one of the components in the offer is not at its separate selling price, revenue is allocated to each component in proportion to their individual selling prices. This is notably the case in offers combining the sale of a mobile phone at a reduced price, where the individual selling price of the mobile phone is considered equal to its purchase cost and logistics expenses plus a commercial margin based on market practice. The amount allocated to equipment sales is recognized under revenue on delivery in exchange for an contract asset, spread over the term of the services contract. The provision of a Livebox® (Internet proprietary box) is neither a separate component of the Internet access service nor a lease, as Orange maintains control of the box. Services including a build and run phase Some Corporate market contracts include two phases: a build phase followed by the management of the IT platforms. Revenue recognition requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each contract in order to determine whether distinct performance obligations exist. Depending on the contract, the Group recognizes build phase revenue at completion if this phase is qualified as distinct. These contracts are generally multi-year, with scalable offers. On each contract modification, we assess the scope modification or its impact on the contract price in order to determine whether the amendment must be treated as a distinct contract, as if the existing contract were terminated and a new contract signed, or whether the amendment must be considered as a change to the existing contract. Service offers to carriers (wholesale) Three types of commercial agreements are entered into with Operator customers for domestic wholesale activities and International carrier offers: – pay-as-you-go model: contract generally applied to “legacy” regulated activities (bit stream call termination, local loop access, roaming and certain data solution contracts), where contract services are not covered by a firm volume commitment. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided (which corresponds to transfer of control) over the contractual term; – send-or-pay model: contract where the price, volume and term are defined. The customer has a commitment to pay the amount indicated in the contract irrespective of actual traffic consumed over the commitment period. This contract category notably includes certain MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator), IDD (International Direct Dialing) or hubbing (call free floating) contracts. Related revenue is recognized progressively based on actual traffic during the period, to reflect transfer of control to the customer; – mixed model: hybrid contract combining the “Pay-as-you-go” and “Send-or-pay” models, comprising a fixed entry fee providing access to preferential pricing conditions for a given volume (“Send or pay” component) and invoicing of traffic consumption (“Pay-as-you-go” component). The entry fee invoiced under this type of commercial agreement is recognized progressively in revenue based on actual traffic over the period. The amount invoiced for the entry fee included in this type of commercial agreement is recognized progressively in revenue based on actual traffic over the period. Agreements between major transit carriers are not billed (free peering) and therefore not recognized in revenue. 170 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements Service level commitment clause The contracts entered into by Group and its customers include service level agreements regarding the processing of orders, deliveries and after sales support (delivery time, performance, service reinstatement time). If the Group fails to comply with one of these commitments, then it pays compensation to the end-customer, which is usually a tariff reduction. The projected amount of these penalties is deducted from revenue in the event that it is likely that the commitment is not or will not be fulfilled Public-private service concession arrangements The Group rollsout and/or operates certain networks under service concessions, such as the public initiative networks implemented in France to roll-out optical fiber networks in less populated areas. Some contracts are analyzed in accordance with IFRIC 12, Service concession arrangements. When the Group builds a network, construction revenue is recognized in exchange for a right to receive consideration from either a public entity or users of the public service. This right is accounted for as: – an intangible asset, if the Group has a right to charge users of the public service. This asset is measured at the infrastructure fair value and amortized over the agreement period; – a financial receivable, if the Group has an unconditional right to receive payments from the public entity. This asset is measured at the infrastructure fair value and accounted for at amortized cost. Leases 3 Orange lease revenue concerns either its regulatory obligation to lease technical sites to competitors, the supply of equipment under certain contracts with Enterprise markets, or occasionally, one-off leases to third-parties of excess space in certain buildings. Lease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, except for certain equipment leases to Enterprise market customers classified as finance leases; in such cases the equipment is considered sold on credit. 4.2 Other operating income (in millions of euros) 2019 2018 2017 Net banking income 55 56 76 Tax credits and subsidies 33 42 40 Income from universal service 5 14 8 Brand & management fees (1) 2 6 14 Other income 625 462 475 Total 720 580 613 (1) Invoiced to certain uncontrolled entities.

(2) The change in IFRS 9 provision for 2019 amounts to (2) million euros (it amounted to (3) for 2018). 172 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements Accounting policies The trade receivables are mainly short-term with no stated interest rate and are measured at original invoice amount. Those receivables which include deferred payment terms over 12 or 24 months for the benefit of customers are discounted and classified as current items. Receivables from financial lease offers on firms’ equipment are recognized as current operating receivables because they are acquired in the normal course of business. Impairment of trade receivables is based on three methods: – a collective statistical method: this is based on historical losses and leads to a separate impairment rate for each aging balance category. This analysis is performed over a homogenous group of receivables with similar credit characteristics because they belong to a customer category (mass-market, small offices and home offices); – a stand-alone method: the assessment of impairment probability and its amount are based on a set of relevant qualitative factors (ageing of late payment, other balances with the counterpart, rating from independent agencies, geographical area). This method is used for carriers and operators (national and international), local, regional and national authorities and for large accounts of Enterprise Communication Services; – a provisioning method based on anticipated loss: IFRS 9 requires recognition of expected losses on receivables immediately upon recognition of the financial instruments. In addition to the pre-existing provisioning system, the Group applies a simplified approach of anticipated impairment at the time the asset is recognized. The percentage applied depends on the maximum revenue non-recoverability rate. 3 Impairment losses identified for a group of receivables represent the step preceding impairment identification for individual receivables. When information is available (clients in bankruptcy or subject to equivalent judicial proceedings), these receivables are then excluded from the statistical impairment database and individually impaired. The trade receivables may be part of securitization programs. When they are sold to consolidated special purpose entities, they are still recognized in the statement of financial position. Other sales to financial institutions may lead to their de-recognition where the risks and benefits are transferred as described by IFRS 9. 4.4 Customer contract net assets and liabilities (in millions of euros) December 31, December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Customer contract net assets (1) 771 784 815 Costs of obtaining a contract 258 233 250 Costs to fulfill a contract 181 149 139 Total customer contract net assets 1,209 1,166 1,204 Prepaid telephone cards (212) (221) (241) Connection fees (665) (706) (725) Loyalty programs (38) (38) (43) Other deferred revenue (2) (1,163) (1,025) (1,002) Other customer contract liabilities (15) (12) (10) Total deferred revenue related to customer contracts (2,093) (2,002) (2,021) Total customer contract net assets and liabilities (884) (836) (817) (1) Assets net of remaining performance obligations.

Trade receivables presented in the consolidated statement of financial position represent an unconditional right to receive consideration (primarily cash), i.e. the services and goods promised to the customer have been transferred. By contrast, contract assets mainly refer to amounts allocated per IFRS 15 as compensation for goods or services provided to customers for which the right to collect payment is subject to providing other services or goods under that same contract (or group of contracts). This is the case in a bundled offer combining the sale of a mobile phone and mobile communication services for a fixed-period, where the mobile phone is invoiced at a reduced price leading to the reallocation of a portion of amounts invoiced for telephone communication services to the supply of the mobile phone. The excess of the amount allocated to the mobile phone over the price invoiced is recognized as a contract asset and transferred to trade receivables as the service is invoiced. Contract assets, like trade receivables, are subject to impairment for credit risk. The recoverability of contract assets is also verified, especially to cover the risk of impairment should the contract be interrupted. Recoverability may also be impacted by a change in the legal environment governing offers. Contract liabilities represent amounts paid by customers to Orange before receiving the goods and/or services promised in the contract. This is typically the case for advances received from customers or amounts invoiced and paid for goods or services not transferred yet, such as contracts payable in advance or prepaid packages (previously recognized in deferred income). Customer contract assets and liabilities are presented, respectively, in current assets and current liabilities since they are a normal part of the Group’s operations.

Where the Group considers the commission incremental and believes that it would not have been paid in the absence of the contract, the commission cost is estimated and capitalized in the balance sheet. It should be noted that the Group has adopted the simplification measure authorized by IFRS 15 to recognize the costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when they are incurred if the amortization period of the asset, it would have recognized in respect of them, would not have exceeded a year. The costs of obtaining fixed-period mobile service contracts are capitalized and released to profit or loss on a straight-line over the enforceable contract term, as these costs are generally incurred each time the customer renews the fixed-period. The costs of obtaining fixed-period landline services for Mass market customers are expensed on a straight-line over the estimated period of the customer relationship. The costs of obtaining business and operator solutions contracts are not material. Costs to fulfill a contract Costs to fulfill a contract consist of all the initial contractual costs necessary to fulfill one or more performance obligations of a contract. These costs, when they qualify as non-distinct from the performance obligation, are capitalized and costs incurred are recorded on a time-apportioned basis over the effective period of the contract. 3 At Group level, these costs mainly concern contracts for Corporate customers, with, for example, design, installation, connection and migration fees that relate to a future performance obligation of the contract. The assumptions underlying the period over which the costs of fulfilling a contract are expensed are periodically reviewed and adjusted in line with observations; termination of the contractual relationship with the customer results in the immediate expensing of the remaining deferred costs. Where the carrying amount of deferred costs exceeds the remaining consideration expected to be received for the transfer of the related goods and services, less expected costs relating directly to the transfer of these goods and services still to be incurred, the excess amount is similarly immediately expensed. The cost of obtaining and fulfilling contracts impacted EBITDAaL in 2019 and adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and 2017. The following table presents the transaction price assigned to unfulfilled As allowed by the simplification procedure in IFRS 15, these disclosures performance obligations as of December 31, 2019. Unfulfilled are only related to performance obligations with an initial term greater performance obligations are the services that the Group is obliged to than one year. provide to customers during the remaining fixed term of the contract.

We have elected to apply certain available practical expedients when disclosing unfulfilled performance obligations, including the option to exclude expected revenues from unsatisfied obligations of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. These contracts are primarily monthly service contracts. In addition, certain contracts offer customers the ability to purchase additional services. These additional services are not included in the transaction price and are recognized when the customer exercises the option (generally on a monthly basis). They are not therefore included in unfulfilled performance obligations. Some multi-year service contracts with Corporate business customers and Operator customers include fixed monthly costs and variable user fees. These variable user fees are excluded from the table of unfulfilled performance obligations.

These receivables are offset by the liabilities of the same amount (see Note 5.7). Orange Money is a money transfer, payment and financial services solution provided via an electronic money (“e-money”) account linked to an Orange mobile number. Since 2016, the Orange group has become an Electronic Money Issuer (“EMI”) in some of the countries in which it operates, via dedicated, approved, internal subsidiaries. Regulations state that EMIs, as last-resort guarantors for the reimbursement of e-money holders, are obliged to restrict the funds collected in exchange for the issue of e-money (obligation to protect holders). The e-money distribution model relies on Orange’s subsidiaries and third-party distributors.

Within the Orange group, this restriction includes the protection of third-party holders (distributors and customers).

Payments related to some litigation are directly recorded in other operating expenses. The Group’s significant litigations are described in Note 17. Accounting policies Litigation In the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in a number of legal and arbitration proceedings and administrative actions described in Note 17. The costs which may result from these proceedings are accrued at the reporting date if the Group has a present obligation towards a third party resulting from a past event and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk. Where appropriate, litigation cases may be analyzed as contingent liabilities, which correspond to: – probable obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company’s control; or – present obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Integration costs Integration costs are incurred at the time of acquisition of legal entities (costs linked to the acquisition of the entity, consultancy fees, training costs for new staff, migration costs associated with customer offers, labor expenses associated with the transition).

They include those that have been financed by the supplier (with or without notification of transfer to financial institutions) under direct or reverse factoring, and those for which the supplier proposed an extended payment period to Orange and for which Orange confirmed the payment arrangement under the agreed terms. Orange considers these financial liabilities to carry the characteristics of trade payables, in particular due to the ongoing trade relationship, the payment schedules ultimately consistent with the operational cycle of a telecommunications operator in particular for the purchase of primary infrastructures, the supplier’s autonomy in the anticipated relationship and a financial cost borne by Orange that corresponds to the compensation of the supplier for the extended payment schedule agreed. For payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is negligible. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost. 5.7 Other liabilities (in millions of euros) December 31, December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2017 3 (1) Provision for litigation 643 572 779 Cable network access fees (IRU) (2) 103 152 194 Submarine cable consortium (3) 168 130 157 Security deposit received 147 160 182 Orange Money – units in circulation (3) 613 497 408 Other 774 739 738 Total 2,448 2,250 2,456 o/w other non-current liabilities 353 462 521 o/w other current liabilities 2,095 1,788 1,935 (1) See Note 5.2.

Its computation is based on external indices commonly used as reference for the Eurozone, – actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are fully recorded in other comprehensive income, – the Group’s defined benefit plans are generally not financed. In the rare cases where they are, hedging plan assets are set up by employer and employee contributions which are managed by separate legal entities whose investments are subject to fluctuations in the financial markets. These entities are generally administrated by joint committees comprising representatives of the Group and of the beneficiaries. Each committee adopts its own investment strategy which is designed to strike the optimum strategies to match assets and liabilities, based on specific studies performed by external experts. It is generally carried out by fund managers selected by the committees and depends on the market opportunities. Assets are measured at fair value, determined by reference to quoted prices, since they are mostly invested in listed securities (primarily shares and bonds) and the use of other asset categories is limited.

The other entities not listed above, with the exception of the Orange This analysis was carried out on each of the following criteria, taken brand presented in Note 8.3, each account for a less than 3% share one at a time: of the aggregated recoverable amount of the consolidated entities or do not have a recoverable amount close to net book value. – discount rate higher by 1%; – perpetual growth rate lower by 1%; – cash flow in final year lower by 10%. 192 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements Accounting policies Goodwill recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position comprises the excess calculated: – either on the basis of the equity interest acquired (and for business combinations after January 1, 2010, no subsequent changes for any additional purchases of non-controlling interests); or – on a 100% basis, leading to the recognition of goodwill relating to the non-controlling. Goodwill is not amortized. It is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired. Thus, the evolution of general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect to the decline of local economic environments, the changes in the market capitalization values of telecommunication companies, as well as actual economic performance compared to market expectations represent external indicators that are analyzed by the Group, together with internal performance indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year. These tests are performed at the level of each Cash Generating Unit (CGU) (or group of CGUs). These generally correspond to operating segments or to each country in Africa and the Middle East. This is reviewed if the Group changes the level at which it monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes. To determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to recoverable amount, for which Orange uses mostly the value in use. 3 Value in use is the present value of the expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and forecast trading and investment activity drawn up by the Group’s management, as follows: – cash flow projections are based on three to five-year business plans and include a tax cash flow calculated as EBIT (operating income) multiplied by the statutory tax rate (excluding deferred tax and unrecognized tax loss carry forward impacts at the date of valuation); In the case of recent acquisitions, longer term business plans may be used; – post-tax cash flow projections beyond that timeframe may be extrapolated by applying a declining or flat growth rate for the next year, and then by a growth rate to perpetuity reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market; – post-tax cash flows are subject to a post-tax discount rate, using rates which incorporate a relevant premium reflecting a risk assessment for the implementation of certain business plans or country risks. The value in use derived from these calculations is identical to the one that would derive from discounting pre-tax cash flows at pre-tax discount rates. The key operating assumptions used to determine the value in use are common across Group’s business segments. These assumptions include: – key revenue assumptions, which reflect market level, penetration rate of the offerings and market share, positioning of the competition’s offerings and their potential impact on market price levels and their transposition to the Group’s offerings bases, regulatory authority decisions on pricing of services to customers and on access and pricing of inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g. extinction of copper local loops), decisions of competition authorities in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors such as cable; – key cost assumptions, on the level of marketing expenses required to renew product lines and keep up with competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and committed employee departure plans; – key assumptions on the level of capital expenditure, which may be affected by the roll-out of new technologies, by decisions of regulatory authorities relating to licenses and spectrum allocation, deployment of fiber networks, mobile network coverage, sharing of network elements or obligations to open up networks to competitors. Tested net carrying values include goodwill, land, and assets with finite useful life (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and net working capital requirements including intragroup balances). The Orange brand, an asset with an indefinite useful life, is subject to a specific test, see Note 8.3. If an entity partially owned by the Group includes goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests, the impairment loss is allocated between the shareholders of Orange SA and the non-controlling interests on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated (i.e. ownership interest). Impairment loss for goodwill is recorded definitively in operating income.

The straight-line basis is usually applied. The useful lives are reviewed annually and are adjusted if current estimated useful lives differ from previous estimates. This may be the case for outlooks on the implementation of new technologies (for example, the replacement of copper local loop by optical fiber). These changes in accounting estimates are recognized prospectively. Main assets Depreciation period (average) Brands acquired Up to 15 years, except for the Orange brand with an indefinite useful life Customer bases acquired Expected life of the commercial relationship: 3 to 16 years Mobile network licenses Grant period from the date when the network is technically ready and the service can be marketed Indefeasible Rights of Use of submarine Shorter of the expected period of use and the contractual period, and terrestrial cables generally less than 20 years Patents 20 years maximum Software 5 years maximum 3 Development costs 3 to 5 years Buildings 10 to 30 years Transmission and other network equipment 5 to 10 years Copper cables, optical fiber and civil works 10 to 30 years Computer hardware 3 to 5 years 8.3 Impairment of fixed assets (in millions of euros) 2019 2018 2017 Egypt 89 (4) 2 Niger (43) (52) Democratic Republic of the Congo (119) Poland (12) 1 (1) Other (4) (2) (21) Total of impairment of fixed assets 73 (49) (190) The impairment of fixed assets resulting from the impairment tests on Cash-Generating Units (CGUs) are described in Note 7.1. Key assumptions and sensitivity of the recoverable amount of the Orange brand Key assumptions and sources of sensitivity used in the assessment of recoverable amount of the Orange brand are similar to those used for the goodwill of consolidated operations (see Note 7.3), which affect the sales base and potentially the level of brand fees. Other assumptions that affect the assessment of the recoverable amount are as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Basis of recoverable amount Value in use Value in use Value in use Source used Internal plan Internal plan Internal plan Methodology Discounted net fees Discounted net fees Discounted net fees Perpetuity growth rate 1.1% 1.2% 1.1% Post-tax discount rate 7.4% 7.4% 7.6% Pre-tax discount rate 8.8% 8.8% 8.9% The sensitivity analysis did not highlight any risk of impairment of the Orange brand. Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 195 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements Accounting policies Given the nature of its assets and businesses, most of the Group’s individual assets do not generate cash flow independent of the cash flows generated by Cash-Generating Units. The recoverable amount is therefore determined on the level of CGU (or CGU group) to which belong the assets, according to a method similar to the one for goodwill. The Orange brand has an indefinite useful life and is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. Its recoverable amount is assessed based on the expected contractual royalties (and included in the business plan) discounted in perpetuity, less the costs attributable to the brand’s owner. 8.4 Other intangible assets (in millions of euros) December 31, 2019 December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Gross Accumulated Accumulated Net book Net book Net book value depreciation impairment value value value and amortization Telecommunications licenses 11,435 (5,340) (51) 6,043 5,917 6,233 Software 12,833 (8,563) (21) 4,250 4,046 3,946 Orange brand 3,133 3,133 3,133 3,133 Other brands 1,117 (114) (915) 88 89 88 Customer bases 5,329 (4,720) (12) 597 449 555 Other intangible assets 2,230 (1,426) (179) 626 439 384 Total 36,078 (20,163) (1,178) 14,737 14,073 14,339 (in millions of euros) 2019 2018 2017 Net book value of other intangible assets – in the opening balance 14,073 14,339 14,602 Acquisitions of other intangible assets 2,385 1,895 1,893 o/w telecommunications licenses (1) 519 200 318 Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (2) 328 69 (13) Disposals (10) (0) (7) Depreciation and amortization (2,286) (2,256) (2,138) Impairment (3) 88 (10) (55) Translation adjustment 106 7 (74) Reclassifications and other items 52 29 131 Reclassifications to assets held for sale Net book value of other intangible assets – in the closing balance 14,737 14,073 14,339 (1) Relates in 2019 to licenses for 296 million euros in Spain, for 119 million euros in Burkina Faso and for 82 million euros in Guinea.

Intangible assets are initially recognized at acquisition or production cost. The payments indexed to revenue, especially for some telecommunications licenses, are expensed in the relevant periods.

They mainly comprise network facilities and equipment. The gross value of property, plants and equipment is made up of their acquisition or production cost, which includes study and construction fees as well as enhancement costs that increase the capacity of equipment and facilities. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset’s productivity or extend its useful life. The cost of property, plant and equipment also includes the estimated cost of dismantling, removing and restoring the site occupied due to the obligation incurred by the Group. The roll-out of assets by stage, especially for network assets, in the Group’s assessment, does not generally require a substantial period of preparation. As a result, the Group does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. In France, the regulatory framework governing the optical fiber network roll-out (Fiber To The Home – FTTH) organizes the access by commercial operators to the last mile of networks rolled-out by another operator on a co-funding basis (ab initio or a posteriori) or through a line access. The sharing of rights and obligations between the various operators co-financing the terminal section of networks is classified as a joint operation in accordance with IFRS 11 “Partnerships” : Orange only recognizes as an asset its share of the network assets self-built or purchased to other co-financing operators. The Group has entered into network sharing arrangements with other mobile operators on a reciprocal basis, which may cover passive infrastructure sharing, active equipment or even spectrum. Accordingly, in Poland, the arrangements with Deutsche Telekom have been qualified as a joint operation: the infrastructure and equipment of the access networks recognized as fixed assets are equivalent to the proportionate share of the Group in the assets installed by the Group or Deutsche Telekom, each in their geographical zone. As a reminder, before applying IFRS 16, the accounting principles related to the assets acquired in form of finance lease and in operating lease were the following: The assets acquired in form of finance lease did not affect the cash flow on acquisition. However, the subsequent rental payments during the leasing period represented interest payments (cash flow on operating activities) and capital repayments (cash flow on financing activities). The majority of the assets held under finance lease were office and network buildings. The land and buildings hosting radio sites could belong to the Group, or be held through a finance lease, or be available under an operating lease or be simply made available. The lease agreements of office buildings and points of sale generally were qualified as operating leases and the future lease payments were disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments. Simultaneously the equipment, very often generic, of which the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred from the Group to third parties via a lease, was considered as sold.

The payment terms can be over several years in the case of infrastructure roll-out and license acquisition. The payables due in more than 12 months are presented in non-current items. For payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is immaterial. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost. Trade payables also include those that the supplier may have sold with or without notifying financial institutions in a direct or reverse factoring arrangement (see Note 5.6). Firm purchase commitments are disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments (see Note 15), net of any prepayment, which are recognized as prepayment on fixed assets. 8.7 Dismantling provision The asset dismantling obligations mainly relate to restoration of mobile telephony antenna sites, dismantling of telephone poles, treatment of electrical and electronic equipment waste and dismantling of telephone booths.

When the obligation arises, a dismantlement asset is recognized in compensation for the dismantling provision. The provision is based on dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for telephone poles, terminals and telephone booths, and on a per-site basis for mobile antennas) incurred by the Group to meet its environmental commitments over the asset dismantling and site restoration planning. The provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of the commitment settlement. This estimate is revised annually and adjusted where appropriate against the asset to which it relates. The provision is present-discounted at a rate set by geographical area and equal to the average rate of risk-free investments in 15-year State bonds. In case of extinguishment of the obligation, the provision is reversed in compensation for the net carrying value of the dismantlement asset and of the net carrying value of the underlying assets if the dismantlement asset is less than the reversal of the provision. Note 9 Lease agreements In the course of its activities, the Group regularly enters into leases as – land and buildings; 3 a lessee. These leases concern the following asset categories: – networks and terminals; – iT equipment; – other. Accounting policies The main accounting positions related to the application of IFRS 16 norm as of January 1, 2019 are detailed in the dedicated transition note (see Note 2.3.1). The Group classifies as a lease, a contract that conveys to the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset for a given period, including a service contract if it contains a lease component. The Group has defined four major lease contract categories: – land and buildings: these contracts mainly concern commercial (point of sale) or service activity (offices and head office) leases, as well as leases of technical buildings not owned by the Group. Real estate leases entered into in France generally have long terms (9-year commercial leases with early termination options after 3 and 6 years, known as “3/6/9 leases”) (see Note 9.1). However, depending on the geographical location of the leases, the legal term may vary and the Group may be required to adopt a specific enforceable period taking into account the local legal environment; – networks and terminals: the Group is required to lease a certain number of assets in connection with its mobile activities. This is notably the case of lands to be used to install antennas, mobile sites leased to a third-party operator and certain “TowerCos” contracts (companies operating telecom towers). Leases are also entered into as part of fixed wireline access network activities. These leases mainly concern access to the local loop where Orange is a market challenger (total or partial unbundling), as well as the lease of land transmission cables; – IT equipment: this asset category primarily comprises leases of servers and hosting space in datacenters; – other: this asset category primarily comprises leases of vehicles and technical equipment. Leases are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position via an asset reflecting the right to use the leased assets and a liability reflecting the related lease obligations (see Notes 9.2 and 9.1). In the consolidated income statement, amortization and depreciation of the right-of-use asset (see Note 9.2) is presented separately from the interest expenses on the lease liability. In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash outflows relating to interests impact operating flows, while repayments of the lease liability impact financing flows. When the Group proceeds with a transaction qualified as sale and leaseback according to IFRS 16, a right-of-use asset is recognized in proportion of the accounting value of the asset retained as a result of the leaseback against a lease liability. A gain (or loss) on disposal of fixed assets is recognized in the income statement in proportion of the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The adjustment of the gain (or loss) on disposal recognized in the income statement for the share on which the Group retains its right to use the underlying asset corresponds to the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability recognized in the balance sheet. Finally, the Group applies the two exemptions proposed by IFRS 16, concerning leases with a term of 12 months or less and leases of underlying assets with a value when new of less than 5,000 euros approximately. Leases covered by either of these exemptions are presented in off-balance sheet commitments and an expense is recognized in “external purchases” in the consolidated income statement. Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 201 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements 9.1 Lease liabilities As of December 31, 2019, lease liabilities amount to 6,492 million euros, including non-current lease liabilities of 5,225 million euros and current lease liabilities of 1,267 million euros. The following table details the undiscounted future cash flows of lease liabilities: (in millions of euros) December 31, 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 and 2019 beyond Undiscounted lease liabilities 7,142 1,280 1,194 900 749 821 2,197 Accounting policies The Group recognizes a liability (i.e. a lease liability) at the date the underlying asset is made available. This lease liability is equal to the present value of fixed and in-substance fixed payments not paid at that date, plus any amounts that Orange is reasonably certain to pay at the end of the lease, such as the exercise price of a purchase option (where it is reasonably certain to be exercised), or penalties payable to the lessor for terminating the lease (where the termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised). The Group only takes into account the lease component of lease when measuring the lease liability. For certain asset classes where the lease includes service and lease components, the Group may recognize a single contract classified as a lease (i.e. without distinction between the service and lease component). Orange systematically determines the lease term as the period during which leases cannot be canceled, plus periods covered by any extension options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and by any termination options that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise. In the case of “3/6/9” leases in France, the term adopted is assessed on a contract by contract basis. This period is also defined taking into account any laws and practices specific to each jurisdiction and business sector regarding the firm lease commitment term granted by lessors. This is the case for open-ended leases, where Orange generally adopts the notice period as the enforceable period. The Group nonetheless assesses, based on the circumstances of each lease, the enforceable period taking account of certain indicators such as the existence of non-insignificant penalties in the event of termination by the lessee. The Group considers in particular the economic importance of the leased asset when determining this enforceable period. When non-removable leasehold improvements have been made to leased assets, the Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis, whether these improvements provide an economic benefit when determining the enforceable period of the lease. When a lease includes a purchase option, the enforceable term is equal to the useful life of the underlying asset where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the purchase option. For each contract, the Group applies a discount rate determined based on the government loan yield, specific to each contract, according to its currency, term and the lessee country, plus the Group’s credit spread. After the lease commencement date, the amount of the lease liability may be reassessed to reflect changes introduced in the following main cases: – a change in term resulting from a contract amendment or a change in assessment of the reasonable certainty that a renewal option will be exercised or a termination option will not be exercised; – a change in the amount of lease payments, for example following application of a new index or rate in the case of variable payments; – a change in assessment of whether a purchase option will be exercised; – any other contractual change, for example a change to the scope of the lease or the underlying asset. 9.2 Right-of-use assets (in millions of euros) December 31, 2019 January 1, 2019 Gross Accumulated Accumulated Net book Net book value depreciation impairment value value and amortization Land and buildings 6,071 (1,106) (176) 4,789 4,834 Networks and terminals 1,802 (494) 1,308 1,359 IT equipment 116 (87) (0) 29 33 Other right-of-use 198 (61) (0) 137 122 Total right-of-use assets 8,187 (1,748) (176) 6,263 6,347 202 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements (in millions of euros) December 31, 2019 Net book value of right-of-use assets – in the opening balance 6,347 (1) Increase (new right-of-use assets) 1,009 Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation 18 Depreciation and amortization (2) (1,239) Impairment (3) (33) Impact of changes in the assessments 169 Translation adjustment 21 Reclassifications and other items (28) Reclassifications to assets held for sale Net book value of right-of-use assets – in the closing balance 6,263 (1) Including 25 million euros related to sale and leaseback transactions.

Accounting policies A right-of use is recognized as an asset, with a corresponding lease liability (see Note 9.1). This right-of-use asset is equal to the amount of the lease liability, plus any direct costs incurred under certain leases such as fees, lease negotiation expenses or administration costs and less rent-free period liabilities and lessor financial contributions. Work performed by the lessee and modifications to the leased asset, as well as guarantee deposits, are not components of the right-of-use asset and are recognized in accordance with other standards. Finally, the right-of-use asset is depreciated in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term adopted by the Group.

In assets were recognized will expire beyond 2024. Accounting policies Current income tax and deferred tax are measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation. The Group calculates the tax assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities. Deferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for unused tax losses, using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when their recovery is considered probable. A deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures and associates, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied: – the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference (e.g. the payment of dividends); and – it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, for fully consolidated companies, a deferred tax liability is only recognized in the amount of the taxes payable on planned dividend distributions by the Group. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. At each period end, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets carried by certain tax entities with significant tax losses carry forwards. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is assessed in the light of the business plans used for impairment testing. This plan may be adjusted for any tax specificities. Deferred tax assets arising on these tax losses are not recognized under certain circumstances specific to each company/tax consolidation group concerned, and particularly where: – entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carry forwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to the horizon for forecasts based on business plans used for impairment testing and uncertainties as to the economic environment; – entities have not yet begun to use the tax loss carry forwards; – entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations; – it is estimated that tax losses are uncertain to be used due to risks of differing interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation.

If an associate incurs losses and the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero, the Group ceases to recognize the additional share of losses since it has no commitment beyond its investment. An impairment test is performed at least annually and when there is objective evidence of impairment, for instance a decrease in the quoted price when the investee is listed, significant financial difficulty of the entity, observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, or information about significant changes having an adverse effect on the entity.

Bonds, bank loans and loans from multilateral lending institutions Among financial liabilities, only the bond of 25 million euros maturing in 2020 and any commitments to redeem non-controlling interests are recognized at fair value in profit or loss. Borrowings are recognized upon origination at the discounted value of the sums to be paid and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are deducted from the liability’s carrying value. The costs are subsequently amortized over the life of the debt, using the effective interest rate method. 3 Some financial liabilities at amortized cost, mainly borrowings, are subject to hedging. This relates mostly to borrowings hedged against the exposure of their future cash flows to foreign exchange risk (cash flow hedge). 12.4 TDIRA appropriate prospectus, at Orange SA’s initiative based on a ratio of 583.261 shares to one TDIRA (i.e., conversion price of 24.175 euros), The perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (“TDIRAs”) with a par as the initial ratio of 300 shares to one TDIRA has been adjusted value of 14,100 euros are listed on Euronext Paris.

This relates to perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRA). On initial recognition, the liability component is measured at its market value, corresponding to the value of the contractually determined future cash flows discounted at the market rate applied at the date of issue to comparable instruments providing substantially the same conditions, but without the option to convert or redeem in shares. This liability component is subsequently recognized at amortized cost. The carrying amount of the equity component is determined at inception by deducting the fair value of the financial liability from the notional value of the instrument. This does not change throughout the life of the instrument.

These assets are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in net financial expenses. – Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI) Investment securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit/loss. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded in other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit/loss. Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 219 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements – Financial assets at amortized cost (AC) This category mainly includes loans and receivables. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is any objective evidence of impairment of these assets, the value of the asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when impairment tests demonstrate that the financial asset carrying amount is higher than its recoverable amount. For trade receivables, the provisioning system also covers expected losses. As a reminder, before the application of IFRS 9, the accounting policies related to financial assets were as follows: Assets available for sale The Group’s assets available for sale mainly consist of investment securities, which are not consolidated and not accounted for using the equity method, and marketable securities that do not fulfill the criteria for classification in any of the other categories of financial assets. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded as “Gains (losses) on assets available for sale” within other comprehensive income. When there is an objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale assets or a decrease in fair value by at least one-third or over 2 consecutive semesters, the cumulative impairment loss included in other comprehensive income is definitely reclassified from equity to profit or loss within net financial expenses. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group can designate at fair value at inception financial investments such as negotiable debt securities, deposits and mutual funds (UCITS), that are compliant with the Group’s risk management policy or investment strategy (see Note 13.3). They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in net financial expenses. Other financial assets This category mainly includes loans and receivables. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is any objective evidence of impairment of these assets, the value of the asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when impairment tests demonstrate that the financial asset carrying amount is higher than its recoverable amount. 12.8 Derivatives instruments 12.8.1 Market value of derivatives December 31, December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in millions of euros) Net Net Net Hedging derivatives 324 (162) (447) Cash flow hedge derivatives 328 (160) (447) Fair value hedge derivatives (4) (2) (0) Derivatives held for trading (1) (187) (298) (282) Net derivatives (2) 138 (460) (729) (1) Mainly due to the foreign exchange effects of the economic hedges against the revaluation of subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling (equity instruments recognized at their historical value – see Note 14.4) for (136) million euros in 2019, (246) million euros in 2018 and (203) million euros in 2017. (2) Of which foreign exchange effects of the cross currency swaps (classified as hedging or held for trading) hedging foreign exchange risk on gross debt notional for 822 million euros in 2019, 512 million euros in 2018 and 125 million euros in 2017. The foreign exchange effects of the cross currency swaps is the difference between the notional converted at the closing rate and its notional converted at the opening rate (or at the trading day spot rate in case of new instrument). The risks hedged by these derivative instruments are described in Note 13. These derivatives are associated with cash-collateral agreements, the effects of which are described in Note 13.5. 220 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements Accounting policies Derivative instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position and presented according to their maturity date, regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 (hedging instruments versus trading instruments). Derivatives are classified as a separate line item in the statement of financial position. Trading derivatives are non-qualified economic hedges. Changes in the value of these instruments are recognized directly in profit and loss. Hedge accounting is applicable when: – at the inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship; – the effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated at inception and it is expected to continue in subsequent periods: i.e. at inception and throughout its duration, the company expects changes in the fair value of the hedged element to be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged instrument. There are three types of hedge accounting: – the fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability (or an identified portion of the asset or liability) that are attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk and which could affect profit or loss. The hedged portion of these items is re-measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Change in this fair value is booked 3 in the income statement and offset by symmetrical changes in the fair value hedging of financial hedging instruments up to the limit of the hedge effectiveness; – the cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (such as a future purchase or sale) and which could affect profit or loss. As the hedged item is not recognized in the statement of financial position, the effective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument is booked in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item (financial asset or liability) affects the profit or loss or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a non-financial asset acquisition cost; – the net investment hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in values attributable to exchange risk of a net investment in a foreign operation, and could affect profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss upon the disposal of the net investment. For transactions qualified as fair value hedges and economic hedges, the foreign exchange impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives is booked in operating income when the underlying hedged item results from operational transactions and in net finance costs when the underlying hedged item is a financial asset or liability. Hedge accounting can be terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognized, i.e. when the Group revokes the designation of the hedging relationship or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are as follows: – fair value hedge: at the hedge accounting termination date, the adjustment of the fair value of the liability is amortized using an effective interest rate recalculated at this date. Should the item hedged disappear, the change in fair value is recognized in the income statement; – cash flow hedge: amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognized. In all other cases, amounts are reclassified in profit or loss, on a straight basis, throughout the remaining life of the original hedging relationship. In both cases, subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss. Concerning the effects of the Foreign Currency Basis Spread, cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges, the Group has chosen to designate them as costs of hedge. This option enables recognizing these effects in comprehensive income and amortizing the cost of the Basis Spread to profit/loss over the period of the hedge. Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 221 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements 12.8.2 Cash flow hedges The Group’s cash flow hedges main goal is to neutralize foreign exchange risk on future cash flows (notional, coupons) or switch floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.

Accounting policies The financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position have been classified based on the three hierarchy levels: – level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; – level 2: inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; – level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The fair value of the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income is the quoted price at year-end for listed securities and, for non-listed securities, uses a valuation technique determined according to the most appropriate financial criteria in each case (comparable transactions, multiples for comparable companies, shareholders’ agreement, discounted present value of future cash flows). For financial assets at amortized cost, the Group considers that the carrying amount of cash, trade receivables and various deposits provide a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements. Among financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, with respect to very short-term investments such as deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper or negotiable debt securities, the Group considers that the nominal value of the investment and any related accrued interest represent a reasonable approximation of fair value. The fair value of mutual funds (UCITS) is the latest net asset value. The fair value of investment securities is the quoted price at year-end for listed securities and, for non-listed securities, uses a valuation technique determined according to the most appropriate financial criteria in each case (comparable transactions, multiples for comparable companies, shareholders’ agreement, discounted present value of future cash flows). For financial liabilities at amortized cost, the fair value of financial liabilities is determined using: – the quoted price for listed instruments (a detailed analysis is performed in the case of a material decrease in liquidity to evidence whether the observed price corresponds to the fair value; otherwise the quoted price is adjusted); – the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using rates observed by the Group at the end of the period for other instruments. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are systematically benchmarked with the values provided by Bloomberg. The Group considers the carrying value of trade payables and deposits received from customers to be a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements. Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 231 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements The fair value of long-term trade payables is the value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss mainly concern firm or contingent commitments to purchase non-controlling interests. Their fair value is measured in accordance with the provisions of the contractual agreements. When the commitment is based on a fixed price, a discounted value is retained. The fair value of derivatives, mostly traded over-the-counter, is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are consistently benchmarked with the values provided by bank counterparties and Bloomberg. When there are no reliable market data which identify the probability of default, the CVA (Credit Value Adjustment) and the DVA (Debit Value Adjustment) are measured based on historical default charts and CDS (Credit Default Swap) trends. Counterparty credit risk and the Group’s own specific default risk are also continuously monitored based on the monitoring of debt security credit spreads on the secondary market and other market information. Given the implementation of collateralization, and based on counterparty policies and the management of indebtedness and liquidity risk described in Note 12, CVA and DVA estimates are not material compared to the measurement of the related financial instruments.

These instruments have no maturity and the coupon’s settlement could be deferred at the option of the issuer. They are booked in equity. As equity instruments are recognized at historical value, the tranche denominated in foreign currency is never re-measured. Where appropriate, a translation adjustment impact will be booked in equity at the exercise date of any purchase option. The holders’ payment is directly booked in equity at the date of the decision to pay the coupons. The tax effect relating to the payment is accounted for as net income and the one relating to the remeasurement of the foreign exchange portion is accounted for as equity. Equity component of perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRA) (see Note 12.4) The equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the instrument taken as a whole and the fair value of the debt component. Thus, the equity component determined and recognized at inception is not subsequently re-measured and remains in equity, even when the instrument is extinguished. 3 14.5 Translation adjustment (in millions of euros) 2019 2018 2017 Gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income during the period 90 (6) (184) Reclassification to net income for the period (12) (1) 8 Total transaction adjustments for continuing operations 78 (7) (176) Reclassification to the net income for the period Total translation adjustments for discontinued operations (in millions of euros) December 31, December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Polish zloty 807 785 845 Egyptian pound (455) (532) (545) Slovak koruna 220 220 220 Sierra leonean leone (120) (95) (78) Moldovan leu (55) (63) (70) Jordanian dinar 69 58 33 Pound sterling 14 14 15 Other (151) (135) (161) Total translation adjustments 329 252 259 o/w share attributable to the owners of the parent company 78 15 27 o/w share attributable to non-controlling interests 251 237 232 Accounting policies The functional currency of foreign operations located outside the euro area is usually the local currency, unless the major cash flows are made with reference to another currency (such as the Orange entities in Romania – euros and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo – US dollars). The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currency is neither the euro nor the currency of a hyper-inflationary economy are translated into euros (the Group’s presentation currency) as follows: – assets and liabilities are translated at the year-end rate; – items in the income statement are translated at the average rate for the year; – the translation adjustment resulting from the use of these different rates is included in other comprehensive income. The translation adjustments are reclassified to profit or loss when the entity disposes or partially disposes (loss of control, loss of joint control, loss of significant influence) of its interest in a foreign operation through the sale, liquidation, repayment of capital or abandon of all, or part of, that activity. The reduction in the carrying amount of a foreign operation, either because of its own losses or because of the recognition of an impairment loss, does not lead to a reclassification to profit or loss of the accumulated translation adjustment.

When the amount of the commitment exceeds the amount of the non-controlling interests, the difference is recorded as a reduction in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company. Financial debt is re-measured at the end of each reporting period in accordance with the contractual arrangement (at fair value or at present value if fixed price) and, in the absence of any guidance provided by IFRS, against finance income or expense. Non-controlling interests that are debtors Total comprehensive income of a subsidiary is attributed to the owners of the parent company and to the non-controlling interests. In accordance with IFRS 10, this can result in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Transactions with owners Each transaction with non-controlling interests of an entity controlled by the Group, when not resulting in a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction with no effect on the total comprehensive income. 3 14.7 Earnings per share Net income Net income, Group share, used for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is determined according to the following method: (in millions of euros) 2019 2018 2017 Net income of continuing operations 3,006 1,954 1,843 Effect of subordinated notes (268) (293) (267) Net income attributable to the owners of the parent company – basic (adjusted) 2,738 1,661 1,576 o/w net income of continuing operations 2,738 1,661 1,547 o/w net income of discontinued operations 29 Impact of dilutive instruments: TDIRA 12 33 Net income attributable to the owners of the parent company – diluted 2,749 1,661 1,609 o/w net income of continuing operations 2,749 1,661 1,580 o/w net income of discontinued operations 29 Number of shares The weighted average number of shares used for calculating the basic and diluted earnings per share is presented below: (number of shares) 2019 2018 2017 Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 2,652,532,564 2,656,683,856 2,659,421,767 Impact of dilutive instruments on number of ordinary shares: TDIRA 33,780,544 52,079,350 Free share award plan 1,662,103 1,419,415 435,150 Weighted average number of shares outstanding – diluted 2,687,975,211 2,658,103,271 2,711,936,267 The average market price of the Orange share in 2019, 2018 and 2017 The TDIRA were included in the calculation of diluted net earnings per is greater than the fair value adopted under the Orange Vision 2020, share at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2017, since they are LTIP 2018 – 2020 and LTIP 2019-2021 free share award plans (see dilutive.

The number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share takes into account the conversion into ordinary shares of potentially dilutive instruments outstanding during the period. These instruments are considered to be dilutive when they have the effect of reducing earnings per share of continuing operations. When basic earnings per share are negative, diluted earnings per share are identical to basic earnings per share. In the event of an issuance of shares at a price lower than the market price, and in order to ensure comparability of the reporting period shown, the weighted average numbers of shares outstanding from current and previous periods are adjusted. Treasury shares owned, which deducted from the consolidated equity, do not enter into the calculation of earnings per share.

Accounting policies Classification of the bank’s balance sheet items as current and non-current was done to match the Group’s financial statements as part of the acquisition of the bank in 2016. Since the concept of current or non-current is non-existent in bank accounting, financial assets and liabilities related to loans and borrowings to customers or credit institutions (the ordinary activities of a bank) have since 2017 all been classified as current for all periods presented. With regard to other financial assets and liabilities, classification as current and non-current has been made in light of both the original intention of management and the nature of the assets and liabilities in question. For instance, with regard to Orange Bank’s other financial assets, since investments are managed by portfolio, only the transaction portfolios (financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) have been recognized in current financial assets. 242 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements 16.1.1 Financial assets related to Orange Bank transactions (excluding derivatives) After application of IFRS 9 on January 1, 2018, the financial assets in connection with the transactions of Orange Bank break down as follows: (in millions of euros) December 31, 2019 December 31, January 1, 2018 2018 (1) Non-current Current Total Total Total Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified to profit or loss 2 2 1 0 Investments securities 2 2 1 0 Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss 653 3 656 925 786 Debt securities 653 3 656 925 786 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 100 79 179 152 242 Investments at fair value 79 79 72 171 Cash collateral paid 76 76 57 62 Others 25 25 23 9 Financial assets at amortized cost 504 3,016 3,519 3,614 3,857 3 Fixed-income securities 504 3 506 614 615 Loans and receivables to customers 1,937 1,937 2,000 2,147 Loans and receivables to credit institutions 1,073 1,073 1,000 943 Others 3 3 152 (2) Total financial assets related to Orange Bank activities 1,259 3,098 4,357 4,692 4,885 (1) Figures have been adjusted for the impact of application of IFRS 9.

Accounting policies Financial assets – Financial assets at fair value through profit/loss (FVR) Certain investment securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted, and cash investments such as negotiable debt securities, deposits and mutual funds (UCITS), that are compliant with the Group’s risk management policy or investment strategy, may be designated by Orange Bank as being recognized at fair value through profit or loss. These assets are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in profit or loss. – Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or /loss (FVOCI) Investment securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded in other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss. – Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss (FVOCIR) Assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss mainly include investments in debt securities. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded in other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss. In case of disposal, the cumulative profit (or loss) recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss. 244 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Financial Report —3 Consolidated financial statements – Financial assets at amortized cost (AC) This category primarily comprises miscellaneous loans and receivables as well as fixed-income securities held with the aim of collecting contractual flows. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Impairment and provisions are recorded as soon as loans are granted or commitments are concluded, without waiting for the appearance of an objective indication of impairment. Impairment and provisions are updated as the credit risk evolves (see below “Impairment of financial assets”). Impairment of financial assets In accordance with IFRS 9, debt instruments classified as financial assets at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, rental receivables, financing commitments and financial guarantees given are systematically subject to impairment or a provision for expected credit loss. These impairments and provisions are recorded as soon as loans are granted, commitments are concluded or bond securities are acquired, without waiting for the appearance of an objective indication of impairment. To do this, the financial assets concerned are split into three categories according to the change in credit risk observed since their initial accounting and a depreciation is recorded on the amount outstanding of each of these categories as follows: – performing loans: the calculation of losses expected is made on a 12-months basis, and the financial income (interest) is calculated on the basis of the instrument’s gross amount; 3 – impaired loans: if the credit risk has significantly worsened since the debt has been booked to the balance sheet, the expected losses, estimated over the duration of the loan, are recognized and the financial income (interest) is calculated based on the gross amount of the instrument; – doubtful loans: the expected loss, estimated over the duration of the loan, is depreciated. The financial income is calculated on the basis of the amount of the instrument net of the depreciation. As a reminder, before the application of IFRS 9, the accounting policies relative to financial assets of banking activities were as follows: Loans and receivables related to Orange Bank Assets related to Orange Bank activities are classified in the IAS 39 category of “loans and receivables”. They are initially recorded at fair value or its equivalent, which is, as a general rule, the net amount originally issued, and which should include the origination costs directly related to the transaction as well as the commissions received or paid, analyzed as an adjustment to the effective return on the loan. The loans and receivables are subsequently valued at amortized cost, and interests, as well as transactions costs and commissions included in the initial value of the credits contribute to the net income for these transactions over the term of the credit, calculated on the basis of effective interest rate. In accordance with IAS 39, loans and receivables are impaired when one or more evidences of depreciation have occurred after the recognition of these receivables. The receivables thus identified are then impaired on an individual basis or on a collective basis. Expected losses are accounted for as impairments, equal to the difference between the carrying amount of the loans (amortized cost) and the total of estimated future cash flows, discounted with the initial effective interest rate, or in the form of discounts for restructured loans due to default from customers. Impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the discounted value, at the initial rate of the receivable, of the components deemed to be recoverable (principal, interest, guarantees, etc.). The changes in the value of the loans impaired are recorded in the income statement under “Cost of risk” included in other operating expenses. When these changes in value are positive, reflecting a subsequent improvement, they are reversed in the income statement, within the same account. The “Cost of risk” account dedicated to Orange Bank and part of the “other operating expenses”, corresponds to provisions and reversals related to banking risks (in particular, counterparty risks and operational risks). Assets available for sale The assets available for sale include fixed income securities or variable income securities that do not fall within the definition of other categories of financial assets. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded as “Gains (losses) on assets available for sale” within other comprehensive income. The long term impairments associated with the assets available for sale are recorded under “Cost of risk” (within other operating expenses) when the assets are fixed rate securities, but they are recorded in “Net Gains (losses) on financial assets available for sale” when the assets are floating-rate securities. Assets held to maturity This category includes fixedrate securities that the bank intends to hold until their maturity. They must not be disposed of prior to maturity and they are accounted for at amortized cost. Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document 245 3 — Financial Report Consolidated financial statements Impairment is recognized on these securities as soon as there is an objective evidence of the existence of an event subsequent to the acquisition of the security that is likely to generate a measurable loss as a result of counterparty risk. Impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value prior to impairment and the discounted value, with the initial rate, of the components deemed to be recoverable (principal, interest, guarantees, etc.). The changes in value thus impaired are recorded in the income statement, under the “Cost of risk” account (within other operating expenses). When these changes in value are positive, reflecting a subsequent improvement, they are reversed in the income statement under “Cost of risk” within other operating expenses. 16.1.2 Financial liabilities related to Orange Bank transactions (excluding derivatives) (in millions of euros) December 31, December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Payables to customers 3,357 3,396 3,685 Debts with financial institutions 448 1,103 975 Deposit certificate 475 335 281 Other 28 28 27 Total Financial liabilities related to Orange Bank’s activities (1) 4,307 4,862 4,968 (1) o/w 27 million of euros of non current financial liabilities in 2019, 2018 and 2017.

In In 2013, Orange undertook a risk assessment in relation to its core some countries (France and Egypt, among others), the Group has businesses (networks, service activities, transport) and opportunities undertaken to blend a number of antennae into the environment and associated with the use of information and communication landscape by adapting them to the local style and context (painting, technologies (ICT), in order to assess its impacts on biodiversity. This incorporation in buildings, etc.). study was conducted in accordance with methodology of the WBCSD The Group’s activity does not generate noise pollution. (World Business Council for Sustainable Development), and showed that the Group’s impacts are generally low. The main impact is related Paper consumption to CO2 emissions, which are responsible for climate change, a major cause of loss of biodiversity. For several years Orange has implemented programs to reduce paper consumption and to use FSC and/or recycled paper. Orange thus participates in biodiversity studies, particularly: – within its partnership with CREA (Alpine ecosystems research Water consumption center), in which Orange offers CREA access to its antennas located The main sources of water consumption in the Orange group are water in mountain areas and equips them with sensors to gather fountains, toilets, canteens and the humidification systems of Data information on temperatures in the Mont Blanc region.

Internet 324 Orange — 2019 Universal Registration Document Non-financial performance —4 Environmental impacts of our activities Indeed, the Group’s Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions for these ten countries 4.4.2.1 Network energy consumption plus Orange Business Services fell by 4.6% in 2019 compared with A massive energy action plan, Green ITN 2020, was undertaken in 2018 (5.4% decline in Scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions within the Group) 2008 to reduce energy consumption related to the operation of as a result of sharply contrasting trends: it is mainly because higher networks and information systems, which account for 84.0% of the emissions in France, Spain, Morocco and Senegal were more than Group’s total consumption and 81.6% of CO2 emissions (including offset the lower emissions in Poland and Jordan. network equipment in buildings). Implemented in most countries where Increased emissions of 3.3% in France between 2018 and 2019 is the Group is active, this action plan enabled Scope 1 & 2 energy due to higher emissions factors set by the International Energy Agency consumption to be restricted to a +0.1% between 2019 and 2018, (IEA), but energy consumption actually fell by 0.7% over the same despite uses continuing to increase (up 3.9% in the most representative period. countries selected for the Group’s CO2 per customer use indicator). For the 2 largest energy consumers of the Group: In Spain, the consumption of fuel oil used on the back-up network and for rural off-grid sites increased in 2019, due to a change in the – the change in energy consumption related to information networks calculation methodology (revised estimates thanks to new data from and systems between 2019 and 2018 amounted to +3.8% for suppliers) and due to an increase in the number of sites in rural areas France, attributable to the increase in the number of mobile sites not served by the national network (increased coverage of the Orange with the coverage of white areas and the continued deployment of Spain mobile network), which impacts Scope 1 emissions upwards. 4G. From 2014 to 2018, the volume of data transported for mobiles had multiplied 7 times, and the energy performance during the In 2019, Orange Spain used electricity from renewable sources for all same period had improved by 80% (i.e. quantity of electricity to of its electricity consumption (Scope 2) through consumption contracts transport 1 Giga bytes); with Guarantee of Origin (GoO) from its suppliers; considering the CO2 emission factor from Spain’s energy mix, it corresponds to 92,959 tons – the change in energy consumption linked to networks and IT of CO2 avoided in 2019, i.e. 7.1% of the Group’s emissions (Scopes between 2019 and 2018 amounted to -1.4% for Poland. 1 & 2). It may be noted that Orange Spain’s electricity consumption Thanks to this action plan, between 2010 and 2019, at least 5 TWh declared until 2018 covered an estimate of the electricity consumed of electricity and 260 million liters of fuel oil were saved within the by Orange equipment located in third-party operator sites (OT), as well network and IT scope. These savings prevented the release of at least as the entire electricity consumption of the Orange Spain sites, although 2,7 million metric tons of CO2 over the period. they host third-party equipments, thus inducing an overestimation of the network’s electricity consumption. In 2019, only the electricity These results were made possible by a series of measures introduced, purchased by Orange Spain for its own sites is accounted for, since particularly increased cooperation with equipment suppliers with a 4 the network agreement concluded between various operators is view to developing and obtaining highly energy-efficient telecommusubstantially balanced.

To this end, effort has gone into Meanwhile, the reduction in CO2 emissions (down 5.5% between liquid cooling systems, a technology which allows heat dissipated by 2018 and 2019) in Poland, thanks to the reduction in energy telecoms equipment and servers to be collected as close as possible consumption (down 2.7% between 2018 and 2019) has been to the components, without needing to cool the liquid beforehand magnified by lower factors set by the IEA for Poland. using a cooling system, and also allows some of that energy to be reused for office heating. In Jordan, Orange has profoundly modified its sources of electricity supply, by using its own solar energy resources up to 52.3 GWh, At Orange’s initiative, a European standard has been developed to corresponding to 62% of Orange Jordan’s total electricity consumption speed up the development of this technology. In addition, water-cooled in 2019. The commissioning of three solar farms in 2019 allows network equipment has already been deployed at an equipment bay releasing a full year capacity corresponding to 70% of the electricity level with very promising results. Next it will be applied to servers. needs estimated for Orange Jordan in 2020. The Group is rationalizing its Data centers, virtualizing servers and Considering the CO2 emission factor from Jordan’s energy mix, it renewing the most energy-consuming equipment in order to benefit corresponds to 25,996 tons of CO2 avoided in 2019, i.e. 2.0% of the from new, less energy-consuming technologies. In France, following Group’s emissions (Scopes 1&2). the example of the first eco-efficient Data center commissioned in 2012, Orange has undertaken large-scale work to build two new Data It should be noted that in 2019, Orange Belgium used electricity from centers, which will replace ten sites across the country.
