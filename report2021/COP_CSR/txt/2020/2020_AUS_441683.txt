gold mining company for all stakeholders, including employees, communities, the environment, regulators, investors and business partners. This is supported by a company strategy focused on delivering against our commitments and driving long-term value for all stakeholders. We are committed to responsible mining, managing our impacts and, more broadly, contributing to the communities in which we work and live. We made big strides in our responsible mining program of work in 2019, however the year was not without its challenges. Providing certainty on our future through the renewal of the Financial, Technical or Assistance Agreement (FTAA) and recommencement of operations at the Didipio mine is a key priority for 2020. We are also focused on delivering our budget guidance, permitting the extension of the Haile Gold Mine in the United States of America, extending the life of the Macraes Operation in the South Island of New Zealand and the launch of the Waihi District Study in the North Island of New Zealand. In the Philippines, we continue to work with the National Government to finalise the renewal of the FTAA for the Didipio Mine. The national regulator gave us approval to continue operating while the renewal is finalised. However, the Province of Nueva Vizcaya and local barangay units view the permit as expired until the renewal is completed and they enforced roadblocks to prevent access for supplies or transport of concentrate from the mine. As a result, we suspended underground mining in July 2019 and processing in October 2019. While the mine remains in a state of operational readiness, we made the difficult decision to commence temporary lay-offs of employees in April 2020. In 2019, the World Gold Council launched the Responsible Gold Mining Principles, which set clear expectations as to what constitutes responsible gold mining. As a member of the World Gold Council, we are among some of the world’s most forwardthinking gold mining companies, defining the future for our industry. OceanaGold takes our role as a responsible gold producer seriously and has committed to implementing the Responsible Gold Mining Principles at all operations over which we have direct control by the end of 2022. In 2018, we commenced a three-year program of work to enhance our corporate governance framework. By strengthening our systems at a corporate level, we support local implementation at our operations and position the company for continued growth and improved performance. In 2019, we launched the Responsible Mining Framework. This governance framework defines how we operate every day, at every level of our business, to manage potential economic, health and safety, employment, environmental and social impacts and risks, while leveraging positive outcomes for all our stakeholders. Under the Framework we reviewed and revised our Responsible Mining Policies. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 4 Our Human Rights Policy outlines our commitment to respecting the human rights of everyone impacted by our business and throughout our value chain. It reflects the requirements of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the UN Declaration of Human Rights and other international frameworks. In 2019, in addition to our ongoing human rights training across the company, we completed human rights impact assessments at the Didipio Mine and Haile Gold Mine and commenced a human rights impact assessment across our New Zealand operations. With the passing of the Australian Modern Slavery Act in 2018, we made a commitment to better-understand human rights risks across our company, including labour rights risks in our supply chain. Extending the scope beyond modern slavery, we benchmarked our performance against that of our industry peers in 2019 to identify potential environmental and social (including human rights) risks. Supported by the Responsible Supply Chain Steering Committee, we will implement all the governance processes required to meet the WGC Supply Chain Principle and issue a Supplier Code of Conduct in 2020. We support the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, this report forms our second annual Communication on Progress and in it we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. In line with our commitment to open and transparent reporting, we continue as members of Transparency International and of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Philippines multi-stakeholder group, which is working to enhance transparency for the minerals sector in the Philippines. In 2019, in line with our commitment to innovation and operational performance we became members of AMIRA International, an independent association of minerals companies which develops, brokers and facilitates collaborative research projects. We also became a founding partner of the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining (CSRM) Social Aspects of Mine Closure Research Consortium, which is conducting research that challenges accepted industry norms and practices and demands new approaches that place people at the centre of mine closure. We procure goods and services locally where practicable, or within the countries that host our operations. This ensures the benefits of our activities extend beyond the boundaries of our operations and provide jobs and financial benefits, in addition to the wages, taxes and other payments we make. In 2019, the economic contribution distributed to local, national and international suppliers was US$499 million. Of this, 85 per cent was invested within the countries that host our operations and projects. We also invested more than US$3.88 million in social programs, donations, in-kind support and community infrastructure and distributed US$ 113.8 million in wages and benefits to OceanaGold employees. We have a highly experienced management team that is committed to achieving positive results every day. In late 2019, we appointed Graham Almond, Executive Vice President and Chief Officer – People and Culture. As a member of our Executive Committee, Graham will help us drive our people and culture strategy and lead our workplace transformation as our company and industry evolves. We provided employment for 2,170 employees in 2019, with 95.8 per cent employed on a permanent basis. We also employed approximately 1,161 contractors, bringing our total workforce in 2019 to 3,331. We continued to provide development and training opportunities to support our people to achieve their full potential, with employees receiving an average of 37.52 hours of training in 2019, an increase of 7.54 per cent on 2018. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 5 In 2019, we conducted a company-wide culture survey to gain key insights around how we can build the culture that will support us into the future. In 2020, building on the results of the survey, we will continue our journey to be a more constructive culture. This will include designing the organisational culture and expected behaviours for our leadership team, developing a leadership model aligned to the corporate strategy and more closely aligning leadership effectiveness with reward schemes. Across the company our workforce achieved a total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) of 3.57 recordable injuries per million hours of work. This was a decrease from 4.53 in 2018 and a result of our continued focus on safety as part of our culture and operationally-led safety programs to increase awareness and drive behavioural change. In 2020, we will reinforce the Corporate Health and Safety Standards focussing on the management of principle hazards and workplace exposures to drive continuous improvement in health and safety performance. Aligned to our Health and Safety Policy, the standards define our performance and systems requirements at all our activities. In 2019, we launched the External Affairs and Social Performance Management System, which governs our engagement activities across the company. As part of the system, we launched our Government and Civil Society Policy and three position statements, which provide clarity on OceanaGold’s commitments on issues of interest to our stakeholders. These position statements include artisanal and small-scale mining, contract transparency and disclosure of taxes, royalties and other payments to government. Also in 2019, we reviewed our approach to environmental governance. We revised our Environmental Policy, operational standards and launched six position statements for our environmental material risk areas. The position statements include water, closure and rehabilitation, biodiversity, tailings storage facilities, cyanide and climate change, energy and C02 emissions management. In 2020, we will commence climate change related risk and opportunity reviews, develop climate change strategies to mitigate the risks associated with climate change and establish measures and targets to improve the efficiency of our energy use and to minimise our CO2 emissions intensity. As an industry we have a responsibility to look for better ways to treat and manage tailings and we support the efforts underway across the sector to investigate continuous improvement. In April 2019, we responded to the Church of England Pensions Board and the Council on Ethics of the Swedish National Pension Funds request to extractive companies to publicly disclose information about their tailings storage facilities (TSFs). In 2019, we completed a program of work to improve our governance and management approach for TSFs. A Tailings Governance Committee was established and chaired by the CEO with representation from the EXCO, Operational teams and an independent technical expert. We also committed to not undertake any new upstream TSF construction and to independently assure TSF-related disclosures in line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) requirements. In 2020, we will develop further corporate guidance for TSF management and continue to operate the Tailings Governance Committee to ensure appropriate oversite is maintained at a senior level within OceanaGold. It’s our pleasure to provide OceanaGold’s 2019 Sustainability Report. You will find more information about all of these initiatives and more in this report.

Precautionary approach We are committed to reducing the environmental and social impact of our operations. We abide by robust performance standards. At a minimum, we meet and often exceed the regulatory requirements of the countries that host our operations. Our approach centres on adopting a mitigation hierarchy in relation to any impacts during the lifecycle of our operations. If incidents occur, we investigate the cause and take immediate action to remediate and prevent a recurrence. In addition, we: • conduct robust environmental, health and safety, external affairs and social performance, employment and governance risk assessments • develop and implement management plans for key environmental topics including water, biodiversity, waste, rehabilitation and greenhouse gas • conduct extensive monitoring and reporting against site-specific permit conditions relating to environment, health and safety, social performance and finance • continue to implement processes to develop social performance management plans • conduct internal and external audits to measure compliance with internal standards and regulatory requirements.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 8 Our material topics We assess and present materiality for this report based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidance for reporting materiality for mining, metals and electric utilities. In line with the GRI Standards, our functional leaders and subject matter experts review the topics that present the greatest potential economic, environmental and social impacts that matter most to our business and stakeholders. Our materiality assessment forms the basis for our sustainability reporting. We also report data in line with the GRI Standards and changes to business over the 2019 calendar year. Our GRI index is provided in Appendix 7 of this report. In determining material topics for our 2019 Sustainability Report, we undertook a process to identify, prioritise, validate and review topics in line with the GRI standard for defining report content. These material topics have been reviewed throughout the preparation of this report. Our 2019 materiality assessment process: • OceanaGold Responsible Mining Committee Working Group—comprising health and safety, environment, finance and human resources (subsequently referred to as ‘people and culture’), social performance and communication—was convened • the Working Group assessed sustainability risks and opportunities through a range of sources (including stakeholder engagement and complaints registers, corporate risk registers, operational reports, board reports, our Responsible Mining Committee) • feedback from our ongoing engagement with internal and external stakeholders was considered • draft Materiality Assessment was reviewed by the OceanaGold Executive Committee (EXCO) and the Responsible Mining Committee. Our material topics for 2019 are similar to 2018. We have included two additional material topics for 2019: labour-management relations and resettlement. Labour-management relations became a material topic as a result of a strike by a small number of employees at our Waihi Operation in New Zealand during a renegotiation process with the representative union. Resettlement elevated slightly and became a material topic in light of continuing grievances over surface rights acquisition at the Didipio Mine between 1990 and 2014 that are yet to be resolved through our grievance mechanism. We regularly engage with advocacy groups and non-government organisations and take on broad feedback we receive from them. In this 2019 report, we have included additional breakdowns in the reporting of our payments to government and additional information about beneficial ownership. We always appreciate and consider feedback provided to us and look for opportunities to improve the way we make information about OceanaGold available. In early 2020 we asked external stakeholders connected with OceanaGold on LinkedIn to provide feedback on our sustainability report and to comment on the areas of our business they would like to see included in this report. We will continue to enhance our direct engagement with stakeholders when determining materiality and other business areas our stakeholders would like to see included in our ongoing reporting. In 2020—as we prepare for external assurance of additional performance data under the World Gold Council’s Responsible Gold Mining Principles—we will expand the data sources we use in our materiality assessment. We will expand the internal representation in the first round of our materiality assessment and present the materiality assessment to the OceanaGold Board Sustainability Committee for discussion and endorsement.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 15 Executive Committee and operational management Our leadership team draws on extensive industry experience and shared vision to collaborate, innovate and build talent throughout OceanaGold, with a focus on sustainable performance. Biographies for each of our Executive Committee members are available on our website. Investors and beneficial ownership We are publicly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) under the stock ticker ‘OGC’. Approximately 90 per cent of our shareholders are institutional investors with brokers, retail and corporate investors accounting for the remaining 10 per cent. They are primarily located in North America (55 per cent), the United Kingdom (25 per cent), mainland Europe (10 per cent) and Australia (10 per cent), with 622.3 million shares outstanding as of 31 March 2020. Additional details are available in the investor centre on our website. Beneficial ownership refers to an individual who ultimately owns or controls more than 25 per cent of a company’s shares or voting rights, or who otherwise exercises control over OceanaGold or its management. Where such an interest is held through a trust, the trustee(s) or anyone who controls the trust is considered a beneficial owner. As a Canadian corporation, any entity that acquires more than 10 per cent ownership of our shares is required to file an Early Warning Report with SEDAR and issue a press release disclosing their ownership and intent with the holding. After that, any change of two per cent (up or down) will also be reported as long as the holding remains above the 10 per cent threshold. An entity cannot acquire more than 20 per cent ownership without offering to take over OceanaGold with certain exceptions. Our top five shareholders as at 31 December 2019 were: 1. Blackrock Inc. 2. Van Eck Associates Corporation 3. Franklin Resources Inc. 4. Dimensional Fund Advisors LP 5. Ingalls & Snyder LLC. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 16 We promote full and fair disclosure and satisfy the disclosure requirements of each of the relevant exchanges as well as applicable securities and corporations legislation. This means we notify the relevant exchanges immediately once we become aware of any information concerning our business and affairs that a reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of our securities. For more information, see our continuous disclosure and investor relations policies on our website. Performance in brief: Automation, digital and process transformation “ADaPT has changed the way we operate. Our jobs are becoming more interesting as repetitive work is removed and our people are empowered to enhance their roles. Our workforce welcomed the change and saw the benefits in their day-to-day jobs through technologies that connect them with each other and protect them from the typical hazards associated with the mining environment.” James Allnutt, Project Manager Since 2018, our company-wide program of automation, digital and process transformation (ADaPT) has helped us define how we will efficiently and safety operate mines in the future. ADaPT is a key feature of our strategy to prepare for operational change as our stakeholders expect us to produce more, waste less and protect our people and environment. We created ADaPT through a high-level collaborative planning workshop that included OceanaGold, Sandvik and MST Global with the aim of building internal capacity and generating better real-time data to improve communication, mitigate risk and enhance innovation. The result? Better data, which enables us to reduce energy consumption and waste production, and more efficient gold production processes that remove less rock and result in less coarse waste and tailings. We strategically selected the underground Didipio Mine in the Philippines to become a flagship site for ADaPT, quickly discovering we could achieve a 10 per cent productivity gain by making the mine more connected. We prioritised our ideas through an Idea Management Process to establish an ideas pipeline, which resulted in two key projects: • surface remote bogging aimed at increasing the stope production rate and enhance safety by removing personnel from hazardous areas • digitised task management aimed at increasing equipment utilisation and efficiency. The project initially focused on trucks and managed to significantly reduce idle time. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 17 Operational assets Our operating assets are located in the Philippines, New Zealand and the United States of America. In 2019 we produced 470.6 thousand ounces (koz) of gold and 10.3 thousand tonnes (kt) of copper at consolidated All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC) of US$1,061/oz. In 2020 we expect to produce between 360 and 380 koz gold at AISC, ranging between US$1,075 $1,125 per ounce sold. This guidance excludes Didipio, which remained suspended at the time the formal guidance was provided to the market.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 19 Exploration and strategic investments Our exploration and investment strategies are focused in the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region, reflecting our operational base and expertise. In these two regions, we leverage our experience and identify opportunities that will sustainably grow our business, continue to deliver consistent results and strengthen our financial position. We are disciplined in our approach to investments, merger and acquisition opportunities and have strict criteria regarding due diligence, financial and other entry hurdles and various potential risks. A significant proportion of our exploration budget is directed towards replacing mine-depleted reserves and expanding our resource base through exploration drilling. In 2019, we increased Measured and Indicated Resources by 0.80 Moz of gold net of mining depletion, mainly due to drilling-related resource upgrades at the Waihi and Macraes Operations. During that time Inferred Resources also increased by 0.7 Moz of gold year-onyear, net of mining depletion largely due to first-time reporting of an Inferred Resource of 0.6 Moz gold for the Palomino underground deposit at Haile and an additional 0.3 Moz gold for the WKP underground deposit near Waihi. Details of our exploration and investment activities are available in full in our Annual Information Form and on our website. Martha Underground resource drilling at the Waihi Operation. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 20 Closure and rehabilitation management Closure and rehabilitation is a critical phase in the mining lifecycle. It underpins the final legacy of the operation within the host community and is a critical aspect in the maintenance of a company’s reputation. Without the appropriate level of engagement, planning, resourcing and management of closure and rehabilitation, long-term negative social, environmental, cultural and economic impacts may be perpetuated. In 2019 we released a position statement on closure and rehabilitation management. It outlined our commitment to the delivery of a long-term positive legacy to the communities that host our operations and undertaking managed closure and rehabilitation to meet the compliance requirements of host country regulations and the requirements of the OceanaGold Closure and Rehabilitation Framework. This position statement is available on our website. For more information about our closure projects and how we plan for and implement closure, see the environment section on page 82. Risk management Risk management is an integral part of operating our business. It protects business, financial and reputational value, reduces potential impacts from hazards to our business, the environment and stakeholders, secures a safer work environment and growth opportunities and promotes a risk-aware culture. Risk management applies at every level of our company and risk analysis is applied to all projects, operations and business units. OceanaGold directors, employees, contractors and consultants have ownership of risk management in their areas of operation. More information is available in our Risk Management Policy on our website. In 2019 we developed and implemented risk management training. The training package was used to undertake social risk assessments and management workshops at our Waihi and Macraes operations. We reviewed and consolidated our corporate risk management processes into a corporate risk management standard that delivers on the requirements listed in our Risk Management Policy and conducted regular risk management reviews at an Executive Committee level. In 2020 we are developing a risk heat map and integrating continuous corporate and operational risk reviews into monthly Executive Committee reports to highlight risk and control activities. We will also increase the frequency of Board-level risk reviews, aligning corporate risk categories to the Board sub-committees and complete social risk assessments at our Haile Gold Mine and Didipio Mine. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 21 Supply chain and due diligence Exploration, Refining and Procurement development and End use marketing operations Pre-contract due Private, financial diligence to procure market, government The customers who goods including, mining Onboarding and business use buy our product are equipment, steel for Ongoing training including jewellery, committed to sourcing construction, electricity, Whistleblower hotline gold bars and coins, conflict-free metals diesel fuel, chemicals electronics, medical and camp supplies technology We conduct thorough due diligence on external parties we work with (for example, projects we could invest in or major contracts we could sign) to make sure we ask the right questions and understand all of the potential impacts of our associations on our business and communities. Local knowledge and expertise are vital and, accordingly, we assess the experience and knowledge of the people we hire. Our due diligence process includes: • identification and verification of the third party we are dealing with • understanding the beneficial ownership or ownership structures to identify potential bribery or corruption exposures • assessing the third party’s attitude and policies in relation to bribery and corruption and practices in relation to donations • determining any investigations the third party may be under. At each of our operations and offices our major contract and tender process includes a due diligence checklist and pre-qualification assessment. In 2020 we will launch a responsible Supply Chain Policy and develop procedures that align to international standards and our OceanaGold Responsible Mining Framework. In 2020 we will also develop a Supplier Code of Conduct, providing clear guidance around our expectations for suppliers. This will include guidance about health and safety, environment, communities, labour and human rights and compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. More information about how we are working towards full compliance with the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 and changes to our supply chain due diligence is available on page 25 of this report. Our gold doré bars (containing gold and silver) are stamped with the mine of origin. Gold produced from our Philippines and New Zealand operations goes to the Perth Mint (in Australia), and gold produced in the United States of America goes to Metalor (in the United States of America). Once the gold is refined it is cast into London Bullion Market Association Good Delivery standard bars and marked with the refiner stamp. We have a commercial offtake with Trafigura for the copper-gold concentrate produced in the Philippines. Once Trafigura receive the concentrate in the Philippines, they determine where it is shipped. The Perth Mint, Metalor and Trafigura are all committed to socially responsible and conflict-free metals sourcing. Their policies are available on their websites. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 22 Human rights Our Human Rights Policy details our commitment to respecting the human rights of everyone impacted by our activities, from exploration through to mining, closure and rehabilitation. This includes our employees, individuals in the communities we operate in, workers in our supply chain and other stakeholders. Our policy is consistent with the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and the concept of free, prior and informed consent. Across our company we advocate for, and are committed to, human rights as a vital part of our Responsible Mining Framework. We do not intentionally incite or support any persecution and we do not operate our business in a way that raises the risk of persecution for indigenous (or non-indigenous) environmental and human rights defenders. As a company we value and respect a broad range of views. We are always open to dialogue, and value the potential for ongoing engagement with all stakeholders to continually improve the way we operate. In 2019 our Didipio Mine commenced a review against the World Gold Council Conflict-free Gold Standard. Across OceanaGold we continued human rights training, including additional training for the Board and Executive Committee. We also provided training to the Responsible Mining Committee, security and other externally-facing employees at the Didipio Mine and leadership teams at the Macraes and Waihi operations and Haile Gold Mines. We also completed human rights impact assessments at the Didipio Mine and Haile Gold Mine. We commenced human rights impact assessments at our operations in New Zealand in 2019 and will complete them in 2020. Indigenous people from Didipio in the Philippines show their support for our Didipio Mine at a peaceful assembly in Manila. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 23 Commitment to the Responsible Gold Mining Principles Our purpose at OceanaGold is to leave a positive legacy every day. So responsible mining is fundamental to the way we do business, manage our impacts and, more broadly, contribute to society. In 2019 the World Gold Council launched the Responsible Gold Mining Principles: 10 principles that set out clear expectations about what constitutes responsible gold mining across key environmental, social and governance issues in the gold mining sector. Earning the right to operate long into the future means always enhancing our responsible performance and working closely with communities, governments and global organisations. As members of the World Gold Council and with our CEO on the World Gold Council Board, we are among the world’s most forward-thinking gold mining companies that are defining the future of our industry. OceanaGold takes its role as a responsible gold producer seriously. It has committed to implementing the Responsible Gold Mining Principles at all mining and processing operations over which OceanaGold has direct control by the end of 2022. This is consistent with the reporting boundaries that we publicly disclose in our annual sustainability report. In implementing these principles, we will: • develop and implement policies, systems, processes and controls to ensure we conform with the principles • publicly report information that helps external stakeholders understand how our conformance with the principles is achieved • report information about any non-conformance to the principles and the steps we will take to remedy the situation • secure independent assurance over the process to ensure the accuracy of the reports and compliance with the principles across OceanaGold. While OceanaGold already implements a majority of the requirements of the principles, we are conducting a thorough assessment and developing a program of work to ensure full compliance. In 2019 we completed these actions: • assessed the principles requirements • developed a plan and schedule to achieve conformance with the principles at both a corporate and site level • identified the accountable managers • undertook preliminary engagement with independent assurers to determine the auditing and assurance process. Actions to be completed in 2020 are: • make a public statement of commitment to implement the principles • undertake a readiness review of all corporate and operational functions • develop corrective action plan to reach conformance by 31 December 2022 • track and report our corrective action plan progress in the 2020 Sustainability Report • seek independent assurance of our self-assessment and progress against the corrective action plan. More information about the World Gold Council Responsible Gold Mining Principles is available on its website. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 24 Compliance with the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 The Modern Slavery Act 2018 was a key development in guiding Australian businesses to better understand and report on how they manage their modern slavery risks. The Act defines modern slavery as eight types of serious exploitation: trafficking in persons; slavery; servitude; forced marriage; forced labour; debt bondage; deceptive recruiting for labour or services; and the worst forms of child labour (where children are subjected to slavery or similar practices or engaged in hazardous work). In 2021 OceanaGold will submit its first modern slavery statement in compliance with the legislation. At OceanaGold, we recognise the importance of understanding human rights risks across our company, including labour rights risks in our supply chain. This includes but is not limited to modern slavery. While modern slavery is the most serious form of labour exploitation, there are many other forms, including restrictions on freedom of association and unfair payment of wages. These practices are also illegal and harmful and may escalate into modern slavery if not addressed. In 2019 we established a Responsible Supply Chain Steering Committee, which includes our CEO, Corporate Counsel and the EVP/Head of External Affairs and Social Performance, the Commercial Manager for the Haile Gold Mine and the General Manager, Project Execution. Reporting to the Steering Committee is a working group comprising representation from corporate and operational business units. The committee and working group undertook work to benchmark our performance against that of our industry peers and to identify the potential environmental and social (including human rights) risks in our supply chain. An action plan was drawn from this to inform the next stage of supply chain mapping and risk assessment. In 2020 we will continue to progress our work plan, which includes developing a Supplier Code of Conduct. This will set out the basis of our responsible sourcing approach. The Code will be supported by communication and education with our existing suppliers and training for people in leadership positions, procurement and finance around new code and procedures, including how to understand, identify and report modern slavery incidents. We will also enhance our procedure for screening suppliers against the Code of Conduct (currently all OceanaGold suppliers are subject to minimum screening and some suppliers are prioritised for further screening based on a risk assessment). While this work transcends modern slavery, it establishes the foundations to help OceanaGold prepare for reporting in line with the Modern Slavery Act 2018. This work also aligns with OceanaGold’s existing sustainability commitments, including to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the United Nations Global Compact, World Gold Council Responsible Gold Mining Principles, Extractives Industries Transparency Initiative and open and transparent reporting as a member of Transparency International. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 25 Memberships and associations We continue to play an active role in international, national and regional industry organisations and multi-stakeholder groups through membership, funding, providing expertise and participation on boards, in committees and working groups. In 2019 we became a member of AMIRA International, an independent association of minerals companies which develops, brokers and facilitates collaborative research projects. We also became a founding partner of the Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining (CSRM) Social Aspects of Mine Closure Research Consortium, which was established to conduct research that challenges accepted industry norms and practices and demands new approaches that place people at the centre of mine closure. Our memberships and associations in 2019 were: • World Gold Council • United Nations Global Compact • Transparency International • AMIRA International • CSRM Social Aspects of Mine Closure Research Consortium • Philippines EITI multi-stakeholder group • Association of Mineral Exploration • Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada • Denver Gold Group • US Chamber of Commerce • South Carolina Mining Association • National Mining Association (USA) • South Carolina Manufacturers Alliance • South Carolina Chamber of Commerce • Lancaster County Chamber of Commerce • Kershaw County Chamber of Commerce • South Carolina Business and Industry Political Education Committee • Lynches River Conservation Fund • Melbourne Mining Club • Philippine Mine Safety and Environment Association • Chamber of Mines of the Philippines • Philippine Mineral Exploration Association • Diwata-Women in Resource Development Inc. • MinEx national Health and Safety Council for New Zealand • New Zealand Major Energy Users’ Group • New Zealand Minerals Forum.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 27 The Didipio Mine in the Philippines A summary of our Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) renewal and the impact of restrictions to our operation OceanaGold acquired the high-grade gold and copper deposit in 2006 through a merger with Climax Mining Ltd and commenced commercial production as an open pit operation in 2013. In 2015 the mine transitioned to underground operation, with production from the underground commencing in early 2017. The Didipio Mine delivers significant socio-economic benefits to the Barangay of Didipio, adjacent communities, the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Quirino, and the Philippines. At full operation it directly employs more than 1,500 workers, of which 97 per cent are Filipino nationals and 59 per cent are from local communities. It also provides thousands of additional livelihood opportunities and indirect jobs through partnerships with cooperatives and social development organisations. Between 2013 and 2019 the Didipio Mine has invested more than PHP 44.9 billion (US$867 million). This includes development expenditure for its host and neighbouring communities, community investment projects, payments to national or local suppliers and contractors, government taxes and employee wages. Of this expenditure, 97 per cent (PHP 43.5 billion) was paid to employees, government and businesses through salaries, taxes and procurement, while PHP 1.4 billion was spent for community development. We operate the Didipio Mine under FTAA, which was signed in 1994 and gives OceanaGold the right and responsibility to explore, develop and operate in the Didipio area. The FTAA does not award OceanaGold ownership of any mineral resources; rather, under this arrangement, OceanaGold is essentially a contractor of the Republic of the Philippines and the mine is a national asset. In June 2019 the FTAA became renewable for a second 25-year term under the same terms and conditions. There are currently five existing FTAAs in the Philippines and the Didipio Mine is the first to go through the renewal process. The processing plant at the Didipio Mine. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 28 In March 2018 we commenced the renewal process with the responsible regulatory agencies—the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB). Both departments reviewed the renewal and in early June 2019 the DENR endorsed the renewal to the Office of the President, based on OceanaGold’s full compliance with FTAA terms and conditions. After its initial review, the Office of the President requested further clarification on how OceanaGold will accommodate the Indigenous People’s Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997. Under the Act, development in the Philippines requires the free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) of recognised indigenous landowners. As the Didipio FTAA area is not included in the existing Bugkalot tribe’s Certificate of Ancestral Domain Claim, FPIC has not been required. However, we did obtain endorsement for the mine from the Didipio community in 2002 as part of our Environmental Compliance Certificate process. We have made a commitment to accommodate IPRA if this is requested by the Philippines Government. In June 2019—recognising the Office of the President would require additional time to review the renewal application—the MGB issued a formal letter confirming OceanaGold’s right to continue to operate while the renewal is finalised. The FTAA renewal is currently under consideration by the Office of the President. In July 2019 the Governor of Nueva Vizcaya issued an order directing Local Government Units to restrain any operations of OceanaGold at the Didipio Mine. The Governor does not recognise the authority of MGB to authorise the continuing operations at the Didipio Mine. In response to the Governor’s order the Local Government Unit closed road checkpoints to company supply vehicles. As a result, we voluntarily ceased all trucking in and out of the mine to prevent any potential for escalation. Road checkpoints remain closed, preventing any trucking of mining consumables into the mine or copper concentrate out of the mine. We temporarily suspended underground mining in July 2019 and processing operations in October 2019. As at 19 June 2020 (the date we published this report) we maintain a state of operational readiness and continue critical activities, like de-watering underground, to ensure the safety of employees and protection of the environment and this national asset. Employees show their support for the FTAA renewal. The mine supports 1,500 direct jobs and more than 4,000 indirect jobs. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 29 In July 2019 we went to the Regional Trial Court in Nueva Vizcaya to challenge the legality of the Governor’s order and, as part of this, we sought an injunction (interim relief) to allow us to continue to operate. The Regional Trial Court denied the injunction request, so we appealed the decision to the Philippine Court of Appeals in Manila and we are waiting for a decision. Injunctive interim relief may only be granted in exceptional cases. Our main legal challenge about the legality of the Governor’s order is still progressing at the Regional Trial Court in Nueva Vizcaya. Prior to taking any legal action we made several attempts to engage with the Provincial Government to resolve its current position. We will always be open to engagement with the Nueva Vizcaya Provincial Government and all other stakeholders. The Didipio FTAA area falls within two provinces, Nueva Vizcaya and Quirino, and the Provincial Government of Quirino has sent written support for the FTAA renewal and our operation to the Office of the President. As we have not been able to operate normally at Didipio since July 2019, OceanaGold issued our employees Notices of Temporary Lay-Off in August 2019 to take effect in September 2019. However, given overwhelming support from employees, the host communities and various actions being taken by OceanaGold to lift restraints on our mining operations and complete the FTAA renewal, the implementation of the lay-offs was deferred for seven months until 15 April 2020. In light of ongoing disruptions to operations at Didipio and the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to temporarily lay-off all staff not occupying essential roles. The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees remains our priority and this has not been an easy decision to make, nor one we take lightly. In March 2020 we received government authority through the MGB to transport the gold doré produced prior to the suspension of operations. In early April 2020 we received a delivery of emergency backup fuel to power our underground de-watering system with the approval of the DENR, MGB and the Office of the President. More information about our Didipio Mine is available on our website. Our Didipio Mine hosted a public hearing of the Philippine Congressional Committee on Indigenous Cultural Communities and Indigenous Peoples to explore environmental and human rights allegations made against the operation. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 30 Economic performance and contribution The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 31 2019 financial and production results We have a strong asset base and focus on making long-term decisions while delivering consistent positive results and long-term value. We achieve this by managing the balance sheet to ensure we can meet short-term challenges while investing in the long-term growth of our company. All financials are reported in US dollars (US$) unless otherwise stated. Further details regarding entities included in our consolidated financial statements can be found in these statements published on our website. 2019 full year revenue of US$651.2 million was lower than 2018 due to the absence of gold and copper sales from the Didipio Mine in the second half of the year. This was partially offset by a higher than average gold price received. Lower year-on-year EBITDA largely reflect the temporary suspension of the Didipio Mine in the second half of the year and the associated carrying costs.

In additional to payments to government, our operations create jobs and purchase goods and services from local, national and international providers. In 2019, the economic value of wages and benefits distributed to OceanaGold employees was US$113.8 million and the total economic contribution distributed to local, national and international suppliers was US$499 million – 85 per cent of this procurement (more than $423 million) was invested within the countries that host our operations and projects. We prioritise local employment and procurement. We invest in social programs and local infrastructure in line with priorities identified by host communities and governments. These programs focus on local enterprise development and access to quality education, training and health care. Further details about our social investment programs can be found in the communities chapter on page 65 of this report.

In 2020 we will review and revise OceanaGold’s Code of Business Conduct. All employees and Board members are required to undertake anti-bribery and anti-corruption training every two years. A breakdown of training data for 2019 is available in Appendix 6 of this report. Gifts and conflicts register All staff, contractors and associates are prohibited from providing or accepting improper benefits (for example, benefits that could inappropriately influence the decision making of an outside party or an OceanaGold person). If the benefit is not an improper benefit, they are required to record gifts, benefits or entertainment with a value equal to or greater than US$150 but less than US$300 in our online gifts and conflicts register. If the gift, benefit or entertainment has a value greater than US$300 then, in addition to recording it, they will also seek prior approval before providing or accepting such benefit. General managers at each operation may impose a lower limit for the value of gifts, benefits or entertainment that are required to be registered or approved through our online gifts and conflicts register, considering the specific situation at each site. All sponsorships and donations made to external parties will comply with our sponsorship and donation compliance standard and our Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Standard and will also be recorded in the gifts and conflicts register. We made no political donations in 2019. In 2019 the gift and conflicts register was reviewed by an internal auditor. The summary of the gift and conflicts register is presented to the Audit and Financial Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. Performance in brief: Maori blessings at Waihi When a new, large piece of equipment arrives at our Waihi Operation, it is blessed in a traditional Maori ceremony to look after it, the people who work with it and the environment it works in. Because we are unaware of what has happened to this equipment in the past, the ceremony makes sure it is safe to use (in cultural and spiritual ways). Our team at the Waihi Operation carries out a blessing with the kaumatua (elder) and kuia (women elders) from the local marae (meeting place). The ceremony involves the removal of tapu, which is the state of being negative. In the Maori spiritual code, all places, people and objects have differing levels of tapu. The ceremony then proceeds to whakanoa, which is the process of making something okay, to free it from the extensions of tapu. This ceremony always concludes with a waiata (song) and is followed by kai (food).

While we report and measure data against the number of employees in this report, we also provided employment for approximately 1,176 contractors, bringing our total workforce in 2019 to 3,346. We employ contractors to do specialised activities and when site staff do not have the capacity for additional work. This includes activities such as processing plant shutdown and maintenance, road construction, tailings storage facility construction, Didipio Mine camp maintenance, and occupational hygiene. More information about how we calculate contractor numbers is available in Appendix 6 of this report. We prioritise local employment and training opportunities to ensure the communities that host our operations benefit. We recognise the importance of strong local representation at all levels of our company and continue to roll out leadership development programs focused on strengthening leadership talent across our business. We provide training and development to grow our local workforce and, where required, support people to relocate to the communities where we operate. We regularly communicate with our employees and provide ongoing support during times of organisational change, including a message from our Chief Executive Officer to all employees at least monthly. In addition to base salary and superannuation, employees across OceanaGold may also receive a variety of benefits and entitlements including health insurance, accommodation, company vehicle, annual performance bonus and performance rights grant (shares). Minimum periods of notice apply to any significant changes to employment. More details are provided in Appendix 6 of this report. In 2020 we will commence a review of our people and culture policy, standards and operating procedures. This includes: • designing the organisational culture and expected behaviours for our leadership team, a leadership model aligned to deliver the corporate strategy, and more closely align leadership effectiveness with reward schemes • revising systems of work and behavioural expectations across the company to achieve the constructive culture we aspire to • enhancing the integration of positions to the company purpose • revising the performance management and feedback methodology • enhancing system-enabling decision-making (e.g. pay modelling and equity analysis) • developing interview guides to remove selection bias. Information about remuneration policies for our Board and executives is available in our Annual General Meeting (AGM) papers, available on our website. Code of Conduct Everyone working for OceanaGold is responsible for ensuring we consistently achieve the highest standards of business conduct. Our Code of Conduct describes the standards by which we undertake our business and applies to all OceanaGold representatives including directors, officers, employees and contractors acting on our behalf. The code is supplemented by policies and procedures that establish appropriate standards and processes in relation to health and safety, environmental management, human rights, community engagement, culture and heritage, employment and diversity, anti-bribery and anti-corruption and investor relations. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 39 As part of our induction process, new employees undertake training on our Code of Conduct and its associated policies and procedures. Our anti-corruption and anti-bribery training program further support the implementation of the code. For more information you can view our Code of Conduct on our website. Employee breakdown Employee numbers across OceanaGold remained stable from 2018 to 2019. The increase of 5.75 per cent represents additional employees working on the development of the Martha Underground development in Waihi and continuing ramp-up of the Haile Gold Mine. 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Australia 50 53 35 37 29 Canada 2 2 5 6 5 New Zealand 908 858 741 741 622 Philippines 745 779 752 752 700 Singapore 4 3 0 0 0 USA 461 357 358 292 159 El Salvador 0 0 0 39 36 Total 2170 2052 2068 1867 1551 Employee turnover Turnover decreased from 23 per cent in 2018 to 13 per cent in 2019. The increase in 2018 represented the integration of roles based in Manila in the Philippines into the team at the Didipio Mine and also an increased turnover at our Haile Gold Mine. The total number and rate of new employee hires and employee turnover by age group, gender and region is available in Appendix 6. 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Rate of turnover 13% 23% 15% 12% 22% Didipio Mine management representation The Didipio Mine is the only operation with a significant number of non-local management (non-citizen or permanent resident) employed. In addition to the Didipio Mine’s policy for promoting local employment opportunities, the operation has a policy to reduce the number of expatriates (staff coming from overseas) across the operation. In 2019 we redefined leadership to include executives, general managers, managers and superintendents. Under this definition we had 72 leadership positions at Didipio. Sixty-two of these positions were held by local employees and 10 (13.9 per cent) of these positions were filled by an expatriate. This is a decrease from 33 per cent expatriate leadership in 2018. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 40 Inclusion and diversity A diverse workforce and an inclusive culture are crucial to the high performance and long-term success of OceanaGold and our ability to sustainably contribute to the communities where we operate. Bringing together people from a wide range of backgrounds—while promoting an environment that allows them to apply their diverse thought, skills, experiences and backgrounds—benefits all of our employees and stakeholders. Diversity at OceanaGold includes race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical ability or attributes, religious or ethical values system, national origin, political beliefs or other ideologies. Seventeen per cent of our employees in 2019 were female, the same percentage as 2018. The percentage of women in leadership positions increased, including the appointment of OceanaGold’s first female in a general manager position in 2019. Training and careers options for women at our Didipio Mine were featured in September 2019 in the Danish Institute for Human Rights report, Toward Gender-responsive Implementation of Extractive Industries Projects” There was one case of discrimination reported in 2019 at our Waihi Operation. The case was managed through a formal process (which includes a disciplinary process, mediation or termination) and resolved. There were no cases of bullying in 2019. By the end of 2021 we aspire to have 20 per cent women in our business and 20 per cent women in leadership and management positions. To support this, we are addressing our people and culture systems and hiring extra resources into our Corporate People and Culture team to support organisational culture, leadership development and talent acquisition. We are also assessing the skills required for tomorrow through programs such as ADaPT (Automation, Digital and Process Transformation), which will influence the future skills employees will require coming into our business.

In 2019 our Macraes Operation set about achieving greater female representation across its workforce to more proportionately reflect the community in which it operates. Women accounted for 14 per cent of the Macraes Operation’s workforce yet constituted 53 per cent of the New Zealand South Island population. In February the team set a target to achieve 20 per cent female representation in the workforce by 2023 and established a Women in Mining Committee to support gender diversity and inclusion; generate and action ways to support women in mining; and grow the number of women working at the Macraes Operation to better reflect the regional population. Emerging female leaders came together to identify support networks and development opportunities to ensure all employees—regardless of gender—were provided an equal opportunity to succeed. The Women in Mining Committee also engaged external consultants, such as Diversity Works, with experience addressing historic gender diversity barriers and developing female leaders. By the end of 2019—less than 12 months after establishing the Women in Mining Committee—female participation at the Macraes Operation increased by 3 per cent. And, as the committee continues to evolve, there is renewed hope that more people across the business will consider championing this proactive, progressive business initiative. In 2020 the Women in Mining initiative will form part of a wider diversity and inclusion focus. The Macraes Operation has set another bold target of 3 per cent to further increase female participation at its site by the end of the year, putting it on track to achieve its 2023 target. Image: Amber, Jackie, Charlotte, Lizzie and Pania (clockwise from top) are some of the team of female professionals contributing to the success of the Macraes Operation. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 43 Training and development In 2019 we continued our commitment to provide development and training opportunities to support our people to achieve their full potential. We delivered a wide range of on-the-job and technical training throughout the year, including safety training and training to meet local and position-specific requirements. On average, our employees received 37.52 hours of training in 2019. We also deliver training based on our responsible mining policies to employees upon hire and intermittently throughout their employment. This includes training on our Code of Conduct, human rights and anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Across OceanaGold we deliver various learning and development programs. Our leadership development program is designed to improve leadership capacity across our company and foster better relationships between team leaders and their teams. The program comprises three courses: Leading a Team, Leader as Coach and Strategic Leadership Development. Each course includes formal and on-the-job training and provides individuals with the tools and support necessary to enhance their skills in effective leadership. More information about these courses is available in Appendix 6. We celebrate our culture and history, and at our Waihi Operation all permanent employees and contractors participate in formal cultural awareness training to help improve awareness around Maori culture and history. Six hundred and thirteen people participated by 31 December 2019 after commencing in 2014. In 2020 we will focus on training to support the ongoing development of our constructive culture. This will include a review of our current training and the establishment of culturallybased training for all levels of the workforce. We will also commence a review of career pathways and professional development support and opportunities for more diverse learning channels, including online training.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 44 Performance in brief: The next generation of mining professionals “My favourite aspect of the internship was seeing how the different engineering disciplines work together within a singular team.” – Dylan Grbavac, Intern, Brisbane project office. OceanaGold welcomes the opportunity to work with students at our mining operations. In 2019 interns from the University of Queensland (UQ) Mining School joined our teams at the Macraes and Waihi operations and in the Brisbane project office to undertake our internship program. While providing the students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge in a practical setting, we also benefit from the presence of these budding mining engineers, gaining lots of fresh ideas and perspectives. If the relationship suits both the intern and our experienced teams, we will go on to hire the students after the internship period has ended. This was the case with Dylan Grbavac (above) who was the first intern to join our Brisbane project office in 2019. In his third year at UQ, Dylan is studying a Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) with a major in Chemical Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry. He is expecting to graduate in 2021 and, while he completes his degrees, Dylan is working with us one day a week. Freedom of association and collective bargaining All of our employees have the right to collective representation and are free to join a union. We have collective bargaining agreements in place at our Didipio Mine and at the Macraes and Waihi Operations. Forty-two per cent of all OceanaGold employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements in 2019. This is an increase from 36 per cent in 2018 and represents New Zealand Government changes to the powers of the union and the transfer of some employees at Didipio from fixed-term to regular employment that includes membership under the collective bargaining unit. Each collective agreement includes consultation and negotiation periods. We strive to work in partnership with all unions. In 2019 we communicated regularly with the E tū union, representing employees at the Waihi Operation, the Amalgamated Workers Union (NZ) representing employees at the Macraes Operation and Pun-oh-ohhaan Hi Kiphodan Organization, representing employees at our Didipio Mine. At the Waihi Operation we completed mining from the main veins of the Correnso Underground and commenced the development of the new Martha Underground. This resulted in a production gap of approximately 12 months and the processing plant has been put into care and maintenance (in early 2020). The restriction of access for mining supplies at Didipio caused the temporary suspension of underground mining in July 2019 and of processing in October 2018. As a result, we issued notices of temporary suspension to employees in August 2019 (which came into effect in April 2020). The health, safety and wellbeing of our employees remains our priority and this was not an easy decision to make. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 45 Throughout this process the Didipio Mine has worked with employees to mitigate the financial impact of temporary lay-offs. This included the extension of employment for nine months and an allowance for employees to draw down all days in lieu, sick leave and annual leave to continue to receive a wage. Other support, including the extension of current medical benefits to employees and their families, allowances, advances and deferral of loan deductions is also available to eligible employees. We continue to build direct relationships between our employees and management teams that are based on leadership, effective communication, respect and mutual trust. Within our business, we implement various workplace relations models, including individual agreements and collective bargaining agreements in accordance with local laws and regulations. 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Number of employees under a collective 906 737 850 842 439 bargaining agreement % of employees under a collective bargaining 42% 36% 41% 45% 28% agreement Child and forced labour In accordance with United Nations Global Compact Guiding Principles, we support the abolition of child labour across OceanaGold and by our contractors. In 2019 we did not have employees under 18 years of age at any of our operations. We employed two people who were 18 in 2019: a diesel mechanic at the Macraes Operation and a QAQC drill technician at the Haile Gold Mine. They were the youngest employees across OceanaGold in 2019. For information about how we are implementing the requirements of the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018, see page 25 of this report. Employee engagement We continue to enhance employee engagement within operations and across OceanaGold. We launched a global employee newsletter in 2018 and distribute 11 editions per calendar year (from February to December). This includes regular stories featuring our growth and performance across each area of our sustainability performance and a message from our CEO. The first full calendar year this was published was 2019, with an average open rate of 56 per cent. Our OceanaGold LinkedIn page is also a source of information for our employees, with approximately 44 per cent of employees connected to the page as at 31 December 2019. During 2019 we also implemented tactics to improve health, safety and wellbeing communication and enhance operational communication channels. These included site-based newsletters and leadership development to improve leadership capacity across our company and to foster better relationships between team leaders and their teams. In 2020 we will increase our use of video to communicate with employees and develop a new website that will make more information about our company available. This will be easily accessible internally and externally. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 46 In 2019 we conducted a company-wide Human Synergistics culture survey to measure our culture and gain key insights into how we can build the culture that will support us into the future. That survey highlighted the existing culture as quite oppositional, with some passive/defensive styles. However, we also found the workforce is well-trained, understands the company’s mission and goals and is adaptive and responsive to external changes. The survey also gave us the opportunity to ask our workforce about its preferred culture. The results showed a preference for a constructive culture, with humanistic-encouraging as the primary style and self-actualising as the secondary style. To learn more about the Human Synergistics survey and results, visit their website. In 2020 we will continue our journey toward a more constructive culture. This will include: • designing the organisational culture and expected behaviours for our leadership team • developing a leadership model aligned to the corporate strategy • more closely aligning leadership effectiveness with reward schemes. We will measure our progress by implementing a biannual leadership effectiveness pulse check of 300 randomly selected employees. Josue and Ruth at the 2019 Haile Family Fall Festival.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 49 Health and safety performance Our Health and Safety Management System operates under our Integrated Management System and applies to all of the workforce at any sites under our direct control. We benchmark our systems and performance against industry best practice and foster a strong companywide culture that prioritises safety, with a focus on systems that promote employee engagement and actioning feedback in a timely manner. Our system sets risk and hazard identification and reporting processes, used for both routine and non-routine activities and hazards are controlled using the hierarchy of controls. We ensure these processes are followed as part of our routine monitoring, including audits and task observations. The system also sets our requirements for incident investigation and reporting. The results from all of these processes are used to continuously improve our systems. More information is available in our Health and Safety Policy on our website. 2019 total work hours OceanaGold staff Casual staff Contractors 7,572,332 4,751,072 0 2,821,259 Safety performance indicator 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Lost time injury (LTI) 7 9 11 6 3 Lost time injury rate (LTIR) 0.92 1.10 1.13 0.57 0.35 Total recordable injuries (TRI) 27 37 39 42 21 Total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR)* 3.57 4.53 4.00 3.99 2.69 Fatalities 0 0 0 1 0 *Based on one million worked hours There was a miscalculation in the reporting of work hours in 2018. The correct total work hours for 2018 was 8,165,703 hours (not 11,519,834 hours as reported in the 2018 Sustainability Report). Despite the miscalculation, there is no change to the 2018 results. In 2019 we achieved our target of a below-four total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR). In 2019 the TRIFR was 3.57, a significant drop from 4.53 in 2018. We had a total of 27 recordable injuries including seven lost time injuries, 18 medical treatment injuries and two restricted work injuries. This is a result of our continued focus on a strong safety culture at all levels of OceanaGold. There were no fatalities at our operations in 2019, and no new cases of occupational disease were recorded. Analysis of injury data identified the major injury types for the year as lacerations (48 per cent), fractures (22 per cent) and sprains or strains (19 per cent). Hand injuries remain the most common type of injury (44 per cent of recordable injuries). This percentage is higher than 2018 (41 per cent). However, it represents fewer cases of hand injury due to the overall lower number of injuries in 2019. Year-on-year injury analysis is available in Appendix 3 of this report. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 50 In 2019 we developed a balanced safety scorecard that enables us to measure and demonstrate continuous improvement in our health and safety performance. The balanced scorecard reflects an increased focus on the importance of injury severity as well as injury frequency in assessing the effectiveness of our safety management systems. It includes the monitoring of a key lead indicator of safety performance to measure the effort being employed to reduce the likelihood of workplace incidents. The rules are outlined as a safety performance rating scale, which is applied across four main identified safety metrics: • expectations (4) = Nil fatalities AND 2/3 other indicators are outstanding AND no indicators are less than target • meets all expectations (3) = Nil fatalities AND all other indicators meet target • needs improvement (2) = Nil fatalities AND any 1/3 other indicator less than target • fails to meet most expectations (1) = Any fatality OR 2/3 other indicators are unacceptable. Each metric has defined thresholds for what is unacceptable, what needs to be improved or meets the target, and what is considered to be outstanding performance. 4Performance indicators 1—unacceptable 2—passable 3 target outstanding Fatalities One or more Nil Total Recordable Injury TRIFR > 4 3.99 > TRIFR > 3.31 TRIFR<3.30 Frequency Rate High Severity Injury Cat 4 IFR > 0.5 Cat 4 IFR < 0.5 Cat 4 IFR = 0 Frequency Rate High Potential Incident <80% >80% >90% >95% actions completed In 2020 and beyond, all incidents and HPI actions will be tracked to ensure key organisational learnings are captured at all of our sites. The goal is to ensure meaningful global actions are taken after any significant incident and in turn prevent the recurrence of the incident. In 2020 we will also develop and launch two standards manuals for health performance and safety performance. Aligned to our Health and Safety Policy, these standards set the minimum performance requirements and systems across OceanaGold. Occupational health and hygiene We focus on the potential short and long-term impacts we have on our workforce. In 2019 we developed and implemented a global system for reporting and tracking occupational exposure monitoring results and controlling effectiveness. This system enables us to apply a global common best practice approach and meet the requirements in each of our operational jurisdictions. Our occupational exposure risk profile is determined by utilising all available information and parameters to determine the likelihood of an exposure and potential health consequence. Our database allows us to track individuals and their workplace similar exposure group (SEG). The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 51 Monitoring is undertaken through routine medicals, exposure sampling and biological sampling determined by an initial health risk assessment. The occupational hygiene monitoring plan is never static and is always evolving based on past results and measured observations. Tasks and SEGs are reviewed regularly based on risk and monitoring results. In 2020 we will extend our periodic health monitoring to reflect the level of risk, better understand the health impacts of the working environment and validate the exposure monitoring data. We will continue to systematically improve our work to eliminate workplace exposures and any potential for our workforce to develop chronic illnesses. More information about our occupational health and hygiene programs and data registration is available in Appendix 3 of this report and on our website. Health and wellbeing Occupational health and wellbeing is vital to our employees and our business activities. In line with the World Gold Council Responsible Gold Mining Principles, we promote the physical and mental wellbeing of our workforce. In 2019 we focused on health and wellbeing with the OceanaGold-wide use of the InHealth database and the introduction of new health targets. One of those targets was the introduction of physical activity programs for staff and contractors, with a focus on active travel (e.g. cycling instead of driving), building physical activity into work hours, reducing sedentary behaviour and the introduction of physical activities such as team sports, fitness classes, running clubs and team challenges. In 2020 and 2021 we will develop a framework to measure the success of initiatives undertaken to support mental and physical health across OceanaGold. Our short-term goal is to record observed changes in the awareness of, and access to, positive health drivers. Tracking the health profile of our workforce over time will enable us to identify a positive change in an individual’s wellbeing.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 52 Performance in brief: Reducing occupational noise exposures at the Haile Gold Mine “Careful collection and presentation of data is key. And, while my job can be challenging at times, improving the health, morale and productivity of our team is what drives me to do better, every day.” – Mary Koerner, Health and Safety Superintendent, Haile Gold Mine. Limiting noise impacts on machine operators presents significant challenges for the mining sector, which experiences one of the highest occupational noise exposure rates and hearing loss risk to its employees. Loud noise is not only a physical hazard, but also contributes to psychological stress, reduces productivity, interferes with communication and can lead to incidents. At OceanaGold, we value employee-generated ideas and processes that test and implement innovative solutions to improve working conditions. Mary Koerner, Health and Safety Superintendent at the Haile Gold Mine recently identified exploration drills were exposing employees to excessive noise levels. Motivated by a personal drive to improve the quality of work life for her team, Mary partnered with the exploration team to test a number of engineering controls to reduce the drills’ noise levels. After identifying the noise sources, the team developed a solution which placed a one-inch insulation under the rotation guard for the drill steel, which enclosed the noise source and created a barrier between it and the driller. This solution succeeded in reducing the sound pressure level from 98.7 dBA to 93 dBA. Mary says this innovative solution will have profound, positive impacts on the drillers’ quality of work life for years to come. Teamwork, with collaborative processes that fostered innovation, were the keys to success. Image: Mary with Exploration Supervisor, Justin, doing a noise survey to measure the reduction of noise from the drill rig after installing insulation to create a sound barrier. Safety in our culture To achieve workforce health, safety, hygiene and wellbeing, we align our safety behaviours to our core values of respect, integrity, teamwork, innovation, action and accountability. Under our Integrated Management System we continued to embed high-performing safety behaviours in our culture in 2019. We continued to enhance our governance framework and supporting systems and our risk management process, which is aligned to the International Standard for Risk Management – Principles and Guidelines ISO 31000 (2009). This was achieved by updating our corporate health and safety standards to align with best practice critical controls (barriers that, if in place, will stop the incident occurring). Each operation enhanced their Principal Hazard Management Plans and their Principal Control Plans to align with the corporate standards. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 53 Measuring safety performance In 2019 we continued to drive safety leadership at all levels. We enhanced safety communication to provide additional transparency and context around key safety initiatives and enhance accountability. The use of new dashboard software has improved our ability to share and visualise real-time data. One of our key safety initiatives is the Gold Standard Program. The Gold Standard Program sets key performance indicator (KPI) targets for leaders (including superintendents, managers and general managers) to measure their participation in field-based task observations, workplace inspections and audits. In 2019 we achieved our target of 100 per cent compliance, partly due to better transparency: we more frequently reported real-time data. The table below demonstrates our quick journey to compliance during 2019. A breakdown of safety leadership activity measures (demonstrated below by colour) is available in Appendix 3 of this report. Gold Standard Involvement in 2019 100% 80% 60% 40% 20% 0% % Below Target % At or above Target % Achieving Gold Safety audits Another measure that supports our safety culture is our safety compliance audit program, conducted annually to track the implementation of our health and safety management system and operational performance standards across our operations. Each year we assess onsite implementation and conformance with approximately one-third of the corporate Health and Safety Standards. The standards selected for assessment reflect priority areas identified for improvement at operational and safety reviews, health and safety performance data and the audit results from previous years. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 54 In 2019 our audits focused on: • system standards: leadership and commitment, compliance obligations (with specific focus on regulatory compliance in HSE), competence and awareness, communication and consultation, monitoring, measurement, analysis and review • health standards: medical assessment and role capability, workplace occupational health monitoring • safety standards: ground control, inundation and inrush, working at heights, tips, ponds and voids, tree felling, extreme weather, personal protective equipment and aviation. In 2019 the operations achieved a 77 per cent audit compliance result. This was a reduction from 83 per cent in 2018. This reduction was a result of increased focus in achieving best practice in the area of health. Routine medicals required functional capacity assessments to be more clearly defined to the role as well as medicals targeting assessment of the potential health risks associated with the role.

Mine and community safety All of our operations have the expertise and specialised equipment to provide rescue and safety services on site as well as, in some circumstances, additional capacity to assist local emergency and rescue services when required. The five key functions of our Mines Rescue and Emergency response teams are: 1. implement management plans 2. undertake mandatory skills competency training 3. manage emergency response equipment 4. implement the operational Emergency Response Program 5. facilitate emergency response training onsite and within host and adjacent communities as required/requested. These mine rescue teams are highly trained and certified in the areas of: • incident response, both onsite and offsite • underground search and rescue (including long duration) • fire (surface and underground) • HAZMAT (hazardous materials) • high and low-angle vertical rope rescue • vehicle extrication • Pre-Hospital Emergency Care (PHEC) medics • exploration remote rescue • working at heights • medical and accident response • apparatus and gas detection.

The building is now open for anyone to visit our community relations team, for meetings and events and as a local mining history museum. Engagement Our vision to create shared value for our company and our diverse stakeholder groups can only be achieved through effective engagement and consultation. By doing so, we better understand and meet each groups’ specific needs. Under the Responsible Management Framework, we launched the External Affairs and Social Performance (EA&SP) Management System in 2019. This governs OceanaGold’s engagement activities at all levels across OceanaGold. Practice areas covered by the management system include community relations, engagement with government, civil society and stakeholders, internal and external communication, human rights due diligence, land access and sustainable development. Our EA&SP Management System is aligned with industry best practice and benchmarked against the World Gold Council Responsible Gold Mining Principles, the Equator Principles and International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Principles and Performance Expectations. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 61 We also launched a Government and Civil Society Policy, which sets out our commitments for how we engage with national, regional and local governments, civil society and other stakeholders in a responsible and transparent manner to exchange ideas, plans and opportunities to create shared value. We launched three position statements, which provide clarity on OceanaGold’s views on issues of interest to our stakeholders: 1. Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining: how we engage with artisanal and small-scale mining 2. Contract transparency: our position on transparent disclosure of contracts between OceanaGold and host governments 3. Disclosure of taxes, royalties and other payments to government: how we disclose our tax, royalty and other payments to governments. The management system is supported by the EA&SP manual (including all related policies, statements of positions and standards). It is available on our website. While our operations positively impact host communities, they also have the potential to create significant negative impacts. These negative impacts include amenity effects, in-migration, land use and closure. This management system helps us ensure we assess, respond and mitigate our impact on host communities. In 2019 we conducted a gap assessment at the Haile Gold Mine, Waihi and Macraes Operations and Reefton Restoration Project against the EA&SP Management System. In 2020 we will conduct an internal audit of all of our operations against select areas of the system, based on the areas of highest risk outlined in the gap assessment including the Complaints and Grievance Mechanism, Human Rights and EA&SP Management Standards. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 62 Our stakeholders We have mapped our key stakeholders at a corporate level and categorised them as: • employees and contractors • labour unions • host communities and indigenous groups • business partners • regulators • investors • customers • non-government organisations • media • industry peers and associations. We use the feedback we gain from stakeholders to improve the way we manage key issues and impacts, respond to concerns or issues relating to our business activities, identify opportunities, inform our business strategy and activities and develop collaborative social investment programs. We are continually improving the way we manage and report information relating to our stakeholder engagement activities, permitting and compliance obligations with a focus on enhanced consistency and continuity at operational and corporate levels. Each of our operations has communication and engagement plans in place that are informed by stakeholder identification, mapping and analysis and social risk and impact analysis. These ensure we conduct all engagement activities in an equitable and culturally appropriate manner, with the maximum transparency commercially possible. Our stakeholder engagement management database, InForm, provides a centralised system that is used across all of our operations. Our Privacy Policy outlines how OceanaGold and its subsidiaries collect, use and manage personal information in compliance with applicable laws. Where our policy differs from local laws, we comply with whichever is more stringent. In 2020 we will implement a privacy information handling framework and training for all employees across OceanaGold involved in the collection or handling of private information. More information about our stakeholders, their areas of interest and how we engage with them is available in Appendix 4 of this report. Pieter, Melissa and Jackie at our OceanaGold booth at the 2019 New Zealand Minerals Forum The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 63 Performance in brief: Relocation of the Baker Cemetery “Each step along the way was coordinated with the descendants and family members who were invited to participate at the gravesites.” – David Thomas, Country Director, Haile Gold Mine. After two years of extensive study, exploration and community engagement, the remains found in the single-family Baker Cemetery—found by chance at OceanaGold’s Haile Gold Mine in 2017—have been reinterred into their final resting place at a nearby relative’s family cemetery plot. We discovered the Baker Cemetery site by chance while conducting a wildlife survey as part of the mine’s Wildlife Management Program. The findings became the subject of an immediate archaeological survey, which revealed a small, unrecorded and abandoned cemetery at the mine. Complying with OceanaGold’s Cultural and Heritage Sites Standard, the Haile Gold Mine team worked with local regulatory authorities to determine how best to preserve the site. We contracted an independent archaeological team to conduct a more thorough examination, during which we identified seven gravesites in total, all belonging to the Baker family and dating back to the 19th century. After an extensive investigation, we contacted descendants of the Baker family, who were engaged in the process to relocate the gravesites. We also undertook a significant public stakeholder engagement process involving a six-month notification period, community meetings and four public hearings to agree on a relocation plan. Prior to proceeding with the relocation we attained full and unanimous consent from the Kershaw Community, Regulatory Authorities (State Historic Preservation Office), the State of South Carolina, Town Council and County Council. Image: The headstone of John “Darling” Baker (1848-1886) who was buried at the Baker Cemetery with his wife, Barbara. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 64 Social investment We are committed to making a positive contribution to the social, economic and institutional development of the communities that host our business activities. We recognise communities’ right to self-determination and develop respectful social investment plans in consultation with host communities. This ensures our programs align with community-identified needs and priorities and support social and economic development in a manner that avoids dependencies over the long term. This is reflected in our new Contribution to Sustainable Development Standard, released in 2019. Primarily, our social investment programs contribute to: • education, training and employment • community health • local business development • community infrastructure. In 2019 we invested US$3,880,552 in social programs, donations, in-kind support and community infrastructure. The full breakdown of our investment is available on page 35 of this report. A table outlining our social investment programs at each of our operations and the Reefton Restoration Project (closure and rehabilitation of the former Globe Progress Mine) is available in Appendix 4 of this report. Local procurement We prioritise local procurement at all of our operations. This includes mining equipment and supplies, specialist mining services and general site services. In 2019, our total procurement spend was US$499,157,129. Of this, we spent US$124,146,151 (25 per cent) with local suppliers, US$298,924,032 (60 per cent) with national suppliers and US$76,086,948 (15 per cent) with international suppliers. Local procurement increased by two per cent, national procurement decreased by two per cent and international procurement remained at the same level. The combined local and national spend of US$423,070,183, representing 85 per cent of our total procurement expenditure, provides employment and business opportunities beyond the boundaries of our operations. The full breakdown of our investment is available on page 35 of this report. 15% 25% Local suppliers National suppliers International suppliers 60% The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 65 Complaints Our grievance mechanisms are supported by OceanaGold’s Complaints and Grievance Mechanism Standard. Launched in 2019 the standard provides clear definitions 'of concern,’ ‘complaint’ and ‘grievance’ and lists a set of requirements for grievance mechanisms across OceanaGold. It is consistent with our Human Rights Policy and aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Effective operational-level grievance mechanisms are important to: • help remediate any potential harm caused by OceanaGold • act as an early warning system and prevent conflict • provide critical information for broader human rights due diligence processes. Operational concerns, complaints and grievances Each of our operations record, monitor and respond to community concerns, complaints and grievances, taking corrective action as required. Our site-based community engagement teams consult and engage with host communities and provide an important conduit for identifying, reporting and responding to complaints and grievances. All of our operations have a community hotline or office where community members can report grievances (via phone, online or in person). Descriptions of the complaints at each operation and the set definitions for concerns, complaints, grievances and third party (dispute) resolution are available in Appendix of this report. General complaints (new complaints) 2019 2018 2017 2016 Waihi 229 170 213 315 Macraes 5 11 5 1 Haile 2 0 0 0 Didipio 8 26 17 84 Total 244 207 235 400 Total* disputes under mediation and negotiation 2019 2018 2017 2016 Waihi 1 0 1 0 Macraes 1 1 1 0 Haile 0 0 0 0 Didipio** 30 26 23 66 Total 32 27 25 66 *Totals include all disputes under mediation and negotiation in the calendar year and include those not closed out the year prior. **Disputes relating to land acquisition at the Didipio Mine have not been resolved and are currently on hold until operations resume. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 66 Performance in brief: How the Waihi Operation responds to complaints and grievances Historically, the Waihi Operation on the North Island of New Zealand has had a high number of complaints due to the proximity of the mining operation to residential areas (with a resident population of more than 4,500 people). Community support for the operation and its related activities is crucial to the ongoing viability of the mine, particularly in relation to the management of vibrations from underground blasting activities. Stringent regulatory requirements apply to our operations, including strict procedures for responding to and managing complaints. The Waihi Operation has a well-defined and accessible grievance mechanism with multiple channels available to the community to make their complaints known and recorded. All feedback and complaints from the community are reported to management daily and used to inform operational planning. The process for responding to complaints at the Waihi Operation requires a maximum response time of one working day, and this has been consistently applied. The Waihi Operation Community Engagement Line is a 24-hour free phone service that deals with queries, concerns and complaints. Complaints received are registered and then logged into the complaints database. As an example of the process, sound monitoring is undertaken after receipt of a noise complaint. Blast vibration data is obtained from our online records following a blastingrelated complaint. The source of the effect is investigated and located wherever possible and appropriate mitigation action is taken where practicable. All of the relevant monitoring data and mitigation actions are recorded in the database. Complainants are informed of the monitoring results, the outcome of any investigation and the mitigation action taken. Image: Gold was first discovered in Waihi in the 1800s. Like many mining towns, the community was established around the mine as you can see around the Martha Open Pit. Whistleblower service All stakeholders can report concerns relating to non-compliance with our Code of Conduct or unacceptable conduct through our independent, confidential whistleblower hotline. Concerns can be raised with our whistleblower protection officers or through our independent and confidential 24-hour whistleblower hotline service provided by Deloitte. Anyone can use this service by emailing oceanagold@deloitte.com.au. Alternatively, a full list of whistleblower service phone numbers for each country we operate in can be found in our Whistleblower Policy on our website. Where disclosures are substantiated, we take appropriate remedial action and advise the reporter on the progress and outcome of the process. We will not tolerate any form of retaliatory or discriminatory action against anyone who makes a disclosure or participates in an investigation. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 67 In 2019 four complaints were reported through Deloitte’s whistleblower service in relation to conflict of interest and occupational health and safety. These matters have been investigated and resolved. Indigenous Peoples We identify and acknowledge Indigenous Peoples, their duly elected representatives and their significant sites. We support ongoing engagement to anticipate and avoid adverse impacts or to minimise and mitigate such impacts. In 2019 we launched OceanaGold’s Human Rights Standard, which outlines specific requirements for engaging with Indigenous Peoples. The standard requires developing a knowledge base of Indigenous Peoples’ connections to land, water and natural resources, cultural traditions and traditional decision-making structures. The standard states OceanaGold should meet with potentially impacted Indigenous Peoples and relevant government authorities and agree on appropriate engagement and consultation processes. This should be done in a manner consistent with free prior informed consent (FPIC) and as early as possible during project planning. FPIC is defined in the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and International Finance Corporation Performance Standard 7 (IFC PS7) Indigenous Peoples. We advocate for, and are committed to, responsible mining. We do not support any persecution or operate our business in a way that raises the risk of persecution for indigenous (or non-indigenous) environmental and human rights defenders. As a company we value and respect a broad range of views. We are always open to dialogue and we value the potential for ongoing engagement with stakeholders to continually improve the way we operate. There were zero Incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples in 2019. Pastor Efren from the Life Way Bible Church in the host community of Didipio has been leading services for our workforce at our Didipio Mine since 2012. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 68 Indigenous agreements in place Our operations in New Zealand have six formal agreements in place with iwi. These memorandums of understanding acknowledge the relationship between indigenous communities and OceanaGold and agree to an approach for collaboration. The MOUs recognise the special status of each iwi as separate and distinct from each other and other groups. As such, the content of MOUs is confidential. Operation Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed The latest MOU was signed in 2019 with the group Ngati Puu. A further four are in place and currently under review with Ngati Hako, Ngati Maru, Waihi 5 Ngati Koi and Ngati Tara Tokanui. A draft MOU with Ngati Tamatera has yet to be agreed. We have signed an MOU with three Runanga: Puketeraki, Otakou and Macraes 1 Moeraki Runanga: governing councils and administrative groups of the local Maori community. MOUs are not required for the current mine scope. While the mine is not Haile 0 on Catawba Indian Nation land and we do not have an MOU with them, we do engage with them as a key stakeholder for Haile Gold Mine. There are currently no formally recognised ancestral domain or native title rights across our mine area. However, local communities and our Didipio 0 employee population self-identify as Indigenous Peoples from a number of cultural communities (tribes) in the Philippines. We acknowledge the diversity of Indigenous Peoples and engage accordingly. Performance in brief: Social change assessment at the Didipio Mine A social change assessment conducted at Didipio Mine in 2019 collected data to inform the mine’s future communityfocused operational decision-making. The project was key to understanding the potential impacts of our operations and, ultimately, to enhance our social performance. The assessment identified and analysed the social changes that have occurred since mining operations began in 2013 and how they were perceived by local stakeholders, which involved 14 barangays (villages) around our site and 36 families. We collected qualitative data through case studies, focus groups and in-depth interviews with the selected population mix. We also developed a remote sensing project that collected relevant geo-spatial data to look at changes in the mining footprint and, subsequently, the surrounding landscapes. This included artisanal mining, access roads and forestry across Didipio Mine’s lifecycle. The next phase will look at the analysed data to forecast the mine’s potential future social impacts so appropriate risk-based mitigation measures can be applied. Image: External Affairs and Social Performance Systems Advisor Danielle Crawford presented the results of the study at the Sustainable Mining 2019 conference in Santiago, Chile. In her presentation she discussed the social changes that occurred as a part of the Didipio Mine’s projects and operations. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 69 Resettlement In 2019 we launched our Land Access and Resettlement Standard, which establishes the requirements for managing all forms of temporary and permanent land access related to exploration, development and operations, as well as associated areas and facilities. It ensures that all land access plans align with OceanaGold’s four Responsible Land Access Principles: 1. avoidance of displacement impacts 2. fair market and replacement value 3. legal compliance and social legitimacy 4. fairness, equity and transparency. The standard covers all involuntary or voluntary resettlement impacts in the form of either physical or economic displacement. It is understood displacement can happen in any phase of the mine life cycle and commitments should be maintained in case of operation suspension or mine closure. The standard applies regardless of the number of people displaced, the level of severity of displacement impacts and if land access is undertaken by OceanaGold or by one of its subsidiaries, a government, a contractor or subcontractor or a joint venture partner. No in-voluntary resettlement occurred at any of our four operations in 2019. All land purchases completed were willing-seller, willing-buyer. Performance in brief: research consortium looks at the social aspects of mine closure “We are looking forward to participating in further research projects to ensure there is broad industry focus on the social and technical integration of mine closures.” – Sharon Flynn, EVP and Head of External Affairs and Social Performance. In 2019 OceanaGold became one of seven multinational mining companies that invested in a three-year research program aimed at better understanding how the social dimensions of mine closures are being considered, understood and managed. The program is being led by the Social Aspects of Mine Closure Research Consortium, a multi-party, industry-university research collaboration. It is an initiative of The University of Queensland’s Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining and was established to conduct research that challenges traditionally accepted industry norms and practices and seeks new approaches that place people at the centre of mine closure. In addition to understanding how the social aspects of mine closures are considered and managed by industry, the consortium will identify strategies for improving post-mining features for host communities and seek to better integrate social dimensions into the mine lifecycle transformation in the transition towards closure and beyond. At OceanaGold, we understand integrating social aspects into mine closure planning gives us a more complete understanding of the risks that closure generates for host communities and other stakeholders. This knowledge enables mitigation measures to be identified and implemented and for mine closure cost estimates to be more rigorous. Through the consortium, we are helping to drive the integration of social dimensions into the mine lifecycle and lift the industry’s performance by sharing and adopting leading closure planning practices. Initial research has found the industry has gained deep expertise in the technical aspects of closure. However, equivalent expertise needs to be developed to address the multiple social aspects of mine closure. This includes workforce planning, housing, town normalisation, post-mining economies, issues associated with infrastructure and services for a resident population, stakeholder engagement, heritage management and agreements with local and indigenous communities.

Corrective action plan developed and implemented The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 72 Our environmental approach We are committed to ongoing engagement with stakeholders and reporting our environmental performance against environmental topics. At each operation we work closely with our regulators and regularly host them at our sites. We also report all key and material environmental data annually in our sustainability report. Across OceanaGold we continue to focus on reviewing and improving internal systems to enhance our environmental performance, improve transparency and aid data collection. In 2019 we reviewed our approach to environmental governance. Our revised environmental governance structure now consists of three main components: 1. Environmental Policy 2. environment statements of position 3. environmental operational standards. In undertaking this work, we reviewed the OceanaGold Environmental Policy and developed statements of position for our environmental material risk areas of water, closure and rehabilitation, biodiversity, tailings storage facilities, cyanide and climate change and energy use and C02 emissions management. We also reviewed our environmental standards. Our statements of position publicly commit OceanaGold to specific actions in each of our environmental material risk areas. The environmental operational standards set the minimum requirements for our operations in relation to environmental management. During the revision process we have mapped our standards to externally recognised good practices, including the International Council for Mining and Metals, World Gold Council and International Finance Corporation requirements. As a member of the World Gold Council, we formally endorsed the new Responsible Gold Mining Principles in 2019. Our plan for how we will achieve conformance to the principles before 2022 is outlined on page 24 of this report and includes all sites being externally audited on key environmental areas. In managing our impacts we use the widely accepted mitigation hierarchy of avoid, minimise, restore or rehabilitate and/or offset to address effects on social, cultural and environmental uses and values in the areas where we operate. This hierarchy is built into our environmental operational standards. Details of our environmental governance policies and plans implemented at each operation are available in Appendix 5 of this report. Our performance Environmental audits In 2019 we significantly improved our environmental auditing results for our Haile Gold Mine as we continued to embed OceanaGold’s operational standards into the mine’s daily operation. The Didipio Mine and Macraes and Waihi operations all recorded continuous improvement in relation to their audit results. The 2019 corporate audits focused on the following standards: • used hydrocarbons • environmental noise and vibration • hazardous waste • waste rock. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 73 Audit performance 2019 2018 Macraes 81% 76.2% Didipio 95%* 90.4% Waihi 92% 90.8% Haile 81% 59.8% Average 87.3 % 79.3 % *A desktop audit was conducted for the Didipio Mine in 2019 due to the temporary suspension of the operation at the time the audit was scheduled. Compliance We continued our strong focus on operational controls and environmental management across all sites throughout 2019. We did not have any significant (level three or above) environmental incidents in 2019 (including spills). We captured minor technical and administrative breaches through our internal compliance monitoring system, as reported in the table below. In 2019 we registered the lowest number of non-compliant events in five years. These did not result in any action by a regulator or other agency. There were no significant fines or nonmonetary sanctions for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations in 2019.

The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 74 Emissions and energy use In 2019 we released a statement of position for climate change, energy use and greenhouse gas management. The statement outlines our commitment to: • understanding and managing the risks of climate change to our business and to the global community • managing CO2 emissions and energy use through responsible procurement • our focus on operational efficiency, continuous improvement and, where possible, sustainable carbon offset arrangements. In 2020 we will commence climate change-related risk and opportunity reviews that will be reported to our Board. We will also develop strategies to mitigate the risks associated with climate change and establish measures and targets to improve the efficiency of our energy use and to minimise our greenhouse gas emissions intensity. Since 2018 we have been monitoring our key energy sources monthly to enhance our understanding of energy consumption and continually improve site-specific energy and greenhouse gas management plans. Both our direct energy use and related CO2 emissions increased by four per cent in 2019. This was primarily attributed to the continuing ramp-up in production at the Haile Gold Mine and increased diesel consumption at the Macraes Operation. Our indirect energy use increased by one per cent, while our indirect CO2 emissions have decreased by three and a half per cent mainly as a result of the suspended operations at the Didipio Mine during 2019. 2019 energy use and CO2 emissions 2019 Energy – total direct (fossil fuel in GJ) 1,853,352 Energy – total indirect (electricity in GJ) 1,673,009 Total energy consumption (GJ) 3,526,361 2019 Greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e) – direct 129,160 scope 1* Greenhouse gas emissions (tCO2e)indirect 117,845 Scope 2* *Gases included in emissions calculations are limited to CO2 and consolidation is undertaken using an operational control approach.

Water and effluents Water management In 2019 we launched a statement of position on water management that outlines our commitment to: • reducing water-related impacts through collaboration, partnerships, product stewardship and minimising our use • our focus on operational controls, improving operational performance • managing water to meet the compliance requirements of each host jurisdiction and the requirements of the OceanaGold Water Management Framework. In 2020 we will establish the Water Management Framework including governance standards and operational performance requirements and will continuously review and improve the framework against the requirements of leading globally-recognised standards. We actively manage site water sources to protect the environment and host communities. None of our operations are in areas under water stress or withdraw or discharge water with total dissolved solids greater than 1,000 milligrams per litre. Ohinemuri River, Waihi, New Zealand.

Water is captured as rainfall and released. Water release in 2019 was lower than in 2018 due to droughts experienced in the Waihi region and the Didipio Mine’s temporarily suspended operations. Haile improved its water consumption in 2019, discharging more water relative to extraction than it did in 2018. Our operations proactively reduce water use and maximise water recycling. Where possible, we reduce our need to extract water from local catchments and ensure our host communities maintain access to healthy water sources. We actively monitor any water discharge from our operations, which will meet the operationspecific limits that local regulators set and our own water management standard. These limits are set through a regulatory process and are based on robust environmental impact assessments, considering appropriate mitigation. Water discharge from operations is monitored and assessed regularly and in 2019 all water discharged from our operations met the site-specific discharge limits set by host country regulators. We do not discharge into marine water bodies (the ocean). Water discharge destination Waihi Ohinemuri River N/A (water is not directly discharged but is stored and evaporates or is Macraes recycled) Haile Tributary of the Little Lynches River Didipio Dinauyan River The potential to reuse wastewater from our processing facilities has increased across all our operations. At the Waihi Operation, Haile Gold Mine and Didipio Mine, water treatment plants treat process water for recycling or release. At the Macraes Operation, water passes through a cyanide destruction plant prior to being stored and then evaporates or is recycled. These treatment plants are designed and operated to treat substances identified through the regulatory permitting process. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 77 In 2019 we withdrew 25,508 megalitres of water at our operations.

Our mining activities produce two main waste streams: rock (for example, excess rock and tailings) and other waste (for example, used oil, rags, batteries, fluorescent lamps). Each operation has a waste management plan that describes how each waste stream will be managed. Based on the fundamental principles of reduce, reuse and recycle, each waste management plan will also address the design, location and operational management of all waste storage facilities located onsite and any monitoring requirements for the waste streams to minimise long-term impacts from our waste management practices. Our operations ensure all hazardous waste is appropriately managed onsite. Where waste is required to be transported from site, we use licensed and approved waste transport contractors and recycle or dispose waste at licensed and approved facilities. All of our operations have a detailed waste rock management plan that defines stack construction, drainage, layout, height and other dimensions. The plan also details mitigation measures to manage any acid and metal-generating material that may be found in extracted overburden material. We implement strategies to reduce the potential discharge from acid-generating material (such as rock we move to reach gold-bearing rock). This includes the early identification of all non-acid forming (NAF) and potentially acid forming (PAF) material that is segregated and stacked to ensure PAF material is encapsulated. This technique is resource industry best practice and is incorporated in waste rock management plans where required.

Performance in brief: Haile’s Cyanide Code certification In July 2019 Haile Gold Mine achieved full compliance certification from the International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI) following the first external audit of cyanide management at the mine. ICMI compliance was a critical step for Haile Gold Mine in South Carolina to demonstrate its excellent performance in responsible and safe mining practices. In addition to Haile, cyanide is used at our Waihi and Macraes operations in New Zealand as a critical ingredient to extract gold from ore during processing. Inappropriate management during this process can lead to significant impacts on our communities, workers and the environment. We have a strong focus on responsible management. This is demonstrated in our Cyanide Statement of Position, which publicly states our commitment to the responsible management of cyanide. In this statement we commit to continue managing all aspects of cyanide during the extraction process, from transport and handling through to usage and disposal in accordance with the requirements of each host country. We have also committed to meet the principles of the International Cyanide Management Code. Image: The reagent building at Haile with sodium cyanide ISO container in the unloading station. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 79 Biodiversity In 2019 we released a statement of position on biodiversity management that outlines our commitment to reducing impacts on biodiversity and to manage all aspects of our business to meet the compliance requirements of host country regulations, minimise operational impacts and seek opportunities to foster biodiversity. In 2020 we will develop an OceanaGold Biodiversity Management Framework incorporating operational standards that detail management performance requirements. We will continuously review and improve the framework against the requirements of leading globallyrecognised standards. We conduct biodiversity assessments prior to exploration, development and operations and throughout the life of the mine. We effectively manage the land under our stewardship, including protecting biodiversity and cultural values. We understand some of our host communities have a long-standing connection to the land we lease or own and this will be respected. Our existing land management practices include: • sediment and erosion control • waste rock siting and management • storm water diversion • soil profiling and management • soil conservation • progressive rehabilitation • hydroseeding pit walls and waste rock stacks. We take great care to minimise our environmental disturbance by ensuring our workforce takes practical steps with equipment and during their daily work activities. This is enhanced with regular, site-based environmental management training sessions and internal communication updates.

The totals also reflects the removal of roads from the Didipio rehabilitation area. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 80 Many of our sites connect high biodiversity areas and support, or have the potential to support, species and ecological communities that are significant. As part of our environmental assessments, we map key flora and fauna species that are known to exist within the areas we operate and adhere to strict protocols as set out by each area’s environmental governing bodies. The Archey’s Frog (Leiopelma archeyi), found in the Coromandel Peninsula, is listed as critically endangered but with a stable population on the IUCN Red List. This is the region where we are currently conducting exploration of the Wharekirauponga (WKP) deposit, approximately 10 km north of our Waihi Operation. We conduct our exploration activities at Wharekirauponga under strict conditions required by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and are conducting extensive ecological surveys as part of our exploration program. We have ruled out any possibility of open cut mining on the surface at Wharekirauponga. More information about our responsible approach to exploration at Wharekirauponga is available on our website. Opportunities for rehabilitation are limited at most sites. Most of the land currently disturbed at our operations is considered active and not available for rehabilitation. Additional biodiversity data is available in Appendix 5 of this report. Concentrate haul truck drivers Bernardo and Randy from our Didipio Mine planting trees to mark World Ozone Day 2019. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 81 Performance in brief: pest control for ecological restoration at Reefton Pest control is one of the most important measures we take to improve biodiversity and protect vulnerable native species at our operations. The Reefton Restoration Project in New Zealand is located in a native forest, where invasive pests such as rats and possums impact on the area’s native species, particularly birds. The pest control program is well established. It commenced as a requirement of our access arrangement when the former Globe Progress Mine was commissioned and has expanded as the mine went into closure. The program strictly follows Department of Conservation practice guidelines, which also approve our permit to trap. The pest control program is run in partnership with the Rainy Creek Ecological Restoration Program, a local NGO that manages trap lines running through a high-value conservation area adjacent to Rainy Creek near our project site at Reefton. OceanaGold provides the Rainy Creek team with transport and resources, including maps locating the traps. We now have more than 60 traps in place along site access roads and around administrative buildings and mining workshops. In 2020 we will place an additional 30 traps around Fossickers Lake to increase pest control around the establishing wetlands, where we have seen a notable increase of bird activity. Image: Environmental and Restoration Technician, Megan, checking a rat and stoat trap on site. Closure In 2019 we launched a statement of position on closure and rehabilitation management. This outlined our commitment to delivering long-term positive legacies to the communities that host our operations. It also outlines how we manage closure and rehabilitation to meet the compliance requirements of our host jurisdiction regulations and the requirements of our Closure and Rehabilitation Framework. In 2020 we will establish a Closure and Rehabilitation Management Framework including governance standards and management performance requirements. We will continuously review and improve the framework against the requirements of leading globally-recognised standards. Planning for how we close and rehabilitate our mines is part of our ongoing mine management and planning. These plans incorporate the ways we can mitigate the operational impacts of our mines and include post-closure environmental, economic and social impacts. We also progressively rehabilitate where mining activities have been finalised. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 82 Our closure projects We continued closure work at four sites in New Zealand, Australia and El Salvador in 2019. More information about our closure projects is available on our website. Project Progress in 2019 As at the end of 2019 more than 118 ha (of the roughly 260 ha of Reefton Restoration Project disturbance) has been completely rehabilitated. This includes the (former Globe Progress Mine) beached surface of Fossickers Tailings Impoundment, which was South Island, New Zealand capped and restored in 2019 with Beech and Manuka planted during the spring planting season El Dorado We completed all property sales, continuing the process of (exploration project) dissolving our companies and assets in the country El Salvador Junction Reef (former Junction Reef Mine) Ongoing water monitoring Australia The tailings storage facility at the former Junction Reef Mine has been capped, rehabilitated and returned to its pre mining use of agriculture. Other areas of the site contain areas of high environmental value to both the New South Wales Government and the local community, who are represented by the Junction Reef Reserve Trustee. The former Globe Progress Mine (now known as the Reefton Restoration Project) is located at Reefton, within the Victoria Forest Park, on the west coast of New Zealand’s South Island. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 83 Tailings management We design, construct and manage tailings storage facilities (TSF) in compliance with all host country TSF regulations and, where applicable, any additional requirements consistent with our TSF management standards and framework. In 2019 we completed a program of work to improve our governance and management approach to TSF. This included: • corporate statement of position on tailings facilities • corporate Tailings Governance Committee including the CEO, Executive Committee members and an independent TSF expert • updated operational standards benchmarked against external guidelines • public web page with information about our TSF, which includes copies of the Church of England response letter and associated data disclosure file. In 2019 we committed not to undertake any new construction of upstream TSFs and to independently assure TSF-related disclosures in line with Global Reporting Initiative requirements. In 2020 we will develop further corporate guidance in relation to the management of TSFs and continue to operate the Tailings Governance Committee to ensure appropriate oversight is maintained at a senior level within OceanaGold. Our approach to tailings storage facility risk management involves three steps: 1. robust design and site management including permitting, operational management, monitoring and reporting 2. regular auditing of conformance with internal standards and permit requirements at a site and corporate level 3. independent reviews by third-party independent experts. We use the following methods of tailings storage: Didipio Haile Waihi Macraes Reefton Downstream Downstream (1) Downstream (2) Downstream with Downstream (1) (1) with composite upstream lift (2) In-pit storage (1) Paste backfill clay/HDPE liner Downstream (1) (underground) Descriptions and illustrations of our TSFs are available on our website. At the Didipio Mine, up to 40 per cent of inert mine tailings are diverted to a processing plant where they are mixed with cement and used as backfill material for underground mine voids. This reduces the volume of tailings delivered to the TSF. We also have two TSFs at Junction Reefs (a joint venture mine in New South Wales, Australia) that are now closed and rehabilitated. One was an in-pit storage and the other a traditional TSF. Both have been capped and revegetated. More detail about our TSF and management is available on our website. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 84 Investor mining and tailings safety initiative In April 2019 the Church of England Pensions Board and the Council on Ethics of the Swedish National Pension Funds wrote to the CEOs of 726 extractive companies requesting public disclosure about their TSFs. The letter contained 20 questions, with guidelines for compiling responses. Questions related to the exact location of TSFs as well as key design characteristics such as current volume, height of the facility, age of the facility, the raising method used and the dam hazard categorisation. We responded in June 2019 and were among the 47 per cent of all contacted companies that did respond. We provided full disclosure related to the questions for our 11 TSFs. Our disclosure noted: • all of our facilities have a closure plan in place and that this plan includes long-term monitoring • none of our TSFs has ever failed to be confirmed or certified as stable, nor have they experienced any notable stability concerns at any point in their history • all of our TSFs have full and complete relevant engineering records including design, construction, operation, maintenance and/or closure. In November 2019 the Investor Mining and Tailings Safety Initiative (IMTSI) reported on the responses to their disclosure request. Our letter of response, supporting information and the IMTSI report are available here and on our website. Tailings storage facility and waste rock stacks being progressively rehabilitated at the Didipio Mine The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 85 Performance in brief: Peer review of tailings management in Waihi Both tailings facilities at our Waihi Operation have extensive monitoring controls in place and are independently peer reviewed annually by a group of technical experts. The two downstream facilities were originally designed by an independent third-party expert in accordance with the New Zealand Society of Large Dams guidelines and based on a high potential impact classification. This is the highest risk category and is conservative for design purposes. The two structures were constructed around existing topographical features so that the final landforms will blend in with the surrounding landscape. Both tailings facilities have the following controls in place: • a monitoring plan reviewed and approved by local regulators • extensive internal monitoring requirements • detailed annual reporting requirements reviewing the stability and performance of pollution controls and environmental effects • annual peer review of the construction and operation of the facility. Decommissioned in 2005 and still frequently monitored, the first facility has provided OceanaGold with a substantial database spanning more than 20 years and demonstrating its continued excellent performance. The excellent water quality from this facility means that any excess water can be discharged directly into the nearby Ohinemuri river. Recognising the cultural aspects of our activities during operation and rehabilitation, iwi (Maori) participant joined the review team in 2019, which comprises geotechnical, hydrogeological, geochemical and rehabilitation experts. Peer reviewers are external experts—either from government institutions (e.g. research centres and universities) or consultants—selected in collaboration between our regulators (Waikato Regional Council and Hauraki District Council) and the Waihi Operation.

In 2019 work was undertaken to utilise our InHealth database to capture the work of the occupational nurses at our operations and collect and store all occupational hygiene data. Adapting this system to occupational health reporting and retrieval will be a significant step in streamlining reporting. Analysing the correlation between occupational hygiene and the impacts on worker health is crucial to manage worker health holistically. The InHealth database has enabled us to look at data and trends for occupational hygiene and improve our ability to connect the impacts to workers’ health. Short-term targets are education and greater awareness and communication about occupational hygiene and the signs and symptoms of exposure. Management of worker health will continue to improve as we continue to move to a collaborative approach between the occupational hygienist, site nurse and occupational physician. We employ registered nurses at all of our operations to preventatively identify any health and wellness issues within our workforce. All of our sites run health calendars that identify and promote health topics relevant to employees at that operation. Initiatives range from health talks and assessments to educational activities and collaboration with external agencies. We now have employee health groups that focus on occupational hygiene stressors in the workplace. In 2019 occupational hygiene consultative forums enabled areas of concern to be shared and this facilitated greater transparency with the workforce. Health risk assessments will be revised in 2020 at our New Zealand operations to determine what is acceptable or unacceptable risk and where more monitoring is required to determine the risk. Most of our operations engage independent, external occupational hygienists to develop monitoring programs, control plans and assess the risk of exposure to our workforce based on specific to site-identified risks. In late 2019 the Haile Gold Mine finalised its contract with an external provider and has this capacity available within the operation. Occupational hygiene data registration Our 2019 target of 100 per cent use of InHealth for occupational hygiene monitoring data was not achieved due to operations being temporarily suspended at the Didipio Mine in 2019. Our other three operations now fully utilise InHealth. The result was increased transparency and an improved ability to control and investigate occupational hygiene stressors. Significant effort was applied in 2019 to improve quality checks and control the accuracy and recording of occupational hygiene data across OceanaGold. Occupational health and hygiene sampling and analysis at our operations continued based on risk and the outcomes of prior monitoring results. In 2019 reporting negative hygiene testing results similarly to health and safety incidents improved, with 26 new events entered in the system. The main elevated hygiene stressors identified in 2019 were noise, diesel particulate matter, mercury in the gold room and inhalable dust. Investigations were undertaken to determine why and control plans implemented where necessary.

construction of a town hall Didipio Mine, • livelihood projects for co-ops and individual farms as part of our Philippines enterprise development and networking program • educational programs: 84 scholars, 33 teachers and 25 day care workers benefited • access to health services: salaries for 74 health workers providing services to 11 villages We continued annual funding to local community group ‘GO Waihi’ to organise and operate its Classic Car Beach Hop Warm-Up Party. GO Waihi was formed in 1997 to revitalise the central business district. The Beach Hop Waihi Operation, Warm-Up Party sees more than 700 cars on display in the town centre and New Zealand between 12,000 and 15,000 visitors to the township. We contributed investment in Waihi College Education Trust. Waihi contributes NZD 40,000 each year to the trust, which has been operating for 27 years We sponsored the Highlanders Rugby Club for NZD60,000, including passes for Macraes staff and regional community (schools) to watch the games. We spend NZD 45,000 annually on education funding to three local primary Macraes Operation, schools. New Zealand We made an NZD 12,000 contribution to the Orokonui Eco-sanctuary for education and biodiversity research purposes. We contributed NZD 10,000 to the creation of a community bike park in Palmerston We contributed and volunteered support to Mt. Calvary Community Outreach Centre. This is a non-profit organisation focused on academic support and social education and provides humanitarian assistance to children who are less fortunate or at risk in the Kershaw Community. The program has operated for more than 26 years in the community with volunteer support and a very small budget. We sponsored the 2019 Summer Native American Lunch and Learn cultural Haile Gold Mine, guest speaker programs. Although some are for adults, these speaking USA engagements are geared predominantly to educate Native American children of the community regarding their heritage and how integral their ancestors were to the region, as well as to enlighten other children who are not Native Americans. We sponsored the Catawba Indian Nation Preservation Project. This program was developed to enhance the Tribal Community Resource Centre to provide a more structured literacy program and culture-specific educational platform for the children of the Catawba community The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 99 Description of complaints at our operations Operation Number of Description and response complaints Waihi 229 The 229 complaints related to: • vibration, felt and heard and noise from underground blasting • damage to property • drill rigs outside working hours • noise related to exploration drilling rigs We remained compliant with our consent conditions as 95% of monitored events were under 5mm/s Macraes 5 • Access to public roads: resolved • Noise for operational activities: agreement under finalisation • Fencing: repairs agreed to but not finalised • Water quality (2): partially resolved, further works under way. All complaints have been investigated and are either resolved or currently being addressed Haile 2 Both complaints are due to blasting and vibration. No seismic data or technical data supports the concern, so the operation is conducting a structural assessment of each of the homesteads using a third-party structural engineer Didipio 8 Four complaints related to future land purchase agreements. These complaints remain open due to the temporary suspension of operations. Two complaints related to economic displacement. These complaints were both settled and compensated adequately. Two complaints related to environmental aspects around water loss and air pollution.

For data capturing, a concern will be registered as a concern but is treated similarly to complaints. Recording and tracking concerns is a good early warning system to identify emerging issues. In addition, in some contexts, people are reluctant to lodge official complaints but have legitimate concerns that should be known and addressed. Complaint A general expression of dissatisfaction with a situation or the behaviours of the business. Generally, a complaint will be able to be managed within the business and is resolved internally and at the first level. Grievance An escalation of a complaint as it is a serious feeling of wrongdoing. It may be that a complaint was not addressed to the satisfaction of the complainant. Generally, a grievance will be managed with third-party resolution or at least escalated to the corporate level and a remedy will be provided where OceanaGold identifies that it has caused or contributed to harm. Third-party Third-party resolution, which is culturally and legally acceptable, is an attempt to resolution affect a peaceful settlement between disputing parties via the facilitation of another independent third party, with all parties and a third party present at the same time. The parties involved in the dispute determine the resolution themselves rather than have it imposed on them.

The program comprises three courses: Leading a Team, Leader as Coach and Strategic Leadership Development. The OceanaGold Way: 2019 Sustainability Report 108 The Leading a Team course is designed to develop or refresh the basic supervisory skills of our leaders so they can lead and support their staff. In 2019 this was made a prerequisite program for the Leader as Coach course and for employees working in a leadership role for the first time. This training is provided by each operation’s people and culture team (formerly human resources) and runs across 24–36 weeks. As at 31 December 2019 21 per cent of employees in leadership roles across OceanaGold have completed the course. The Leader as Coach training course is designed to develop the coaching skills of our leaders so they can empower their people. Each cohort takes 23 weeks and allows leaders to learn and practise their new skills over time and, importantly, to measure their progress. As at 31 December 2019 23 per cent of employees in leadership roles have completed the course. In 2019 we launched the Strategic Thinking Development program for staff in senior leadership roles (general manager level and above). This program supports senior leaders with a common set of tools and processes and embeds strategic and critical thinking capability. As at 31 December 2019, 30 per cent of senior leaders have completed this program.
