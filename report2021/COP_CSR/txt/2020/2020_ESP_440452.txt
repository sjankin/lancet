That is why we supervise our waste generation and management, as well as the consumption of water and energy and associated emissions. Our Code of Conduct and our Environmental Policy define our internal processes and the guidelines to be followed by all the employees to avoid harming the environment. Given that our parks are not production centres, the consumption of raw materials is considered to be a non-material aspect. The main consumption of raw materials is that associated with restaurant activity. This depends on the type of menu offered, so it is not possible to establish consumption ratios for the raw materials that would provide information about efficiency of use. The corporate safety, health and environment area develops performance standards that incorporate the requirements related to environmental protection. These standards, as is the case with standards related to the health and safety of our customers and workers, are incorporated to the internal audit process carried out in our parks.

That is why work is being done in various fields to find an answer to these challenges. The main reason why it is difficult to find employees is that Belantis is not easy to reach by public transport. What is more, employees are recruited from other countries during the high season, so there is a challenge to ensure they reach the park from where they live. Three years ago, a fleet of bicycles was created that is provided free of charge to employees for their journey to work. At present there are 50 bicycles, as well as the necessary helmets, to make this free offer more attractive to employees. There is also the problem of finding employees in the region; among other reasons, this is because there is no way of reaching BELANTIS without a car. After long discussions with the public transport provider, in 2019 for the first time the park will have a public bus service available before the park opens and after it closes. In addition, employees are helped with a monthly quota of 20 bus tickets to encourage its use. More employees are expected to be found who have not had the opportunity to work in Belantis so far. Those who have so far arrived at work by car are expected to take the bus and, in this way, make a valuable contribution to the environment. Internal mobility: Use of electric vehicles BELANTIS has old diesel vehicles for its internal supply routes. The plan is to gradually equip a fleet of electrical vehicles. There is already an electric cart for gardening and the cleaning team. Germany is strongly committed to electric cars, so it will provide subsidies for these replacements. The change is therefore a realistic possibility, not only from an environmental point of view, but also financially. 26 Energy Indicator Unit 2019 Total energy consumption MWh 208,988 Electricity MWh 149,359 Natural gas MWh 53,134 Other fuels MWh 6,498 Energy from renewable sources MWh 55,724 Electricity MWh 55,072 Natural gas MWh Other fuels MWh 651 Energy from renewable sources % 27% Energy intensity MWh/103 guests 9.8 The details by region are included in the Performance Indicators table in Annex III.

Evaluating our approach 31.3% of water used in parks located in areas classified as under high or very high-water stress comes from recycled water. 28 Splish Splash Conserving water Resources In 1991, when Splish Splash was being constructed, the opportunity arose of reusing the water from washing the swimming pool filtering system for irrigation. The initial construction had a filtration system for 9 sand filters and their respective pumps. Subsequently a holding tank was designed and constructed to contain 300,000 litres of water used for washing the filtration systems. In one day of operation, each sand filter was washed at least once, generating a total of 225,000 litres of water used for washing every day; so, in the 86 days of operation each season, over 19 million litres of water are recycled. After each cycle of backflushing the water is kept in the tank until the chemicals evaporate. Following this procedure, the water is passed through an additional filter that was added to the holding tank and pumped through the irrigation system. As the park has expanded, the process used until now has been continued, and although the initial sand filters has been swapped for a more efficient Defender filter that does not require backflushing cycles, this method of recycling is still used for all the swimming pools that still use sand filters. Each of the water attractions in the park has smaller holding tanks to irrigate small sections of the area. Currently 100% of the irrigation of trees, plants, lawns and flowers comes from recycled water from swimming pools or wells. Amusement park Sustainable Water Management Plan (SWMP) In the 2017-2019 period the following measures included in the SWMP were implemented: Installation of specific meters in the water attractions. Improvement of the consumption records based on partial meters Raising awareness of users, raising awareness and training of staff. Preparation and dissemination of the Manual of Good Practice. Dissemination of the changes in water consumption. Adherence to the campaigns proposed by the City Council of Madrid or other bodies.

This includes cups for coffee and drinks, hamburger boxes, paper bags and straws. In addition, Raging Waters Sydney has organised a programme for the elimination of single-use cups. It urges customers to buy a cup that they can bring to the points of sale of drinks to receive a top-up with a discount. Work is being done in the restaurant areas of parks to together with all the rest. However, some parks have reduce food loss and waste, although no specific begun to adhere to national projects to reduce the calculations are made, and this waste is managed food waste. TusenfrydFood waste project “Recycling food is essential” Tusenfryd forms part of the “Kutt Matsvinn” project, whose aim is to reduce food waste in Norway by 20% by 2020 and reduce it by half by 2030, thus contributing to the United Nations Sustainability Goal 12.3. To achieve this objective Tusenfryd has trained staff and supervisors to reduce food waste, make orders in accordance with real needs, reuse products and sell products with a big warehousing stock. In turn, the project aims to develop a common tool and a reporting system to monitor food waste in each restaurant, thus contributing to the study of the overall situation in Norway.

Improvement plans Every year, each park prepares its strategic improvement plan on the health and safety of customers and workers. After the launch of the process in 2018, with the development and implementation of health and safety improvement plans for 2019 in all the parks in Europe, the process was extended in 2019 to the whole Group, with the drafting of the 2020-2022 Improvement Plans and the integration of environmental targets into them. • The Improvement Plan is proactive and long-term. • The actions under the plan are established according to a process that identifies trends and incidents, the findings of audits and inspections and all the relevant information for identifying the transforming projects that elevate the maturity of health and safety of the park to the next level. • It has a mandatory staff designed at Group level. • The number of targets that can be selected is limited to a maximum of four to be implemented during a plan of a 3-year period. • The process is cyclical and is closely linked to the management cycle. • The individual targets linked to the variable part of the salary are aligned with the Improvement Plan for the individuals responsible (in other words, the persons identified as responsible for specific actions included in the plan). • Once the strategic initiatives are implemented as a whole, they are maintained and become a routine part of the action plan. This process guarantees an approach that is geared to continuous improvement and also adapted to the specific needs of each park. 36 Safe and healthy workplaces Our objectives ❖ Provide safe and healthy workplaces for our employees and collaborators ❖ Zero damage Why is it important?

France, Dreams Come True and Children’s Wish • MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION Make-A-Wish Foundation is an international organisation that works to make the dreams of children suffering from terminal or long-term illnesses true; and to support and encourage them to continue to fight their disease. The Make-A-Wish Foundation is present in 50 countries, which allows them to collaborate with a number of the parks in the Group through its 39 subsidiaries, constructing lasting collaborations with local actors such as the Parques Reunidos Group. The members and volunteers of Make-A-Wish work directly with doctors to find the right time at which to make the children’s dreams come true. The children themselves participate actively in preparing their “wish”: they are given things to do that get them involved during the whole process and in which they must explain why they have the wish they have asked to come true. The value Parques Reunidos brings to its collaboration with Make-A-Wish is immense. The biggest wishes of many children continue to be to get to know their favourite characters and see exotic animals in real life. The Group’s parks offer the resources needed to make these dreams come true, very often almost exclusively at local level. 9 parks in the Group have collaborated with Make-A-Wish in 2019 The fight against child cancer Another of the areas of health on which the parks Foundation.

The project consists of making a number of educational visits to Selwo Marina, where the minors participating in the programme benefit from integrated personality development thanks to contact with the animals and staff. During the visits, the minors collaborate with the staff in the centre to carry out a variety of tasks related to the animals. The aim of these exchanges is for the young people to identify viable and positive occupational profiles in their development towards adult life.

Modern habits of consumption mean demand changes according to customer preferences, which vary constantly. The shops in our parks offer gifts and clothing that also have to be renewed continuously to respond to our guests’ tastes. Part of the merchandise requiring renewal is in perfect condition. The Regalos Unidos programme finds a perfect use for it via donations, which also reduce the generation of waste. This initiative makes donations of toys, textiles and accessories from our shops for foundations, NGOs, hospitals and specialised schools. Depending on their activity, our collaborators deliver the articles at Christmas parties, birthdays, raffles or as prizes in competitions. In this way, we use all the articles that are not sold each season. The ultimate goal of this donation programme is to raise the spirits of the children and people affected by chronic or rare diseases, or by any disability; and to generate a little more hope in their daily lives. 82 EDUCATION AND AWARENESS Education and awareness are the first step in caring for the environment and threatened species Climate change, the impact of plastic waste, the special task of making people aware of these thousands of species threatened across the world environmental challenges, educating the public on and the conservation of biodiversity are all how to reduce the deterioration of nature, challenges faced by the whole world. disseminating the knowledge of experts and veterinarians on threatened species and raising Parques Reunidos, and in particular its Foundation awareness of the importance of contributing and the animal parks, have set themselves the actively to protect biodiversity.

SELWO EDUCA This is an environmental training programme for the integrated development of students from the 6th year of primary school and 1st year of secondary school (around 11 and 12 years old) in schools located in marginal zones of Malaga. This project is a joint initiative between Selwo Aventura and Selwo Marina, with a twin purpose: First, Selwo Educa aims to promote education and generate awareness of environmental issues among the students taking part. This initial phase of the project took place in May 2019 to January 2020, with a pause from June to September during the school holidays. It is run in the schools with which Selwo Aventura and Selwo Marina collaborate. They explain the role of zoos in the 21st century and the world of nature is presented to the students through videos, images, games and workshops, explaining the cycle of life and the synergies between the animal and plant kingdoms. Six sessions are taught, dealing with different environmental issues such as identification of waste and the different recycling techniques, interspersed with visits to parks to apply the knowledge learned in a practical way. The second Selwo Educa objective is to promote personal improvement and the search for motivating training opportunities among these young people, who are involved in a very precarious social environment. The activities are carried out in parks provide the young people with suggestions on the different jobs that could be available to them. During the visits to the parks, which are interspersed with the school sessions, participants have the opportunity to join workshops at which a variety of park workers explain their jobs to raise the interest of the young people 84 in continuing their studies and taking a university degree to improve their quality of life and access to the labour market.

It warns that a million animal and plant species around the world are on the point of extinction. The loss of biodiversity has become an extraordinary threat whose consequences may be very negative for the planet. The conservation of ecosystems and the protection of threatened species are one of the pillars of the Parques Reunidos Spirit. For this reason, the Parques Reunidos Foundation has promoted the creation of a Group of Biodiversity Experts formed by prestigious members of the academic community, government, research and civil society, with the aim of identifying the contribution of modern zoos to biodiversity through their role in education, conservation, research and animal welfare.

Pº de la Castellana, 259 C 28046 Madrid Independent Assurance Report on the Consolidated NonFinancial Information Statement of Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales, S.A. and subsidiaries for the year 2019 (Free translation from the original in Spanish. In case of discrepancy, the Spanish language version prevails.) To the shareholders of Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales, S.A.: Pursuant to article 49 of the Spanish Code of Commerce, we have performed a limited assurance review on the Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement (hereinafter NFIS) for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019, of Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales, S.A. (hereinafter the Parent) and subsidiaries (hereinafter the Group) which forms part of the accompanying 2019 consolidated Directors’ Report. The consolidated Directors’ Report includes additional information to that required by prevailing mercantile legislation governing non-financial information that has not been the subject of our assurance work. In this regard, our work was limited only to providing assurance on the information contained in table “Index of content required by Law 11/2018 of 28 December” of the accompanying consolidated Directors’ Report. Directors’ responsibilities _________________________________________________ The Directors of the Parent are responsible for the contents and the authorisation for issue of the NFIS included in the Group’s consolidated Directors’ Report. The NFIS has been prepared in accordance with the contents required by prevailing mercantile legislation and selected Sustainability Reporting Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards), in accordance with each subject area in table “Index of content required by Law 11/2018 of 28 December” of the aforementioned Group’s consolidated Directors’ Report. This responsibility also encompasses the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control deemed necessary to ensure that the NFIS is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The directors of Parent are also responsible for defining, implementing, adapting and maintaining the management systems from which the information necessary for preparing the NFIS was obtained.

M -249.480, Inscrip. 1.ª KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International N.I.F. B-82498650 Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. Paseo de la Castellana, 259C – Torre de Cristal – 28046 Madrid 2 Our independence and quality control _____________________________________ We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC1) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The engagement team was comprised of professionals specialised in reviews of non-financial information and, specifically, in information on economic, social and environmental performance. Our responsibility ________________________________________________________ Our responsibility is to express our conclusions in an independent limited assurance report based on the work performed. We conducted our review engagement in accordance with the current revised International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000, “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (Revised ISAE 3000), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), and with the Performance Guide on assurance engagements on the Non-Financial Information Statement issued by the Spanish Institute of Registered Auditors (ICJCE). The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement, and consequently, the level of assurance provided is also lower. Our work consisted of making inquiries of Management, as well as of the different units of the Parent that participated in the preparation of the NFIS, in the review of the processes for compiling and validating the information presented in the NFIS and in the application of certain analytical procedures and sample review testing described below: – Meetings with the Parent personnel to gain an understanding of the business model, policies and management approaches applied, the principal risks related to these questions and to obtain the information necessary for the external review. – Analysis of the scope, relevance and completeness of the content of the NFIS based on the materiality analysis performed by the Parent and described in the section “Materiality analysis and materiality matrix”, considering the content required by prevailing mercantile legislation. – Analysis of the processes for compiling and validating the data presented in the NFIS for 2019. – Review of the information relative to the risks, policies and management approaches applied in relation to the material aspects presented in the NFIS for 2019. – Corroboration, through sample testing, of the information relative to the content of the NFIS for 2019 and whether it has been adequately compiled based on data provided by information sources. – Procurement of a representation letter from the Directors and management. 3 Conclusion _______________________________________________________________ Based on the assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFIS of Parques Reunidos Servicios Centrales, S.A. and subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the contents included in prevailing mercantile legislation and with the GRI Standards selected, in accordance with each subject area in the table “Index of content required by Law 11/2018 of 28 December” of the aforementioned consolidated Directors’ Report. Use and distribution ______________________________________________________ This report has been prepared in response to the requirement established in prevailing mercantile legislation in Spain, and thus may not be suitable for other purposes and jurisdictions.
