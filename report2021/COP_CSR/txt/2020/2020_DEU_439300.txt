António Guterres Secretary General United Nations New York, NY 10017 USA Schwerte, 26.03.2020 Statement of Continuous Support and Communication on Progress 2020 Fleischhacker GmbH & Co. KG, Germany Dear Mr. Secretary-General, Hereby I am pleased to reaffirm Fleischhacker’s support of the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the four issue areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Fleischhacker is committed to continuously incorporate these principles into its own activities as a part of its business-strategy, -culture and day-to-day operations. In respect to the broader development goals of the United Nations this particularly refers to the sustainable development goals. Fleischhacker has already supported the principles of the UNGC long before becoming a member of the initiative. In the same line first in 2016 and again in 2019 we have successfully been externally audited by EcoVadis Global Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Monitoring and were granted the Silver Recognition Level Certificate based on EcoVadis CSR rating. The EcoVadis methodology is based on the principles of, a) the Global Reporting Initiative, b) the UNGC and c) the standards of ISO 26000. Against this background all four issue areas (human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption) are well addressed among others and professionally evaluated and assessed by EcoVadis. We are proud to report as the measurement of outcomes from the audit that Fleischhacker is again in the top 25% of the companies assessed by EcoVadis. Furthermore in 2019 we started extended reconstruction works on our offices to further improve working conditions for our office-staff. State of the art illumination technology and sanitary equipment are installed to reduce both energyand water-consumption. A completely new and optimized facility-utilization-concept provided the ground for reducing the number of staff per office by increasing the number of offices as well as increasing the number of meeting rooms from four to seven at the time.

This step helped reducing corresponding inter-warehouse-transportation by 75+%, which again has a positive impact on CO2-emissions. Apart from the above, the implementation of our new ERP-system in 2019 already has and further will support reducing the consumption of paper fully in the sense and towards sustainability goals. In preparation of the likewise in 2019 successfully implemented and audited Certification of our Pharmaceutical Quality System according to WHO-standards, we also installed our fully updated “Code of Conduct, Ethics & Conflict of Interest – document”. This document (copy attached) is fully in line with the relevant UNGC principles and has been made becoming integral part of employment contracts at Fleischhacker. In 2020 we will continue to further internalize the philosophy of the UNGC internally with our employees and externally with our customers. We will complete our office reconstruction project. We will further intensify our efforts in encouraging suppliers to support the principles of the UNGC, to support sustainability goals and to adhering to our corresponding Code of Conduct. In a continuous process of improvement Fleischhacker will go on carefully evaluating own performance and acting. This includes respecting its corporate social responsibility and the principles of the UNGC within the sphere of applicable statutory requirements.
