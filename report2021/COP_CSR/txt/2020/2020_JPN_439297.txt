CSR Data Book 2019 1 Message from the President The Seven & i Group strives, in accordance with its corporate creed,1 to be a sincere business enterprise that earns the trust of all stakeholders including customers, business partners, shareholders, local communities, franchisees, and employees. The distribution and retail environment in Japan today is undergoing rapid changes. As we face various problems such as changing social needs with the increasing number of working women, falling birthrate, aging population, and shrinking population as well as global environmental problems, we are endeavoring to solve social issues based on our management resources by incorporating the ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) viewpoint into our management and business activities. Ryuichi Isaka Therefore, the Seven & i Group signed the United Nations Global Compact*2 in 2012 and, in addition to practicing its 10 President and principles, we also identified five priority topics (material issues) that are particularly important for society and the Group through Representative dialogue with stakeholders in 2014. Currently, we are correlating these material issues with 17 goals identified in the United Director and Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*3 while engaging in solving issues through our main business with the aim of Chairman creating new logistics service business models based on our material issues. As part of this, we established our GREEN CHALLENGE 2050 Environmental Declaration in May 2019. As we have deployed our business with the goal of pursuing customer convenience, we have had a social impact in terms of our environmental impact and the external diseconomy. It is essential to proactively and autonomously engage in solving issues in order to attain a sustainable future. When formulating our environmental proclamation, we identified four major themes*4 that have a particular impact on society amongst the various environmental burdens caused by our business activities. We have set clear quantitative targets for 2030, which is the near future, based on our ideal stance for 2050, which is still some time into the future. We have also established four innovation teams and will work to promote effective initiatives across the group while striving to solve issues in coordination with customers, business partners and local communities based on unity amongst all group employees. *1 The Seven & i Group Corporate creed: We aim to be a sincere company that our customers trust. We aim to be a sincere company that our business partners, shareholders and local communities trust. We aim to be a sincere company that our employees trust. *2 Sustainable Development Goals: The SDGs are targets for all of international society adopted unanimously by the 193 member states of the United Nations at the Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015. There are 17 goals and 169 targets regarding priority, global-scale issues, creating a clear vision for the world to be achieved by 2030. *3 United Nations Global Compact: A voluntary initiative whereby companies and organizations participate in a global framework to act as good members of society by displaying responsible and creative leadership to achieve sustainable growth. The Compact comprises 10 principles in four fields (human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption) recognized by international society and globally adopted and agreed upon as universal values. *4 Four themes: CO2 emission reduction, plastic countermeasures, food loss/foodstuff recycling countermeasures, sustainable procurement Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

CSR Data Book 2019 6 Corporate Governance The mission of Seven & i Holdings, as a holding company that oversees and controls its operating companies, is to strengthen corporate governance and maximize the enterprise value of the Seven & i Group. Organization Seven & i Holdings has adopted the Audit & Supervisory Board system for implementing management oversight. The Board of Directors comprises 12 members, of whom 5 are Outside Directors and one is a female Director. Through the use of multiple Outside Directors who maintain their independence and have advanced management knowledge and experience, Seven & i Holdings protects the interests of general shareholders and enhances the quality of decision-making in business execution. To ensure appropriate reflection of the wishes of shareholders, the term of Directors has been set at one year. To facilitate prompt decision-making and business execution, the Company has introduced the executive officer system. Under this system, the Board of Directors is able to focus on the formulation of management strategies and the oversight of business execution, while the executive officers can focus on business execution. The Audit & Supervisory Board comprises five members, including three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members who maintain their independence and have specialized knowledge in such areas as legal affairs and financial accounting. Each Audit & Supervisory Board Member fulfills such tasks as attending meetings of the Board of Directors and other important meetings, exchanging opinions with the Representative Directors, periodically receiving reports from Directors and others regarding business execution, and actively exchanging information with the Auditing Office. Through these activities, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members audit the Directors’ execution of their duties. In addition, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members actively exchange information with the independent auditor to maintain close ties with it with respect to financial audits. * The number of people is as of the end of May 2019. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 7 Strengthening Corporate Governance All of the Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members of Seven & i Holdings are independent from the Company. Independent Directors and Independent Audit & Supervisory Board Members are defined as Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members who have no potential conflicts of interest with general shareholders of the Company. In the event that an Outside Director or an Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member is likely to be significantly controlled by the management of the Company or is likely to significantly control the management of the Company, that Outside Director or Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Member is considered to have a potential conflict of interest with general shareholders of the Company and is considered to lack independence. In accordance with this fundamental approach, the Company uses the independence criteria established by the financial instrument exchange as the independence criteria for the Company’s Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. These Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members hold periodic meetings, as necessary, with the Board of Directors, Representative Directors, and individual Directors to exchange opinions regarding such matters as the Group’s management and corporate governance. In addition, Seven & i Holdings assigns employees to assist the Outside Directors and the Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The Company has established a support system that facilitates smooth information exchange and close interaction with the other Directors and the other Audit & Supervisory Board Members. The Company’s Corporate Governance System (As of May 23, 2019) Nomination and Compensation Committee Seven & i Holdings has established the Nomination and Compensation Committee with an Independent Outside Director as the Chair to be an advisory committee to the Board of Directors. The committee deliberates on the nomination and compensation of Representative Directors, Directors, Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and executive officers to utilize the knowledge and advice of Independent Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. By ensuring procedural objectivity and transparency in deciding on officer nomination and compensation, the committee enhances the supervisory functions of the Board of Directors and further substantiates corporate governance functions. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 8 Committees Seven & i Holdings has established the CSR Management Committee, Risk Management Committee, and Information Management Committee, which report to the Representative Director. Each committee cooperates with the operating companies to determine Group policies and to manage and supervise their dissemination and execution with an eye to strengthening corporate governance. CSR Management Committee Seven & i Holdings established the CSR Management Committee to carry out, manage, and oversee Groupwide CSR activities. Four subcommittees (the Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee, Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices Subcommittee, Environment Subcommittee, and Social Value Creation Subcommittee) were established under the CSR Management Committee as Groupwide organizations that investigate and implement specific measures addressing the five material issues that affect the Group as a whole. Through these subcommittees, we seek to enhance compliance even further and promote business activities that assist in solving social issues involving stakeholders while pursuing sustainable development by both society and the Group from the perspective of ESG (environment, society, and governance). As one part of Groupwide internal controls, we are operating an internal reporting system that can be utilized by Group executive officers , employees and business partners. The officer responsible for the CSR Management Committee periodically reports to the Board of Directors and confirms that operation status of the internal reporting system. Risk Management Committee The company and its Group companies , in accordance with the “basic rules for risk management,” establishes, maintains, and utilizes comprehensive risk management systems, centered on the Risk Management Committee, in order to properly analyze and evaluate, and appropriately respond to risks associated with each business, with consideration for changes in the management environment and risk factors relevant to the Company and its Group companies. The Risk Management Committee regards all phenomena that threaten continuation of our businesses and hinder sustainable growth as risks, and works to strengthen comprehensive and integrated risk management. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, we revised the basic rules for risk management based on a review of risk categories that correspond to internal and external environmental changes as well as quantitative standards. In addition, to improve the effectiveness of risk management, we made efforts to further strengthen risk management throughout the Group through support for the implementation of Group company risk evaluation, analysis, and reduction countermeasures by the various risk management control divisions of our company. Information Management Committee The Information Management Committee is in charge of initiatives to strengthen corporate governance and information security based on gathering and managing information. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, continuing from the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, the committee strengthened its system for gathering important information from each company in an appropriate and timely manner and collaboratively addressing the information while working to enhance the system for centrally managing that information and reporting it without omission or delay to management and relevant departments. In response to heightened social interest in protection of personal information and to ensure that customers can use the Group’ s integrated EC website, omni7, as well as various operating company applications safely and securely, all business sites that handle customer personal information have acquired ISMS certification (ISO27001), an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS) and are working to reinforce information security. The committee formulated information security standards to be achieved by the Group and is working to further strengthen information security by promoting a PDCA cycle compliant with ISMS certification methods throughout Group companies as well. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 9 Reinforcing Internal Control Systems Seven & i Holdings has worked to enhance its internal control systems to achieve the required conditions of internal control: 1) operational effectiveness and efficiency; 2) reliability in financial reporting; 3) strict compliance with laws and regulations in operating activities; and 4) appropriate preservation of assets. The Board of Directors responded to the enforcement of the Companies Act of Japan in May 2006 by passing a resolution concerning the Company’s “Basic Policy on Internal Control Systems.” The Board of Directors continually monitors the establishment of various rules as well as the status of risk management. In February 2009, as one facet of initiatives implemented in response to the introduction of the internal control reporting system under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, the Company formulated the “Rules for Establishing Internal Control Concerning Financial Reporting” and the “Rules for Evaluating Internal Control Concerning Financial Reporting.” In accordance with these rules, in March 2009 the Company established the position of internal control evaluation director in the Auditing Office. The internal control evaluation director implements evaluations of internal control concerning financial reporting for the Group as a whole. In addition to this type of system enhancement, the Company has prepared an Internal Control Handbook. The Company is working to ensure that all of the Group’s employees understand the objectives and importance of internal control. Moreover, following revisions to the Companies Act and the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Companies Act in May 2015, the Company established systems for ensuring appropriate operations within the corporate group formed by Seven & i Holdings and Group subsidiaries and enhanced and clarified the regulations relating to systems for supporting audits and so forth. Further details about corporate governance can be found here: Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 10 Compliance Seven & i Holdings places absolute priority on compliance with laws and regulations and social norms. The Company also strives to ensure that its corporate governance is functioning soundly and secured by management. Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines The Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines present the behavior that each employee should practice in order to realize the spirit of “reliability and sincerity” expressed in the Group's corporate creed. The guidelines call for employees to comply with laws, regulations, and social norms, to uphold laws and regulations such as the Act on Prohibition of Private Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade as well as internal rules, conduct business under appropriate conditions in line with sound trading practices, and not to have any contact with antisocial groups.

Efforts Regarding Social Issues Compliance System Seven & i Holdings has a CSR Management Committee, chaired by the President, and three subcommittees—the Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee, the Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices Subcommittee, and the Environment Subcommittee. These subcommittees work together with each Group company to promote the Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines and to rigorously enforce compliance. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 11 Internal Reporting System Seven & i Holdings has set up the Groupwide Employee Help Line, the Business Partner Help Line, and the Audit & Supervisory Board Hotline to prevent conduct that could result in loss of public credibility and to ensure early detection, early remediation, and recurrence prevention. The Groupwide Employee Help Line is for receiving reports from employees of operating companies in Japan, the Business Partner Help Line is for reports from business partners, and the Audit & Supervisory Board Hotline is for reports related to management. The three help lines have a consultation desk operated by a third party under a service contract and a non-disclosure agreement to protect the privacy of people consulting or whistleblowing, and ensure that the content of their reports is not disclosed publicly or leaked. The consultation desk accepts reports via email, telephone, or post. (Reports via telephone are only accepted during service hours.) When the Company receives a report, it quickly confirms the facts, corrects any violations that are found, and strives to prevent a recurrence. To create an environment that facilitates reporting, reports can be made anonymously, and our operating regulations stipulate that whistleblowers are not to be subjected to disadvantageous treatment for having made a report. The person is contacted four weeks after completion of the case by the third-party consultation desk to check that they have not suffered retaliation or disadvantageous treatment. Seven & i Holdings’ Sustainability Promotion Department keeps track of the number and nature of the reports for each Group company, as well as the status of responses, to ensure that the actions taken by the operating companies are appropriate. In the event of a serious violation or other such incident, a report will be provided immediately to the Representative Director, responses will be discussed with the relevant divisions and companies, and the necessary response measures will be taken. In addition, the CSR Department reports on the operational status of the internal reporting system to Seven & i Holdings’ Board of Directors. Registration for the Consumer Affairs Agency ’s Whistleblower Certification In July 2019, to further enhance our compliance management and aim to become a Group that is trusted by all stakeholders, including our customers and business partners, our Group registered its “Groupwide Employee Help Line” to the Consumer Affairs Agency’s Whistleblower Compliance Management System. ※Whistleblower Compliance Management System A system in which businesses compare their own internal reporting systems to the Consumer Affairs Agency’s “Guidelines for ,” and those businesses who comply with said guidelines are given permission to display the WCMS symbol. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 12 Groupwide Employee Help Line The Groupwide Employee Help Line serves employees, Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members , and retirees and their families. To ensure that all employees are aware of the system and its contact points, it is explained in employee training and posters are put up in every workplace and store. Additionally, employees' awareness of the Groupwide Employee Help Line is surveyed as part of the Employee Engagement Survey administered once every two years. Procedural Flow for the Groupwide Employee Help Line Audit & Supervisory Board Hotline The Audit & Supervisory Board Hotline was newly established in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 to receive reports independent of management related to actions that could potentially result in the loss of social trust in which the directors, members of the Audit & Supervisory Board, executive officers, and other members of management for Group companies in Japan are suspected of being involved. The Seven & i Holdings Audit & Supervisory Board and the Audit & Supervisory Boards of its operating companies coordinate to handle cases. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 13 Business Partner Help Line The Business Partner Help Line is provided for Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members, employees, and former employees of domestic Group companies’ business partners. To ensure that business partners are fully aware of the help line system and its points of contact, we explain it at briefings for business partners and distribute information in pamphlets. Procedural Flow for the Business Partner Help Line Education and Training of Employees Seven & i Holdings and Group companies endeavor to promote and foster understanding of the Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines among all employees. To this end they have prepared specific guidance for employees on how to put the guidelines into practice in line with the business characteristics of each company. In addition, when undertaking tier-specific group training for organizational levels ranging from new recruits to management, Seven & i Holdings provides training based on the themes of the Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines and compliance. From the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, compliance seminars have been held every year for executives, beginning with the presidents of Seven & i Holdings and each Group company. In addition, starting in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017, training via e-learning (some employees viewed DVDs) has been periodically undertaken for Group employees in Japan. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 14 Compliance Awareness Survey Seven & i Holdings conducts prepares questions related to compliance for the Employee Opinion Engagement Survey, a n anonymous biennial survey designed to gauge the extent of understanding of the Corporate Creed and compliance awareness among employees. The survey includes questions that measure job satisfaction and the degree of acceptance of performance reviews. Groupwide initiatives are implemented to address common issues across the Group that have been identified by the survey results. Along with this, Group companies devise measures to tackle the issues faced by each company and strive to make improvements accordingly. For more details of the Employee Engagement Survey, please visit: System for Prevention of Noncompliance Regarding Business Partners Seven & i Holdings has established the FT (Fair Trade) Information Sharing Committee, made up of personnel in charge of fair trade at each Group company, under the Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices Subcommittee. In this project, the members strive to prevent noncompliance by sharing information on the latest laws and regulations concerning business practices, cases of unfair business practices at Group companies or other companies in the industry, and measures for improvement. If a case of an unfair business practice occurs, or is suspected, the FT Information Sharing Committee and the Sustainability Promotion Department work together to check the facts with the department and business partners concerned. If any issues are found to exist, they are dealt with appropriately according to administrative guidance. Prevention of Noncompliance at Group Companies Each Group company has a division to rigorously ensure fair trading practices, such as the FT Committee headed by the company president. These divisions are responsible for training the personnel responsible for procurement as regards the laws and regulations related to contracts, such as the Antimonopoly Act and the Subcontract Act. The status of legal compliance at each Group company is confirmed through a monitoring survey of each Group company conducted by the FT Information Sharing Committee. Prevention of Noncompliance Regarding Business Partners In the final stage of negotiations with each business partner, to ensure there are no later disagreements between the personnel in charge of purchasing at each company and the representative of the business partner, the matters determined as a result of their discussions are recorded in a standardized format, with each party retaining a copy. Moreover, the Seven & i Group conducts individual employee interviews led by the employee's supervisor once every six months. At the individual interviews of personnel in charge of purchasing, their compliance with fair business practices is evaluated and reflected in their compensation package. From the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017, the Seven & i Group has conducted questionnaire surveys of business partners to confirm whether the speech and behavior of employees toward business partners follow the Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines. In these surveys, business partners reply to questions anonymously. In May 2019, a total of approximately 8,300 representatives of business partners responded to questionnaire surveys issued by Group companies. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 15 Protecting Personal Information and Appropriately Securing the Safety of Information Assets Seven & i Holdings has established the Basic Policy on Protection of Personal Information and the Basic Policy on Information Security. As a sincere company trusted by its stakeholders, Seven & i Holdings has made it mandatory for officers and all employees to protect the personal information handled by the Group and appropriately secure the safety of information assets as a material management and business issue and a social responsibility. At the same time, the Company aims to ensure appropriate business execution through the protection of personal information and the use of information assets by complying with relevant laws and regulations such as the Act on the Protection of Personal Information and internal rules. The Privacy Policy can be found here The Basic Policy on Information Security can be found here Tax‒Related Policies Based on the Seven & i Holdings Global Tax Policy, Seven & i Holdings has a tax strategy that corresponds with its management strategies, and carries out uniform Companywide tax management. Seven & i Holdings Global Tax Policy Seven & i Holdings has a basic policy of establishing high-quality corporate governance systems at the Company and its Group companies, including overseas subsidiaries. The systems are designed to ensure sound, sustainable growth and to uphold public trust. To provide appropriate countermeasures for tax-related risks, including changes in the tax governance environment in Japan and overseas, reputational risk, brand value degradation, and corporate social responsibility, we have a tax strategy that corresponds with our management strategies, and we will carry out uniform Companywide tax management. In line with the above, Seven & i Holdings has adopted the following global tax policy. 1. Legal Compliance Seven & i Holdings and its Group companies, including overseas subsidiaries, always comply with the taxation laws in the countries where they operate. Moreover, they also respect the intention of such laws by paying taxes appropriately as a way of contributing to the economic development of the countries. To ensure that our compliance with tax-related laws and our tax management are appropriate, we follow the guidelines for developing internal controls for financial reporting to build and develop internal control systems that ensure appropriate accounting procedures and financial reporting. We also operate these systems appropriately and have inside and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members check and assess the effectiveness of the controls. 2. Ensure Transparency Seven & i Holdings and its Group companies, including overseas subsidiaries, provide timely and appropriate disclosure of management data and tax payment status in accordance with the laws of each country where they have operations. Moreover, the Company and its Group companies, including overseas subsidiaries, do not engage in tax avoidance practices, which seek to excessively reduce tax payments, and transactions between operating companies are conducted according to the arm's length principle. 3. Relationship with Tax Authorities Seven & i Holdings and its Group companies, including overseas subsidiaries, strive to ensure transparency and reliability with regard to their tax obligations by responding in good faith to the tax authorities in the countries where they operate and international tax authorities. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 16 Tax‒Related Risks Seven & i Holdings has evaluated the impact of tax obligation risks on future value creation. As a result, we recognize the risk from changes in accounting standards and tax systems, such as transfer pricing taxation as a financial risk, and the risk associated with M&A and business reorganizations as a business risk. Financial Risks The Group could encounter unforeseen introductions of new accounting standards or taxation systems, or changes to existing systems, which could affect its business performance or financial position. Business Risks The Group develops new businesses and reorganizes its Group businesses through M&As, business alliances with other companies, establishment of joint ventures, and so forth. However, if the Group's strategic investments do not achieve the initially anticipated effect and cannot meet their targets, its business performance and financial position could be affected. Tax‒Related Reports Our Group is expanding new businesses and restructuring Group businesses through M&As, business tie-ups with other companies, the establishment of merged companies, and so on. However, if we are unable to attain the effects we originally hoped for from strategic investments and are unable to accomplish their objectives, there is a chance that this will have a negative effect on our Group’s business results and financial situation.

We recognize that respect for human rights is an extremely important social responsibility as a part of our business activities, and we respect basic human rights as provided for in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international proclamations. The Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines stipulates that no person shall be unfairly discriminated against or harassed based on their social status, nationality, race, family lineage, creed, age, gender, sexual orientation*, gender identity*, physical or mental disability, or other traits. We work to ensure that all employees understand these Guidelines. Furthermore, we believe that the cooperation of our business partners is necessary to advance our initiatives on respecting the human rights and the dignity of all people involved in our business activities. We have established the Seven & i Holdings Business Partner Action Guidelines and work to ensure that our business partners understand and comply with them. As a sign of our respect for human rights, Seven & i Holdings is also a signatory and supporter of the UN Global Compact comprising 10 principles related to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. * Sexual orientation: A person’s sexual nature determining the gender(s) to which he or she feels attracted * Gender identity: The recognition and sense of which gender an individual feels they belong to Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines Basic Policy 4. Respect for Human Rights Seven & i Group Business Partner Action Guidelines 2. Respect for Human Rights Promotion Framework Seven & i Holdings has established the Human Rights Education Center as a dedicated entity for overseeing and promoting the Group’s efforts with respect to human rights education and normalization. The Human Rights Education Center coordinates with the personnel and CSR promotion departments of each Group company, and carries out a variety of educational and awareness activities. In addition, the Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee under the CSR Management Committee regularly shares the progress on efforts related to human rights education, and advances activities aimed at having all employees of Group companies correctly understand and recognize human rights, along with fostering a corporate culture free of discrimination or prejudice. With respect to human rights initiatives in the supply chain, the Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices Subcommittee under the CSR Management Committee takes the lead role in encouraging human rights awareness among business partners. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 18 Human Rights Awareness and Training Seven & i Group offers a variety of educational activities and employee training with the aim of creating a corporate culture in which everyone respects the human rights of all customers, business partners, people in local communities, and colleagues, and in which people are aware of all types of discrimination and prejudices and do not discriminate against others or tolerate such behavior. Conducting Training Seven & i Group companies provide a variety of human rights awareness training to employees, including part-time employees. For example, Ito-Yokado holds level-specific human rights awareness training when employees join the company and at other times, with training content matching job responsibilities. Employees come to recognize that human rights issues are an intricate part of everyday life, and the training includes specific examples as well as new developments and issues so that employees can apply what they learn to their daily activities. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, a total of 73 training sessions were held, and a total of 1,728 employees underwent training. In order to further support training by Group companies, Seven & i Holdings has been using “Human Rights – Let’s Start by Learning,” a handbook published in February 2017, to raise employee awareness. Human rights training Human Rights – Let’s Start by Learning handbook Solicitation of Proposals for Human Rights Slogans To create a corporate culture in which each employee’s human rights are respected in accordance with the Corporate Action Guidelines, each year the Seven & i Group solicits proposals for human rights slogans from all employees, including part-time employees, and their family members. By coming up with slogans, employees are encouraged to think about human rights, which raises their awareness of human rights issues. The most excellent slogans submitted are published in the Group’s internal newsletter and on the intranet website, and are awarded prizes. The contest was held for the 28th time in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, and 70,637 proposals were received. This marks the third consecutive year that more than 70,000 proposals were received. Poster calling for the submission of human rights slogans Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 19 Evaluation of Respect for Human Rights Conducting Employee Engagement Surveys Seven & i Group conducts an employee engagement survey targeting Seven & i Holdings as well as Group companies. The survey includes questions asking people if they respect diversity or have seen or heard about problematic employee behavior in the workplace, and checks whether the human rights established in the Corporate Action Guidelines are being respected. The survey conducted in November 2018 targeted approximately 35,000 employees working at 28 Group companies in Japan. More details of the Employee Engagement Survey can be found here Consultation Service for Employees Seven & i Group has established the Groupwide Help Line as a consultation service for Group employees, their family members, and former employees to consult about or report on any human rights problems in the workplace. The consultation service is operated by a third party under a service contract and a non-disclosure agreement to protect the privacy of people who contact it. When a report or consultation is received, the facts are investigated as necessary having obtained consent from the person who made the report. In addition, the rules of the consultation service stipulate that people who contact the service as well as those who cooperate with the investigation of facts shall not be subject to disadvantageous treatment. Further information about the Groupwide Help Line can be found here Assessment of Business Partners by Self-Check Sheet To ensure that business partners understand the Seven & i Holdings Business Partner Action Guidelines, Seven & i Group administers a self-check sheet for business partners that explains all of the specific requirements for compliance. The self-check sheet contains 61 questions, including human rights-related questions. For example, the questions ask whether or not factory employees have access to consulting desks and whether or not the company requests that its own suppliers comply with the Seven & i Holdings Business Partner Action Guidelines. Responses are entered into a database, and the data are used in the process for determining whether to continue doing business with specific business partners. Further information about the self-check sheet for business partners can be found here Conducting CSR Audits of Business Partners’ Manufacturing Plants In addition, Seven & i Group conducts CSR audits of end manufacturing plants of the business partners who produce Seven Premium private brand products as well as Ito-Yokado’s overseas direct import suppliers. The audits ascertain their level of compliance with the Seven & i Holdings Business Partner Action Guidelines. An outside audit agency conducts the audits in line with Seven & i Holdings’ original audit, which covers topics such as human rights and the work environment (16 categories and approximately 140 check items). This was prepared by making reference to sources such as the ISO 26000 standard, the Japanese Business Federation’s Charter of Corporate Behavior, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, CSR audits were conducted at 327 plants in 13 countries. Further details about CSR audits of business partners can be found here Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 20 CSR Management Seven & i Holdings works toward solving social issues in its core operations through promotion and development of businesses such as products and services. At the same time, we aim for sustainable development that creates value for both companies and society. CSR Promotion Framework Seven & i Holdings seeks to promote Group‒wide CSR activities that are effective and efficient. To this end, we hold regular, twice‒yearly meetings of the CSR Management Committee, which is chaired by the President and Representative Director. At these meetings, we offer guidance and make improvements based on reports received from the four subcommittees. The meetings also help to strengthen the framework of collaboration between the holding company and operating companies. Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee The Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee conducts initiatives aimed at Group employees based on rigorous implementation of the Corporate Action Guidelines. In our initiatives to ensure rigorous implementation of the Corporate Action Guidelines, individual Group companies revised their guidelines (employee codes of conduct) in accordance with the Seven & i Group’s Corporate Action Guidelines, which were revised in September 2016. Moreover, we are working to improve employee awareness by making everyone aware of the Corporate Creed and the Corporate Action Guidelines, as well as conducting e-learning related to CSR and compliance throughout the entire Group. In addition, we also conduct a Business Partner questionnaire to confirm that Group employees are acting in accordance with the Corporate Creed and Corporate Action Guidelines in their dealings with business partners. Group companies share information throughout the Group on the progress made by each Group company and accomplishments of measures to improve the issues identified by this survey. Through these efforts, we seek to improve on those issues. Meanwhile, to create fulfilling workplaces, we have been conducting an Employee Engagement Survey since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The issues that come to light from this survey are reported to managers, and measures are currently being formulated and implemented to improve them. In addition to these surveys, we have established an internal reporting system so that we can hear a wide variety of voices, including employees, business partners, their family members. The Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee also carries out initiatives to monitor and improve the system. In addition to these initiatives, we are working to improve work environments, such as by rectifying long working hours, making progress on promoting active roles for diverse human resources including women and people with disabilities, and helping employees balance work and family care responsibilities. In addition, we are working to create an environment where all employees can work at ease, such as by encouraging employees to take days off on holidays and acquire leave.

To improve product quality and ensure safety, the Subcommittee aims to establish and strengthen its own quality levels and control systems for each Group company based on Group‒wide quality policies. For details about the Quality Policy Furthermore, to ensure that we meet our social responsibilities regarding products and services across the entire supply chain, we ask business partners to understand and implement the Seven & i Group Business Partner Action Guidelines, and regularly confirm and assess their compliance. For details about the Seven & i Group Business Partner Action Guidelines Environment Subcommittee Based on the GREEN CHALLENGE 2050 announced in May 2019, the Environment Subcommittee is working to promote initiatives to develop a lowcarbon society, a circular economy, and a society in harmony with nature. With regards to a low-carbon society, we will enhance information sharing at our Group companies. In addition to reducing CO2 emissions as part of our store management, we are promoting initiatives to reduce CO2 across the entire supply chain, from product development to production, shipment, sales, and consumption. With regards to creating a circular economy, we are working to reduce the usage of plastic bags from cash registers and shift to environmentallyconscious materials for containers for our Group’s original products (including Seven Premium). In addition, we have been utilizing the Seven & i Group’s store networks in various regions by installing automated plastic bottle collection machines in stores since 2012 and expanding the number of stores collecting bottles. The collected bottles are recycled in Japan and used in Seven Premium packaging for bottled beverages made from 100% recycled material, among other products. We are also expanding our initiatives to reduce food waste and promote food recycling. With regards to creating a society in harmony with nature, we are aiming to expand the use of materials with guaranteed sustainability for the food ingredients that we use in our original Group products (including Seven Premium). To further promote these initiatives, we selected leaders from responsible departments at our Group companies and launched four cross-group Environmental Innovation Teams. We are also working to raise employees' environmental awareness by periodically providing environmental training to our employees so that all employees in the Group can work together. Social Value Creation Subcommittee Based on an awareness that efforts to solve social issues will lead to new business opportunities as the Group expands its business domains and related social problems become increasing varied, the Social Value Creation Subcommittee takes action to create business that generates social and economic value (creating shared value; CSV). Aiming to realize a sustainable society, the Seven & i Group has identified five material issues that it must address through engagement with various stakeholders. In response, the Social Value Creation Subcommittee is working to plan and execute new businesses originating from social issues to be addressed through core businesses by leveraging business characteristics and management resources, including the Group's business infrastructure and expertise cultivated to date. Moreover, it has set up similar structures at each Group company, is building internal promotion frameworks, and is conducting periodic training for personnel in charge at Group companies to further expand the scope of action. Apart from this, the subcommittee will strive to deepen initiatives with a view to fostering external collaboration with business partners, social entrepreneurs, NPOs, and other partners.

Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 31 Seven & i Holdings’ Material Issues Seven & i Holdings has conducted dialogues with various stakeholders and in 2014 determined material issues that should be addressed so that the entire Group can respond to the expectations and demands of stakeholders. We will introduce the determination process here. Purpose of Material Issues Determination Concentrate on material issues that Seven & i Holdings should address in particular, and respond appropriately as the scope of its business expands and related social issues and social demands become more diverse. Clarify the direction towards CSR for the entire Group and maximize Group synergies. Implement CSR management and information disclosure in line with global standards. Material Issues Determination Process STEP 1 Identify social issues that should be considered To determine the material issues, we identified social issues that should be considered. In addition to the Group’s Corporate Action Guidelines and other policies, global frameworks such as GRI Guidelines G4, ISO 26000, and Millennium Development Goals; issues facing Japan, such as those debated by the Japanese government; and survey items of CSR rating agencies were also taken into consideration to identify social issues that should be addressed. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 32 STEP 2 Interviews with stakeholders An interview survey in a questionnaire format was conducted with customers, business partners, shareholders and investors, and employees to understand the future expectations and demands of all stakeholders for the Group for the identified social issues. An assessment was made of how much of a priority the Group should place on each issue. STEP 3 Prepare candidate material issues based on the interview results Based on the expectations of each stakeholder, the importance of the social issues was evaluated based on the two axes of the importance to each stakeholder and the importance to our Group business. Furthermore, after consolidating these axes to evaluate the overall level of importance, we prepared candidate material issues for the entire Group. STEP 4 Dialogue with experts Based on our candidate material issues, we conducted dialogues with experts to discuss what issues Seven & i Holdings should focus on. These dialogues were held between members of the management of Seven & i Holdings and core operating companies, including the President and Representative Director. Opportunities were established to discuss the entire Group and to discuss each business area as opinions were exchanged with experts. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 33 STEP 5 Decide on material issues We reviewed the importance of the various candidate material issues based on the opinions of stakeholders and experts and summarized them anew. Having sorted the candidate material issues by importance, we integrated the items of greatest importance for stakeholders and the Group's business into five areas that took into account their various associations. The CSR Management Committee, chaired by the President, decided on the material issues that Seven & i Holdings should address as a Group. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

CSR Data Book 2019 35 Material Issue 1 Providing Social Infrastructure in this era with an Aging Society and Declining Population Approach to Material Issues Seven & i Holdings is working to enhance the convenience of shopping while leveraging the unique aspects of its business and some 20,000‒store network as a form of social infrastructure to support consumers inconvenienced by shopping and to respond to changes taking place in society. These changes include Japan’s decrease in population brought on by a declining birthrate and aging society, the advancement of women in society, and the declining number of retail stores, among others. We recognize that fulfilling these diverse needs of our customers is one of our most important and unwavering roles in society. We will continue to tackle these issues as our most importance issues. Background to Material Issues Inconvenience of shopping and other services due to the hollowing out of lifestyle hubs following aging society and declining population trends Japan is experiencing aging society and declining population trends. By the year 2060, the country’s population will dip below 90 million and nearly 40% will be seniors* . The number of seniors living alone continues to increase each year, with the number expected to rise 1.5‒fold from the level in 2010 by 2030. Meanwhile, the hollowing out of lifestyle hubs following the declining population stands as one of Japan’s major social issues. Forecasts suggest that the number of seniors living alone without walkable access to a supermarket with fresh produce and meat will double by the year 2030. * Source: FY2013 Population Estimates, Statistics Bureau, Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications Promotional Framework for Material Issues In response to this material issue, the CSR Management Committee, led by the president, and its subordinate Social Value Creation Subcommittee, work together with the Group companies and related departments to develop various services as initiatives to resolve social issues through business activities, as well as monitoring the progress of activities and promoting new initiatives.

Net Supermarkets IY operates Net Supermarket at 127 stores (as of February 28, 2019) to provide scheduled deliveries of products ordered by customers using PCs or smartphones. Net Supermarket delivers from nearby stores in as little as four hours. The service deals in food and household goods, and pharmaceutical products were added in November 2013. In December 2014, we started offering a service to help parents raising children. With this service, parents who present and register a maternity notebook issued within the last four years can receive deliveries at a fee of only ¥100 (including tax) for four years from the registration date. In addition, we opened IY Fresh in November 2017. This joint venture with LOHACO enables customers to order daily necessities from LOHACO and products from Ito-Yokado at the same time (the delivery area is Bunyko-ku, and Shinjuku-ku in Tokyo as of February 28, 2019). Net Supermarkets Online Convenience Stores SEJ offers a service that allows customers to place orders online using a PC or smartphone for some 2,800 products such as rice balls and boxed lunches handled by its stores and have them delivered to their homes or other designated location in as little as two hours.

Seven RakuRaku Delivery The mobile store services Seven Anshin Delivery and Ito-Yokado Anshin Delivery SEJ operates the Seven Anshin Delivery mobile store service at 83 stores in 34 prefectures (as of February 28, 2019). This service utilizes proprietarily developed light trucks equipped with store facilities, which go to areas that are inconvenient for daily shopping and where many residents are seniors who have trouble securing means of transportation. Customers are able to purchase a range of foods and beverages, including frozen foods, using this service. Plans call for this service to be expanded further in the future to fulfill the needs of customers. IY also uses its own specially developed trucks equipped with store facilities to provide the Ito-Yokado Anshin Delivery mobile store service at five stores in six regions: Nagano Prefecture’s Ueda region, Sapporo City, Tama City, Hachioji City, Hanamaki City, and Iwaki City (as of February 28, 2019).

In addition to sales at stores, customers can also order products using their PC or smartphone. In addition, with the expansion of the electronic commerce market and other factors, there is an increasing trend in the volume of parcel deliveries, and at the same time, manpower shortage in the transport industry is growing more severe. Seven Net Shopping offers the store pick-up service allowing ordered products to be picked up at nearby 7-Eleven stores. This contributes toward reducing the number of redeliveries and CO2 emitted during deliveries. Shopping Support When Delivering Products Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

The kits can be ordered starting from one meal for one person. The Meal Kits do not contain any preservatives or artificial colors in the main ingredients or condiments, and since the ingredients come pre-cut, cooking times are short. In addition, Ito-Yokado sells the Chef’s RECIPE series , which can be easily prepared using a frying pan or microwave oven, at fresh meat and fish sales areas (Tokyo Metropolitan area, northern Kanto, and Shizuoka). The selection for cooking with a frying pan* offers meat and fish paying particular attention to quality, and cut and seasoned so as to be easy to eat. These meals can be easily cooked in a short time just by frying with a frying pan. They can also be expanded upon, such as frying them with different vegetables of your choice.

Promoting Alliances with Municipalities through Comprehensive Alliance Agreements and Other Means The Seven & i Group is promoting regional revitalization by concluding comprehensive alliance agreements with local governments in a wide range of fields, including local production for local consumption, senior support, health promotion, and environmental protection. Moreover, we are also moving ahead on concluding “guardian angel agreements” with local governments to look out for elderly people and so on during regular store operating hours, or through delivery services and collaborating with local governments to respond if irregularities are detected, as well as to promote employment of senior citizens, train cognitive impairment supporters, and take other measures. In other developments, we have also concluded “supply-support agreements” to prepare for rapid regional support in the event of disasters, and we are also promoting “agreements for supporting people who cannot return home after a disaster” where we provide tap water, access to restrooms, and local information wherever possible.

SEJ recognizes the importance of local flavors and food cultures by developing products that use local ingredients. IY, Sogo & Seibu, YorkBenimaru, and other Group companies propose menus using local products and ingredients, helping to support regional revitalization by promoting the appeal of the local area. In addition, at stores in Chiba Prefecture’s Yachiyo City, York Mart organized the Yachipan Project, an event for producing and selling bread based on ideas from local high school students carried out as part of the initiatives with local governments. “1/2 Day of Vegetables! Joshu Flour Okkirikomi” sold at 7-Eleven stores in “Flavors of Aomori Presented by Students of Aomori Chuo Junior the Nagano region College !

Agreements for this service are in place with 587 municipalities (as of February 28, 2019). This service is currently being expanded, as family register certificates can now be issued for 430 municipalities and tax certificates for 432. (Individual Number Cards are required to use the service) This service for Individual Number Card holders is easily operable and can be used even late at night and on holidays, simply by waving the Individual Number Card over a scanner. Private information is given high security protection by a sophisticated dedicated network and special printing prevents forgery and manipulation. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 43 Insurance Enrollment and Premium Payment Service 7-Eleven stores became the first in the industry to offer motorcycle and bicycle insurance enrollment and insurance premium payment services where customers can enroll in insurance 24 hours a day by entering the necessary personal information on the multi-functional copier machine screen in store and paying their premium at the register. (The service is for motor scooters and motorcycles with an engine displacement of 250 cc or less, which do not require a motor vehicle inspection.) 1 DAY Insurance providing automotive insurance coverage in one-day increments has been available at all 7Eleven stores since September 2015, and “1 DAY Leisure Insurance” that provides necessary accident coverage when needed has been available since April 2018. Multifunctional copier machines can copy print, issue various types of certificates, and even issue insurance policies. Bicycle Sharing SEJ has started using bicycle parking spaces on store grounds as sites for renting and returning shared bicycles. The areas will be expanded in stages, and SEJ has placed some 3,300 bicycles at 600 stores in the Tokyo Metropolitan region and regional cities during FY2018. This program was launched at Ito-Yokado in June 2018, and Denny’s restaurants in September 2018. Bicycle sharing allows for bicycles to be rented from any of multiple stations within a certain region. After use, a bicycle need not be returned to the original location and can be returned to the station closest to the user’s destination. Bicycle sharing is expected to supplement public transportation in areas that lack adequate transportation and will play an important role as infrastructure. A store with a bicycle sharing site Establishment of Polling Stations in Stores IY and Sogo & Seibu provide facilities within stores to be used free of charge for use as polling booths in cooperation with local governments to provide voters with easily accessible polling booths that are handy to shopping facilities. Local governments seek to increase the voting rate due to the reduction in number of polling booths and decline in voting rate due to the merger of municipalities, in addition to the enactment of the revised Public Offices Election Act, which lowered the voting age to 18. The booths are used to provide easy access to voters while they are shopping. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, polling booths were set up in 26 Ito-Yokado stores and four Sogo & Seibu stores, and election promotion activities were conducted in the stores, such as displaying posters, in-store announcements and printing the election date on receipts.

Training Cognitive Impairment Supporters The Seven & i Group supports the creation of neighborhoods where local residents who suffer from cognitive impairment and their families can live with security. To this end, we are encouraging our employees to attend cognitive impairment supporter training courses. Each Group company holds training courses, and the number of supporters across the 26 Group companies as of February, 2019 is 34,110 in total. We will continue to strengthen our efforts to develop cognitive impairment supporters. * 26 Group companies will be targeted in this initiative (accounting for 90 of Group sales in Japan).

Sales are conducted by sales staff with specialized qualifications who are also able to deal with consultations regarding nursing care and welfare issues in general. The company is working to develop products in response to customer opinions and comments and created a pushcart for seniors, known as the “Silver Car,” that can easily be pushed over uneven surfaces and has been well received by customers. In addition, Sogo & Seibu has teamed up with the Caring Design Association to establish a permanent “Living Design Salon” at the Seibu Ikebukuro Store for supporting living and home design for customers aged in their 50s and above. The facility proposes appealing homes that casually incorporate care and support features for the physical changes that occur with age, aiming to enable people to live in their own way even as they grow older.

CSR Data Book 2019 46 Disseminating Information to Support Everyday Living for Foreigners Seven Bank provides an overseas remittance app available in nine languages for customers who make use of overseas remittance services. In 2016, we started concluding agreements for promoting multicultural coexistence with local governments in areas with high concentrations of foreign residents. The agreements are mainly intended to disseminate local information through the app. Information about living in these areas, disaster information, and so forth is disseminated in multiple languages through the app to residents, providing support for customers so that they can live safely and conveniently in Japan. As of March 31, 2019, we have concluded agreements with 11 local government organizations, and we plan to continue expanding this initiative. ATMs That Diverse Customers Can Operate Easily Seven Bank is making daily progress on the ATM functions and services so that all customers can use them with confidence. With the voice guidance service, which is mainly for customers with visual disabilities, users can make a transaction by following voice guidance delivered through an intercom phone installed on the ATM to operate the buttons on the phone. Customers with the cash cards of around 540 affiliated partner financial institutions* can also use this service. This voice guidance system was developed after soliciting feedback from people with visual disabilities and testing its operability. Furthermore, ATMs in 7-Eleven stores now feature cane and drink holders to make them easy for anyone to use. * Banks, credit unions, credit cooperatives, labor banks, JA banks, JF Marine banks, and securities companies that are partners with Seven Bank.

CSR Data Book 2019 47 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Approach to Material Issues The Seven & i Group handles about 3 million product items at its stores at each company, and also develops a variety of private brand products. Because of this, we place the utmost importance on ensuring the quality of our products, including their safety and reliability. We also recognize the material issue of our role as a social infrastructure that can be used with peace of mind, even in emergencies such as natural disasters. Relevant policy Quality Policy Background to Material Issues Food Safety With the globalization of food and the occurrence in recent years of incidents and accidents that threaten food safety and security food, there is a growing interest in food safety, including the issues of controlling raw materials, food additives, and residual agrichemicals. In particular, answers to a survey by the Cabinet Office showed that about 70% of people feel uneasy about food safety and want companies to be required to further strengthen their quality control systems. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 48 Frequent Natural Disasters In recent years, floods and landslides due to heavy rain occur frequently, driven by climate change and other factors. Also, many natural disasters such as large‒scale earthquakes continue to occur in connection with the location of the Japanese archipelago. In Japan, especially, where many people suffer due to natural disasters, social infrastructure, such as the provision of the goods and services necessary for daily life, plays an important role when a large‒scale disaster occurs. The Company is expected to ensure business continuity to provide a safe and secure base. Promotional Framework for Material Issues In response to this material issue, the CSR Management Committee, led by the president, and its subordinate Consumer Affairs and Fair Business Practices Subcommittee, work together with the Group companies and related departments to provide safety and reliability through products and stores. The Group is also working to ensure information security under the Group Information Management Committee. These activities are supervised by the Seven and i Holdings Director Executive Officer Head of Corporate Communication Division. Contribution to SDGs By tackling this priority issue, Seven & i Group will provide living bases that ensure people's safety and security in the event of natural disasters due to climate change, and will contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals 2, 3, 9, 11 and 13.

CSR Data Book 2019 50 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Building Quality Control Systems Seven & i Holdings is working to introduce international management system standards and management methods regarding quality and hygiene in order to provide safe and reliable products to customers. Establishing a Foundation for Quality Control in Each Group Company Seven & i Holdings is working to establish quality control systems, recognizing that a product incident at one Group company affects the entire Group. Product control officers at the development division for the Seven Premium private brand, 12 Group companies that handle food products and 10 that handle apparel and household items meet regularly to share their policies and information. These activities are designed to prevent incidents and strengthen the Group’s ability to respond rapidly when incidents occur. Specifically, Group companies are working to establish the following foundation for quality control. Establishing a Foundation for Quality Control 1. A system with a dedicated department that can respond to incidents objectively. 2. A system for reporting major incidents quickly to the top management. 3. Guidelines for judging whether to recall products or continue sales if a serious incident occurs. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 51 Adoption of the NDF-HACCP Certification System SEJ has adopted the HACCP*1 (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) method since 1997 as a method to manage food hygiene aimed at improving the level of quality management during food production. Nihon Delica Foods Association (NDF)*2 has developed its own NDF-HACCP Certification System for labor-intensive industries producing small lots of many varieties, and we have obtained this certification for all our plants. Furthermore, this was changed to the NDF-FSMS*3 Certification System since October 2018 so as to respond to the institutionalization of the HACCP international standard, and we are working toward obtaining certification for all plants in 2020. (As of February 28, 2019, certification has been obtained for 40% of our plants.) In addition, we also hold study sessions on food allergies to deepen understanding of allergy onset mechanisms and symptoms together with our business partners and to promote the creation of food allergy management systems. *1 HACCP: A process management system that analyzes hazards at each step of production, from ingredient acceptance through to product finalization, and provides continuous monitoring and recording of critically important hazard prevention processes. *2 Nihon Delica Foods Association (NDF): The NDF was formed in 1979 to improve hygiene quality management levels at daily food manufacturing facilities and to eliminate regionbased quality differences. *3 FSMS: Food Safety Management System, a mechanism for the proper management of hazards that threaten food safety so as to deliver safe and secure foodstuffs to consumers. For more details about SEJ initiatives (in Japanese) Acquisition of JGAP Certification For our private brands Fruits and Vegetables with Traceability at Ito-Yokado, we are working to acquire the Japan Good Agricultural Practice (JGAP) certification, an agricultural production process management technique, in order to further improve the level of our quality management. JGAP sets standards that should be implemented in day-to-day agricultural management to improve safety and protect the environment. Certification has been acquired by 133 producers as of February 28, 2019, and efforts will be made for further certification going forward. For more details about Ito-Yokado initiatives (in Japanese) Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 52 Acquisition of ISO 22000 Certification York-Benimaru Co., Ltd. acquired certification under ISO 22000, an international food safety management system, at its Otsuki Store in Koriyama City, Fukushima Prefecture. Going forward, York-Benimaru will use the experience of acquiring ISO 22000 certification to introduce HACCP systems at all stores while training store employees. The company will also work to provide greater safety and confidence to customers regarding food products and enhance product quality in all stages from procurement to sale. Hygiene Management Based on ISO 9001 At Seven & i Food Systems, the QC Office that serves as the hygiene management division has acquired the ISO 9001 international standard concerning quality management (application scope consisting of food hygiene management system standards and provision at stores). Utilizing this system, efforts are made to improve hygiene management at stores and educate employees. In hygiene management, priority is placed on freshness management that is easy to understand and can be performed by anyone. The QC Office conducts checks at stores, and random checks of store hygiene are also conducted by a third-party hygiene inspection organization (wipe inspections). Store employees undergo periodic hygiene management training to raise hygiene management levels. For more details about Seven & i Foods Systems initiatives (in Japanese) Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 53 Introduction of Cold Chains Various leafy vegetables are used in 7-Eleven’s original daily foods (rice balls, sandwiches, stuffed bread, salads, delicatessen items, noodles, and so on). We began introducing cold chains (low-temperature distribution networks) in 2005 for low temperature transportation and processing in order to maintain high levels of freshness of produce from harvesting in the field to delivery to stores. Harvested vegetables are consistently maintained at low temperature in delivery vehicles, at sorting centers and processing factories, and until placement on store shelves. In addition, the active use of domestic produce in regions close to where it was harvested reduces energy use in transportation. Cold chains (low-temperature distribution networks) Inspection for Radioactive Substances In response to an increase in inquiries since the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Seven & i Holdings Group voluntarily conducts inspections to complement the monitoring of radioactive materials that was carried out by the government, and we have posted details on our website. The Radioactivity Project was established as an internal organization at YB to enable customers to shop with confidence by complementing the monitoring on radioactive substances implemented by the government. We install equipment for measuring radioactive substances at key points within the area where we have established stores, and an internal organization conducts regular inspections. The inspection results are announced on the company’s website. For the case of our private brand Three-Star Fruit and Vegetables, we endeavor to sell products that meet the criteria by having buyers visit production sites and conduct soil inspections and independent inspections on samples. Inspections for radioactive substances are also conducted for IY’s Foods with Traceability and the results are published on the company’s website. For more details about IY initiatives (in Japanese) For results of the inspections at York-Benimaru (in Japanese) Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 54 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Food Traceability The Seven & i Group proactively discloses traceability of products as an initiative to emphasize the safety and reliability of its products at all stages from raw materials procurement through to sales. “Fresh Foods with Traceability” and “Products with Visible Production Areas” Initiatives IY sells products under its private brand Fresh Foods with Traceability, where we achieve an accurate understanding of production sites, production methods, and distribution channels and communicate these to customers. For these products, our procurement officers check with producers at the production sites to ensure that they are using appropriate cultivation and stock-raising management. Before the products are sold, various tests are conducted, including agricultural chemical residue tests, as well as soil, feed, and water quality tests, and third-party confirmation is obtained. Furthermore, radioactive substances are also inspected under stringent standards that are stricter than the statutory standards. Customers can confirm producer and inspection-results information for Fresh Foods with Traceability products on the IY website using a PC or smartphone. As of February 28, 2019, 238 items are handled under the Fresh Foods with Traceability brand, covering all fresh foods including vegetables, fruits, meat, eggs, and fish. Also, York-Benimaru has established a section called “York-Benimaru Products with Visible Production Areas” on its website, providing information on the production site, characteristics, production process, producers, and other aspects of the fresh food that the company has carefully selected. As of February 28, 2019, we are handling about 30 product items under this system.

CSR Data Book 2019 55 Centralized Management of Production Records SEJ uses an average of 40 different food materials (including seasonings) per daily food product item, which includes rice and delicatessen items. To manage these individual products and correctly grasp which production facilities produced them and which materials have been used in which regions, SEJ manages information from all its approximately 160 dedicated plants using a database system and links this to the point-of-sale data at its stores to precisely manage the production history of its products, from the production region of the materials used to the stores where the products are sold. This enables any problems that arise in connection with food materials, for example, to be addressed immediately. Further, to make absolutely sure about the products it sells, SEJ also verifies whether products contain any additives or allergens. In addition, SEJ is also able to precisely track the volume of food materials, packaging, and containers used at every plant, which helps it reduce waste by limiting excess production, for instance. Moreover, the company voluntarily conducts DNA testing on rice to prevent the admixture of other varieties as well as testing for radioactive substances.

CSR Data Book 2019 56 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Consideration for Health Amid increasing public interest in health and nutrition, including the problems of obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and nutritional deficiencies, Seven & i Holdings is responding to a stronger health orientation among customers by working to reduce the use of food additives and provide food products with a good balance of nutrients. Reducing the Use of Food Additives Seven & i Holdings is taking steps to reduce the use of additives in food products as a step towards providing health conscious products. For example, 7Eleven’s original daily foods, numbering around 2,000 items including rice balls and boxed lunches, and IY’s delicatessen items, boxed lunches, and sushi produced in-store are all free from synthetic coloring agents and preservatives. Furthermore, SEJ is continuing its own initiatives with food manufacturers to reduce trans fatty acid, which is said to increase the risk of heart disease. Based on the Guidelines on Trans Fatty Acid Labeling issued by the Consumer Affairs Agency, SEJ discloses information on its website on levels of saturated fatty acid, trans fatty acid, and cholesterol contained in its main food products.

In response to rising demand for healthy foods, the “Good Health Starts with this Hand” logo is placed on products that contain dietary fiber roughly equal to that in a serving of lettuce and contain at least one-half of the daily requirement of vegetables,* and stronger appeals of these products are being made to customers. SEJ plans to expand product categories and lineups in the future. ※The Healthy Japan 21 (Secondary) guideline for vegetable consumption is an average of 350 g per day. “Good Health Starts with this Hand” logo Products of the “Good Health Starts with this Hand” series Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

CSR Data Book 2019 59 Labeling of Nutritional Components and Allergy Information Seven and i Holdings strives to provide proper labeling of nutritional components for its private brand Seven Premium. In addition to displaying nutritional components* such as energy, protein, fat, carbohydrates, and salt equivalents, for certain products we also display components such as saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acid, and cholesterol. Calorie counts are printed on the front of most products to make it easier for customers to find when selecting a product. The Seven & i Group strives to provide customers with clear product labelling so that people with allergies are also able to select products with confidence. Both products purchased from suppliers and products prepared in-store are labeled for allergen content, and the labels list allergens mandated under the Food Sanitation Act as well as items that are recommended for labeling. For example, information on use of specified ingredients and equivalent items in products prepared in-store at 7-Eleven (hot snacks, oden, Chinese steamed buns) and in menu items at Denny’s restaurants is provided on our website. In addition, we revised Denny’s restaurant menus in September 2018 to provide allergy information (use of seven specified ingredients and 20 equivalent items) in all menu books used in each time slot. Furthermore, in addition to posting information on our website, in July 2017 we placed tablets in all restaurants so customers can conduct searches regarding allergens (specified ingredients and equivalent items) in each menu item. These tablets are easy to use and enable customers to check detailed information when ordering. * Excluding certain items for discretionary labeling that have small surface area.

CSR Data Book 2019 60 Sales of Products with Food Allergy Considerations Ito-Yokado offers the “Healthy Fruitcake”—a cake which does not use specified ingredients—available by reservation so that customers with food allergies can eat products with confidence. For more details about IY’s initiatives (in Japanese) A Healthy Fruitcake At the Denny’s restaurant chain managed by Seven & i Food Systems, there is a low-allergen menu and low-allergen cake for children that do not include any of the seven specified allergens (eggs, milk, wheat, buckwheat, peanuts, shrimp, and crab), created out of consideration for children who have food allergies. When the meals are prepared at the restaurants, employees cook and arrange the food in an area separate from the regular cooking line, and the tableware is individually washed and stored to prevent secondary contamination by allergens. Denny’s restaurants have introduced tablets that customer can use to search information on the use of designated ingredients and equivalent items, and all menus used in each time slot contain information on the use of allergens (seven specified ingredients and 20 equivalent items). For more details about Denny’s initiatives (in Japanese) Low allergen menu Low-allergen cake Regarding Handling of Genetically Modified Foodstuff Seven & i Holdings labels genetically modified foodstuffs in accordance with relevant domestic regulations. In addition, genetically modified ingredients are not used for the main ingredients—for which labeling is obligatory—of products under the Group’s private brand Seven Premium (excluding certain products such as soy sauce and oil which use genetically modified potatoes, corn, soy beans, and other produce recognized for import by the Japanese government). Disaster Reconstruction Support Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 61 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Communication with Customers The Seven & i Group quickly responds to comments and requests provided by email or phone through customer consultation desks set up at each Group company in order to improve products and services from the customer’s perspective. Given the need to protect privacy in connection with feedback received from customers, all personal information is deleted, and the feedback is then categorized by content and communicated to departments and stores for use in making improvements. Information on customer feedback at 7-Eleven stores can be found here (in Japanese) Information on customer feedback at IY stores can be found here (in Japanese) Enhancing Customer Service Quality Seven & i Holdings holds a monthly information and liaison meeting of the Seven & i Group's customer consultation desks, which is attended by customer service desk supervisors at each Group company, in order to reduce the factors that cause customer dissatisfaction and raise satisfaction levels throughout the Group, not just at individual Group companies. Measures taken in response to comments and requests received from customers are shared on a regular basis and the information is incorporated into products and services. Annual training is also held for customer consultation desk personnel at each Group company with a view to further refining customer service skills. Customer consultation desk personnel training Collecting Customer Feedback Seven & i Holdings collects feedback from customers who visit its stores on customer service, sales floor setup, product lineups, and other aspects of operations in order to further improve its products and services. For example, at SEJ, a questionnaire is conducted every two years of 10,000 people to ascertain the needs of customers nationwide. In addition, at IY, store surveys are contracted to external agencies certified as consumer affairs advisors to collect feedback from store customers. Based on the results of the surveys, Group companies work to develop products that incorporate the evaluations and opinions of customers. Product Development Using a Website For its Seven Premium private-brand products, the Group launched Seven Premium Enhancement Committee —a website community for product development that invites participation by customers in 2009. The website features users’ evaluations of individual products and original recipes using Seven Premium products. We also use the website to call for participants in product monitor surveys. The information gathered from the website enables us to analyze the ways and scenarios in which customers use our products, and is reflected in product development.

CSR Data Book 2019 62 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Information Security and Personal Information Protection Seven & i Holdings positions the appropriate protection and security of information assets handled by the Group as an important priority and social responsibility of its management and operations and as mandatory for all executives and employees. We strictly manage personal information received from customers in particular and take special care to prevent information leaks and other such incidents. Development of Information Security Management System Seven & i Holdings anticipates that points of contact with customers will further increase through our Omni-Channel Strategy. In light of this, just as with food safety, initiatives to ensure the safety and security of information assets themselves constitute the foundation that will support the strategy. Seven & i Holdings has established the Basic Policy on Information Security and Basic Policy on Protection of Personal Information to promote the appropriate protection and use of customer information (personal information) acquired through Omni-Channel initiatives and further promote safe and secure business operations, and we have obtained ISMS certification (ISO 27001) for information security management systems. Through the implementation of a PDCA cycle for our ISMS we continue to develop a high-level information security system. We have also acquired the PCIDSS certification, which is a global security standard, in our Omni-Channel system. Our goal in this is to ensure the safe handling of particularly credit card information, business partners’ information, and business partners. Information security is also regarded as an important risk, and we have established the Information Management Committee to analyze, assess, and address this risk. We develop our management systems based on these activities. Specifically, we are working to strengthen our information management and security by establishing information security standards to be achieved by the Group and conducting development in accordance with the PDCA cycle method prescribed by ISMS certification at Group companies. More details about our Basic Policy on Information Security can be found here More details about our Basic Policy on Personal Information Protection can be found here Further information about bases that have acquired ISMS certification and about PCIDSS certification acquisition can be found here (in Japanese) Information security management system Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 63 Employee Training to Raise Awareness of Information Security and Cyber Security Seven & i Holdings conducted information security training through e-learning and group training programs for all executives and employees of the Group companies in order to raise employee awareness of information security and cyber security. The fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 training was on the theme of internal fraud, and in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 it was focused on targeted cyberattacks. We also provide educational tools for used in morning meetings and departmental meetings to encourage education within departments. All employees at hiring and retirement sign a confidentiality pledge, which also raises awareness of information security. In employee training through daily operations and regular meetings, all employees are told to promptly report, communicate, and consult about any problems that occur to the person responsible for information management of the respective division, and in e-learning and group training as well, employees are trained to immediately report suspicious occurrences. Reporting lines to upper management have been established depending on the severity of the occurrence. We have also created Reporting Guidelines for Significant Events, and when a significant event occurs that could potentially impact the entire Group, there is an internal reporting line depending on the severity level for reporting to upper management at the Group company where it occurred. There is also a reporting line for reporting the incident to the Information Management & Security Department and upper management of Seven & i Holdings. In creating these two reporting lines, we strive to ensure the accuracy of information conveyed and the promptness of our response. Cyberattack Measures Seven & i Holdings has established the 7&i Computer Security Incident Response Team (7&i CSIRT) to respond to external cyberattacks and minimize their impact and potential damage, particularly from a technical standpoint. The team conducts quick and appropriate containment and other measures in response to information security incidents in an organized manner. In addition, when an information security incident is judged to be a major incident by the 7&i CSIRT (based on the extent of damage, etc.), a response system has been built for mobilizing the 7&i Security Incident Response Team (7&i SIRT) and to deciding on and carry out emergency response measures, standard response measures for system recovery, and externally directed actions, in particular, such how the incident is to be disclosed. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 64 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Appropriate Disclosure of Information on Products and Services Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines stipulate that “We seek to display information that is accurate, easy to understand, and truthful so that customers can make an appropriate selection of products and services.” Moreover, each Group company will check the following information and strive to transmit this information to customers. Provide beneficial information to customers, taking the customer’s perspective, even if the information is negative from the Company’s perspective. (For example: Consumption of this produce may be hazardous for health, etc.) For information such as images and recordings distributed as commercials and advertisements, we will use appropriate expressions for the audience. We will provide information that meets or exceeds the legally mandatory level with regard to health, environment, and other sustainability aspects. Establishment of Management System for Information Provided to Customers The Seven & i Group verifies in advance that product and price information listed in advertising media, including newspaper inserts, pamphlets, and television commercials, is accurate and that they contain no information that might mislead customers. For example, IY requires that prior approval be obtained from its Fair Trade Committee Office when listing dual prices with the sales price and a comparison price, or discounts, in newspaper inserts and other media. Employee Training on Product Labeling Seven & i Holdings conducts regular, group training twice a year based on laws governing labeling such as the Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Food Labeling Act for newly assigned purchasing personnel at Group companies to provide basic knowledge on improper labeling and excessive gifts or giveaways prohibited under laws and regulations. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 166 employees at 15 companies underwent this training. In addition, e-learning is conducted for Group personnel involved in procurement. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 11,985 employees from 23 companies underwent this training. Group training on labeling Prevention of Improper Labeling Seven & i Holdings has established the “Group Discretionary Guideline on Imprecise Labeling,” on product labeling for the Group to prevent the use of expressions that could mislead customers. The guideline is thoroughly taught to and implemented by product development and quality control staff at each Group company. For example, the expression “permanent” is not used in principle as it is difficult to rationally present the permanent efficacy of a product in the future. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 65 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Implementing Crime Prevention Measures for Local Communities Seven & i Holdings cooperates in local crime prevention initiatives in line with the operational characteristics of each Group company to ensure that customers can use its facilities safely and with confidence. Safety Station Activities 7-Eleven stores take advantage of the fact that they stay open 24 hours a day every day of the year to conduct Safety Station activities (SS activities). These involve looking out for the safety and security of the community through such activities as providing a place for women and children to seek assistance, protecting seniors, preventing robberies, shoplifting, and designated fraud, responding to accidents and disasters, and helping in the case of a sudden illness. 7-Eleven stores work to promote a healthier environment for young people by not selling alcohol and tobacco products to minors (those under the age of 20 years), for example, and SEJ also provides information to raise awareness of compliance and crime prevention at franchised stores through “SS Activity Notices” issued monthly. Activities are publicized using posters Preventing the sale of alcohol and tobacco to those less than 20 years old An SS Activity Notice The “SS Space” on the Japan Franchise Association (JFA) website Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 66 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Disaster Assistance Seven & i Holdings strives to quickly reopen its establishments and keep them in operation even during disasters as a part of its mission to preserve community lifelines and fulfill its role as social infrastructure when disasters occur. Swift Regional Relief Activities in Disasters and Local Awareness-Raising The Seven & i Group stores strive to preserve community lifelines during disasters by working quickly to resume and continue operations, as well as providing swift regional relief during disasters along with tap water, restroom facilities, disaster information, and other necessities. Head Office also provided support for stores in the form of product supplies and special assistance for staff members. In preparation for a wide range of situations, we work with the community to fulfill our role as important social infrastructure for daily living. In addition, Seven & i Group companies have been promoting the conclusion of agreements on assistance with relief provisions and support for evacuees during disasters with local governments, under which they provide material assistance in line with requests from local governments during disasters. All Group stores conduct fundraising activities to assist people affected by disasters and have launched free Wi-Fi service Seven Spot. In July 2017, three Group companies–Seven & i Holdings, SEJ, and IY–were designated as public institutions under the Basic Act on Disaster Control Measures. As daily initiatives, the stores feature disaster preparedness sections and hold disaster preparedness events and so forth in a bid to raise customer awareness of disasters. Cooperation with Local Government During Disasters SEJ and Denny’s, which is managed by Seven & i Food Systems, have registered stores and restaurants in prefectures with which agreements have been executed as Disaster Support Stations. In the event of a large-scale disaster, these sites will provide tap water, restroom facilities, and information to the extent possible to persons who are unable to return to their homes. A Disaster Support Station sticker Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 67 Providing Means of Communication in Emergencies Seven & i Holdings allows its free Wi-Fi service Seven Spot, located at approximately 20,000 Seven & i Group stores nationwide, to be used on a special basis during emergencies even by people who have not registered as members so that they can confirm the safety of friends and relatives and serve as a line of communication for those who are unable to return home.

Emergency telephone Free In-Store Wi-Fi Service Seven Spot 7VIEW: Seven Visual Information Emergency Web Seven & i Holdings compiles a range of information within the Group but we have also joined with business partners to develop the 7VIEW*1 system for providing, sharing, and utilizing disaster information more broadly. The system automatically combines various information sources from external organizations such as the Japan Meteorological Agency and L-Alert*2, as well as Group companies, and layers them onto a map to enable a swift and accurate grasp of disaster conditions without placing a burden on disaster areas. We are continuing to develop the system by forming links between companies, as well as with the national and local governments and public research institutions, to help reestablish supply chains as quickly as possible. 7VIEW Screen *1.

CSR Data Book 2019 68 Fuel Depot for Delivery of Emergency Provisions One of the important priorities of Seven & i Holdings in the area of business continuity in emergencies is maintaining fuel supply networks in the event of a major disaster. We have established a fuel depot at IY’s distribution center in Saitama Prefecture that can be used by product delivery trucks to transport emergency provisions, a first for a Japanese retailer. The depot maintains a permanent supply of 400 kiloliters of fuel, and when a disaster occurs it can be used to deliver emergency provisions and products for up to ten days to evacuation centers in affected regions and elsewhere and to Group stores and establishments in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Fuel for vehicles is stored in underground tanks Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 69 Material Issue 2 Providing Safety and Reliability through Products and Stores Disaster Reconstruction Support The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011 inflicted enormous damage on Tohoku and surrounding regions. The Seven & i Group helps to support the reconstruction by working with employee volunteers and NPOs to conduct a variety of activities, including product sales, while leveraging its position as a retailer to connect consumers with producers. Tohoku Kakehashi Project The Seven & i Group has held the Tohoku Kakehashi Project in support of the reconstruction. Our goal is to serve as a bridge connecting the people of Tohoku with people around the country in their desire to support the reconstruction with the cooperation of Fukushima, Miyagi, Iwate, and other Tohoku Prefectures and various government agencies. There were 270 sponsor and participant companies and approximately 2,300 items, making the project over 10 times larger than when it first started. Procuring local products from disaster-affected regions helps revitalize the agriculture and fishing industries. In addition, to keep affected regions fresh in the minds of people living outside of them, we purchase products from affected partner companies in Tohoku and the products of major food manufacturers produced in the region. We also hold sales events at approximately 400 stores in total, including IY and York-Benimaru.

CSR Data Book 2019 71 Material Issue 3 Non-Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients, and Energy Approach to Material Issues The Seven & i Group operates around 20,000 primarily retail stores throughout Japan, and deals with numerous products. We believe that reducing the energy consumption and waste material generated by the Group’s business activities will make a significant contribution toward realizing a sustainable society. At the same time, such efforts are also of great value to the Seven & i Group as they will additionally help to reduce waste, product and raw material costs, together with energy costs. We have therefore positioned elimination of waste in products, raw materials, and energy throughout the entire value chain one of our most material issues, and we are taking measures to address it. Relevant Policies Environmental Guidelines / Environmental Rules Seven & i Holdings Environmental Declaration / Fundamental Polices Relating to Measures to Contribute to the Prevention of Global Warming Business Partner Action Guidelines Background to Material Issues Climate Change Environmental issues are a global concern. Manifestations of climate change, such as rising sea levels, erratic weather, and damage to primary industries, pose serious threats to future generations. An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report states that global warming is “beyond doubt,” and if current trends continue, the worst case is that temperatures will rise by 2°C or more by 2050, with CO2 emissions considered to be the major cause. Food Waste In 2014, the global amount of food aid reached approximately 3.2 million tons. The increase in the global population and abnormal weather have given rise to food shortages with one in nine people now estimated to suffer from chronic hunger. By comparison, over 17 million tons of food is wasted every year in Japan. Of this, 6.32 million tons is food loss—food that is likely to be still edible, such as half-eaten food or food that has passed its expiry date. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 72 Promotional Framework for Material Issues In response to this material issue, the CSR Management Committee, led by the president, and its subordinate Environmental Subcommittee, work together with the Group companies and related departments to promote initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions and make effective use of limited resources through business activities. These activities are supervised by the Seven and i Holdings Director Executive Officer Head of Corporate Communication Division. Contribution to SDGs In addressing these material issues, Seven & i Holdings contributes to achieving goals 4, 7, 12, 13, and 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing CO2 emissions and waste of food products, and so forth.

ISO 14001 Acquisition Seven & i Holdings aims to reduce its environmental impact. To this end, we are promoting acquisition of the international standard ISO 14001, and we conduct annual internal audits at the operating companies that have the certification. Sogo & Seibu became the first in the department store sector to acquire ISO 14001 certification in 1999, and has maintained it continuously at all business sites. Furthermore, SEJ acquired the certification at the end of February 2015 for its offices and directly managed stores throughout Japan. Seven & i Food Systems also acquired the certification in February 2015, and IY Foods in February 2016. The sales ratio of the operating companies that have obtained ISO 14001 certification is approximately 50% of the Group's net sales. Eco Action 21 Certification Acquired In collaboration with the Nihon Delica Foods Association (NDF), SEJ shares information on examples of initiatives that have substantial energy-saving effects at biannual nationwide CSR promotion conferences. SEJ also confirms the need to create system that can respond to a variety of environmental issues including compliance, continuing energy-saving measures, reducing CO2 emissions, and reducing food loss. Based on the results of the confirmations, SEJ declared that it will utilize Eco Action 21 established by the Ministry of the Environment. SEJ is taking action such as holding briefings and acquired certification at 32 plants of eight companies that produce daily products (as of February 28, 2019). Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 75 Third-Party Audit of CO 2 Emissions To correctly assess and verify the initiatives taken to reduce environmental impact, each year since 2015, Seven & i Holdings has undergone third-party audits of CO2 emissions from store operations. In the fiscal year ending February 28, 2020, audits of 12 companies* will be conducted, covering about 97% of the Group’s total sales. The CO2 emissions associated with store operations by the 12 companies in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 were 130,360 tons for Scope 1, and 3,110,724 tons for Scope 2. Moreover, we underwent a third-party audit of the data for the Category 1 emissions of SEJ, which accounted for about half (9,874,836 tons) of the Scope 3 emissions, thereby helping to improve the accuracy and reliability of the quantitative data internally and externally. * The twelve companies are: SEJ, IY, Sogo & Seibu, YB, York Mart, Seven & i Food Systems, Akachan Honpo, THE LOFT, SHELL GARDEN, Life Foods, IY Foods, and 7Eleven, Inc. Third-Party Verification Report Third-Party Verification Report Management of Water At each store of the Seven & i Group, in addition to the daily efforts made to conserve water, water-conserving faucets and energy-saving flushing toilets are also being introduced. Furthermore, through utilizing rainwater and so forth, we are working to reduce the volumes of water used. As a result, in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, water usage in conjunction with store operation was 34,067,000 m3*, a decrease of 11.4% compared to the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. * Eight companies included: SEJ, IY, Sogo & Seibu, YB, York Mart, Seven & i Food Systems, Akachan Honpo, and THE LOFT Management of CFCs At Seven & i Holdings stores, devices using CFCs are replaced with ones using CFC alternatives during remodeling and so forth. Moreover, in compliance with the Act on the Protection of the Ozone Layer Through the Control of Specified Substances and Other Measures, which was implemented in April 2015, devices undergo regular inspections and leakage assessments required by the government. Devices using CFCs are disposed of by professional companies in compliance with the law, and stores receive collection certificates from these contractors as proof of appropriate disposal. Substitute CFCs include HCFC (hydro chlorofluorocarbon), production of which is to be banned in developed countries by 2020. As this will require a changeover to another type of substitute, we also plan to further promote the introduction of non-CFC devices in freezing and refrigeration devices used at our stores. At SEJ, refrigeration devices that utilize CO2 refrigerants have been introduced at 174 stores (as of February 28, 2019), and we are trialing them at 6 IY stores. Management of Paper At 7-Eleven , we are making progress toward going paperless for accounting forms that have thus far been generated on paper, and we have been expanding this effort to all stores since June 2019. This initiative has allowed us to reduce the amount of paper used annually at each store by approx. 3,000 sheets, which helps to reduce the impact on the environment . Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 76 Material Issue 3 Non‒Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients and Energy Initiatives for Realizing a Low-Carbon Society Seven & i Holdings is taking steps to reduce CO2, the main cause of global warming, and to create a low-carbon society with dramatically reduced CO2 emissions. We are promoting energy saving initiatives and expanding the use of renewable energy in order to achieve a target of reducing CO2 emissions arising in conjunction with store operation by 80% compared to FY2013 by 2050*. * The target covers 12 operating companies subject to the Act Concerning the Rational Use of Energy (Energy-Saving Act) (SEJ, IY, Sogo & Seibu, YB, York Mart, Seven & i Food Systems, Akachan Honpo, THE LOFT, SHELL GARDEN, Life Foods, IY Foods, and Barneys Japan). Reduction Targets for CO 2 Emissions Approximately 90% of the CO2 emissions by each Seven & i Group company are from the use of energy for store operations. For this reason, we set a target of reducing CO2 emissions occurring in conjunction with operation of the stores of the 12 operating companies in Japan by 80% compared to FY2013 by FY2050 so that CO2 emissions do not increase in conjunction with the expansion of business and increases in the number of stores. Details of CO2 emissions amount data can be found here Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 77 Promoting Introduction of Energy-Saving Equipment at Stores In order to curtail the increase in environmental impact in comparison to increases and expansion of stores and expansion of products and services, each Seven & i Group company is installing energy-saving equipment such as LED illumination and solar panels when opening new stores and refurbishing existing stores. Conserving energy at stores also leads to lower costs for energy use. For example, at 7-Eleven stores, we are promoting environmentally friendly store creation by converting all types of lighting to LED, including store signage, sales area lighting, and sign poles. In 2014, we introduced new specification LED lighting that can further reduce electricity usage by approximately 50%. In addition, we have made progress with installing solar panels, which are now installed at 8,018 stores (as of February 28, 2019). At IY as well, to reduce the load on the environment from store operations, LED lighting has been installed at almost all stores, and solar panels have been installed at 13 stores (as of February 28, 2019).

In March 2017, the companies opened a store with a hydrogen station in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, bringing the total number of hydrogen-station stores to three with the existing stores in Ikegami, Ota-ku, Tokyo Metropolis and Kariya City, Aichi Prefecture. Looking ahead, we will install pure hydrogen fuel cells at the 7-Eleven stores with hydrogen stations and conduct a trial test on the environmental impact reduction to verify the potential for the use of fuel cells in stores. The project also aims to promote the creation of close-by, convenient stores that are closely tied to local communities, while creating sites that can serve as social infrastructure able to provide products, services, and clean energy at a single point. 7-Eleven store with hydrogen station at Ota-ku Ikegami 8-chome Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 79 Peopleand Environment-Friendly Next-Generation 7-Eleven Stores In December 2017, SEJ refurbished the Chiyoda Nibancho 7-Eleven store, incorporating new technologies that will serve as the foundations for optimal next-generation stores. By utilizing the technologies and facilities of companies representing various fields from Japan and other countries, total electric power externally purchased by the store has been reduced by approximately 28%*1, and work times relating to the subject equipment has been reduced by approximately 5.5 hours per day*2. In addition, in May 2018 we opened stores in Sagamihara City, Kanagawa Prefecture based on the three themes of reducing the impact on the environment, making it easier to work, and creating a comfortable store environment. We installed equipment that allowed us to cover approx. 46% of our electricity usage with renewable energy and reduce our daily working hours by approx. 7.1 hours. *1 Converted from the case where the technologies and equipment were installed in a standard store, compared to FY2013. *2 Total compared to work performed according to existing procedures in an average store environment.

CSR Data Book 2019 80 Commencement of Trial Test on 100% Renewable Energy Store Operation In September 2019, as an initiative based on the Agreement on Cooperation and Collaboration in Promoting SDGs between Seven & i Holdings and Kanagawa Prefecture as well as the Seven & i Group’s Environmental Declaration, Seven Eleven Japan started a trial test at 10 7-Eleven stores within Kanagawa Prefecture whereby all electric energy related to store operation is procured using renewable energy. 4R Energy ’s original batteries—which uses reused batteries from the Nissan LEAF electric vehicle produced by Nissan Motor —and solar panels with significantly improved electric power generation efficiency made by Kaneka are installed at stores undergoing the trial. Electric power is used efficiently through in-house power generation. In addition, since November 2019, the procurement of electric power beyond what in-house generation is being supplied by SMART TECH based on post-FIT *1, allowing an actual renewable energy rate of 100%*2 when combined with in-house power generation. In addition to initiatives undertaken so far, such as peopleand environment-friendly stores, Seven & i aims to significantly reduce CO2 emission through this initiative. ※1 FIT is the abbreviation for feed-in tariff , a scheme for energy buyback at a fixed price. It is an assistance scheme that fixes the buyback price of energy produced. Post-FIT is expected to gradually occur from November 2019 as the scheme ends for solar energy. ※2 Achieve an actual renewable energy rate of 100% by combining the use of electric power generated/stored by stores with that of electric power originating from postFIT. Overview of Initiative Installation of Electric Vehicle Chargers Seven & i Holdings and NEC Corporation have installed approximately 3,300 chargers for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHVs) as of February 28, 2019 in parking lots at 47 stores in Japan, including IY, Ario, and Sogo & Seibu department stores to provide a fee-based charging service. Payment for the service is made with a charging card issued by Nippon Charge Service LLC, a joint venture established by four Japanese automakers, as well as credit cards. This project is the largest scale introduction of EV and PHV chargers ever attempted in Japan. The initiative aims to increase the convenience of the commercial facilities and establish a pattern for using EVs and PHVs of charging them while shopping. It also aims to contribute to the realization of a lowcarbon society by promoting the spread of environment-friendly, next-generation cars. Electric Vehicle Chargers Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 81 Managing Climate Change Risks Seven & i Holdings is affected by various risks related to climate change. These include regulatory risk from tighter regulations in Japan and overseas, physical risk from the occurrence of major disasters, and judgment risk, in which changes in consumer purchasing behavior due to the climate and response to weather fluctuations become the standards for evaluating companies. In particular, the impact from changes in temperature and the occurrence of major natural disasters extends beyond damage to store equipment and distribution networks, restrictions or halts to trading, and sales opportunity loss; it can also affect Group companies’ product suppliers and raw material prices. Climate change is therefore a risk factor for all aspects of operations, from product development and production to distribution, store operations, and product lineups. Seven & i Holdings therefore recognizes that quickly building and implementing a business model that can cope with weather and climate change is important for maintaining growth. Seven & i Holdings, in accordance with its “basic rules for risk management,” establishes, maintains, and utilizes comprehensive risk management systems, centered on the Risk Management Committee, in order to properly analyze and evaluate, and appropriately respond to risks associated with each business, with consideration for changes in the management environment and risk factors relevant to the Company and its Group companies. Risks associated with climate change are managed under the systems described below. Once each year, each Group company identifies risks affecting that company based on an examination of the shared Group risk catalogue presented by the Risk Department, which serves as the administrative office for the Risk Management Committee. Companies quantify risks assessments based on the degree of impact and the likelihood of occurrence of each risk, organize responses countermeasures to each risk in a risk assessment table, and submit the table to the Risk Department. The risk assessment tables include physical risks (large-scale disasters) from restrictions on CO2 emissions and climate change as well as reputational risks from delays in responding to climate change and other such risks. The Risk Management Committee meets twice annually with the president of Seven & i Holdings in attendance to comprehensively determine the status of Group risks based on the risk assessments and countermeasures submitted by each Group company and monitors implementation of risk management and improvement measures by each company from the perspectives of materiality, urgency of improvements, and so on. The officer responsible for the Risk Management Committee responds on the status of Group risk management to the Seven & i Holdings Board of Directors at least once annually. Measures for Adaptation to and Mitigation of Climate Change Risks Our enduring concern around weather and temperature change is reflected in our daily ordering activities and sales floor formation. In product development and lineups as well, we strive to provide products that meet customers’ needs by establishing a hypothesis based on weather changes over several months. At the same time, we will respond carefully to changes in customers’ purchasing behavior driven by abnormal weather and temperature changes driven by climate change. The Seven Farm environmental recycling‒oriented agriculture initiative of IY buys the entire quantity of harvested produce, including non‒standard items. This enables us to procure and sell vegetables steadily regardless of market trends. In this way, we are also addressing the aspect of stable product procurement. These Seven Farms are located in 14 places throughout Japan, covering approximately 250 ha in total. (As of February 28, 2019). In addition, Seven & i Holdings is establishing systems to prepare for disasters associated with sudden weather phenomena, such as the numerous incidents of heavy rain and landslides that have occurred recently in Japan. For example, we have distributed booklets to regular employees summarizing how to respond in an emergency, and we have also been holding regular simulation drills using teleconferencing systems and so forth. Furthermore, Seven & i Holdings is constructing 7VIEW (Seven Visual Information Emergency Web), a system that enables provision, sharing, and joint use of disaster information. The system gathers together information from within the Group and through cooperation with business partners. Measures to mitigate climate change include various initiatives related to reducing our environmental impact, such as energy conservation and use of renewable energy at stores, along with forest maintenance and related activities throughout Japan. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 82 Material Issue 3 Non-Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients and Energy Reducing Environmental Impact in the Supply Chain Seven & i Holdings is focusing on reducing its own environmental impact as well as working together with its business partners to reduce environmental impact across the entire supply chain. For example, we are promoting various initiatives such as working together with original product manufacturing plants and delivery service providers and others to save energy at factories and introduce eco-friendly vehicles. Scope 3 *1 Calculation Seven & i Holdings is working to reduce CO2 emissions and evaluate its environmental impact at every stage from the supply chain through to sales and consumption, as stated in its Fundamental Policies Relating to Measures to Contribute to the Prevention of Global Warming. To this end, we have calculated the CO2 emissions (“Scope 3”) throughout the entire supply chain following the “Basic Guidelines on Accounting for Greenhouse Gas Emissions throughout the Supply Chain Ver. 2.1.” of the Ministry of the Environment. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 we calculated emissions for 10 major Group companies*2. The results showed that Scope 3 emissions accounted for almost 90% of the Group’s overall emissions, and of these, around 80% originated in the raw materials procurement process. We will analyze this calculation result and use it to achieve further reductions of CO2 emissions across the entire supply chain. *1. “Scope 3”: CO2 emissions other than those from the company, emitted from its procurement of raw materials and products, transportation, and product use, together with CO2 emissions from waste disposal processes *2.

CSR Data Book 2019 83 Environmental Consideration in Leased Vehicles At SEJ, Operation Field Consultants, who support franchised store management, use leased vehicles to visit franchised stores. We have been phasing in hybrid vehicles for these leased vehicles. In the fiscal year ending February 28, 2019, we replaced about 1,800 of our leased vehicles with hybrid models. Reducing CO 2 Emissions from Deliveries Seven & i Holdings is asking its partners who deliver products to stores to cooperate with efforts to introduce eco-friendly vehicles, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce store delivery frequencies. Furthermore, progress is also being made in fitting trucks with drive-data terminals that record driving status. Data collected from the terminals is used to provide driver instruction and eco-driving seminars. Introduction of Eco-Friendly Vehicles SEJ is actively introducing eco-friendly hybrid trucks and compressed natural gas (CNG) delivery vehicles and working to reduce CO2 emissions to support the development of a low-carbon society. Of the total of 6,001 delivery vehicles, 983 are eco-friendly vehicles (as of February 28, 2019). In April 2019, SEJ entered into an agreement with Toyota Motor Corporation regarding store shipments using small fuel cell trucks to save energy and reduce CO2 in logistics. Under the agreement, we have begun a demonstration trial for shipments using hydrogen-powered fuel cell trucks. Japan’s first EV delivery truck A small fuel cell truck Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 84 Using Biodiesel in Delivery Vehicles SEJ is cooperating with a project being conducted by Ehime Prefecture to encourage the use of biodiesel fuel (BDF) produced from used frying oil. Starting March 2018, SEJ has been refining BDF from oil collected from households, fryers in 7-Eleven stores, and production of fried foods at specialized plants in Ehime Prefecture. SEJ projects that approximately 25,000 liters of BDF will be used each month and that emissions from deliveries will be reduced by about 2,590 kgCO2 per month. A delivery vehicle the uses biodiesel fuel Promoting Introduction of Eco-Friendly Tires SEJ is promoting the introduction of eco-friendly tires with low rolling resistance for delivery vehicles. As of February 28, 2019, we have installed ecofriendly tires on 5,941 delivery vehicles, representing approximately 99% of the total fleet. Moreover, SEJ has also introduced retread tires to 2,015 vehicles, as of February 28, 2019. These tires are made from tires that have finished their service life, by removing a certain amount of the rubber surface that makes contact with the road and applying new rubber and tread. In this way, they can be re-used as rear tires for delivery vehicles. SEJ will promote the use of retread tires to contribute to resource conservation and waste reduction by reusing them. Retread tires Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 85 Introduction of Energy-Saving Equipment at Distribution Centers SEJ is promoting efforts to reduce wasted power usage at its distribution centers by introducing “demand controllers” that monitor the electricity usage of each unit of equipment and apply controls to the equipment in use to ensure that the usage does not exceed a certain range at 79 of 159 distribution centers (as of February 28, 2019). Promoting Environmental Information Management at Manufacturing Plants SEJ has its original daily products manufactured by several contract manufacturers. These manufacturers have organized the Nihon Delica Foods Association, which reports on the CO2 emissions, waste emissions, and the food recycle rate associated with plant operations. We work to ascertain the environmental information of our contract manufacturers and hold study seminars in conjunction with the CSR Promotion Committee of the Nihon Delica Foods Association, where we share environmental measures such as energy-saving with each manufacturer in an effort to reduce energy use at their plants. Business Partner Action Guidelines and CSR Audit To ensure that it meets its social responsibilities on matters such as human rights, labor issues and the environment, Seven & i Holdings formulated the Business Partner Action Guidelines and asks business partners to understand and implement them. The guidelines cover compliance with environmental laws and regulations, as well as consideration for climate change, biodiversity, and sustainable procurement. Since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, we have had CSR audits conducted by third-party inspections organizations at the manufacturing plants of our private brand suppliers in developing countries. The CSR audits include inspections of environmental aspects, such as compliance with environmental laws and regulations, management of effluent and chemical substances, and promotion of energy-saving and environmental protection activities. Further details about the Business Partner Action Guidelines can be found here Further details about CSR audits of business partners can be found here Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 86 Material Issue 3 Non-Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients and Energy Promoting Food Recycling At Seven & i Holdings, food products account for a large portion of net sales. With this in mind, we have been advancing measures based on the key themes of reducing food waste and promoting recycling with a target food recycling rate of 100% by 2050*. * Covering six food-related operating companies: SEJ, IY, YB, York Mart, Seven & i Food Systems, and SHELL GARDEN. Our Approach to Reducing Food Waste Our priorities for reducing food waste are to curtail the generation of waste, promote the reuse of waste, convert waste into feed and fertilizer, and recover heat. The Seven & i Group is currently conducting initiatives centered on converting waste into feed and fertilizer. For example, IY has been engaged in “recycling-oriented agriculture” since 2008. Under this system, food residue generated by IY stores is composted and used by Seven Farms to grow vegetables. These vegetables are then sold at IY stores. Looking ahead, we will continue to establish these recycling systems in each region, with a view to enhancing the recycling rate. We are also taking steps to curtail the generation of waste, including innovating sales methods and developing products with longer-lasting freshness. Looking ahead, we will continue to advance innovative initiatives to prevent the generation of food waste, such as by developing new products and services. With regard to reuse, SEJ has been donating inventories of process foods to food banks when stores are closed or refurbished, since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, and began making donations to social welfare organization in the fiscal year ending February 28, 2019. Ito-Yokado has similarly been donating unexpired foods from some stores to food banks since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018. We believe that promoting reuse is an important issue, and we will step up our measures in this area in the future. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 87 Reducing Food Waste In order to reduce food waste, the Seven & i Group has been innovating its sales methods, products and other aspects of business in various ways. For example, IY has introduced sales methods such as selling individual loose items and selling by weight, enabling customers to purchase products only in the amounts they need. In addition, SEJ has developed chilled boxed lunches that have longer expiry dates than conventional products, without compromising taste or quality. This has been achieved by revising ingredients, manufacturing processes, and temperature control methods. SEJ is also working to reduce food waste by developing products with longer-lasting freshness in the categories of bread and delicatessen items. In other areas, Seven & i Food Systems has been implementing measures to reduce food leftovers at Denny’s restaurants, such as providing menus offering dishes with smaller servings that can be finished comfortably without leftovers, supplying take-home boxes for any leftovers, and holding a campaign in collaboration with municipalities to encourage people to enjoy eating everything on their plate. Installing Systems to Treat Garbage At IY, a “biodegradable garbage processor” system that breaks down garbage using microorganisms was introduced in October of 2011 and has been installed in 20 stores as of the end of February 2019. Through the power of microorganisms, the devices break down into water and CO2 garbage that is illsuited to recycling (such as highly fibrous substances, etc.). This process results in reduced CO2 emissions compared to incineration processing, and it offers an effective reduction of waste volumes. Garbage processor Converting Food Waste into Feed and Fertilizer SEJ has been promoting “Eco Distribution*” since 1994 as a system for appropriate processing and recycling of waste . Under this system, we work to recycle food products that have passed their sell-by dates into feed and fertilizer. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, the combined recycling rate for products that had passed their sell-by dates and discarded food oil was 54.4%. * Eco Distribution: 7-Eleven’s original waste recycling system. A recommended waste disposal provider for franchisees in each region collects all of the waste from 7-Eleven stores for appropriate processing and recycling. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 88 Recycling-Oriented Farms (Seven Farms) In August 2008, with the aim of enhancing recycling rates and revitalizing local agriculture, IY established “Seven Farm Tomisato” as an agricultural production corporation in Tomisato City, Chiba Prefecture, thereby becoming the first player in the retail sector to engage in “recycling-oriented agriculture.” “Recycling-oriented agriculture” is a system for composting food residues (garbage) generated by IY stores and using it at Seven Farms. The produce that is grown at the farms is then harvested and sold at the stores from which the food residues were generated. As of February 28, 2019, Seven Farm had expanded to 14 sites nationwide, Seven Farm is actively working to acquire certification under Japan Good Agricultural Practice (JGAP), an agricultural production process management technique, and currently, ten farms have acquired JGAP certification. Seven Farms Seven Farms Recycling-Oriented System More details on Seven Farm can be found here (in Japanese) Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 89 Material Issue 3 Non‒Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients and Energy Effective Use of Resources Depletion of resources such as oil has become an issue. Seven & i Holdings is working to reduce waste emissions associated with store operations, as well as working with customers and business partners to reduce container and packaging materials used for supplying products and to recycle them after they are used by customers. Installing Reverse Vending Machines for Collecting PET Bottles for Recycling IY, YB, and York Mart have had reverse vending machines for Collecting PET bottles for recycling installed at stores since 2012. Because PET bottles inserted into the machines undergo an automatic process of foreign-matter removal and volume-reduction (by either compression or crushing), large volumes of bottles for recycling can be sent to recycling plants on each occasion, which reduces the delivery frequency from stores. Moreover, by utilizing Seven & i Holdings logistics routes, more efficient transportation is possible and the volume of CO2 emissions resulting from the operations can be reduced. SEJ conducted trials of reverse vending machines at five stores in Koto-ku, Tokyo starting in December 2015. Later, the program was expanded in stages to 300 stores in Tokyo and Saitama Prefectures starting in December 2017. In addition, since June 2019, SEJ has been partnering with Higashi-yamato City, the Nippon Foundation , and the Higashi-yamato City Cleaning Business Cooperative to gradually install automatic PET bottle collection machines to promote bottle-to-bottle recycling at all 7-Eleven stores in Higashi-yamato City. It is working together with local communities to create a circular economy and promoting the realization of a recycling-oriented society and a reduction in ocean pollution. Small-sized reverse vending machine System for convenience stores Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 90 PET Bottle Recycling System Using a reverse vending machine Some of the collected PET bottles are made into new PET bottles for the domestic market. This “closed-loop recycling” system of recycling PET bottles into new PET bottles is the first attempt by a major retail chain in Japan to be implemented on such a large scale. As of the end of February 2019, the vending machines have been installed in 759 stores across the four companies, and approximately 8,900 tons of PET bottles have been collected. We are promoting an initiative to recycle material from PET bottles recovered at stores and use it in packaging for Seven Premium private brand products. Moreover, we have printed a note explaining the process from recovery to recycling on the product packaging. Achieving Complete Bottle-to-Bottle PET Bottle Recycling The Seven & i Group ’s initiative, in which it uses 100% of the PET bottle collected by stores in specific distribution groups as raw materials and sells it as a product again in the same distribution group, is the first of its kind in the world.* * As of June 5, 2019. Study by Coca-Cola Japan and Seven & i Holdings. Reducing Waste Resulting from Products IY is working to curtail the generation of waste and to promote reuse and recycling with a view to reducing waste disposal. For example, in product deliveries, we recommend the use of reusable containers and the use of hangers for delivery of apparel as a way of cutting down on the use of packaging and cardboard. At stores, we promote understanding of recycling, and store employees are encouraged to rigorously sort waste for recycling purposes. Reusable containers for store deliveries Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 91 Reuse of Fixtures and Building Materials from Closed Stores When 7-Eleven stores are to be rebuilt or closed, the disposed product shelving, fixtures, and chiller cases are reused at other stores after undergoing maintenance. Furthermore, steel frames and sashes that are made available, through dismantling stores are reused in the construction of new stores hence reducing construction waste. Innovating Sales Methods to Reduce Containers and Packaging At IY, YB, and York Mart, we have devised sales methods for fresh food and delicatessen items that reduce the amount of containers and packaging used, such as selling by weight or selling individual loose items. In our delicatessen items sales areas, we are increasingly using paper bags rather than plastic containers for selling items such as croquettes and fried chicken. In other areas, some fresh meat sales areas have adopted the method of packing meat for sale in plastic bags without a polystyrene tray. Reducing the Use of Disposable Plastic Bags The Seven & i Group promotes the reduced use of disposable plastic bags by asking customers whether they need a bag at the register, displaying posters and POP signs, and holding events to encourage customers to bring their own shopping bags when shopping at stores. Moreover, IY has discontinued the free distribution of plastic bags on the food floors of all its stores and YB has followed suit at around 90% of its stores. SEJ is working to introduce biomass polyethylene shopping bags. Resource Recovery at Stores The Seven & i Group is promoting an important initiative to recover and recycle empty containers and other materials from its products. Every Group company cooperates with customers and local governments to recover resources such as bottles, cans, polystyrene, paper cartons, and PET bottles at stores in accordance with local waste disposal sorting rules. Recently, some stores of the Group have also been cooperating with local governments to recover small electrical appliances, which have been drawing attention as “urban mines.” For example, IY’s Kasai Store hosted the event “Creating Products from an Urban Mine – Medal Project for Everyone” held by the Ministry of the Environment in February 2017. Currently, 14 stores have a permanent recycling box for small home appliances (as of the end of February 2019), and are working to increase awareness among local residents and to collect materials. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 92 Material Issue 3 Non‒Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients and Energy Introduction of Environmental-Friendly Packaging Product containers and packaging play important roles including preserving products and displaying information about ingredients, but after product use, these items become waste. Seven & i Holdings is working to reduce the environmental impact of containers and packaging by introducing containers and packaging made from recycled materials and biodegradable materials. Environmental-Friendly Seven Premium With its private brand Seven Premium, the Group seeks to promote the values of “taste,” “quality,” and “safety and reliability,” while at the same time developing products that are environmental-friendly. So far, the Group has used environmentally considerate packaging such as recycled PET or forest thinning materials in 950 Seven Premium products. The Group is expanding its measures with the aim of using environmental-friendly containers and packaging for all Seven Premium products by 2030. Change to Recyclable Packaging In July 2015, we changed the paper cartons used for Seven Premium alcohol products from the previous aluminum carton material to a non-aluminum carton material. This change enables the cartons to be recycled as paper cartons. Moreover, the volume of CO2 emissions per carton from the raw material procurement and manufacturing process is around 12% lower compared with the aluminum cartons. Furthermore, this initiative has resulted in a CO2 reduction of approximately 250 tons per year, the equivalent of the CO2 absorbed by approximately 18,000 cedar trees. The identification mark also changed from the Paper Mark to the Paper Carton Mark Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 93 Use of Plant Based Materials In April 2016, SEJ introduced rice ink for printing the packaging of rice balls sold at its stores. Rice ink is made from rice bran oil, a non-edible part of the plant extracted from rice bran. This ink reduces the Company’s annual CO2 emissions by around 60 tons compared with conventional petroleum-based inks and is therefore aiding in reducing environmental impact. Moreover, the packaging is also contributing to our efforts to promote local production for local consumption by using domestically produced rice bran oil, which is one of the raw materials. In December 2016, SEJ changed to plant-based packaging film and ink for its original bakery products. Compared with the previous oil-based packaging, this has therefore reduced the Company’s annual CO2 emissions by approximately 108 tons. Product packaging made with plant-derived materials Use of Forest Thinning Materials Certain Seven Premium cup soups and yoghurt drinks have containers made with Seven Forest thinning materials. Japan has a large number of unmaintained man-made forests that have been left unattended. With many such forests currently not fulfilling their potential as carbon sinks, use of forest thinning materials can contribute to the creation of healthy forests and prevention of global warming. Forest thinning materials are also being phased in for use in the outer sleeve section of the hot cups used for SEVEN CAFÉ, which is sold mainly at 7Eleven stores throughout Japan. Products that use forest thinning materials A SEVEN CAFÉ cup and the Forest Thinning Material Mark (printed on the reverse side) See here for further information about Seven Forest (in Japanese) Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 94 Introduction of Recycled Materials IY and York Mart are introducing recycled trays manufactured by suppliers that have received Eco Mark certification. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, approximately 800 types of recycled tray were introduced. The introduction of recycled trays reduced annual CO2 emissions by approximately 2,900 tons. Moreover, in packaging for lifestyle household goods such as Seven Premium Refillable Body Soap, the Group has adopted recycled materials such as those from PET bottles, some of which are recovered at Group stores. Recycled tray Packaging made from recycled PET bottle material Introduction of Biomass Materials In the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, SEJ replaced the original Salad Cup Container sold in the chilled cases of its stores with containers that use environmental-friendly PET made from recycled or biomass PET rather than oil-based PET. IY will also use bioplastics that make partial use of plantbased oil materials for the containers in its cut fruit and boxed lunches. Example of Salad Cup Container using environmental-friendly PET Environmental-Friendly SEVEN CAFÉ Many customers support SEVEN CAFÉ, which is promoting environmental considerations in various ways. For example, forest thinning material is used for the outer sleeves for hot beverages. Cups for iced beverages use a compound material that includes recycled PET. We are also working to cut down our use of limited resources, for example by making cups lighter and thinner. Since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, we have developed an antibacterial deodorizer that uses recycled coffee grounds collected from some of our stores. The new product is being used for cleaning at 7-Eleven stores. Antibacterial deodorizer that uses recycled coffee grounds Environmental-Friendly SEVEN CAFÉ Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 95 Material Issue 3 Non‒Wasteful Usage of Products, Ingredients and Energy Internal and External Communication Seven & i Holdings is working to raise the awareness of Group employees by providing them with environmental education and so on. At the same time, it is emphasizing communication with customers, external environmental organizations and others. Promoting Environmental Education of Employees and Taking the Certification Test for Environmental Specialists Seven & i Holdings regularly holds training for new recruits and newly appointed managers in line with the characteristics of each Group company. The aim is to instill basic knowledge and facilitate their understanding of environmental matters. Specifically, June has been designated as Group Environment Month, and various programs are conducted to raise employee awareness and understanding. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, in addition to environmental lectures conducted by outside instructors that were held for all Group employees as well as programs such as environmental study sessions at the Takao Forest and Nature School operated by the Seven-Eleven Foundation together with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, activities such as the collection and recycling of unneeded smartphones and mobile phones were conducted as well. These efforts imparted knowledge and facilitated consideration of the environment by employees while allowing them to enjoy themselves. Since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, the Group has been encouraging employees to pass the Certification Test for Environmental Specialists (Eco Test) as a training tool for systematically acquiring a broad knowledge about increasingly diverse environmental problems. With a target of having 12,000 Group employees pass the Eco Test by 2020, each company supports test takers by subsidizing test fees, holding study sessions, and so forth. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 2,363 employees passed the test (cumulative total of 6,515 people passing the test since the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015). Holding Environmental Events Seven & i Holdings holds environmental events both within and outside the Company to provide opportunities to raise environmental awareness of employees. For example, Group employees and 7-Eleven franchisees participate in volunteer activities organized by the Seven-Eleven Foundation. Major activities include events such as forest care operations ranging from tree planting to tree thinning and undergrowth cutting at “Seven Forests” in 20 locations throughout Japan; marine afforestation initiatives to cultivate eelgrass habitats, which purify water and reduce CO2, thereby enriching the marine environments in Tokyo Bay and Osaka Bay; and conservation activities on Mt.

In 2014, when we identified the material issues that Seven & i Holdings should address, we incorporated the opinions of stakeholders including customers, business partners, shareholders and other investors, as well as those of CSR experts. For more details about the selection process for material issues Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 97 Material Issue 4 Supporting the Active Role of Women, Youth and Seniors across the Group and in Society Approach to Material Issues The Seven & i Group has close to 140,000 employees working throughout the Group. Workplaces also include part-time employees, foreign nationals, and employees working short hours due to childcare and family care responsibilities. With this diverse workforce, we recognize that we have a duty as a corporation to support diverse working formats. We support the careers of our diverse employees and strive to create appealing workplaces that make work worthwhile. This enables us to steadily acquire diverse human resources, and also drives us to incorporate completely new ways of thinking and generate new value. It is therefore a source of competitiveness. Policy Regarding CSR Seven & i Holdings Corporate Action Guidelines Background to Material Issue Population Aging and Decline in Productive-Aged Population In Japan, the birth rate is in decline, and the population is advancing in age, leading the productive-aged population to decline. Over the next 30 years or so, the productive-aged population is projected to decline by over 20 million. For this reason, raising productivity by bolstering employee capacities and developing diverse personnel will help vitalize Japan’s economy and society. Supporting Active Roles for Women With the productive-aged population in decline, it is essential to promote active participation by women. However, many women are denied the opportunity to work, for example, because it is not possible to balance work with childcare, or because they have been unable to return to work after childcare. Furthermore, the ratio of women in management in Japan is relatively low by international standards at 12.5% (2015). Creating workplaces where women can play active roles is therefore an important task. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 98 Promotional Framework for Material Issues In response to this material issue, the CSR Management Committee, led by the president, and its subordinate Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee, work together with the Group companies and related divisions to create environments that allow individual employees to perform to their full potential and promote the development of appealing, fulfilling workplaces. These activities are supervised by the Seven and i Holdings director and executive officer in charge of Corporate Communication. Contribution to SDGs Though its engagement in this material issue, Seven & i Holdings provides pleasant working conditions for people inside and outside the company regardless of gender or age, thereby contributing to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3, 4, 5, 8 and 10.

Workplaces also include part-time employees, nonJapanese employees, and employees working short hours due to childcare and family care responsibilities. With this diverse workforce, we recognize that we have a duty as a corporation to support diverse working formats. We support the careers of our diverse employees and strive to adjust workplaces so as to make work feel worthwhile. We understand that this not only improves productivity and enables us to secure human resources, but also leads to greater customer satisfaction and the generation of innovation, thereby increasing our competitive power. Targets and Steps for Promoting Diversity and Inclusion Seven & i Holdings established the Diversity Promotion Project in 2012. At the time, it promoted initiatives with a focus particularly on women's participation and advancement, based in part on the thinking that incorporating the perspectives and sensibilities of women into product and service development as well as sales floor arrangements would translate into higher customer satisfaction given that a majority of customers that visit the Group's stores are women. As the next steps in the initiative, in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, we created a promotion system and in 2013 conducted measures for awareness-raising among women themselves and revised operation of the system. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, we moved to the stage of raising the awareness of management-level employees. In addition, since the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, we have supported the balancing of work and family care responsibilities, and in 2017, our theme was LGBT. Thus, since 2013 we have decided to determine an annual theme and have been implementing measures based since then. At the same time, we have also reviewed working formats for greater productivity, focusing on rectifying long working hours, which have been a barrier to the further advancement of diverse human resources, and on achieving employee work-life balance. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 100 Diversity Promotion Targets By 2020 1. Raise percentage of female managers: 30% (section managers and team leaders) 2. Encourage male employees to participate in housework and childcare 3. Eliminate retirements resulting from need to provide family care 4. Improve employee satisfaction 5. Improve external evaluation System to Promote Diversity and Inclusion Based on the commitment of its top level members, Seven & i Holdings established a Seven & i Group Diversity and Inclusion Promotion Project (initially referred to as the Diversity Promotion Project) in 2012 within the Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee under the CSR Management Committee. This project has involved the formulation of policies for activities to promote diversity and inclusion at the group as well as the formulation and execution of group-wide measures. From 2013 specialized diversity organizations have also been established at stores including Seven-Eleven Japan and Ito-Yokado. Such organizations have set individual goals in accordance with the characteristics of each group company and initiatives are being implemented. In addition, a Diversity Promotion Liaison Council at which persons in charge of diversity promotion at 11 main group companies is held on a quarterly basis. The aim of this council is to share information on the progress of and issues related to promotion activities at each group company while also facilitating the horizontal deployment of superior initiatives to other group companies. The details of activities are reported on regularly at the Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee at which personnel and CSR managers from 28 group companies attend, and the CSR Management Committee chaired by the President and Representative Director of Seven & i Holdings. The aim is to spread and bring to concrete fruition diversity and inclusion activities throughout the entire group.

CSR Data Book 2019 102 Fostering a Culture Where Diverse Human Resources Can Play an Active Role The Seven & i Holdings Group is working to promote active roles for women and other diverse human resources by conducting community activities and seminars targeting various levels within the Group. Community Activities for Employees Involved in Raising Children Since 2012, Seven & i Holdings has been implementing community activities aiming to construct networks and eliminate anxiety for employees who are involved in raising children as well as pregnant employees as a group-wide initiative. Information is exchanged and discussions are held during lunch breaks based on the predetermined theme at each session in relation to balancing work and child-raising. These activities have led to a review of work styles. Child-Raising Community Seven-Eleven Japan held a Reappointment Guidance Session based on the theme of balancing work with housework and child-raising for employees hoping to return to work after childcare leave and their superiors. An external lecturer was invited to the event. The aim of this session is to cultivate women who can balance child-raising with their career. The guidance session was held at the head office in Tokyo and a TV conference system was utilized to enable employees working at business offices throughout Japan to view it. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, two sessions were held (spring and fall), with a total of 162 female employees and 170 management level employees attending. A total of 84 employees from 25 offices nationwide attended the spring fiscal 2019 session. At York Mart, four gatherings were held in fiscal 2018 for female employees with children.

Led by outside lecturers, the seminars cover such issues as management of diverse staff members, reforming work formats, and leadership. They provide the opportunity for managers to think about diversity from a number of different perspectives. In June 2017, to mark the fifth year since the launch of the Diversity Promotion Project, lecturers were invited from leading companies to “Seven & i Diversity Day 2017.” The event was attended by around 400 CEOs and management team members from 21 Group company. The Diversity Management Handbook is also distributed to managers at all Group companies to promote communication with staff members working to balance work and childcare or family care responsibilities in order to further train managers to make good use of their diverse human resources to generate results. Seven-Eleven Japan has published Diversity Tsushin each month since 2017. The aim of this initiative is to share information with all employees including management level employees, and to foster awareness regarding diversity including the significance of diversity management, knowledge on LGBT and understanding of systems for supporting balance. In its hierarchy-based executive training, Ito-Yokado is implementing sessions on understanding systems for supporting balance between child-raising and family support with work, as well as methods of using such systems and the management of diverse subordinates.

To this end, all operating companies consult with employees with disabilities to determine the workplaces, jobs and working hours that are suitable in consideration of the level and details of their disability and their own preferences. In this way, people with disabilities work in various divisions. In recruitment, we coordinate with special-needs schools to provide onsite training in stores and participate in job interviews organized by local employment agencies and partner with vocational schools. Furthermore, all Group companies are provided with the Seven & i Holdings Normalization Support Guide, which contains basic knowledge and practical recruitment methods when employing people with disabilities, to ensure that all people who are responsible for recruitment and education at Group companies are aware of considerations regarding disabilities and that they implement them. Furthermore, Terube, Ltd.*1, which is a special subsidiary established to foster the employment of people with severe disabilities, employs 20 people with disabilities as of June 1, 2019, making the Group's employment rate of people with disabilities*2, including those employed by Terube, 2.84%.

Currently, it has implemented such training in Hokkaido, Osaka, Kyoto and Fukuoka, with plans for expansion into more areas going forward. Employment support training involving “Seven-Eleven Work Experience” Initiatives for “Universal Manners” on how to interact with a diverse range of people Seven-Eleven Japan holds seminars for acquiring “Universal Manners Test Grade 3” as an opportunity to learn about basic interaction with a diverse range of people including elderly people, people with disabilities and non-Japanese employees. The seminars deepen employees’ understanding through lectures and group work on topics such as what universal manners are and how employees can show consideration for people who are different to them and act based on appropriate understanding. This initiative was started in July 2018. By the end of February 2019, 159 employees had achieved grade 3 certification.

CSR Data Book 2019 109 Support for Participation of Seniors and Non-Japanese Employees Seven & i Group companies have a system for rehiring employees after mandatory retirement, providing an opportunity for veteran employees to use their skills and abilities. At IY, for example, a re-employment system that allows people to continue working until age 65 was introduced in 1995 in response to employees who said they wanted to continue working after the mandatory retirement age. Employees can select from three options of working days and hours to suit their wishes, enabling them to work in diverse ways. From April 2006, the Senior Partner System was implemented to allow part-time employees to work until age 65 as well. As of the end of February 2019, 6,653 senior partners are active in the company. The system was also expanded in May 2017 to enable people to continue working up to the age of 70. With the birthrate declining, society aging, and the working-age population decreasing, SEJ is creating employment opportunities for seniors who want to work. The Company actively participates in joint company presentations on senior employment held by municipalities and promotes the hiring of seniors. For people concerned about working at a convenience store, SEJ strives to provide detailed information and maintain conditions that are conducive to working with confidence. The ratio of employees with non-Japanese nationality working at stores is also increasing, with the national average reaching approximately 8.9% as of the end of February 2019, accounting for approximately 34,000 employees. The Company provides support not only for seniors but also for foreign students and non-Japanese employees by means of training. A briefing for senior employees Independent Support System for People Hoping to Migrate Seven-Eleven Japan has started an Independent Support System for People Hoping to Migrate that supports people thinking about moving back to their hometown to start a business or wanting to move to an area for reasons such as seeking a better child-raising or living environment. By supporting the migration of people who want to start a Seven-Eleven business in a local area or similar through, for example, providing moving costs or the costs of accommodation and transport when going to confirm properties, we are contributing to reviving local communities through the creation of shopping spots and employment opportunities. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 110 Material Issue 4 Supporting the Active Role of Women, Youth and Seniors across the Group and in Society Achieving Work-Life Balance Seven & i Holdings is promoting the concept of “work-life synergy,” which aims to create synergies by utilizing the perspective of a consumer in work while simultaneously leveraging the lessons of work in life. We have a range of assistance systems that exceed minimum legal requirements to enable diverse employees work with peace of mind. To make it even easier for employees to work, we are also taking steps to correct long working hours and encourage the use of paid leave. Enhancing Systems for Diverse Workstyles The Seven & i Group has implemented various systems that go beyond legal minimums to enable employees, including part timers, to continue working with peace of mind while engaging in childcare or nursing care. For example, at Ito-Yokado, which has some 40,000 employees, the most among the Group’s operating companies, there is a childbirth and childcare program and a family care program that can be utilized by employees, both men and women, who have worked at the company for at least a year; the programs are also available to part-time employees.

CSR Data Book 2019 111 Support for child-rearing by employees SEJ began the “Spot Day Care” initiative in October 2016 to support the careers of employees with small children. At SEJ, the franchise chain headquarters, holidays and the New Year vacation period, which are peak times for stores, are basically working days. However, for employees raising small children, it can be difficult to find day care on holidays, over New Year, and during other extended vacation periods, so this initiative establishes temporary day care facilities in company meeting rooms and at facilities near the Company’s business offices. It was started on a trial basis at four business offices, and starting in May 2017 it was put into full operation and extended to 27 offices, with the aim going forward for expansion nationwide. As of the end of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, a total of 1,016 employees had utilized the system, with a total of 1,301 children having been cared for at these facilities. Spot Day Care was expanded to 14 Seven & i Group companies starting in May 2017, creating environments where employees can pursue their careers throughout the Group. In October 2017, two Seven Nanairo Nursery Schools were opened in Ota-ku, Tokyo, and Hiroshima City. These facilities are available for use by SevenEleven store operators and employees as well as local residents and SEJ employees. An additional school was opened in Sendai City in July 2018, and in Machida City, Tokyo and Kyoto City in June 2019, with plans to open additional schools in stages. Ito-Yokado has introduced eight daycare facilities comprising authorized daycare centers and corporate-led nurseries as tenants in its shopping centers in Tokyo and four other prefectures. These facilities are used by employees and local residents. At a Spot Day Care facility The exterior of a Seven Nanairo Nursery School Promotion of Childcare Leave-taking by Men To promote greater participation by men in childcare, a childcare leave program has been introduced at Seven & i Group companies since 2014.The program provides five special vacation days per year that can be used in one-day increments to employees with pre-school aged children. Since the program was started, it has been used by many employees for various reasons involving their children, such as when their spouse gives birth, or to attend kindergarten entrance and graduation ceremonies or participate in field day events. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 45 male employees took childcare leave at Seven & i Holdings, along with 592 at SEJ, and 467 at Ito-Yokado. The Seven & i Group is also taking measures to encourage male employees to take childcare leave including producing and displaying posters targeting male managers and leave-takers. A poster encouraging male employees to take childcare leave A poster targeting managers Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 112 Recognition by Outside Parties of Support for Childcare Ito-Yokado has become the first company in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area to receive “Platinum Kurumin” Mark certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, following a revision of the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children in June 2015. “Platinum Kurumin” is awarded to companies that have already received “Kurumin” certification and have advanced use of systems to support balancing work with childcare to a significant degree while implementing measures at a high level. The system was established in 2015 to promote continued initiatives. ItoYokado has received the “Kurumin” certification twice, and has actively utilized its Re-Challenge Plan, a personnel system for supporting childcare to help workers balance work and childcare. Other initiatives include introducing childcare leave systems and holding opinion exchange events with employees who are involved in childcare, diversity seminars at store manager meetings, and promoting the taking of annual paid leave by employees, especially part-time workers. These activities were highly rated. Seven & i Holdings, Seven-Eleven Japan, Sogo & Seibu, YorkBenimaru, Seven & i Food Systems and Seven Bank have received the“Kurumin” certification. Corporate certification ceremony (June 2015) Support for Balancing Jobs with Family Care Responsibilities The Seven & i Group also works to help employees balance their jobs with family care responsibilities. A survey of family care responsibilities being provided by employees revealed that in the near future, approximately 70% of employees might have to balance work with nursing care, making this likely to become a major issue for the future. From 2015, we have been regularly holding Family Care Responsibility Seminars with external experts as prior preparation for handling such responsibilities, In 2016, we produced the Handbook for Helping Employees to Balance Work and Family Care Responsibilities, with a view to using it in training etc. at all Group operating companies to support the creation of working environments that make it easy to balance these commitments. Tools for conveying information on family care and preventing job separation as a result of family care for use at meetings and so on were distributed to Group companies in 2017, increasing opportunities for more employees to deepen their understanding regarding family care. In addition, we are endeavoring to create environments that make it easy for employees to balance their job with family care responsibilities through efforts including actively informing employees about a consultation desk and writing about case examples of balancing such responsibilities with work in the company newsletter. System to Allow Telework Seven Bank and Nissen Holdings group companies established a telework system that allows employees to continue to perform their jobs if they have difficulty commuting due to pregnancy, childcare or family care responsibilities, an injury or other reason. Restricting Long Working Hours Seven & i Group conducts various initiatives to restrict long working hours. The internal newsletter distributed to the Group’s approximately 70,000 employees contains a monthly column on working styles to raise awareness, and in our Diversity Management Seminars conducted since 2014, there are lectures by specialists and presentations on progressive initiatives at other companies related to work styles. Around 5,400 employees from Group companies have attended 19 seminars as of the end of February 2019. Many of the seminar participants work to increase communication with their subordinates and take further action to improve working styles. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 113 Implementation of Sliding Work Hours Seven & i Holdings and SEJ have implemented a system for staggered commuting times and sliding work hours from spring 2018 enabling employees to select their work times based on private reasons. Employees are eligible to select 8 a.m., 9 a.m., or 10 a.m. as their work start times. The aim of this is to allow employees to select their own work start time, thereby promoting active and efficient work styles. SEJ has achieved utilization results of over 80% for the staff department in particular, and this effort is leading to enhanced private time for staff as well as reduced commuting burdens. Implementation of Sliding Work Hours In July 2017, Seven & i Holdings and SEJ collaborated with Tokyo-based Jisa Biz to conduct a trial of staggered commuting times. Employees at the Head Office and offices in the Tokyo region were eligible to select 8 a.m., 9 a.m., or 10 a.m. as their morning work start times. The result was a decrease in overtime throughout the company. SEJ received the Jisa Biz Promotion Award in the Promotion Category from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government for this initiative. After verifying the results of the trial introduction, Seven & i Holdings and SEJ established formal programs and introduced them on a full scale in March and April 2018 respectively. In November 2016, SEJ established a program to encourage employees to take time off (six days per year) in addition to special holidays designated by the company. Implementation of Volunteer Leave System To support employee participation in local community activities for people with disabilities, family care support, environmental beautification, disaster reconstruction support, and other objectives, Seven & i Holdings, Seven-Eleven Japan, Ito-Yokado, York Mart, Seven & i Food Systems, and Seven Bank have instituted a volunteer leave system under which employees can take five days off per year for volunteer work. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 16 Group employees took volunteer leave. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 114 Material Issue 4 Supporting the Active Role of Women, Youth and Seniors across the Group and in Society Support for Fostering More Capable Employees Seven & i Holdings conducts human resources development with training systems refined by Group companies to match their respective business characteristics and supports the skill development of each individual employee. Establishment and Refinement of Training Systems The Seven & i Group engages in human resources development through training systems refined by Group companies to match their respective business characteristics. The Group focuses particularly on the essential task of improving the skills of store employees who interact with customers. To this end, we hold regular group training by position and also work to enhance the skills and develop the careers of individual employees, including parttime employees. For example, at IY, new employee training is held for all employees, including part-time employees, to teach company policies, retail fundamentals, and skills and knowledge required for work. Further, training leading to OJT at stores is continuously held to provide basic knowledge of products handled by affiliated division and to improve skills related to customer service and fresh food preparation. In this way, the company assists employees in upgrading their skills. Additionally, training is also held for everyone from new hires to sales floor staff, sales floor managers, division managers, and store managers, to provide knowledge of sales floor management and management skills in stages and in line with their respective positions. Training is also carried out beforehand to improve their skills in preparation for their next positions. YB uses target setting charts to clarify the individual employee’s current skills and abilities as well as skills to be acquired and training targets between individual employees and their managers. The target setting charts include detailed items necessary for job performance, such as customer service, sales area management, ordering, and food preparation techniques, with the skills and abilities of the employee assessed on a six-step scale from 0 to 5. In the “skills version” for staff members and part-time employees, items are determined for each division depending on duties, job characteristics, and products handled for each analysis item. There is also a “management version” for store managers, assistant store managers, customer service managers and division managers that is intended to help raise and standardize management abilities. Based on the chart, employees confirm their skill levels with their supervisors and twice a year share the progress they have made with their supervisors and establish the next set of goals. This enables them to check their own growth, helping to boost motivation. Employees in training Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 115 Establishment of Training Facilities Seven & i Holdings established the Ito Training Center in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture in March 2012 to support the acquisition of technical knowledge on sales, food preparation, and other areas to match business characteristics. Another function is to communicate the Group’s founding spirit and nurture the next generation of human resources. The training center is equipped with meeting rooms as well as skills rooms for personnel that handle fresh fish, meat, and produce (including delicatessen items, fresh fish, sushi, fresh meat, and produce) cash register practice rooms, and display practice rooms with recreated sales areas. A historical materials room is provided to help communicate the founding spirit and corporate philosophy. There is also an accommodation facility within the training center with 65 rooms for overnight stays, including four universal design rooms that are wheelchair-accessible. The Ito Training Center Further details about the Ito Training Center can be found here (in Japanese) Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 116 Open Recruitment System for Human Resources Seven & i Holdings implements an open recruitment system for human resources that encompasses all of its operating companies. The system is designed to respect the will of each individual employee and ensure the right person is placed in the right job to fully leverage their abilities and to invigorate the organization. Full-time employees at participating companies who have been performing their current duties and have been in their current positions for at least two years are eligible to apply. Group companies have also instituted internal recruitment systems. For example, at IY, employees who have worked at the company for at least one year can become candidates for managerial positions and jobs regardless of business experience or seniority. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 202 people applied through this system and 35 were appointed to their preferred positions or jobs. Going forward, we intend to further enhance the conditions that raise motivation and allow employees to fully demonstrate their abilities. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 117 Material Issue 4 Supporting the Active Role of Women, Youth and Seniors across the Group and in Society Assuring Fair Assessment and Treatment of Employees Seven & i Holdings implements various assessment systems for employees to maximize their individual abilities and ensure fair assessments free of unreasonable discrimination due to social status, place of birth, race, creed, gender, and so on. Ensuring Fairness through Self-Evaluations The Seven & i Group has instituted a self-check program to maximize individual employee abilities and help ensure fair evaluations. Twice a year at each Group company, employees first assess their own job performance, which is then evaluated by their supervisor. After that, the employee and supervisor meet to discuss the results. This direct dialogue helps the employee to identify their own achievements, strengths, and challenges while also ensuring the transparency and fairness of evaluations. In addition, through individual meetings with supervisors, issues at the workplace related to management levels, knowledge, skills and the like are confirmed, and this leads to further career development. Since it is not a simple one-sided evaluation by the company, employees are more willing to accept the system and find it motivating. The system is helping to steadily improve operational levels. Implementation of Management Checks SEJ has been conducting management checks since November 2017 as a personnel measure where subordinates and supervisors work together to improve the Company and enhance internal communications. Subordinates check the status of management of employees by managers. Employees respond to a total of 20 questions (five questions in each of four categories: human abilities, thinking abilities, action abilities, and compliance) and also input comments in the free entry field. To prevent the identification of specific individuals, the scores of all subordinates are averaged and comments are combined. Results are not directly disclosed to supervisors; oral feedback is provided during interim interviews (conducted twice annually) by the supervisor who is two levels higher. Each individual actively uses the results to generate outputs that will contribute to their individual growth. Employee Compensation System IY has an employee classification system that allows employees to choose which region to work in based on their individual life plans and values. Based on this system, employees are evaluated using a qualifications system, which ranks them by job performance ability and skill, and by job responsibilities, taking into account their current duties and job assignment. In addition, individual evaluations, which are determined based on job achievement, level of contribution and other factors, are directly incorporated into salary and bonus levels. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 118 Selection of Various Work Styles Seven & i Holdings' operating companies also focus on establishing systems that allow employees to choose various work styles to increase their motivation for work. For example, IY has a program enabling part-timers to choose from diverse working styles. Under this system, part-timers may elect to step up a rank after acquiring a certain level of evaluation and sales skill. There is also a program in place where part-timers designated as highest level can be hired as a monthly salaried permanent employee or contract worker. To date (as of February 28, 2019), 164 part-timers have become monthly salaried permanent employees. A large number of part-timers have also been hired on in managerial roles, such as sales floor managers. This initiative has received formal recognition as IY received the grand prize (Health, Labour and Welfare Minister's Award) at the Awards for Enterprises Promoting Part-time Workers to Play Active Roles at Work, which was established in the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.

We support each employee’s proactive initiative to promote health. Therefore, in October 2014, we started the Seven & i Health Declaration 2018 that sought to improve employee health and QOL, and enhance our corporate vitality. Through conducting a variety of initiatives related to health, we have reaped certain results. In view of this, we formulated the Seven & i Health Declaration NEXT which states three new goals that seeks to further strengthen our initiatives, and are starting on those initiatives. This declaration sets themes related to individual employees, the Company, and society respectively, and aims to improve results through specific measures. Promoting the health of employees will be the foundation for improving individual QOL, widen opportunities for further participation by each person at work, and become the source of our Group’s sustainable growth. In addition, based on the basic principle of providing safe and reliable products, we will work to support the health of the customers who use our Group’s stores and products on a regular basis, and also contribute toward promoting the health of local communities through measures such as product development that works on reducing additives while being particular about taste and quality; being thorough in the labelling of food ingredients which is of high concern to customers; development and provision of products supporting health; and support for healthy dietary habits and dietary education. Going forward, Seven & i Holdings will deepen our initiatives contributing to the healthy growth and development of people’s lives and society from the viewpoint of being close to daily lives, and aim to be a Company that is trusted and needed by employees and society.

CSR Data Book 2019 121 Initiatives for the Group’s sustainable growth and Promoting the health of local communities When employees are healthy both mentally and physically, it not only makes their own lives more fulfilling but is also a source of vitality for the Company, and makes management more efficient. Based on this understanding, Seven & i Holdings launched the “Seven & i Health Declaration 2018” in October 2014 in partnership with Seven & i Holdings Health Insurance Union. To further strengthen initiatives, the “Seven & i Health Declaration NEXT” was formulated in October 2019. Promotion of health and productivity management was incorporated into the Corporate Ethics and Culture Subcommittee under the CSR Management Committee chaired by the President and Representative Director of Seven & i Holdings, and various measures are being promoted in collaboration with human resources and labor relations supervisors at each Group company, led by the Seven & i Holdings Personnel Planning Dept., Health Management Center and Health Insurance Union. The Seven & i Health Declaration NEXT establishes targets in such areas as reducing the risk of lifestyle diseases, reducing the smoking rate, improving the percentage of annual paid leave taken, and reducing long working hours. The MY HEALTH WEB Health Management System, a portal website, is being used as a support measure for these targets. We also hold mental health training and health-themed events, offer low-calorie, lowsodium menu items at the staff cafeteria, and provide health-related information through internal Group newsletters and other media, and help employees maintain and manage their own health to raise awareness about health. The MY HEALTH WEB Health Management System in particular allows individuals to browse the past five years of their own health checkup data on the Internet, and serves as a tool for checking and goal-setting on health status, and for receiving advice on how to improve health. It also has an environment which allows use through a smartphone app. Furthermore, Group companies have taken steps to implement appropriate health and productivity management based on the Industrial Safety and Health Act by ensuring that all employees receive regular health checks and follow up on the results, as well as making sure that stress checks are implemented for everyone.

For example, at IY, training is conducted on the handling of knives and other implements for employees that work with fresh food products. In addition, at Seven & i Food Systems, awareness-raising posters and other campaign materials are posted at stores three times a year to bring attention to the prevention of workplace accidents.

Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 123 Material Issue 4 Supporting the Active Role of Women, Youth and Seniors across the Group and in Society Employee Engagement Survey Seven & i Holdings conducts employee engagement surveys aimed at creating fulfilling workplaces. Employee Engagement Survey The employee engagement survey is an indexing of employees’ feelings about doing one’s best and not giving up until delivering results above expectations, with the “feeling that each and every employee is always playing a leading role” as well as having “pride and passion in everyone’s own work.” In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, the survey was administered to approximately 35,000 employees at 28 companies in Japan,. Results of the Employee Engagement Survey (Example) Percentage of employees with their own desire to contribute to the Company* Male 50% Female 43% Overall 47% *Results from the survey conducted in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The degree of employees wanting to contribute to the Company on their own initiative is categorized into four levels, and the figures in the above table are the percentages of employees who “Have an extremely strong desire,” “Have desire,” and “Have some desire.” Promoting Improvement Activities The survey results are reported to upper management, and at the same time, each Group company carries out their analysis of the survey results and organization of the issues. Going forward, improvement measures will be proposed based on the issues identified and gradually executed. At the same time, the Company plans to carry out validation at the next employee engagement survey. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 124 Material Issue 4 Supporting the Active Role of Women, Youth and Seniors across the Group and in Society Sound Labor-Management Relations Seven & i Holdings respects workers’ rights such as the freedom of association, the right to organize and collective bargaining. In the Seven & i Group Corporate Action Guidelines, we have established the following principle: “The Company respects workers’ rights, such as the right to organize, based on international norms and efforts to further improve the work environment.” Respect for Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining At Seven & i Holdings, the Group’s 11* labor unions form the Federation of Seven & i Group Labor Unions, which as of March 2019 has approximately 59,000 members in 11 unions and a participation rate of 76.5% (Ito-Yokado labor union). The federation carries out a variety of activities for union members based on the thinking that “no water can be drawn from a dry well.” It also coordinates activities by holding discussions on organizational management, labor conditions, and other issues pertaining to union members. The member unions autonomously create their own independent organizations, and then they coordinate and join together for common causes. They complement one another’s strengths and also work to improve shared labor conditions on a unified basis, which further reinforces both the individual unions and the federation itself. This is the basic approach through which activities are conducted. Seven & i Holdings and the labor unions work through numerous active discussions between labor and management to improve issues related to labor conditions and employees’ workplace environments. For example, at Ito-Yokado, the compensation system and labor conditions for union members and employees are discussed, and consultations between management and labor are considered valuable for solving issues and improving productivity. Promotion of recent workstyle reform is an example of collaboration between management and labor, and Ito-Yokado is taking steps to ensure that work rules are understood by everyone, promote the use of holidays and paid leave, improve the labor environment, and achieve a good work-life balance. * The 11 companies are Ito-Yokado, York-Benimaru, York Mart, SHELL GARDEN, Marudai, Sanei, Sogo & Seibu, Seven & i Food Systems, Akachan Honpo, THE LOFT and Life Foods.

A childcare support event sponsored by public-private-academic partnership Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 127 Supporting Career Education To support career education at elementary, junior high, high schools, and universities, the Seven & i Group cooperates with requests from schools by sending out employees to each school, by providing workplace tours, and by holding workplace experience programs at its Group stores, where children have the chance to take part in conducting familiar retail store operations. For example, York Mart provides an opportunity to observe the food processing operations and to practice stocking the shelves in the store with products. Approximately 9,000 elementary and junior high school students participate each year. Ito-Yokado also conducts workplace experience programs at its stores where each year approximately 8,000 students can come up with and convey their own proposals by making coordination proposals and suggestions to customers through in-store sampling while experiencing firsthand the importance of complying with basic standards to ensure safety and confidence. Also, Seven & i Food Systems holds workplace experience programs where students can try working as the manager of a restaurant or learn about the importance of ingredients control and hospitality through actual experience. The program was attended by students from 106 schools in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. The Seven & i Group training facility, Ito Training Center, provides sales space creation and food processing experiences, as well as opportunities to provide service from various customer perspectives, such as helping customers in wheelchairs and so on. Through these experiences, the students can feel the value of working and the joy of interacting with customers. Learning about cash registers through hands-on experience at Ito Training Center Furthermore, SEJ has a store in Shinagawa Student City, which has been run jointly by Shinagawa Ward and Junior Achievement Japan since 2003. The concept of Shinagawa Student City is to create a virtual town inside an elementary school, with various companies setting up shops and providing experience of working and society. The children working in the 7-Eleven store experience customer service, sales space creation, and other operations to learn about the systems of society. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 2,484 elementary school students staffed our store and learned about the joys and challenges of working through customer service and retail sales. Shinagawa Student City Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 128 Outreach Classes for Company-School Exchange SEJ holds outreach classes at an elementary school in Tokyo’s Suginami Ward in March 2019 as a part of the Yomiuri Education Network, which seeks to increase interactions between companies and schools. The class involves group work in which 7-Eleven stores are established in fictitious towns on a map. Through the group work, the children come to understand in a fun way the roles that 7-Eleven plays in society. At the same time, they learn about how the products and services of 7-Eleven—which aims to build stores that are convenient and close to people—have changed (CRM strategy* and response to SDGs) in accordance to the changes in society (changes in customers’ needs). The class provides a good opportunity for children to think about their society from the everyday perspective of a convenience store. *CRM: Customer Relationship Management This is a management strategy/method aimed at expanding sales and improving profitability through improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. Outreach class in progress Picture Book Storytelling Sessions Seven Bank supports the publication of “Bonolon, Warrior of the Forest” (approximately one million copies on even months), a picture book that parents can read to their children to foster communication. The bank also distributes picture books free of charge, and regularly holds storytelling sessions by employees at children’s centers and other places for children. Storytelling sessions are also held at Denny’s restaurants, which are managed by Seven & i Food Systems. Storytelling session led by employee volunteers Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 129 Support for Dietary Education The Seven & i Group promotes dietary education activities for children to raise people who understand foods through various experiences and can practice sound and healthy dietary habits. For example, Seven & i Food Systems distributes a booklet called “Bonolon and Food” at its chain of Denny’s restaurants. The booklet contains important information about food manners and knowledge and teaches children about the correct eating habits using games and quizzes. In addition, dietary education classes for children were held a total of eight times at four Denny’s restaurants in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019. These are opportunities for children to learn about how to use chopsticks, how to use knives, forks, and spoons, and other basic table manners. They are also opportunities to learn about vegetables in an enjoyable way through explanations using ingredient-themed panels and quizzes. ©NSP 2005, © Together with Bonolon, 2007 Dietary education class Free dietary education booklet “Bonolon and Food” Donating Shoes to Children in Zambia Sogo & Seibu works with the Japanese Organization for International Cooperation in Family Planning (JOICFP)* on a project for sending shoes to children in Zambia. The company has established areas to accept children’s shoes donations in all of its stores. The shoes they receive from customers help to prevent tetanus and parasitic infections resulting from foot injuries to children with bare feet. They are sent through JOICFP to children in Zambia. As of February 28, 2019, Sogo & Seibu had sent about 860,000 pairs of shoes since 2009. * JOICFP is an international cooperation NGO that was started in Japan to protect the health and lives of women and children in the developing world.

CSR Data Book 2019 131 Material Issue 5 Building an Ethical Society and Improving Resource Sustainability Together with Customers and Business Partners Approach to Material Issues In the course of supplying a vast amount of products and services, Seven & i Holdings believes that the Group has an important role to play in providing socially and environmental responsible products and services, thereby helping to build an ethical* society. In every process from procuring raw materials for products to delivering products to customers, Seven & i Holdings believes that it must not only comply with laws and regulations, but it must also supply valuable products that show consideration for society and the environment. This will contribute to improving the sustainability of resources and is crucial to enhancing the strength of supply chains and ensuring business continuity. Moreover, awareness of ethical consumption has been increasing among customers in recent years. Addressing this awareness will also help to strengthen Seven & i Holdings’ competitiveness. For these reasons, we will advance initiatives targeting the entire supply chain, including business partners. * The word “ethical,” in addition to its conventional meaning, has been increasingly associated with environmental preservation and social contribution in recent years. Background to Material Issues Decline and Depletion of Fisheries Resources Amid increasing consumption of seafood in recent years, activities such as overfishing and environmentally destructive resource usage have taken place. As a result, sound marine resources have been steadily declining, while an increasing number of resources face the risk of depletion. Among familiar seafood items in Japan, Pacific Bluefin tuna and Japanese eel are endangered species in danger of extinction. Heightened Interest in the Social and Environmental Impact of Supply Chains Against the backdrop of a multitude of social issues around the world, an increasing number of consumers are seeking to purchase goods produced through fair trade practices.

The audit results of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 showed some form of noncompliance at all factories audited, and corrective actions are being undertaken.

Factories are given prior notice before being visited for audits, and compliance with CSR audit items is confirmed by checking sites, documents, and data as well as through interviews with managers and workers. If the audit finds items that do not comply with the audit program (unacceptable items), the external audit organization provides guidance to the business partner concerned. The business partners must submit a corrective action plan (CAP) to the auditing organization within 10 days of the audit being completed, and must take immediate action to improve the items. After receiving a report on the completion of improvements for the relevant items, the completion of improvements is confirmed based on the submission of photos showing the improvements, guarantee documents and other materials. However, in cases that exceed certain standards, such as when numerous serious unacceptable items are found, the resolution of issues is confirmed by revisiting the factory to perform a re-audit. When the unacceptable items are remedied or the auditing organization and Seven & i Holdings judge that the content of the CAP to be satisfactory, a Compliance Certificate is issued to the relevant business partner. Compliance certificate Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

CSR Data Book 2019 140 Material Issue 5 Building an Ethical Society and Improving Resource Sustainability Together with Customers and Business Partners Sustainable Environment Conservation Activities Seven & i Holdings cooperates with NPOs and other organizations to undertake measures that contribute to the prevention of global warming and preservation of biodiversity. Seven Forest Creation Conservation Project Seven & i Holdings participates in Seven Forest creation activities run by the Seven-Eleven Foundation at 20 locations across Japan to help prevent global warming and contribute to the maintenance and conservation of biodiversity. The Seven Forest creation concept is a forest nurturing project that includes tree planting, undergrowth clearing, and forest thinning. Japan implements a cycle for planting, nurturing and harvesting trees and then replanting new ones. It takes decades to nurture a tree, during which time people systematically carry out forest conservation activities to protect forests. Trees create water that is rich in minerals and by releasing it into rivers and oceans, they protect biodiversity and help to prevent global warming. Seven Forest creation activities are carried out by employee volunteers from 7-Eleven franchised stores and Group companies under collaboration agreements with forestry cooperatives, NPOs and others throughout Japan. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, activities were held 26 times and a total of 2,694 people participated. Another forestry issue in Japan is the need to encourage greater use of wood materials collected from forest thinning activities. Wood material collected from Seven Forest is used within the Group for store materials and office supplies, as well as in commercialization to promote use of national resources. Furthermore, the Seven-Eleven Foundation also undertakes marine afforestation initiatives that increase eelgrass—which is helpful in purifying water and reducing CO2—and regenerates the marine environment. The foundation conducts the Tokyo Bay UMI Project since 2011, and the Hannan Seven marine afforestation initiative at Osaka Bay since 2018.

Using money collected from in-store donation boxes and donations from the Head Office, the foundation engages in projects related to environmental citizenship activity support, nature conservation, and disaster reconstruction assistance. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, instore donations totaled \375,482,345 and around \153,957,167 was used to give grants to 271 environmental citizenship grant projects (including ongoing projects), which support environmental activities by local residents. Seven-Eleven Foundation website (in Japanese) UMIGOMI Zero WEEK Green Wrapping Sogo & Seibu is promoting the use of “green wrapping,” for customers when they order gifts, which sends the message of “keeping the earth’s environment in mind,” This involves the purchase of a wrapping ribbon with a leaf-shaped mascot for an additional price of \100 (including tax), of which \50 is donated to tree planting and growing activities. One tree is planted for every 80 ribbons sold. In addition, customers purchasing ochuugen and oseibo (summer and winter) gifts who agree to simple packaging also contribute to tree planting, with one tree planted for every 4,000 gifts that use the simple packaging option. (Between 2009 and February 28, 2019, 12,679 trees were planted).

In October 2016, Ito-Yokado commenced the sale for the first time in Japan of farmed oysters that have obtained Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) certification, an international certification system for environmentally and socially responsible aquaculture businesses. The farmed oysters were grown by the cooperative. Farmed oysters with ASC certification Sales of Alaska Seafood Products Seven & i Group stores actively sell and convey to customers the quality of Alaska Seafood products, which are sourced through environmentally friendly fishing practices. In Alaska, the source region of the brand's all-natural marine products, Alaska Seafood strictly manages resources and fisheries to ensure that the ecosystem that nurtures these natural marine resources is not impaired. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, Group companies held events and took other measures in August to promote sales of Alaska Seafood. For example, Sogo & Seibu conducted in-store Alaska Seafood promotions at eight stores in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 to inform customers about the appeal of Alaska Seafood. Alaska Seafood products were also promoted as oseibo (winter gifts). Seven Premium Benizake no Shioyaki Alaska Seafood (Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute) website Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 144 Procurement of Organic Products In response to rising consumer interest in product safety and reliability in recent years, Seven & i Holdings started selling 100% Organic Cotton Innerwear products which have cleared strict organic production standards for women under the Seven Premium Lifestyle Group-wide private brand in December 2015. These products are sold at around 182 Ito-Yokado and York Benimaru stores throughout Japan (as of February 28, 2019) and the Group's integrated portal website, omni7. The cotton used as raw materials in these products is only organic cotton that meets U.S. Organic Content Standards (OCS). Apart from these products, Seven & i Group companies also sell items such as organic cotton towels and apparel, as well as organic coffee and loose leaf tea. Seven Premium Lifestyle 100% Organic Cotton Innerwear Handling of Low-Agrichemical Products Ito-Yokado and York Benimaru sell private brand products that use fewer agrichemicals than the values regulated by law. Examples include the Fresh Vegetables with Traceability and Fresh Fruits with Traceability private brand products sold at Ito-Yokado. Although these products are not completely organic, they are grown with fewer agrichemicals, and assure traceability of the growing region and growing history. Sales of these products in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019 were approximately \22.6 billion. The methods and frequency of use of agricultural chemicals vary by region and crop. The Fresh Vegetables with Traceability category and certain other products comprise foods grown with the goal of applying agrichemicals with half or lower of the usual frequency of each growing area (the average number of applications for each crop stipulated by local government organizations and other public bodies). In addition, at our Seven Farms, which are engaged in agricultural operations, and under our Fresh Vegetables with Traceability and Fresh Fruits with Traceability brands, we aim to ensure safe agricultural produce, correct farm management, and so forth, and have acquired Japan Good Agricultural Practice (JGAP) certification. JGAP is an agricultural production management method recommended by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan. It provides a set of standards to be followed in daily farm management to increase food safety and ensure environmental conservation. Since JGAP includes standards relating to food safety and environmentally sustainable agriculture, these products use the minimum necessary level of agricultural chemicals. Fresh Vegetables with Traceability Five Promises of Fresh Vegetables with Traceability and Fresh Fruits with Traceability 1. Stores only stock domestically grown agricultural products. 2. Producers who properly grow vegetables on suitable land are carefully selected from all over Japan. 3. Products are delivered to customers under the name of each individual producer. 4.

Calculated based on Fiscal 2011 Key Points Regarding the Implementation of Social Contribution Activity Surveys (Keidanren (Japan Business Federation)). However, political contributions are excluded. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 147 Effect Measurement Method Seven & i Holdings seeks to mitigate the environmental impact associated with its business activities and to contribute to making a better society through those activities. When selecting external partners for activities, we always ensure that they have a philosophy that is compatible with our own, and that they have sufficient specialist expertise. We measure the effect of our social contribution activities based on four perspectives. Moreover, we plan to revise our measurement methods in the future to enable an even more accurate measurement of the inputs for an activity, the respective outputs for the Company and society after the activity, and the final impacts on the Company and society, respectively. Effect Measurement Method Detail 1. Verification of the Social Contribution Activity The activity cost is verified by type and format of activity. Cost Over One Year 2. Verification with KPIs The effect of the initiatives is measured numerically against established key performance indicators (KPIs). For example, we conduct “shopping support” services to assist seniors (Seven-Meal, Net Supermarket, mobile store service, etc.) The effect of these activities is verified by using the number of stores involved, the number of operational vehicles, the amount of sales, and other metrics as KPIs. In addition to these numbers, we also reflect feedback from service users in our planning for the following fiscal year. Further details about shopping support can be found here 3. Dialogue with Organizations We Support We confirm the results of activities reported by NPOs and other organizations to which we give financial assistance. We verify the effects of activities based on reported information such as the number of beneficiaries and the positive impact on them, as well as direct feedback obtained through dialogue with the assisted organizations. We also refer to these reports and feedback when deciding on the next round of recipients and projects that we will assist. 4. Survey of Employees Who Participate in We conduct questionnaire surveys of employees who participated as volunteers in activities we have planned, Activities asking them about their level of satisfaction with the activity and points for improvement. The results are used to measure the effect of the activity and in planning our next activities. 5. Survey of Employees Overall Every second year we conduct an Employee Opinion Survey of a sample of employees from 29 Group companies. (Certain companies conduct sampling surveys.) Through the results of the survey, we confirm employees' awareness of their own companies. The results are used in our verification of the activities for two years, and for formulating plans for the next period. Sample question: I believe my company: Builds good relationships with local communities. Conducts environmentally friendly business activities. Is actively engaged in social contribution activities. Further details about the Employee Awareness Survey can be found here Encouraging Employee Participation in Social Contribution Activities Seven & i Holdings believes that employee participation in social contribution activities is also crucial. Based on this belief, we plan and implement activities such as opportunities to experience nature and disaster reconstruction support programs. Moreover, to encourage employee participation in volunteer activities, Seven-Eleven Japan, Ito-Yokado, Seven & i Food Systems and Seven Bank have instituted a volunteer leave system under which employees can take five days off per year for volunteer work. At Ito-Yokado, part-time workers may also take volunteer leave. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

CSR Data Book 2019 152 7‒Eleven, Inc. Reducing Environmental Impact 7-Eleven, Inc. remains focused on doing its part to reduce the company’s impact on the environment. In 2017, the company continued to make progress by implementing sustainability measures that focus on energy conservation and efficiency, and other environmental benefits. 【Environmental Goals(restates in 2017)】 (1)Reduce CO2e emissions in stores by 20% by 2027 (2015 baseline) (2)Shift to eco-friendly packaging for 100% of private brand products by 2027 ※2027 is SEI’s 100th anniversary. Collaboration with External Organizations 7-Eleven, Inc. continued relationships with two organizations to help guide its environmental initiatives – Conservation International and Retail Industry Leaders Association. Conservation International (CI), is a nonprofit organization dedicated to building a healthier, more prosperous and more productive planet through science, policy and partnerships. 7-Eleven is a member of CI’s Business and Sustainability Council, a forum for corporate leaders taking positive environmental actions in their businesses, to explore mutually beneficial ways to further reduce its environmental impact.7Eleven is a member of the Retail Industry Leaders Association’s Retail Sustainability Initiative (RSI). RSI is an industrywide educational forum for the largest U.S. retailers. It brings its members together to share leading practices, identify future trends, benchmark with peers, and collaborate on common industry sustainability challenges. Promoting Energy Saving 7 Eleven is committed to reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency. In 2016, 7-Eleven, Inc. set a target to reduce the company’s energy footprint in stores by 20% by 2025, compared with 2015 levels, measured in MTCO2e per square foot. In 2017, 7-Eleven reduced it C02e emissions by 92,035 MTCO2e year over year from 2016 and by 111,611 MTCO2e from 2015. 7-Eleven has currently reduced MTCO2e by 13.6% MTCO2e per sq ft. from 2015 to 2017. This is equivalent to greenhouse gas emissions from approximately 19,800 passenger vehicles for one year. 7-Eleven reduced its environmental footprint by working with energy partners and through energy conservation and efficiency measures in stores, such as installing LED light fixtures, energy management systems and high efficiency heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment. Between 2008 and 2017, 7Eleven reduced electricity consumption in stores by an estimated 24.5%. LED Lighting LED lights are energy efficient, eliminate use of hazardous materials and comply with local regulations to reduce light pollution. They enhance the customer shopping experience and support store safety. 7-Eleven’s LED lighting program is part of the company’s energy-efficient design standard and is a significant contributor to the company’s CO2 reduction goals. As of December 31, 2017, more than 6,000 stores feature LED lighting. Stores that changed from fluorescent to LED lighting can achieve an estimated annual energy saving effect of 38,756 kWh per store. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 153 Energy Management Systems(EMS) 7-Eleven stores energy management systems (EMS)s enable remote control of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigerant equipment, which yield significant energy consumption. The systems monitor, control and optimize the performance of energy-consuming equipment, and generate real-time data to perform diagnostics and optimization routines to reduce energy consumption and manage costs. In 2017, the company continued to install EMS. Currently, nearly 6,000 stores have EMS installed, enabling stores to achieve an estimated energy savings effect of 16,323 kWh per store, per year. Shifting Focus to Renewable Energy In 2017, while maintaining the company’s commitment to existing energy conservation projects, 7-Eleven, Inc. turned its focus toward renewable energy. 7-Eleven signed an agreement with TXU Energy to purchase 100 percent Texas wind energy for all its Texas stores located in competitive energy markets. This wind energy agreement, which impacts 425 stores, starts in 2018, and is expected to reduce 7-Eleven’s carbon footprint by an estimated 6.7 percent while providing significant operating expense savings. With more than 10,000 wind turbines in the state, Texas ranks first in the United States for both installed and under-construction wind capacity, and is home to four of the top 10 largest wind farms in the nation. External recognition for initiatives addressing environmental issues Sustainability Choice Award TXU Energy recognized 7-Eleven with its 2017 Sustainability Choice Award for its commitment to reduce the company’s carbon footprint and choice of renewable energy for the business. Stars of Energy Efficiency Award In 2017, the Alliance to Save Energy awarded 7-Eleven® with the Alliance to Save Energy “Built Environment” award for its commitment to reducing energy consumption and improving efficiency in its stores. The award recognized 7-Eleven’s for successfully decreasing electricity use in store operations by an estimated 21 percent between 2008 and 2015 through installing LED lighting, energy management systems and high-efficiency HVAC units. The Alliance to Save Energy is in its 25th year of recognizing innovators in the energy efficiency field and reward the hard work of those dedicated to saving energy. Engaging our People in Climate Change Climate change is a significant global problem that we encourage all our people to learn more about. At our 2017 national conference, SEI provided information on the effects of climate change, and gave pedometers to all attendees for our “Steps for Good” contest. For every 500 steps a participant took, 7-Eleven donated $1 to help the environment. Participants walked more than 17 million steps – almost 8,600 miles – raising over $34,000 for environmental initiatives. The money was donated to Conservation International (CI), an American nonprofit organization, to support efforts to educate people on ways to improve and stabilize the climate. Use of Environmentally Friendly Containers and Packaging 7-Eleven is committed to continually looking for ways to improve product packaging. Many of our solutions are paper-based, derived from sustainable resources and, whenever possible, we work to reduce packaging materials without compromising product quality or safety. We focus on correct sizing and choosing materials that best fit and deliver our products in the most efficient manner. In 2017, SEI continued its commitment to packaging improvements through several packaging reduction initiatives. 2017 Highlights 7-Eleven evaluated several fresh food packaging designs and determined that the company could reduce materials and still maintain packaging quality and performance for breakfast and meal offerings. The breakfast sandwich package was switched from quilted hand wrap to a window bag, reducing the material by 25% The rectangle entrée package was made smaller and a plastic shrink band deleted, reducing the material by 10%. The large oval entrée package was reduced in size and a plastic shrink band deleted, reducing the material by 33% A downsized small oval entrée package without a plastic shrink band reduced materials by 37% Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

Nearly every major coffee-producing region of the world is under stress as changing weather patterns affect coffee production. By working with the Rainforest Alliance, SEI can help foster sustainable farming practices that protect natural resources. The Rainforest Alliance is an international nonprofit organization that seeks to conserve biodiversity and ensure sustainable livelihoods. Carrying the Rainforest Alliance Certified seal means 7-Eleven stores’ new coffee is sourced from coffee-growers whose farms are required to meet strict standards designed to protect the environment, conserve wildlife and promote the well-being of local communities. Single-Origin Coffee from Mexico After introducing its first single-origin Rainforest Alliance Certified coffee, sourced from Nicaragua last year, 7-Eleven introduced its second singleorigin sustainably-sourced coffee from Chiapas, Mexico. The Rainforest Alliance Certified coffee is made exclusively from beans harvested in the mountainous highlands of southern Mexico, an area known for its dense rain forests and ancient Mayan ruins. Permanent Single-Origin Colombian Coffee 7-Eleven made a significant product commitment to sustainability with the switch to a new Rainforest Alliance Certified single-origin Colombian coffee. Available year-round, the new 100 percent Columbian coffee replaced the version previously offered and is the company’s first permanent coffee variety to switch to sustainable sourcing. Limited Time, Single-Origin Peruvian Coffee For its next limited time, single origin coffee, 7-Eleven sourced beans from the Cajamarca region of Peru. As with its other single-origin, sustainably sourced coffee, the new coffee from Peru is Rainforest Alliance Certified. The Peruvian coffee is the third limited-time, single-origin coffee offered at 7-Eleven, the fourth largest coffee retailer in the U.S. With the addition of the certified single-origin Colombian coffee as a permanent offering and other sustainable limited-time varieties in the future, between one-third and one-half of the 7-Eleven® coffee lineup will be Rainforest Alliance Certified. As part of its CSR objectives, SEI will continue to seek out responsibly sourced coffees with less environmental impact. Coffee that carries the Rainforest Alliance ‘Certified™ Seal and gives customers a premium cup of coffee and a feel-good way to start the day. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 155 Coexisting with Local Communities (U.S.) 7‒Eleven, Inc. aims to uphold its responsibilities as a good corporate citizen and contribute to local communities where it has opened stores. The Head Office and franchisees work together to promote social contribution activities. The main fields for these activities are support for youth development and military personnel. In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, 7‒Eleven, Inc. provided assistance to over 1,500 organizations totaling more than US$3.40 million in monetary terms through donation drives and provision of supplies implemented by customers, franchisees, employees, and Head Office. 【Social Contribution Goal（restates in 2017）】 Increase corporate giving to 1% net income by 2027 ※2027 is SEI’s 100th anniversary. Support for Youth Development For the 22nd year, 7-Eleven® worked with law enforcement agencies across the country to distribute free Slurpee® drink coupons through Operation Chill®, 7-Eleven’s popular community-service program that recognize kids for positive behavior. Through Operation Chill, law enforcement officers from participating local police and sheriff’s departments “ticket” youngsters caught in the act of doing good with Slurpee beverage coupons. The coupons help officers enhance relationships with the young people of their cities by rewarding them for good deeds, positive activities and acts of kindness. Examples of rewarded behavior might include helping a person in need, deterring crime or participating in a community service activity. Each coupon can be redeemed for a small Slurpee drink at participating 7-Eleven stores. In 2017, 7-Eleven issued more than 1.3 million Slurpee coupons to approximately 1,000 law enforcement agencies which, in turn, distributed most of those during the summer months and back-to-school season. Since the program’s inception in 1995, more than 19 million Operation Chill coupons have been distributed to hundreds of law enforcement agencies across the country in areas where 7-Eleven operates stores. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 156 Support for Children's Education Developing our youth is an important investment to ensure kids have a strong foundation to become responsible and productive citizens. 7-Eleven’s Project A-Game program helps kids develop their full potential by funding education, fitness, safety and hunger relief programs that can set them up for success. Franchisees who identify a need in their community can apply for a Project A-Game grant on behalf of a school, youth sports program or community organization in their store’s neighborhood. The grant is jointly funded by Franchisees and the company and helps provide critical funding for program expenses. In 2017, more than 620 grants were awarded a community investment of approximately $515,000. Grants helped underwrite a variety of initiatives that help kids stay focused, in school and on track including, positive behavior programs, athletic teams and after school activities. Since the program’s inception in 2012, nearly 3,500 grants have been awarded, totaling approximately $2,000,000. Fighting Youth Hunger In the United States, 13 million, or 1 in 6 children, face hunger and may not know where they will get their next meal. Getting the energy kids need to learn and grow can be a daily challenge. Fresh produce is in high demand by food banks and is important to good nutrition, especially for children. In 2017, for the 4th consecutive year, 7-Eleven, Inc. joined the Feeding America network of food banks in a pay-it-forward campaign to buy bananas for food-insecure individuals and families in the U.S. 7-Eleven® customers were offered a quick and easy way to help by purchasing two bananas for $1, that were donated to Feeding America and distributed through its network of local food banks to families in need. For every two bananas donated by a customer, 7-Eleven also contributed an additional dime for the Feeding America network. This program provided an opportunity for 7-Eleven customers to get involved in one of the most pressing issues our country is facing and support hunger-relief efforts at a vital time during the holiday season. The mission of Feeding America, the nation’s leading domestic hunger-relief charity, is to feed America’s hungry through a national network of 200member food banks and engage the country in the fight to solve hunger. Its member food banks supply food to more than 46.5 million Americans each year, including children and seniors. 7-Eleven and its customers donated approximately 725,000 bananas and nearly $35,000 in cash contributions to benefit 22 regional Feeding America member food banks where 7-Eleven operates stores. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 157 Creating fulfilling workplaces Employees with strong abilities are vital for SEI to achieve its business goals and objectives. SEI understands the value of learning and development to build employee competencies for personal growth and to maximize employee potential. Initiatives in North America For information on Seven-Eleven Hawaii, please follow this link. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 158 Seven-Eleven Hawaii In March 2016, Seven-Eleven Hawaii (SEH) added “Our Promise” to its set of company values in order to support its direction as a chain of “close-by, convenient stores,” to shape its corporate culture, and to further solidify its values. “Our Promise” is comprised of the following three specific values. 1. Bring a smile to the faces of customers, vendor partners, and employees 2. Work together as a team to achieve goals 3. Strive for greater heights To promote “Our Promise,” the company started a program for recognizing exceptional employees. First, all employees are encouraged to nominate people they think are practicing the three values. Then, the selected people are given a badge and a bonus and are introduced in the company newsletter and on an employee-only Facebook page. These values define SEH as a business for the community, for partners and for employees. The practice of Our Promise then becomes the cornerstone for the words and actions of employees. Thriving with Local Communities As a good corporate citizen, SEH supports activities and NPOs involved with children, education, public welfare, and health. In 2018, the equivalent of approximately $42,500 in support was provided to 61 organizations through fundraising, material support, and volunteer activities on the part of SEH customers, stores, employees, and the company. Supporting NPOs through Storefront Donations SEH has been collecting storefront donations to support various NPOs that contribute to the local community since it began operations. Organizations that wish to receive donations submit an application stating their mission and why they want to participate in the organization, and each month, one organization is selected as the recipient. The selected organizations are active in fields such as health, safety, and education, and the donated funds are used throughout Hawaii. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, approximately $86,844 were donated. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 159 Social Contribution through the Sale of Coupon Books Since 2001, SEH has sold Lima Kokua (Helping Hands) Coupon Books to schools, sports teams, and other non-profit organizations. The organizations that purchase the coupon books, which can be used in all SEH stores, earn a profit by selling them to third parties. SEH supports the activities of these NPOs through the sale of the coupon books. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, 25 organizations used the system. Many of these were repeat orders, showing that the books have been popular. “Healthy Bento Contest ” Held for Culinary School Students SEH began a partnership with the Pacific Food Association through an introduction from the Hawaii State Department of Health . Its first initiative was to hold a healthy boxed lunch contest for the association’s students. Students create boxed lunches that fulfill nine conditions, such as calorie restrictions (700 calories or less), using at least two local ingredients, and using SEH boxed lunch containers. The boxed lunch competition gives students an opportunity to tackle meal preparation in ways that differ from restaurant cooking. To support the students during the two-month preparation period, the SEH Fresh Food team provided SEH information as well as various boxed lunch samples. It also confirmed all samples submitted one week before the contest and provided advice for improvement. In addition, WARABEYA U.S.A., which supplies products exclusively to SEH, provided students an opportunity to tour a plant. Seeing the process of boxed lunches being made from start to finish was very useful to the students in creating their own boxed lunch recipes. On November 28, the eight finalists gave presentations in front of an audience of over 70 spectators, and the judges from SEH and WARABEYA U.S.A. decided the top three entries based on the appearance, taste, marketability, and presentation of the food. The first-, second-, and third-place entries, which were boxed lunches consisting of pastele stew, vegetarian chili, and teriyaki salmon , respectively, are slated to be rolled out at all SEH stores in 2019. Due to the large response received from people in the region, SEH plans to hold the same contest for other culinary school students in the autumn of 2019. Contest Participants Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 160 Support for Children Starting November 12, 2018, SEH held its third “Letters to Santa” Program . The children living near its stores brought in letters addressed to Santa asking for things that they want. The SEH Marketing Department reads all of the letters and selects 40. Three children among those who wrote especially outstanding letters appeared on a local lifestyle program and talked about what they requested from Santa and why they requested it. SEH sends presents to the elderly every year during Christmas season, and a 7-year-old girl who requested money for such a present received a gift card. SEH also made a donation in the girl’s name to a service that provides meals to senior citizens. A 9-year-old girl requested that meals be provided to the homeless, and a 12-year-old girl requested a home for abandoned animals. To satisfy this girl’s kindness toward animals, SEH made a donation in the girl’s name to the Hawaiian Humane Society . In addition to providing what the three asked for, SEH also gave them toys and other gifts. SEH plans to continue the “Letters to Santa” campaign, which brings smiles to children’s faces, in the future as well. The children who participate in the campaign come from families without the financial means to grant their wishes, and they are putting into practice the Christmas spirit of “unconditional giving.” SEH has learned a lot from children by lending them its assistance. The three children introduced on television Reducing Environmental Impact SEH has been working on an initiative named the Energy Smart Program, to reduce energy consumption, since 2012. In 2018, many stores replaced their ice cases. In addition, they are replacing old sandwich sales fixtures as they increase the number of product displays. Despite these efforts, electricity consumption for 2018 was almost the same level as the previous year. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd.

Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 162 Chinese Convenience Store Business Providing Safe and Reliable Products In China, where concerns over food safety and integrity have been mounting, SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING), SEVEN-ELEVEN (TIANJIN) and SEVENELEVEN (CHENGDU) work to provide safe and reliable products by leveraging quality management and product development capacities cultivated in Japan. Product Quality Management For the Group’s private-brand products in China, strict standards are applied in selecting ingredients, and processing plants that maintain high quality levels are selected through a screening process based on whether they have experience exporting to Japan and other criteria. We have strengthened quality management at dedicated plants producing only the Group’s products by incorporating international food safety management systems and measures implemented at plants in Japan. Beijing Wang-Yang Foods and JEANAVICE factories, which are dedicated plants of SEVENELEVEN (BEIJING) and SEVEN-ELEVEN (TIANJIN), obtained the “SC” food production license for chilled foods in February 2017, earlier than peer companies in the industry. “SC” is a regulatory requirement related to food production in China. Food manufacturers must acquire the “SC” license by switching from the existing “QS” food quality and safety license by October 2018. In addition, Q’s Café plants acquired HACCP*1 certification in March 2017, while Beijing Wang-Yang Foods acquired it in March 2018. The three companies are working on automating their manufacturing process to better stabilize product taste and quality. Chengdu Yonglida Food Limited Company , which supplies products to SEVEN-ELEVEN (CHENGDU) , expanded its installation of rice ball molding and wrapping machines in July 2018, and it introduced noodle-making machines starting in 2019. Beijing Wang-Yang Foods has been introducing more machines at its plant dedicated to stuffed bread , which began full-scale operations in March 2019, with a focus on the bread production process and product wrapping. SEVEN-ELEVEN (CHENGDU) also began cultivation management at its dedicated production sites starting February 2019, and it began sales of salads made using very fresh vegetables by using low-temperature transportation and processing (cold chains). Similarly, SEVEN-ELEVEN (TIANJIN) began selling salads using cold chains starting July 2019. *1HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) food sanitation management method Giving Consideration to Health Trans-fatty acids, which are said to increase the risk of heart disease, were successfully reduced to zero in the original room-temperature bread products of SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) and SEVEN-ELEVEN (TIANJIN). In addition, since January 2019, allergens have been displayed for rice balls and sushi, and this is gradually being expanded to boxed lunches, sandwiches, and other products. Seven & i Holdings Co., Ltd. CSR Data Book 2019 163 Improving Customer Satisfaction The three companies are working to collect customer feedback in order to improve products and services from the standpoint of customers. Feedback obtained from customers is shared with departments and stores on a daily basis. In addition, in order to grasp changes in customer needs and reflect them in products. SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) and SEVEN-ELEVEN (CHENGDU) conduct periodic customer surveys. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) conducted a survey aimed at 1,000 customers. Because we learned from the survey that many customers from neighboring residential areas are making use of it, we reviewed our lineup of sundries . The three companies have been conducting training to further improve the customer service provided by employees. For example, starting in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, SEVEN-ELEVEN (TIANJIN) has been conducting cash register customer contact training at certain stores, and due to the significant improvements, the company introduced the training to all stores starting in the fiscal year ending February 28, 2019. In addition, SEVEN-ELEVEN (CHENGDU) placed trainers in charge of store training and is working to improve customer service through customer service training and daily practice. SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) created customer service awards to recognize employees who provide outstanding customer service. The awards are presented in a group ceremony every three months. We will strive to enhance motivation by presenting awards to recipients at meetings and other such forums in conjunction with striving to increase examples of best practices for employees to follow by making the award-winning activities widely known. Presentation of awards by SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) Thriving with Local Communities Each company conducts social contribution activities as members of their local communities. Environmental Preservation Measures through In-Store Donations SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) installed collection boxes in stores and has been collecting money from customers since November 2006. The funds are donated to the Beijing Green Fund, an officially-recognized environmental preservation organization. The Fund uses donations from the public to plant trees as countermeasures against sandstorm damage and desertification, creating tree fences that prevent sand movement in and around Beijing. Starting the fiscal year ended February 28, 2019, as an activity in which customers could easily get involved, it began an initiative in which part of the proceeds from customers’ coffee purchases were donated to the Beijing Green Fund . This initiative resulted in donations of 25,639 yuan, and a total of 108,974 yuan was donated for the year.

They serve as store management consultants that provide multifaceted advice to franchise stores on overall management, including ordering, product lineups, and employee training. OFC candidates first gain store experience at training stores and learn the fundamentals of store management, which include the Four Basic Principles; unit control; employing, training, assigning and evaluating staff; and management indicators.

Monthly interviews are conducted between employees and their direct supervisors to discuss the rate of progress toward their performance goals. After selfassessments are carried out by each employee, yearly interviews and evaluations are then conducted by the direct supervisor and a secondary, higherlevel supervisor. Monthly evaluations are based on company, divisional and individual performance. They are working on improving the evaluation system, with SEVEN-ELEVEN (BEIJING) working with external vendors to review the skill items necessary for each job, for example. Moreover, the frequency of interviews was changed from once a year to quarterly, and progress is being periodically checked so that annual performance goals can be achieved. In addition, SEVEN-ELEVEN (TIANJIN) added the achievement status of action plans to its evaluation items in an effort to have each employee be conscious about results when engaged in their work. For managers who perform evaluations, regular training is carried out on matters such as monthly evaluation methods for subordinates and on determining pay in accordance with these evaluations. The training enables managers to obtain the correct knowledge on these matters.
