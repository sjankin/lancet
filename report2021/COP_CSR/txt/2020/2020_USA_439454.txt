(UNISHKA) is a worldwide alliance dedicated to fostering ethics and integrity in government, business and society. Founded in 2005 as University Research Service (URS), we began operations by reaching out to local legal advisors, scholars, scientists and financial experts; inviting them to collaborate with us in the creation of an international information consortium committed to gathering data and knowledge on economic, security, legal, and political issues relating to corruption. In 2014, UNISHKA incorporated in Alaska to carry on the URS legacy while implementing an anti-corruption methodology created by UNISHKA called Systems Integrity Development. UNISHKA is the first U.S.-company dedicated exclusively to anti-corruption. In April 2018, UNISHKA became a signatory to the UN Global Compact. For the period April 2019 through April 2020, UNISHKA was classified as “GC Active.” UNISHKA plans to expand its actions and outcomes in the coming years, eventually growing into a “GC Advanced” member. The following is a summary of the actions and outcomes for the reporting period: 2 DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS 2.1 Human Rights 2.1.1 UN Objectives:  Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.  Make sure that they are not complicit in human right abuses. 2.1.2 UNISHKA Actions:  UNISHKA is sharing research on human rights abuses in Afghanistan with the International Criminal Court to ensure that any abuses of human rights are prosecuted.  Adopted the UNISHKA Gender Policy to foster both equity and equality in the workplace;  Became a Signatory to the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEP);  In UNISHKA’s Quarterly Newsletter, we have devoted a section to gender and integrate gender issues throughout the document;  UNISHKA began a collaboration with Afghan Child Education and Care Organization (AFCEO) to enhance the educational opportunities for young girls;  UNISHKA and Justice for All Organization (JFAO), a women-run NGO dedicated to enhancing access to justice for women and girls, began a collaboration to promote justice and reduce the effects of corruption on women and girls in Afghanistan;  Implemented vetting policies to ensure that any business with whom UNISHKA does business is not complicit in human rights abuses;  Implemented UNISHKA’s gender integration policy and employed a gender lens on all projects. 1 2.2 Labour 2.2.1 UN Objectives:  Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.  The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour.  The effective abolition of child labour.  The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. 2.2.2 UNISHKA Actions:  Adopted the UNISHKA Family Medical Leave Policy.  Assigned and empowered the Compliance Committee to ensure UNISHKA projects are being implemented in accordance with all labor laws as well as the UN Global Compact;  Adopted a Human Resources pay scale that is significantly above local and national minimum wage standards;  Employed a gender lens to Human Resources to advance gender equality. 2.3 Environment 2.3.1 UN Objectives:  Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges;  Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility;  Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 2.3.2 UNISHKA Actions:  Became a Signatory to the UN Water Mandate;  Initiated the Kabul River Clean-up (KRC) which is developing a sustainable approach to keeping the Kabul River clean.  Adopted a business strategy that focuses on supporting government implementation of environmental and wildlife protections.  Implemented a company-wide “work from home” program to reduce the use of fossil fuels.  Implemented an office recycling program and “environmentally friendly” substitution policy (i.e. paper plates instead of plastic; paper cups instead of Styrofoam, etc.). 2.4 Anti-Corruption 2.4.1 UN Objectives:  Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 2.4.2 UNISHKA Actions:  Joined Anti-Corruption Advocacy Network (ACAN)  Adopted a company Compliance Manual 2  Revised and reissued the UNISHKA Code of Conduct  Issued the UNISHKA Ethics Policy  Engaged and empowered independent auditors to scrutinize UNISHKA’s financial expenditures to reduce the risk to corruption in any form.  Implemented anti-corruption programs worldwide. 3 MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES  UNISHKA was instrumental in the United States imposing sanctions on current and former public offices who engaged in corruption in multiple countries around the world.  UNISHKA donated 200+ professional hours and countless staff hours to developing women-led NGOs in several countries in the Middle East and Central Asia.  UNISHKA employs a policy of hiring refugees from counties that abuse human rights on projects that directly implicated those abuses; consequently, we have engaged two new consultants on projects focused on problematic environments in the Middle East and Central Asia.  UNISHKA collaborates with Mine the Gap (https://www.minethegap.co) on a weekly basis to maintain our gender lens and commitment to gender equality.  The Compliance Committee developed a matrix of recommendations to ensure compliance with human trafficking, anti-corruption and gender equality objectives and laws; all of the recommendations have been adopted for implementation.  A majority our full-time staff and all of our part-time staff have opted for the “work at home” program allowing UNISHKA to significantly reduce its carbon footprint.  Conducted worldwide research on the schemes and perpetrators of public corruption and identified those schemes to the appropriate authorities. 3
