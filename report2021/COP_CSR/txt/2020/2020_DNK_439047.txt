In Moranti Services, we focus on our customers and employees. Through innovation and by “thinking out of the box”, we continuously strive to improve our high level of performance and quality. We believe, that an open-minded dialog with our customers and the empowerment of our employees, not only generates a high performance, but also ensures satisfaction and motivation – both amongst our customers and our employees. We know that companies are driven by people for people. This is reflected in our core values; which we practice in everything we do. We aim to be a responsible company, acting ethical correct on e.g. the natural environment, work environment, operating environment and social environment. We believe that ethical responsibility, diversity and inclusive leadership ensure the best results. This, combined with our compliance and adherence of applicable laws and regulations, make our fantastic corporate culture which we both cherish and are proud of. We take care of our customers and make sure that their values and visions are passed on to the market. Moranti has a clear Corporate Governance model where all employees, customers and suppliers are encouraged to follow the “Ten principles of Global Compact”. Within our own operation we have education schemes, self-assessments as well as audit processes to ensure that we constantly meet the requirements. Our suppliers must sign a document confirming that they meet the requirements of Global Compact and likewise document this by audit reports. It is our firm belief, that the “Ten principles within Global Compact” make a difference within trusted corporations and provide sustainable Governance to a better world. Thank you for being an asset in developing our business together with us. Birgitte Dam Kræmmergaard President and CEO Moranti Services A/S April 2020
