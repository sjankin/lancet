Corporate Responsibility Report I 39 Upholding information security INTRALOT has established clear processes, tools and activities to prevent, detect, and react to information security incidents, in order to protect its information assets.

Furthermore, the Company provides specific guidelines and instructions to all employees related to information security (e.g. protection against malicious code and illegal software, email and internet security) and has developed detailed rules and requirements for specific departments or user groups (such as the Human Resources Department and the Corporate Affairs Department, Project and Technical Managers, Code Designers and Developers, ICT Department and Service Desk), which respective employees must read and comply with their provisions.

In case employees do not have access to corporate email at that time, they can file their report through telephone and send an email as soon as possible.

The Company’s IT Department has moved the new software configurations testing as well as development and consolidation of production servers to virtualized environment, which significantly improves INTRALOT’s environmental efficiency due to lower energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.

For this reason, the Company mainly utilizes chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) free refrigerants to cool its servers, use in air-conditioning (R407 and R410) and fire suppression systems as well as for its coolers, in order not to harm the ozone layer, as they correspond to a lower ODP (R-11 equivalent). Air Travel Because the climate impact of air transportation is currently not sufficiently regulated by national or international laws, the Company voluntarily commits to minimize air travel and travelled air miles, in order to reduce the impact of its business operations on climate change. Therefore, INTRALOT: ▶ Uses other modes of regional travel, where possible ▶ Utilizes remote session technologies and conference calls to reduce the number and frequency of business travels ▶ Extensively uses e-learning training programs ▶ Monitors the number of flights and greenhouse emissions due to employee air travel ▶ Combines trips and activities, in order to minimize the number of flights required ▶ Uses the most direct routes possible, since take-offs and landings increase the amount of fuel consumed ▶ Prefers to utilize flights during the daytime, because relevant studies have showed that flying during nighttime increases the overall environmental impact ▶ Encourages employees to fly economy seats, because more people per plane mean fewer emissions per person ▶ Encourages employees not to carry heavy baggage during flights, because lighter planes mean less fuels consumed Corporate Responsibility Report I 109 Air miles and CO2 emissions from air travel 2015 2016 2017 2018 Flights (number) 783 810 727 827 Long flights (>4 hours) 180 320 172 155 Short flights (<4 hours) 603 490 555 672 Travelled air miles (thousand miles) 1,101.5 849.9 773.9 686.9 CO2 emissions (indirect emissions) 549.6 585.1 492.8 437.4 (tons)* *Estimations based on ICAO Carbon Emissions Calculator and EPA 430-R-08-006. Carbon dioxide emissions from air travel reduced by 11.2% Societal Support Promoting environmental awareness INTRALOT seeks to promote environmental protection issues and encourages initiatives related to environmental protection. Therefore, the Company: ▶ Includes the use of a dedicated reminder in corporate e-mail signatures to consider the environment before printing an e-mail ▶ Briefs newly hired employees on recycling through the Corporate Induction Program ▶ Supports the activities of its Corporate Volunteer Group, which was created in 2005 and actively engages in various programs and initiatives with Stakeholders and the wider public on environmental protection issues. The Corporate Volunteer Group has created the GREEN SITE, an electronic platform that supports their mission and publicizes their activities ▶ Trains employees on environmental protection and the efficient use of energy sources Protecting biodiversity Due to its negligible influence of activities and operations on biodiversity, INTRALOT does not have a separate policy on biodiversity. However, the Company takes this important environmental issue into consideration, as: ▶ All buildings are located in established industrial or residential areas, with no facilities located near protected NATURA or RAMSAR areas ▶ All operation sites are not located near ecosystems and habitats or other areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas ▶ There are no IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations Corporate Responsibility Report I 110 2018 Objectives % of completion Contribute to career initiatives for university students 100% Participate in career fair for people with disabilities 100% Societal Support Future Objectives Implement an internal awareness by campaign to reduce energy consumption 2019 Contribute to career initiatives for by university students (e.g. career fairs, internships, mentoring) 2019 Participate in career fairs or programs by for persons with abilities and unemployed youth 2019 Sponsor or participate in local by technology-related events 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report I 111 9.0 ABOUT THE REPORT About the Report Corporate Responsibility Report I 112 9.1 Scope and Development Principles The Report follows the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) ‘Sustainability Reporting Standards’ (version 2016), while the following have also been used: ▶ For the principles of the Report, the UN’s Global Compact ▶ For the presentation of quantitative data within the Report, the EFQM’s RADAR Card Scope The annual Corporate Responsibility Report: ▶ Refers to the period 1/1/2018-31/12/2018 (unless indicated otherwise in certain points) ▶ Refers to all activities of INTRALOT S.A.
