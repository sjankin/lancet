Given our strong and long-standing partnerships with manufacturers of boats and related equipment, such as marine engines, we expect the marine segment to constitute a growing share of our revenue in the years to come. Our aim is to be the leading supplier of special purpose boats – from search-and-rescue to special purpose boats – to both governmental and commercial entities in the Nordics. We continue to focus on the sale of armoured vehicles to international organisations and governmental entities by expanding our product portfolio and after sales services. We also offer a leasing scheme for pre-owned armoured vehicles including on-site service. By continuously expanding our list of dealerships for high quality and often niche products and services for the Kingdom of Denmark and the Baltic Region, we also expect to expand our presence in the Danish and European market in the years to come. Our business model is and always will be that of a facilitator and broker – bridging the gap between reputable manufacturers and customers. Supporting international organisations and national governmental bodies worldwide with products and services from cradle to grave remains our core business focus.
