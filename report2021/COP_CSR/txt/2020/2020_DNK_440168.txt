CSR Report 2020 Communication on Progress (COP) A SUSTAINABLE INITIATIVE Mekoprint has been a member of the UN Global Compact since 2017, and we are very ambitiously committed to support the UN Global Compact and its ten principles with human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. As part of the UN Global Compact membership, Mekoprint is primarily focusing on the Sustainable Goal no. 12 “Sustainable Consumption and Production”, but in the following years more goals will be evaluated and selected – such as Goal no. 9 “Industry, innovation and infrastructure” and Goal no. 17 “Partnerships for goals”, which the company in particularly can contribute to. At Mekoprint we have an ambitious objective to be a “sustainable development and production partner”. We want to be a sustainable frontrunner that sets the standard with a balanced development of the company, based on a fourfold bottom line measured on 1) Job satisfaction and management quality 2) Customer satisfaction 3) Social responsibility and 4) Economic growth. We want to lead the charge in optimizing the sustainability throughout the value chain by delivering maximum value with a minimum amount of resources and environmental impact. This year we have once again achieved positive results in our efforts in working with sustainability. We have achieved CO2 neutral production for all our customers, climbed the ranks of the Great Place to Work to an impressive 12th place as Denmark´s best places to work among medium-sized companies and received the award “CSR Gold Rating” from the independent analysis company EcoVadis in developing a more sustainable customer collaboration. This report gives a short status of what we have achieved in 2019 by working together with our stakeholders. We will continue working for sustainable growth. Anders Kold Torben Jensen CEO CFO Crucial steps towards a Sustainable development & production partner 2019 was an exceptional year in many ways. We celebrated Mekoprint’s 65th anniversary, introduced CO2 neutral production for all our customers, were named Entrepreneur of the Year in the North Denmark Region at the EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards, and moved up to an impressive overall 12th place as Denmark's best place to work among medium-sized companies. We have come far, but there is still a lot of work to be done to achieve our objectives for 2020 and towards 2030, as a sustainable development & production partner. At Mekoprint, this is expressed in our desire to be a sustainable frontrunner that sets the standard with a balanced development of the company, based on a fourfold bottom line measured on 1) Job satisfaction and management quality 2) Customer satisfaction, 3) Social responsibility and 4) Economic growth. This report oﬀers a brief overview of our work in 2019 as regards the CSR strategy drawn up in 2017, with objectives going towards 2020. In the CSR strategy, our social responsibility has been subdivided into the environment, supplier collaboration and our other social responsibility work with particular focus on child and youth development, all of which are described brieﬂy in this report.
