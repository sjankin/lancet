Chemistry in laboratories is a science for the development of sustainable technologies and innovations. Sustainable development requires policy changes from a linear economy to a circular economy, where the products are designed to allow waste to serve as resources for other industries. Environmental considerations and economic growth are not mutually exclusive. Chemistry must continue to play a leadership role in forging the science and technology that will provide humanity with a sustainable path to the future. Chemistry offers vast market opportunities related to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and several paths are emerging before us: ▪ Preserve environmental protections based on science; ▪ Promote the adoption of more sustainable technologies; ▪ Promote more responsible materials in supplies; ▪ Invest in basic research to enable long-term advances; ▪ Promote the preferential hiring of scientists and engineers trained in the principles and practices of sustainability; ▪ Develop a circular economy to reuse the materials of products after the end of their first life; ▪ Take into account the preservation of ecosystem services to maintain our biodiversity. | 26 2019 CSR REPORT GOVERNANCE STRATEGY COMMITMENTS PERFORMANCE GRI 102-21 / 102-29 / 102-40 / 102-42 102-44 / 102-46 / 102-47 / 103-1 2.5 GROUP CSR CHALLENGES STAKEHOLDER IDENTIFICATION For a responsible and sustainable activity, MANE is committed to refining its strategy in collaboration with its stakeholders.

CSR issues cover many areas, and not all of them having the same impact on the company and its stakeholders, the materiality analysis makes it possible to identify the environmental, social and societal consequences specific to an organization, and those that have a significant influence on its stakeholders. A full list of CSR challenges linked to MANE's activities has been drawn up on the basis of various existing standards (ISO 26000, UN Global Compact, GRI, article 225 of the Grenelle) and issues identified by other players in the sector. The materiality matrix obtained represents the level of relevance of the subjects according to their impact for MANE (horizontal axis) and their importance in the eyes of our stakeholders (vertical axis). This materiality analysis was developed for the first time in 2012 and has since been updated each year by the management review of the CSR Committee. In 2018, for example, we identified new priority issues to take into account in our analysis, including: the traceability of the geographic origin of raw materials of natural origin (in the context of the Nagoya Protocol) and the fight against corruption (with the Sapin 2 Law). In 2020, a new consultation with stakeholders will take place to further develop the CSR strategy of the MANE Group. | 30 2019 CSR REPORT GOVERNANCE STRATEGY COMMITMENTS PERFORMANCE 2.5 GROUP CSR CHALLENGES INTEGRATION IN THE CSR POLICY Risks / Opportunities Priority issues in the materiality matrix Strategic issues of our In this report sustainable development policy 1.

From this perspective, although the first step for MANE is to develop products that provide greater environmental benefits, it is also necessary to give customers all the social and environmental information about our products to enable them to make informed purchases. With GREEN MOTION™, our tool to assess the environmental impact of the ingredients manufactured, MANE gives its customers the chance to find out about the environmental profile of products and makes them aware of the choice of more “green” formulae. In terms of nutrition, consumers want healthier and nutritionally beneficial products. Our customers in the food industry are looking to reduce the sugar and salt content of their products. The challenge is to do this without drastically altering the taste consumers are used to. To this end, MANE has developed a range of products, Sense Capture, to help its customers adapt to these behavioural changes and new consumer expectations. To ensure the result meets the taste expectations of consumers in terms of organoleptic quality, MANE offers natural food flavours to decrease quantities of sugar (Sense Capture Stevia) and salt (Sense Capture Salt) without changing the taste of the lighter products.

Freedom of assembly and the right to collective bargaining are key principles in our Group Code of Ethics. We believe that social dialogue can play a productive part in negotiations, consultations or simply information exchange between the company and employee representatives to encourage cooperation to increase the positive social impact of the company. Across the Group's sites in France, social dialogue occurs with members of the Social and Economic Committee (CES), which since 2018 has merged all of the employee representative bodies: employee representatives, works council and occupational health, safety and working conditions committee.

To ensure the everyday traceability of vanilla from farming communities, we have formalised oversight of farming communities in the form of agreements including the establishment of pollination records, indexing all pollinated flowers (then green pods) by plot and by week. This year, we also have a new and very simple yet effective traceability tool: a mobile app called METAJUA, which allows you to record data on farming communities and share it with various partners. For each farmer, the app tracks information on their plantation, the flowering of vanilla plants (log, statistics, estimated harvest date, etc.) and the purchase of green vanilla or vanilla prepared by the farmer (date, delivery person, quantity, price, quality, etc.). This tool also allows us to assess the potential and performance of each plantation and each farming community, which is very important to continue selecting the best vanilla pods. Analysing the data collected is vital to encourage farmers and put in place corrective action. We are also continuing our initiatives aimed at creating shared value, as defined in the MANE 2018-2021 plan to support Madagascan vanilla, particularly in terms of health with the funding of the Vohemar hospital and through various investments to improve daily hygiene.

The project’s success is attributed to its personal nature: donors know the names, ages and gender of the children who will receive their gifts. The project is supported by a vast network of volunteers in South Africa and Namibia volunteers who devote their time, energy, and know-how and receive no financial compensation in return. The project is also made possible due to the generous support of several company sponsors who provide financial backing or other types of aid. For 6 years now, MANE South Africa has been supporting the Children's Hospital Trust, which raises funds for the War Memorial Children's Hospital, the largest children's hospital in sub-Saharan Africa. A child requiring intensive care is a harrowing experience for the whole family. It is therefore important for hospitals to create a comfortable and welcoming space for families, and just as important to create an environment that complies with the highest standards so that the intensive care department can provide advanced treatments for children whose symptoms require careful monitoring. Since its creation, the Trust has helped the hospital modernise its buildings, buy vital equipment and fund essential research and training programmes. After several years in planning and construction, the first of three intensive care units opened its doors in August 2016, while a second unit providing facilities for patients, families and staff opened in November 2017 and a third unit providing neonatal intensive care will open in February 2018. In November 2018, MANE South Africa employees (Johannesburg, Cape Town and DELI SPICES) donated 110 personalised shoeboxes filled with gifts as part of the Santa Shoebox Project. The Santa Shoebox Project began in Cape Town in 2006 with 180 modest shoeboxes. | 85 2019 CSR REPORT GOVERNANCE STRATEGY COMMITMENTS PERFORMANCE 3.4 PROMOTE SUSTAINABILITY ALONG OUR VALUE CHAIN PERFORMANCE TABLE 2021 GRI Indicator Unit 2009 2017 2018 2019 objective 102-43 Customer satisfaction rate % 89% 204-1 Supplier average payment term Days 50 308-1 Share of the total amount of purchases made from suppliers committed to a CSR policy % 53% 93% 90% 93% 90% 308-1 Share of global suppliers committed to a CSR policy % 9% 56% 70% 72% 80% 308-1 Share of significant suppliers assessed on their CSR % 0% 27% 38% 47% 50% (On-site audits or by ECOVADIS assessment) | 86 2019 CSR REPORT GOVERNANCE STRATEGY COMMITMENTS PERFORMANCE 4 PERFORMANCE | 87 2019 CSR REPORT GOVERNANCE STRATEGY COMMITMENTS PERFORMANCE GRI 102-45 / 102-48 102-52 / 102-54 4.1 REPORTING PROTOCOL The published non-financial information included in this report covers the period from 1 January to 31 December 2019.
