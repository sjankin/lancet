Statement of support MTI Worldwide Logistics is committed to the principles and goals of the United Nations Global Compact advancement of the ten universal principles in the areas of human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Signature Position CEO Karl Krug We have chosen to list all of the 10 principles in our COP even though some of them may never require significant updating. The complete list will be a good reminder of where we’ve been, and where we’re going. We ensure the principles are maintained in our own operations to the extent that they are relevant (for example, we have never had an issue with human rights abuses, child labor, forced or compulsory labor, corruption, etc.). On the other hand, we have found room for improvement in the environmental category and are creating several procedures for improving our environmental impacts. PRINCIPLE 1 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT AND RESPECT THE PROTECTION OF INTERNATIONALLY PROCLAIMED HUMAN RIGHTS Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance.

PRINCIPLE 3 BUSINESS SHOULD UPHOLD THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND THE EFFECTIVE RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING GLOBAL COMPACT ANNUAL COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS Our Commitment or Policy The MTI Worldwide Logistics policy guarantees to all employees the right to collective bargaining as well as the freedom of association.

PRINCIPLE 5 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOUR Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. PRINCIPLE 6 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION IN RESPECT OF EMPLOYMENT AND OCCUPATION Our Commitment or Policy We actively promote diversity in our staff recruitment. Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • As a small business and by comparison -MTI Worldwide Logistics provides a good health insurance, liberal annual vacation schedule, employer funded pension plan and a profit sharing program for all employees. • VOIP allows flex-work-flow from home or office for all employees... decreasing the need to commute for some to the office. Measurable Results or Outcomes • All our employees have health insurance, a pension & participate in a rewarding profit sharing plan. • All employees are able to work from home on a partial/selective basis. All employees work at least part-time remote, and we have expanded the number of remote work only employees to 5 from 2 in 2019. PRINCIPLE 7 BUSINESS SHOULD SUPPORT A PRECAUTIONARY APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES Our Commitment or Policy Our policies are to reduce the environmental footprint of our operation. A brief description of our Processes or Systems Recycle system and Electronic Document Repository Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • We have continued our “go-green” initiative with both internal (MTI & Global Partner Network) and external clients & vendors. • Implementation of 100% vendor electronic invoicing continues with every new vendor that works with our company. We now only retain invoice copies electronically, no longer printing hard copies, with very rare exception. All are retained within our system for reference. effectively improves the environmental impact by reduced printed materials, and the handling and resources taken to mail the invoice. GLOBAL COMPACT ANNUAL COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS • Implemented in all offices, our operational files are now retained within our system electronically, and the goal of 100% electronic storage by the end of 2019, has been attained. Only government required printed documents are redundantly kept both electronically and in paper form. • We have completed the implementation of the IATA e-AWB, which allows for electronic communication between our company and the airlines. The e-AWB and electronic documents in some instances eliminate the need for printed document pouches that historically must accompany each air shipment. The additional benefit seeing the elimination of paper and fuel to transport these documents help to increase our environmental stewardship and reduce global warming impact. PRINCIPLE 8 BUSINESS SHOULD UNDERTAKE INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE GREATER ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY Our Commitment or Policy MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are focused to reduce the environmental footprint of our operation Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year • Continued conversion of vendors to electronic invoicing. This reduces the environmental impact of printing, processing, and delivery of the document. • Expanded remote work program extended to all employees, currently ranging from two days working remote to now 5 employees working remote full-time. This reduces our carbon emissions, and we estimate a reduction of 60 or round trip commutes per week that we have effectively eliminated. Continued implementation will progress as feasible through the year • Continued push for electronic invoicing to all new customers, and to move existing customers to electronic delivery, resulting in a reduction in the environmental impact of our daily billing function. • Implementation of our electronic e-AWB and move to 100% electronic document storage will greatly reduce our impact on the environment. Not only through the reduction of paper, but also in carbon emissions with the enhanced ability for more employees to work from home, as electronic communication is further implemented. PRINCIPLE 9 BUSINESS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DIFFUSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES Our Commitment or Policy The MTI Worldwide Logistics provides help to existing & start-up companies which are attempting to develop environmentally friendly technologies. Actions implemented in the last year / planned for next year We offer recyclable cardboard pallets to targeted customers in order to replace the wooden pallets which account for almost 30% of all the trees cut each year in the USA alone. Measurable Results or Outcomes Cheap wooden pallets (and a strong political lobby..) during a recession are a major hurdle for companies resisting change to a more environmentally friendly cardboard pallet. However we are starting to see positive momentum in the willingness of companies to entertain eco-friendly pallet alternatives. GLOBAL COMPACT ANNUAL COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS PRINCIPLE 10 BUSINESS SHOULD WORK AGAINST CORRUPTION IN ALL ITS FORMS, INCLUDING EXTORTION AND BRIBERY Our Commitment or Policy All MTI Worldwide Logistics policies are nested with US and Host Nation government requirements in order to ensure strict compliance. Additionally, all employees must sign an anti-corruption agreement and report to MTI Senior Management, any coworkers, vendors, customers, or partners that attempt to engage in any form of bribery, extortion, or corruption of any nature. How do you intend to make this COP available to your stakeholders? The MTI Worldwide Logistics COP will be provided to all staff for review and feedback in order to continue to refine our policies and procedures to remain compliant in this process.
