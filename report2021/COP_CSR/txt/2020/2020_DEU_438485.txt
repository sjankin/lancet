It describes the product perfectly, because Morton’s table salt pours without clogging even when humidity is high. Unfortunately, the saying also applies to us in a different way. When something bad happens, other bad things usually happen at the same time. And that is an accurate description of what has been going on at K+S these past two years. While the extreme drought weighed on our results in 2018 by causing disposal problems, the downturn in the potash market had a negative impact on our earnings in the year under review. This means that, for the second time in a row, it is largely external factors that have led to a year of disappointing earnings, to which we have responded by readjusting our strategy. But first things first. I am still firmly convinced that the Shaping 2030 strategy will bring the right answers to the challenges of our markets and the megatrends relevant to us. In the past year, we made very good progress in its implementation. The reorganization of the Group into a customer-focused “One company” progressed further. For example, we merged a number of K+S subsidiaries to make it easier for us to harness synergies and hone the way we respond to our customers’ demand. Our new corporate culture is now embedded in One K+S values, which have been communicated throughout the Group. One of these values – sustainability – is an integral part of Shaping 2030. We made considerable advances in implementing our sustainability program in 2019. We are vigorously pursuing our objectives in the areas of people, the environment, and business ethics. We measure our performance in this area against specific key figures, as described from page 52 onward in this Annual Report. Through Shaping 2030, we leveraged synergies of more than €100 million in procurement, logistics, production, and sales and marketing in the past year. From the end of 2020 onward, we will, as promised, generate synergies of €150 million a year. K+S Annual Report 2019 3 However, the deterioration in general conditions for a large part of our business and uncertainty in the global economy have necessitated some fine-tuning of our strategy. The potash market started to weaken in early fall of 2019. Freak weather in important sales regions and a temporary import ban on potash in China led to a massive decline in demand and prices. In response, we – along with our competitors – cut production last year and were forced to revise our original earnings expectations significantly downwards. Despite these factors, we still generated a 6% increase in EBITDA year on year, to a total of €640 million in 2019. But in terms of free cash flow, we really delivered! For the first time since 2013, we succeeded in achieving positive free cash flow of €140 million. This is all the more important because reducing our indebtedness is the only way forward. Our indebtedness rose sharply, firstly following the strategically important investment in the construction of our new potash plant in Canada. Secondly, it reflects the large investments in environmental protection measures at our German production sites. In the past eight years, we have spent almost €1 billion in total on these projects. However, given the market conditions described above, we are not in a position, based on operational performance alone, to generate enough available liquidity that would allow us to reduce our debt significantly within the specified time frame. But we need a solid financial basis to enter the planned growth phase of our strategy. This will also make the Company more robust. Together with the Supervisory Board, we therefore resolved in December 2019 to accelerate the implementation of Shaping 2030 by adopting a comprehensive package of measures. These measures are aimed at selling parts of the Company in the short term, thereby quickly realizing value. A key focus area of these value-creating measures is on the Americas operating unit. For the salt business located there, we can envisage, for example, the sale of an interest. In the Europe+ operating unit, the emphasis is on further increases in efficiency and production, as well as portfolio optimization. Our German production sites have to generate positive free cash flows on a sustainable basis, a principle that applies to every plant. In the current situation we simply cannot carry on with “business as usual,” solely for reasons of costs, because this would put our international competitiveness at risk. What is more, we want to sell assets that are not part of our core business. Activities that don’t add value will be restructured or sold. 4 K+S Annual Report 2019 In addition to reducing our debt, we want to make the existing values of K+S a lot more visible so that they translate into an appropriate market capitalization. Weakness in the potash market, combined with our high leverage ratio, led to a fall of almost 30% in the K+S share price in the 2019 calendar year. A performance with which we are very dissatisfied, of course. This applies particularly in view of the continued failure to adequately show the value of our business on the capital market. With the announcement of the package of measures, we decided not to wait for a recovery in the potash market, but to take matters into our own hands. Ladies and gentlemen, As you are aware, through our new Shaping 2030 strategy, we are implementing major changes in our Company. We are aligning K+S even more closely with our customers and their needs. This transformation entails great opportunities, which we illustrate for you in this report, starting on page 49. Those who know me will know that I am an optimist whose glass is always half-full. Despite the challenges of the past two years, I am also optimistic about our Company. We are already generating positive cash flows from operations in our Canadian potash plant in Bethune. Product quality has meanwhile reached the high levels expected not only by our customers, but also by ourselves. We are implementing the announced package of measures with speed and determination in order to reveal the kind of value we actually have in our Company. Our business model is as robust as the markets in which we operate. The positioning of our products is excellent. And last but not least, our corporate Shaping 2030 strategy will bring the right solutions to the challenges ahead. Thank you for staying loyal to K+S in 2019, even though this was certainly not always easy. I can assure you that we are working with considerable drive and determination on the tasks ahead in order to guide our Company through this difficult phase. All the best!

K+S Annual Report 2019 7 Resource conservation 8 K+S Annual Report 2019 Fruit from the desert Throughout the world, areas under cultivation are becoming scarcer while, at the same time, demand for agricultural products is growing. Thus, it is important to u ­ tilize every single square yard even where no plants have been cultivated in the past. In ­especially hot and arid regions, farmers use what is known as “fertigation,” a combi­ nation of irrigation and fertilization. K+S Annual Report 2019 9 Fertigation conserves resources Harvesting even when water is scarce In this process, nutrient salts that are fully soluble in water are used. The water-­ fertilizer mixture is applied drop by drop to the soil directly next to the plant. Even in desert regions, almost all the liquid reaches the roots without evaporating beforehand. But the best thing about this is that the plants are fertilized exactly as needed so that they receive the right nutrients at every point in their growth. Fertigation literally makes the desert bloom. For example, the method is popular in regions in the Middle East and North Africa, where farmers are now able to grow cucumbers, tomatoes, and fruit. But fertigation is not only useful in hot, arid areas it can also increase yield in wine-growing regions. Because of climate change, the world will have to adjust to more extreme periods of hot weather and drought. Fertigation is one way to feed a growing global population even under these changing conditions. With our reliable water-soluble fertilizers including products for organic farming – and our strong brands, we are making a contri­ bution towards the expected growth in this area. Photo above: Pomegranate plantation in the Bhuj region in the state of Gujarat in northwest India. Photo left: Growing tomatoes in a greenhouse: So that produce such as ­tomatoes can grow optimally, water-­ soluble potassium chloride and potassium ­sulfate are used for fertilization. 10 K+S Annual Report 2019 Opportunities • Resource conservation • Highly efficient fertilization • Autonomy in arid farming areas • Optimizing agricultural production K+S Annual Report 2019 11 Innovations 12 K+S Annual Report 2019 Productive ideas in the fields and in the city To feed a continuously growing world population, we need new ideas. ­Especially since the available areas for cultivation are becoming smaller. This is one of the reasons why we are promoting resource conserving farming with artificial intelligence (AI). But we are also using AI to ­examine whether it is economically viable to cultivate algae on an industrial scale. K+S Annual Report 2019 13 Innovations for our future Growing with new ideas Fertilizing the complete field uniformly that was yesterday. Because the need for fertilizer can change considerably every few yards within productive land, it is important to ensure that nutrients are provided as precisely as possible. This is where ­satellites and smartphones come into play: In collaboration with the ­Darmstadt-based start-up Spacenus and the Institute of Applied Plant Nutrition (IAPN) in Göttingen, Germany, we are developing the Plant Nutrient Detection (PND) system. Artificial intelligence developed by Spacenus uses smartphone photos to detect the supply status of individual plants and, with satellite photos, recognizes the level of nutrient supply on the field. To calculate the correct volume of fertilizer, AI needs appro­ priate data about plant growth. Together with the IAPN, we are generating this data in experiments with wheat. For the 2020 fertilizing season, PND will be tested in practice with some pilot farmers. Marine algae can be found on menus in many parts of the world. This is a good thing, as the plants are rich in proteins. In ­addition, many types of algae contain carrageen an important raw material for the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, food, and animal feed industries. Macroalgae pilot plant at Innopark Sigmundshall.

Non-negotiable: Our values • Safe & sustainable • Agile • Collaborative • Innovative • Entrepreneurial • Optimistic K+S Annual Report 2019 23 SUPERVISORY BOARD REPORT Dr. Andreas Kreimeyer Chairman of the Supervisory Board 24 K+S Annual Report 2019 The 2019 financial year again presented us with major challenges and highlighted the fact that K+S is currently navigating a difficult path. Following an encouraging first half of the year, geopolitical turbulence and the increasingly unfavorable business conditions for potash fertilizers in the second half year led to increasing inventories at our customers, price pressure on our products, and lower production volumes, negatively impacting profitability. As a result, we were unable to meet our EBITDA targets and reduce debt as planned. Consequently, our share price dropped. The high level of indebtedness is essentially due to two factors: Firstly to the successful completion of the new potash production plant in Canada. This investment was approved in 2011 and was a key strategic move to secure the future viability of K+S. Although the expected potash price development currently falls short of our initial planning, K+S is set to achieve healthy profits on the potassium chloride volumes produced following the full ramp-up of the Bethune plant, which is among the world’s most competitive facilities! Secondly by the continuously rising demand for major investment in environmental protection measures at the German sites, which are now almost impossible to predict. Over the past eight years, K+S has already invested around €1 billion in environmental measures to enable us to keep our domestic facilities in operation. We have always been clear that the rapid reduction of our high level of indebtedness must be a core objective of our SHAPING 2030 strategy. In light of this, we formulated specific targets: K+S intends to halve its indebtedness by 2020 and fulfill the requirements to regain an investment grade rating in 2023. We were already well on track by mid-2019. However, in the course of the second half of the year, the rapid deterioration of business conditions – due in particular to the trade dispute between the USA and China and China’s import ban on potash – made it apparent that these targets would be unachievable by the specified dates without more extensive measures. K+S Annual Report 2019 25 The central aim of the additional measures developed in 2019 and communicated in December 2019 is therefore to step up debt reduction in order to rapidly and sustainably reduce our indebtedness. We do not plan to rely on the market’s self-healing powers to do this. Instead, we will act boldly and decisively to consistently drive forward our value-generating and cost-cutting projects. On behalf of the Supervisory Board, I would like to thank all employees for their hard work and commitment. Our thanks also go to the members of the Board of Executive Directors, who are guiding K+S through this difficult period, as well as to our ­employee representatives and Works Council members who have constructively contributed to the achievement of our ambitious targets with a focus on the future. Special thanks go to you, our shareholders, for critically, but always constructively, standing by us through the challenging conditions in 2019. Advising the Board of Executive Directors and Monitoring of Management During the 2019 financial year, the Supervisory Board diligently performed the supervisory and advisory functions incumbent on it by law and in accordance with the Articles of Association and its bylaws. Numerous matters were discussed in depth and resolutions were adopted on transactions requiring approval. We continuously monitored the Board of Executive Directors’ management of the Company and advised the Board on the governance of the Group. We were always involved in decisions of fundamental importance in a timely and appropriate manner. The Board of Executive Directors regularly briefed us promptly and comprehensively on the course of business, the financial position, net assets, and results of operations, the employment situation, the progress of important investment projects, planning, and the further strategic development of the Company. Deviations from planning were explained to the Supervisory Board in detail. The risk situation and risk management were carefully considered. The Supervisory Board received written reports from the Board of Executive Directors in order to prepare for meetings. In particular, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board also remained in close personal contact with the Board of Executive Directors outside of meetings and regularly discussed significant events as well as upcoming decisions. The shareholder and employee representatives regularly discussed important agenda items at separate meetings prior to meetings of the Supervisory Board. 26 K+S Annual Report 2019 In 2019, five Supervisory Board meetings were held. The average attendance rate of the 16 Supervisory Board members at these meetings was 95% in the reporting period. One meeting was attended by all Supervisory Board members and at each of the four remaining meetings one member was unable to attend. All absences were excused. Of the four physical Audit Committee meetings, three were attended by all committee members and one member was excused from the remaining meeting. The Nomination Committee held three sessions, fully represented. Six of the seven meetings of the Personnel Committee were attended by all committee members; at one meeting one member was excused. The Strategy Committee met on two occasions, with full attendance at both meetings. Composition of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board appointed Ms. Fabíola Fernandez Grund to the Board of Executive Directors at its meeting of November 13, 2019. On assuming this role, Ms. Fernandez Grund will also become the Company’s Labor Relations Director. The composition of the Supervisory Board did not change in the year under review. Supervisory Board Meetings One extraordinary and four ordinary Supervisory Board meetings were held during the 2019 financial year. At the ordinary meeting held on March 13, 2019, the Supervisory Board examined the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements, and the management reports for the 2018 financial year in the presence of the auditor, approved the financial statements on the recommendation of the Audit Committee, and, following extensive discussions, agreed to the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors concerning the appropriation of profits. The business situation and the outlook for the current year were discussed in depth and the proposed resolutions for the 2019 Annual General Meeting were also approved. In addition, the findings of the audit of the non-financial statement were discussed with the auditors. Furthermore, the target agreements of the members of the Board of Executive Directors for the 2019 financial year and the determination of target achievement in 2018 as well as the adjustment of the pension ceilings were resolved. Lastly, we discussed potential acquisitions with the Board of Executive Directors. At the ordinary meeting on May 14, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors briefed the Supervisory Board in detail on the development of the business situation, earnings in the first quarter of 2019, potential acquisitions and the status of the “Operations Excellence” project. Furthermore, the gender ratio for the Board of K+S Annual Report 2019 27 Executive Directors was redefined. In addition, candidates for election to the Super­ visory Board by the 2020 Annual General Meeting were nominated. In advance of this, the shareholder representatives submitted an application for separate fulfillment and forwarded it to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board. At the ordinary meeting on August 22, 2019, we addressed the new German Corporate Governance Code and the current business situation, among other things, and approved a financing measure. The Board of Executive Directors also informed the Supervisory Board about potential acquisitions and provided an update on the K+S GROUP’s SHAPING 2030 strategy. In addition, we learned in detail about the status of the digitalization process and discussed the long-term succession planning in the Board of Executive Directors. The extension of the mandates of Dr. Lohr and Mr. Boeckers, the introduction of claw-back clauses in their contracts, the adjustment of the remuneration structure of the Board of Executive Directors and the adjustment of committee remuneration were resolved. In addition, a resolution was passed on the remuneration of non-Group mandates. At the extraordinary meeting on November 13, 2019, we learned in detail about the preparations for the upcoming medium-term planning, the progress of the Bethune plant, and a package of measures to rapidly reduce debt. Furthermore, the filling of the additional position in the Board of Executive Directors was discussed and Ms Fernandez Grund was appointed to the Board of Executive Directors. At the last ordinary meeting of the year, held on December 3, 2019, the Board of Executive Directors explained the current business situation and provided a forecast of the anticipated revenues and earnings of the K+S GROUP in the 2019 financial year. The planning of the K+S GROUP for 2020, including the capital expenditure and financing framework, was examined in depth (also in terms of consistency with strategic objectives) and subsequently approved. We then had a detailed discussion with the Board of Executive Directors on the package of measures to rapidly generate value and reduce indebtedness. The mandate of Mr. Roberts was extended. In addition, ­adjustments to age limits and election periods for Supervisory Board members and an adjustment to committee remuneration were resolved. Acting on a recommendation submitted by the Audit Committee following a structured tender procedure, we also supported a proposal to the Annual General Meeting on the election of the auditor for the annual and consolidated financial statements for the 2021 financial year. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported on this committee’s last meeting. The Supervisory Board resolved to engage DELOITTE GMBH WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFUNGSGESELLSCHAFT to audit the non-financial statement. The joint 2019/2020 declaration of conformity by the Board of Executive Directors and Supervisory Board was likewise approved. ‘Declaration on corporate governance,’ page 99 28 K+S Annual Report 2019 Committee Meetings In addition to the Mediation Committee required by law, the Supervisory Board has established four more committees to support its tasks and responsibilities: the Audit Committee, the Personnel Committee, the Nomination Committee, and the Strategy Committee. An overview of these committees and their composition can be found in the management report on page 104 and on the K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT website under “About K+S”. There you can also find the bylaws for the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Audit Committee met a total of four times in 2019. The committee, together with the Strategy Committee, addressed potential acquisitions on February 28. On March 1, 2019, in the presence of the auditor as well as the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and the Chief Financial Officer, the committee examined the 2018 annual financial statements of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, the 2018 consolidated financial statements, the combined management report, as well as the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors for the appropriation of profits, and recommended that the reappointment of DELOITTE GMBH WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFUNGSGESELLSCHAFT as auditor be proposed to the Annual General Meeting. The committee also addressed the audit tender procedure for the 2021 financial year. On August 22, 2019, the committee discussed the K+S GROUP’s internal control system (ICS) in detail, especially accounting and auditing processes with the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors and the Chief Financial Officer. Moreover, the committee acknowledged and approved the report delivered by the Chief Compliance Officer on the status of the compliance management system of the K+S GROUP. In addition, the recommendation to the plenary meeting of the Supervisory Board of two audit firms for the audit of the annual financial statements for financial year 2021 was agreed. Finally, the committee discussed focal points of the 2019 audit. At the meeting on December 3, 2019, the head of Internal Audit reported on his work in the K+S GROUP. The Board of Executive Directors reported on developments with regard to consultancy fees and donations as well as on the engagement of the auditor with non-audit services. Finally, the Audit Committee recommended that the Supervisory Board engage the statutory auditor to audit the non-financial statement. The level of indebtedness, liquidity, and measures to reduce indebtedness were also discussed. The respective Quarterly Reports and the Half-Yearly Financial Report awaiting publication were discussed by the members of the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, and the Chief Financial Officer in conference calls held on May 8, August 12, and November 12, at the end of the respective quarters. K+S Annual Report 2019 29 The Personnel Committee, which prepares personnel decisions of the Supervisory Board and is responsible for other Executive Board matters, met seven times in 2019. It dealt with the target agreements and achievement of targets by the members of the Board of Executive Directors, the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Board of Executive Directors in relation to the management circles and the total workforce, the level of the fixed remuneration of the members of the Board of Executive Directors, the redefinition of the gender ratio, the adjustment of the pension ceilings, the introduction of claw-back clauses, the expansion of the Board of Executive Directors and the associated appointment of Ms. Fernandez Grund to the Board of Executive Directors, as well as the further development of the remuneration system for the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, the extension of the mandates of the members of the Executive Board was discussed. In addition, the developments of the German Corporate Governance Code and the changes in legislation regarding the 2nd Shareholder Rights Directive (ARUG II) were discussed. It also dealt with short and long-term succession planning for the Board of Executive Directors. Detailed information on the amount of compensation for the Board of Executive Directors in 2019 and the structure of the current compensation system can be found on pages 142–146. The members of the Nomination Committee met four times in 2019; the main topic of discussion was long-term succession planning for the Supervisory Board. It also dealt with the age limit and the limitation on the number of election periods for ­Supervisory Board members. The Strategy Committee met twice in 2019. The main topics of discussion were potential acquisitions and the medium-term planning, as well as the package of measures to rapidly generate value and reduce indebtedness. The Mediation Committee did not need to be convened in the past financial year. Conflicts of interest No conflicts of interest involving members of the Board of Executive Directors or the Supervisory Board, about which the Annual General Meeting needed to be informed, were disclosed to the Supervisory Board during the reporting period. Audit of the 2019 Annual Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Statements DELOITTE GMBH WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFUNGSGESELLSCHAFT, Hanover, audited the annual financial statements of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, prepared by the Board of Executive Directors in accordance with the rules of the German Commercial Code (HGB), the consolidated financial statements prepared on the basis of the international accounting standards as adopted by the EU and the supplementary German legal requirements required to be applied in accordance with section 315e (1) of the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB – German Commercial Code) and the combined manage30 K+S Annual Report 2019 ment and Group management report for the 2019 financial year. The annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements both received unqualified audit opinions. In addition to the statutory audit, the Supervisory Board of K+S AKTIEN­ GESELLSCHAFT commissioned DELOITTE GMBH WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFUNGSGESELLSCHAFT to audit the conformity with limited assurance of the combined non-financial statement in accordance with the CSR-RUG. DELOITTE reported the results to the Audit Committee of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT at its meeting on March 2, 2020 and to the Supervisory Board at its meeting on March 11, 2020. Based on the audit procedures performed and the audit evidence obtained, no matters have come to the attention of DELOITTE that cause DELOITTE to believe that the condensed non-financial statement of the company for the period from January 1, to December 31, 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with sections 315b, 315c in conjunction with 289c to 289e of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The aforementioned documents, the Board of Executive Directors’ proposal concerning the appropriation of profits, and the audit reports of DELOITTE GMBH WIRTSCHAFTSPRÜFUNGSGESELLSCHAFT, each of which had been submitted to the members of the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board on time, were each addressed extensively at the Audit Committee meeting held on March 2, 2020, as well as at the Supervisory Board meeting held on March 11, 2020, in the presence of the auditor. All questions raised at both meetings were answered satisfactorily by the Board of Executive Directors and the auditor. Following its own examination of the reports presented, the Supervisory Board did not raise any objections. It agreed with the Board of Executive Directors on its assessment of the position of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT and of the Group and, at the suggestion of the Audit Committee, approved the financial statements for the 2019 financial year, thereby ratifying the 2019 annual financial statements of K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT. The Supervisory Board endorsed the proposal of the Board of Executive Directors for the declaration on corporate governance (page 99). The resolution on the appropriation of profits proposed by the Board of Executive Directors was also examined, particularly with regard to the present and expected future financial situation of the K+S GROUP. Following extensive discussions, the Supervisory Board also approved this proposal made by the Board of Executive Directors. All the best for the future!

Although there are few market ­cultivation synergies between Agriculture and the other customer segments, there are numerous synergies that we intend to more intensively leverage in the areas of production, technology, and logistics due to the geographic proximity of the potash and salt mines within Germany. The operating units have direct and close ties with their customers. For optimal market cultivation, the two units are responsible for the entire value chain from sales planning through production and marketing and distribution to delivery. Based on central strategies, they develop medium-term implementation concepts for their markets and implement central production standards. 38 K+S Annual Report 2019 CUSTOMER SEGMENTS or because they are water-soluble.

Water is also a very important resource for K+S. We use different qualities of water in many processes. We need water for extraction and production at certain deposits, in production, and when using certain products, such as in agriculture. We extract high-quality salt products from seawater and other saline waters through solar evaporation. On the other hand, certain production processes and tailings piles generate saline wastewater that we need to dispose of. Across the Group we want to reduce water-related impacts to an absolute minimum.

K+S Annual Report 2019 133 REPORT ON EXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS The current high volatility in potassium chloride prices in the overseas regions makes it particularly difficult to forecast earnings; in addition, the further spreading of the coronavirus could additionally exacerbate uncertainty. Thus, for 2020, EBITDA is expected to range between €500 million and €620 million (2019: €640.4 million). In the Agriculture customer segment, negative price effects will be set against higher sales volumes following the production cuts in the previous year. After a weak start in the de-icing salt business in the first quarter, we expect lower total sales volumes in the Communities customer segment than in the previous year.

For the worldwide collection of financial data, SAP systems are widely used. In the present Annual Report, these are disclosed for all ­fully consolidated Group companies. We also collect most of our personnel key figures worldwide with SAP systems. They cover all fully consolidated companies. Key fi­ gures concerning human rights due diligence are currently recorded centrally with individual data sheets and for all fully consolidated and non-consolidated companies of the K+S GROUP. The key figure recording of the indicator for the positive perception of an inclusive work environment by employees is shown in the section on diversity and inclusion. Key figures on human rights due diligence are currently recorded centrally via individual data sheets for all fully consolidated and non-consolidated companies of the K+S Group. The majority of HSE key figures are recorded using a SAP system for all fully consolidated and non-consolidated companies in which K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT directly or indirectly holds a majority interest or in which K+S AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT exercises direct or indirect joint control or takes influence in decisions by Articles of Association or by-laws. We record the environmental key figures of all fully consolidated potash and salt production sites. For uniform recording, K+S uses the site information system SoFi. Performance indicators in terms of CSR-RUG are calculated based on measured and extrapolated values using individual data sheets. Reporting limits other than the scope of consolidation are presented accordingly in the section “Environment.” The purchase volume ordered by the purchasing department is mainly entered into the SAP system for all fully consolidated companies. At present, we record our compliance key figures using individual data sheets for fully consolidated and non-consolidated companies. ‘List of shareholdings,’ page 222-224 238 K+S Annual Report 2019

The participating companies acknowledge the ten principles of the Global Compact in the areas of human rights, working standards, environmental protection, and anti-corruption. Value Added This key figure is based on the assumption that a company creates added value for the investor when the return on the average capital employed exceeds the underlying cost of capital. This excess return is multiplied by the average capital employed (annual average for operating assets and working capital) to give the company’s added value for the year under review.
