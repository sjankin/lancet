In this year, we deeply studied and implemented the Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and, guided by this, took firmer steps to serve the nation by strengthening the iron and steel industry with stronger resolve. We continuously improved the operating benefits and development quality, and made contributions to national affluence and strength, social stability, and better livelihood for the people. In this year, we unswervingly implemented the new concept on development, consistently carried out transformation, upgrading and innovation centered on the supply-side structural reform, and achieved ever better operating benefits and development quality. In 2018, the steel output of China Baowu reached 67.25 million tons, ranking the second in the world. The annual operating revenues registered 439.8 billion yuan and the profits were 33.8 billion, up 100% year-on-year and creating a new record of profits in its history. In this year, we persistently implemented the new concept on development and stepped up the planning for major, cutting-edge technologies and product innovation, with the aim of meeting national strategies and user demands. We launched seven products worldwide, actively pushed intelligent manufacturing and accelerated the process of “Industrial Intelligentization and Intelligent Industrialization”, and promoted green urban steel mill construction across the board on the principle of “higher than standard, better than city proper, integration with city”. In this year, we resolutely carried out the decisions and deployments of poverty alleviation made by the CPC Central Committee, and made poverty alleviation a key political task. We doubled the funds for designated poverty-stricken areas with more allocated to extremely poverty-stricken counties by assisting Yunnan’s Ning’er County, Tibet’s Dingqing County and Qinghai’s Tongde County in getting rid of poverty, overfulfilling our commitments to the designated areas in every aspect. The world today is undergoing profound changes never seen in the past century, when economic globalization, political polarization, social informatization and cultural diversification are exerting substantial impacts on the global landscape. As China’s economy is shifting from high-speed growth to high-quality development, the iron and steel industry is facing various new requirements made by ecological development, upgraded demand for materials, transformation of industrial services, and the Made in China 2025. As a leading enterprise in China, China Baowu shoulders more arduous and challenging tasks in leading the transformation and upgrading of the industry. Therefore, China Baowu, committed to becoming a global iron and steel leader, put forward the corporate mission of “jointly creating a high-quality iron and steel ecosphere” for the first time. The iron and steel ecosphere we propose features the combination of “intelligent manufacturing + intelligent service”. Based on new-generation network and information technologies, it realizes the connection and coordination of all links of iron and steel manufacturing and service and ensures intelligent decisions on each of them. With “one base and five industries” as the basis and putting user interests first, our iron and steel ecosphere, through sharing and intelligent data, strives to maximize the synergy effect of all stakeholders based on the maximal integration effect of China Baowu. This iron and steel ecosphere also features “opening-up, sharing and innovation”, aspiring to establish a new business mode of B2B2C. “The boat encounters stronger waves when sailing midstream”. As the initiator and founder of the iron and steel ecosphere, we will undertake the responsibility of defending its core values and operating rules. On one hand, we will carry forward the spirit of self-revolution, and reshape the iron and steel supply chain by shattering the fetters on our mind, restrictions on our enterprises and geographical limitation. On the other hand, we will fully exert our advantages as a pilot state-owned capital investment company and a central enterprise, actively integrate the specialized resources and capabilities of subsidiaries, and build the service infrastructure connecting all stakeholders. In this way, we will create the most coordinated, cohesive and competitive ecosphere to lead the highquality development of the iron and steel industry. 2019 marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Over the past 70 years, China’s iron and steel industry has experienced more twists and turns than that in any other country, but it has also made more glorious achievements than any of them. We can say with pride that the iron and steel industry has made irreplaceable contributions for the Chinese nation to stand up, get stronger and more prosperous. In this new era when the Chinese nation is working hard to achieve the Chinese Dream of great rejuvenation, China Baowu, following General Secretary Xi’s instruction of “fostering a world-class enterprise with global competitiveness”, will adhere to our initial aspiration and mission of serving the nation by building a powerful iron and steel industry, and do our best to become a global iron and steel leader. China Baowu will go all out Party Secretary and Board Chairman of to foster a high-quality iron and steel ecosphere that is built and shared by all stakeholders and aims at our China Baowu Steel Group Corporation Limited common development, and help realize the Chinese Dream of the great national rejuvenation!
