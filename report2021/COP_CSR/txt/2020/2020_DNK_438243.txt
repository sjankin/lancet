To reach this goal, we are putting into place robust policies, procedures, and programmes that promote the physical ENERGY-EFFICIENT WATER SOLUTIONS and mental health of people working for Grundfos. Supporting people in returning to work after prolonged illness or injury is another crucial part of realising our responsibilities as an employer. Extended absence from the workplace is detrimental to a person’s mental, physical, and social wellbeing. We strive to find ways to help our injured or ill employees return to function and work when it is safe for them to do so. In addition to benefiting the employee and their family, a safe and timely return to work helps preserve a skilled and stable workforce for employees and society. It also reduces demands on disability plans, as well as health & social services. We track how many employees return to work (RTW) after being absent for more than 14 days due to illness or injury. ACCOUNTABILITY In 2019, there were 1,685 cases globally. 1,553 returned to work at Grundfos, a RTW rate of 92.2%. RTW was incorporated into the new Sustainability Index mentioned on page 7.

Group Learning and Development is one of the HR teams working hard to optimise conditions for employee learning and growth. This includes everything from working with organisational culture to specific technologies and learning processes. In 2019, the team rolled out a new, user-friendly digital learning platform called G-Learn – the entry point for all Grundfos global training and courses. Here, employees can discover learning opportunities by category, search the platform to meet a specific need, or share knowledge with experts and peers. The platform builds on the current learning management system and aims to offer significantly more user-centric learning experiences. ACCOUNTABILITY The main idea is to put the learner in the driver’s seat by offering a platform where you can search for anything you need, whenever it works for you, on any device. Our founder, Poul Due Jensen Grundfos in Society Report 2019 36 OVERVIEW Walking the Talk – Social Responsibility Maximising employee motivation and satisfaction ABOUT GRUNDFOS W e understand that there is a powerful link between employee engagement and customer loyalty, and are doing our utmost to maximise both. The Grundfos Employee Motivation and Satisfaction (EMS) survey provides employees with the opportunity to voice opinions, concerns, and feedback WALKING THE TALK on important issues. The annual survey is anonymous and disseminated in 34 different languages. It reveals areas where things are going well and where they are in need of improvement. The results are shared at every level of the organisation to increase accountability, as well as to encourage progress and growth. Employee participation in the 2019 survey was about 95% – about the same as last year. ENERGY-EFFICIENT WATER SOLUTIONS The level of employee motivation and satisfaction was 75, an increase of 2 points compared with 2018. This brings Grundfos into the top 25% of comparable companies. Our target is to reach 78 by the end of 2025. The 2019 loyalty score was 82, an increase of one point over 2018 – just shy of the top 25% benchmark we aspire to. EMS results also showed positive year over year trends in the confidence employees have in Grundfos leadership, collaboration culture, accountability, and customer-centricity. Finally, employees rate 60 out of 100 leaders as strong on both leadership and ACCOUNTABILITY professional skills, a significant improvement from 55 in 2018. While much of this is good news, we acknowledge that the rapid pace of change in our industry and world is stressful for many people who worry about being left behind. In 2019, we included a question asking workers to rate their stress levels. This is discussed in greater detail on the following page.

ENERGY-EFFICIENT WATER SOLUTIONS In 2019, the annual Employee Motivation and Satisfaction Survey asked individuals to report their stress levels for the first time. On an individual level, 12% of employees rated their stress level as ‘very high stress’, 36% ‘moderate stress’, and 52% ‘very low to no stress’. This data forms a baseline, which will help us to prioritise needs, actions, and resources moving forward. Moving ahead, we will work to foster a deeper understanding of the causes of stress to better support employee wellbeing. In the first quarter of 2020, we are rolling out new e-learning tools that deal with stress prevention and ACCOUNTABILITY mitigation. Our top priority is to ensure that managers are trained and well equipped to create a team environment that is conducive to wellbeing and prevents stress from occurring in the first place.

ENERGY-EFFICIENT WATER SOLUTIONS One of the ways we invite Grundfos employees to join us in this endeavour is through our employee-initiated and employee-driven programme, Water2Life (W2L). Thanks to the concerted effort of W2L ambassadors, dedicated employees from 35 countries have voluntarily invested their time to help those in need. We believe that sustainable change is most effective in partnership, and through the years, we have collaborated with experienced NGOs like Water Mission and Red Cross to help ensure the success of each Water2Life project. Together, we develop smart solutions for realworld problems and bring them to life. “Great things have been achieved already, but we are sure that more can be done,” says Sustainability Consultant, Jesper Richter Rasmussen. ACCOUNTABILITY One of the most amazing parts of the programme is the multiplier effect of donations: financial gifts made by Grundfos employees are matched by the company and by our NGO partner. The result: every dollar donated to Water2Life is quadrupled. In 2019, DKK 390,000 was raised to support our Water2Life projects, bringing the total to over DKK 4.9 million since the programme started. For more about Water2Life, see here.

The public hospital attends to about 80,000 patients per year but did not have a safe source of clean water for operating and treating patients. In partnership with Water Mission, wells were drilled, pipes and water treatment systems installed, and now patients and staff have access to clean water 24/7. The second project is still in progress and will eventually bring water to the 2,000 students and teachers at Froylan Turcios High School. The school faces challenges similar to those of the San Isidro Hospital – dehydrated students and high rates of water-related illness.
