We did not sell any energy in 2019. Energy consumption information was converted to GJ and kWh using conversion factors from EPA Climate Leaders Design Principles Appendix 2, and Energy Star Portfolio Manager Technical Reference: Thermal Energy Conversions. Where actual electricity and natural gas consumption information was unavailable, this was estimated using industry averages from the US Energy Information Administration Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), prorated by office floor area. 5 WSP relied on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, made available by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Resources Institute, to develop our 2019 GHG inventory. We employ the operational control approach in compilation of our inventory. Reported GHG emissions include all six greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6). To convert energy consumption, fuel combustion and business travel data into GHG emissions, we used emissions factors from US EPA eGRID, International Energy Agency, Environment Canada National Inventory Report, US Environmental Protection Agency Emission Factors Hub (US EPA EF Hub) and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). WSP does not produce significant biogenic emissions. Global warming potentials used to convert emissions into CO2e are sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report.
