The main emissions source in our operation is from burning of fuel to generate electricity used in our factories (Scope 2), being responsible for 83.1% of the CO2 that we emit into the atmosphere.

In addition to the benefits described on page 34, some local facilities have implemented, at no charge to the employee, additional well-being options such as: • Food Service & Vending with healthy choice options • Vaccination Campaigns • Mobile Mammogram Screenings • Health Fairs (including basic screenings and blood panel analysis) • Discount to local fitness facilities • Occupational Therapy • On-Site Nurse Practitioner for non-emergency treatment 63 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 Social investment GRI 102-48 / 201-1 A t Fitesa, we are mindful of our responsibility to the communities where we operate and we seek to invest in organizations whose values and practices align with our own. As a multinational company, we understand the ability to be a positive influence on a large number of people across a wide range of cultures. Therefore we focus on social investments in a systematic way: global contributions and local contributions. Philanthropic giving is guided by our holding company, Evora’s, strategic philanthropy policy; however, each operation has the autonomy to define their strategy for social investment based on the needs within their region. Global contributions are chosen at the corporate level and voted on by the PO SI Through these actions, we Fitesa Board.

Their work began in 1995, offering scholarship grants, and as of 2014, establishing a cultural center. In 2019, their activities evolved to encompass also health initiatives through support of implementation of an Oncology center. In 2019, Fitesa contributed $350,000 USD to this partner. Our local contributions are done as financial contributions, enrichment opportunities, volunteer hours and community outreach that are aligned with community’s needs. Traditionally, our Human Resource Departments and Plant Managers play a role in strategy for social investment. • Financial Contributions: monetary contributions to non-profits (raised by employees voluntarily), local company monetary contributions to worthy causes (pre-approved by Fitesa Executive Team) • Enrichment Opportunities: Occupational training, job creation, open house / family events • Volunteer Hours: Food delivery programs for shut ins community residence, Reforestation events, Community clean up days • Community Outreach: Food drives, Diaper donations, Clothing drives, 64 RESPONSIBILITY During 2019, Fitesa was globally SOCIAL INVESTMENTS*(IN THOUSANDS OF USD$) involved in many social investments across the globe.
