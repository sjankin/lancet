Through our broad product offering, we are a single source supplier of phosphateand potash-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients. We serve customers in approximately 40 countries. We are the second largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphate-based animal feed ingredients in North America and Brazil. Following our January 8, 2018 acquisition (the “Acquisition”) of the global phosphate and potash operations of Vale S.A. conducted through Mosaic Fertilizantes P&K Ltda (formerly Vale Fertilizantes S.A.), we are the leading fertilizer production and distribution company in Brazil. We mine phosphate rock in Florida and Brazil. We process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida, Louisiana and Brazil. Upon completion of the Acquisition, we became the majority owner of a joint venture operating a phosphate rock mine in the Bayovar region in Peru, in which we previously held a minority equity interest. We mine potash in Saskatchewan, New Mexico and Brazil. We have other production, blending or distribution operations in Brazil, China, India and Paraguay, as well as a joint venture to develop a phosphate rock mine and chemical complexes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Phosphates We sell phosphate-based crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout North America and internationally. We account for approximately 74 percent of estimated North American annual production of concentrated phosphate nutrients. Potash We sell potash throughout North America and internationally, principally as fertilizer, but also for use in industrial applications and, to a lesser degree, as animal feed ingredients. We account for approximately 34 percent of estimated North American annual potash production. Mosaic Fertilizantes We produce and sell phosphate and potash-based crop nutrients, and animal feed ingredients, in Brazil. In addition to five phosphate rock mines, four chemical plants and a potash mine in Brazil, this segment consists of sales offices, crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities, port terminals and warehouses in Brazil and Paraguay. The Mosaic Fertilizantes segment also serves as a distribution outlet for our Phosphates and Potash segments. We account for approximately 69% of estimated annual production of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in Brazil and 100% of estimated annual potash production in Brazil. 15 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE General Standard Disclosures 102-4 Location of operations We mine phosphate rock in Florida, Peru and Brazil and process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida, Louisiana and Brazil.

Reporting Practice 102-46 Defining report content and Topic Boundaries 102-47 List of material topics 103-1 Topics and Topic Boundaries As a global, publicly traded company, we are continually exploring what it means to be responsible and accountable to Mosaic’s diverse stakeholders. From employees, customers, shareholders and industry partners to trade unions, community organizations, government officials and academics, we seek ongoing dialogue with individuals or representatives of stakeholder organizations that impact—or are impacted by—Mosaic’s business activities. Topics and indicators that reflect Mosaic’s significant economic, environmental and social impacts or that would substantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders are deemed by us to be “significant” for sustainability reporting purposes. AccountAbility’s AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard guided the review process that reflects our company’s commitment to more fully inform all stakeholders on matters that influence our business and society. 24 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE General Standard Disclosures In addition to analyzing peer sustainability reports, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option and the GRI Mining and Metals sector supplement, as well as other reports and frameworks, our ongoing analysis includes: • Reviewing Mosaic’s public financial reports, sustainability reports, GRI tables, policies and commitments as well as an internally conducted survey of senior management, customers and employees • Scanning media reports, social media and blogs for issues raised for public concern • Engaging leaders of local, regional, national and global community organizations • Comparing sustainability materiality determination practices to peer companies • Cataloging issues identified by stakeholder surveys, sustainability indexes, United Nations Sustainability Development Goals, principles of the United Nations Global Compact, regulatory and policy trends, industry associations and cross-sector partnerships • Reviewing marketing research and customer satisfaction survey results • Analyzing investor insights • Compiling community perceptions through social media activity and brand awareness surveys Significant issues are structured around and summarized in four areas of our sustainability focus: People, Environment, Society and Company. Please see our website for relevant updates in each of these areas. Mosaic team members originally evaluated the significance of more than 50 issues based on their relevancy and importance to stakeholders, the likelihood of impact and the connection to Mosaic’s business strategies and values. We monitor these issues as part of the process described above. In 2018 we began a materiality refresh exercise to incorporate insights from the newly acquired Mosaic Fertilizantes business. As part of the refresh process we analyzed reporting disclosures by Mosaic and Brazil peer companies and suppliers to identify gaps in stakeholder groups and engagement methods, material issues and reporting best practices; and to evaluate opportunities for improvement in areas related to targets-setting, prioritization of material issues, external assurance of materiality and sustainability governance. Our goals and reporting continue to evolve as we refine our understanding and identify further significant issues. 25 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE General Standard Disclosures Full disclosures of Mosaic’s management approach precede the disclosure of the respective topic.

Our report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. The content of this report has been shaped by the issues identified through a significance study, the results of which we analyze on an ongoing basis. This report primarily summarizes the activities occurring in the period of calendar year 2019 and, unless otherwise noted, all data is presented on a calendar year (CY) basis. We encourage readers to refer to our 2019 10–K, our 2019 Performance Summary, Environment Metrics Supplement and mosaicco.com for additional information about Mosaic’s performance. This report covers our global operations, including entities over which Mosaic exercises majority operational control, including all its operations and departments that have the potential to generate significant impacts. Except for financial and select environmental data, this report does not specifically reflect equity-method investments, including joint ventures in which we have a minority interest. Please see our 2019 10–K (page F-54) for more information about those investments. This disclosure includes data from facilities we acquired as part of the 2018 acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes S.A. in Brazil. We are also including data from the Miski Mayo mine as part of our Phosphates business since we became the majority owner of the joint venture that operates it following the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. Impacts associated with a joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in which we have a 25% interest are reported as part of our Scope 3 emissions in 305-3. In this report, we are restating 2018 companywide indirect energy use due to an error with one of our Potash facility’s reporting of electricity. As the total impact on companywide total energy intensity and GHG intensity is less than 1%, we are not restating total energy use and total energy intensity. We are also restating 2018 reclaimed water due to an overstatement of reclaimed water use in our Mosaic Fertilizantes business last year. We are updating 2018 surface water use to reflect the addition of seawater withdrawals from our Miski Mayo operations and will report those volumes as part of surface water withdrawals moving forward. ERM CVS performed limited assurance of 2019 total energy (direct and indirect), total GHG emissions (Scope 1 & Scope 2), Scope 1 GHG emissions, Scope 2 emissions, total water withdrawals, and total water withdrawals by source. ERM CVS also performed limited assurance of 2019 total waste data for our Potash and Phosphates businesses. To understand the scope, activities and conclusions of the assurance process, please view the ERM CVS Assurance Statement. Throughout the report, “tonnes” refers to metric ton unit of measurement equaling approximately 2,205 pounds, whereas the occasional reference to “tons” refers to the unit of measurement equaling 2,000 pounds. References to sulfur are in “long tons,” which is equal to 2,240 pounds. 27 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic Management Approach: Economic Performance Since forming in 2004, Mosaic has grown to be a global leader in phosphates and potash crop nutrition. We are proud to be a competitive, low-cost producer with strong customer relationships and the financial strength to invest in growth. And we’ve led the industry in developing high-quality premium products that help growers succeed. We are focused on executing against six strategic priorities: North America Transformation Uncover and pursue new opportunities to improve the profitability and competitiveness of our Potash and Phosphates businesses South America Growth Engine Leverage Mosaic’s in-country capabilities to drive additional growth and profitability Grow and Strengthen Our Product Portfolio Pursue diverse opportunities that make us stronger and that yield mutual benefits for Mosaic and our customers Drive Functional Collaboration and Efficiency Rethink and re-engineer outdated and inefficient processes, and continue to look for new ways to improve Optimize Operating Assets and Capital Management Continually assess, prioritize and allocate capital across the business and make decisions that strengthen our balance sheet Act Responsibly Be a good corporate citizen and contribute to the vitality of the people and the communities around us, which address profitability, competitiveness and our ability to deliver value to our diverse constituents. Mosaic’s sustainability efforts and performance are closely aligned with our operational and financial goals. We respond annually to CDP and use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards with the Mining and Metals Sector Supplement to report on our environmental and sustainability performance. Our reporting index is aligned to many of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics for the Metals & Mining and Chemicals industries. As it relates to maximizing our impact in communities, we believe it is our responsibility to use our financial resources, technical expertise and innovative spirit to help the world sustainably grow the food it needs through strategic partnerships with leading organizations. Our community investments are focused in the areas of food, water and local initiatives. FOOD: Mosaic is committed to supporting organizations that advance global agricultural development, agricultural research and education, and hunger relief for community members in need. These programs, respectively, include: The Mosaic Villages Project in India; micronutrient deficiency research and mobile soil testing labs; and local community food drives, food distribution trucks and school backpack programs. WATER: Mosaic supports organizations that work in watershed restoration, habitat conservation and nutrient stewardship. These programs, respectively, include shoreline restoration and oyster reef installations; improved land management practices and wildlife protection; and 4R nutrient stewardship, which is best management practices for fertilizer application, minimizing field runoff and improving farmer yields. LOCAL: Mosaic supports philanthropic or civic partnerships that enrich the long-term strength of communities in which Mosaic has offices and operations. These programs include local schools, health care institutions, museums; special projects and sponsorship of events; and housing and disaster relief. For more information on our management approach and financial progress, please see our 2019 10–K and company website.

Our operating communities are also our homes-where we live, work and raise children. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor, investing carefully and generously as we seek long-term partnerships with organizations that are making a difference. Mosaic is dedicated to advancing the many ways that our business contributes to the sustainable development of the communities where we operate: investing in communities; hiring employees and contracting vendors from local communities; offering competitive wages and benefits to our workforce; and developing our future workforce. Investing in Communities The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil partner with industry associations, nonprofit groups and stakeholders focused on food, water and local initiatives. We are especially committed to the strength and prosperity of the communities where we have offices and operations, including North America, South America and Asia. Our financial support is magnified by employee volunteerism and community involvement. Hiring Employees and Contracting Vendors From Local Communities As a matter of practice, and in accordance with Mosaic’s global job posting policies, we will “hire from within wherever possible.” In addition, Mosaic initiates and conducts its search for qualified candidates locally, before the search is broadened. Mosaic’s mining and production operations take place in communities of varying size throughout North America. Mosaic does not have a written policy for giving preference to locally-based suppliers, but we do encourage and support local suppliers of all sizes. As a global company, the vendor screening process we have in place ensures that we maintain strict ethics, quality and safety standards. In an effort to support more local suppliers, we engage them, build partnerships, and explore opportunities to build capacity. Our Supplier Code of Conduct and Ethics outlines the standards of business integrity to which we hold ourselves and our suppliers accountable. Offering Competitive Wages and Benefits to Our Workforce Our global talent investment philosophy is to provide competitive compensation and benefits, with flexibility to choose programs that best meet our employees’ needs. Developing Our Future Workforce Skilled labor is a key priority in the geographies where we operate. We work with governments and institutions to help train skilled labor to develop the knowledge required to support Mosaic’s future workforce. 33 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic 202-1 Ratios of standard entry level wage by gender compared to local minimum wage at significant locations of operation Mosaic offers competitive compensation and benefits in each of the company’s significant locations of operation. As shown below in local currency, the standard entry-level wage range is higher than the prevailing local minimum wage for each location presented. For Mosaic, minimum wages are generally not relevant since the majority of entry-level Mosaic positions require a higher level of skills or knowledge than jobs to which the minimum wage rate would apply. 2019 MOSAIC LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE COMPARED TO LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE MOSAIC ENTRY-LEVEL WAGE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE MOSAIC ENTRY-LEVEL WAGES RELATIVE TO LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE $15.75 – $29.80 (hourly) U.S. Range/hr (USD) $7.25 – $10.00 159% $11.59 – $18.46 (salaried) $31.42 – $34.36 (hourly) Canada Range/hr (CAD) $11.32 146% $16.59 – $25.00 (salaried) Brazil Range/hr (BRL) $4.80 – $8.15 $5.20 – $10. 123% China Range/hr (CNY) $10.92 – $12.64 $23.91 – 33.33 219% India Range/hr (INR) $47.75 – $57.29 $158.30 – 302.20 331% Paraguay Range/hr (PGY) $9,967.45 $9,986.65 – 10,946.42 105% 202-2 Proportion of senior management hired from the local community at significant locations of operation As a matter of practice, we will hire from within wherever possible. For senior leader roles, if no internal candidates are identified, a search will be conducted externally to find the best candidate for the leader role. The hire may or may not come from one of the communities where we have a local presence. These candidates are also supported with relocation assistance. In 2019, 100 percent of newly hired senior leaders—all ten of whom were external hires —came from local communities. For the purpose of this indicator, “significant locations of operation” refers to United States, Canada and Brazil. “Senior leader” is defined as those individuals who are responsible for a business unit, corporate function, business unit function, country or operations site; “local community” is defined as the country where our operations are located. “Senior leaders” represent less than 3 percent of our total workforce. 34 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic 203-1 Development and impact of infrastructure investments and services supported Livable communities require stable infrastructure and connectivity. As part of our community investment focus on local communities, Mosaic responds to community needs for welcoming public spaces, hospitals and emergency services, and entertainment and sports facilities that bring additional revenue to local economies. Our investments in this category in 2019 totaled approximately $4.2 million. Here are examples of some of our recent community investments in infrastructure. Florida • Mosaic made a $55,000 grant to Lakeland Habitat for Humanity to support construction and development of Fleming Platoon in Mulberry, Florida. Opening in late 2020, Fleming Platoon is a rent-free planned community, consisting of 30 small cottages. The homes are specifically designed for veterans 55 and over, who have limited incomes and are unable to make necessary repairs to their own homes. The entrance to the community will be lined with American flags and named the Mosaic Honor Walk. • The Mosaic Company Foundation made a $500,000 grant to Meals on Wheels of Tampa to support their More-ThanA-Meal capital campaign to build a new LEED Silver certified facility. Slated to open in 2020, the new building will nearly double in size – from 4,670 square feet to over 8,000 — and allow the organization to increase services from 1,350 to 3,000 meals a day to seniors and homebound neighbors. Canada • Mosaic made a $100,000 grant to Carmichael Outreach to support construction of a full commercial kitchen in their new building on 12th Avenue. The new kitchen will allow Carmichael to serve meals indoors, as opposed to operating as a take-out kitchen for years prior. This new space will also provide Carmichael an opportunity to run their nutrition courses more efficiently, providing patrons with the skills and knowledge needed to prepare healthy, affordable meals on their own. • Souls Harbour Rescue Mission received a $150,000 grant to help build a dining hall in the new building on Angus Street. The space allows the organization to serve twice the number of people and doubles as a men’s shelter each evening, doubling the capacity of their previous shelter from 12 to 24 spaces. • In 2019, we invested over $100,000 in infrastructure projects benefiting local First Nation communities. Mosaic supported water treatment plants, playgrounds and splash parks, and school renovations as part of our commitment to supporting the communities that near our operations. India • Mosaic’s Krishi Jyoti project aims to improve livelihoods in villages in rural India by enhancing farm productivity. In partnership with the project’s implementing partner, The Sehgal Foundation, eleven check dams have been constructed since 2008, increasing water storage capacity to 38.6 million gallons. The project also promotes education among children in these remote villages by providing them a healthy and safe school environment. Krishi Jyoti has supported the renovation of 24 government schools in the project villages, benefiting nearly 5,000 children. 2019 marked Mosaic’s eleventh year participating in the Krishi Jyoti project. Brazil • The Mosaic Institute recognizes the important contributions of public spaces and social centers to a community’s wellbeing and invests in them locally. In 2019, The Mosaic Institute Brazil invested more than $800,000 in the areas of food, water, education and social development, helping fund projects like the construction of a school library in Candeias. In 2019, combined contributions by The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil through philanthropic funding, employee engagement and in-kind donations totaled approximately $12 million. View our global and local community investments on Mosaic’s Giving Map. 35 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic 203-2 Significant indirect economic impacts, including the extent of impacts Mosaic has diverse and varied indirect economic effects on communities across the world as an employer, community partner, taxpayer, and consumer of goods and services. Due to the complex nature of the business and philanthropic activities in which Mosaic engages, we do not attempt to estimate our full indirect economic impact by using a measurement of currency. Here are some of the ways Mosaic contributes indirectly to economies around the globe: • Our customers, dealers, and vendors are all meaningful contributors to the economic vitality of the rural and regional communities where they operate. They provide employment, purchase goods and services, and pay taxes in their own communities. A 2020 economic study by The Fertilizer Institute estimates that the United States fertilizer industry contributes $131 billion to the United States economy. The study goes on to estimate that fertilizer producers, wholesalers and retailers, and the businesses that serve them, support nearly 400,000 United States jobs. • Located in Tampa, Florida, The Florida Aquarium receives more than 800,000 visitors each year. Approximately six to eight times a year, Mosaic barges returning from Louisiana collect sea water from the Gulf of Mexico and deliver this vital resource to the aquarium, which helps support over 8,000 animals and plants. • Libraries connect people to their community by promoting an atmosphere of public collaboration. Mosaic provided a $40,000 grant to Friends of the Library of Tampa, Hillsborough County to build a café space in the new Riverview Public Library to support the Library’s educational initiatives. Located near the Library’s main entrance, the café will incorporate furniture that uses natural elements and recycled/recyclable materials. Additionally, a projected 250,000 visitors annually will view an educational multimedia display that will increase the community’s understanding of the history of agriculture in Hillsborough County, the impact of sustainable practices on the environment, and Mosaic’s contributions in these areas. • The Mosaic Villages Project works with smallholder farmers in India to help break the cycle of poverty, moving farmers from survival to surplus. Agronomic training is essential for these farmers, as they suffer from depleted soils and lack the land-management knowledge necessary to farm productively and sustainably. Mosaic’s agronomists provide expertise to teach these farmers modern methods that increase yields and protect the local ecosystem. Additionally, participants in The Mosaic Villages Project in India receive no-interest loans to buy fertilizer at time of planting and repay the loans through the sale of surplus yield at harvest. Fertilizer acts as an injection of capital to the region, helping farmers break the cycle of poverty that has gripped developing regions of the world. This project has benefited 85 villages and over 60,000 farmers with average 18-35% crop yield increases in Wheat, Mustard, Millet and Cotton. Building off the success of the Mosaic Villages Project success in India, The Mosaic Foundation launched Villages Brazil in 2019, which will support 20 small farmers in Barreiras, state of Bahia. • In Brazil and Paraguay, The Mosaic Institute recognized World Food Day by organizing a Hunger Action Month. As part of the month’s activities, teams organized food collection and distribution events that served socially vulnerable families near our operations and public schools in nearby communities. Over 190 tons of food were donated and the efforts had positive impacts for 18,000 individuals. We also offered trainings to lunchroom employees at 32 schools in Capela and Rosário do Catete, in the state of Sergipe, to promote healthy food habits and food safety. Mosaic created gardens in 15 of these schools that provide vegetables and fruits for lunch meals. Excess produce is donated to nearby schools. • The Mosaic Institute in Brazil also implemented programs to improve basic education, including promoting literacy and independent reading and refurbishing or supporting construction of public schools. In 2019 we constructed one library in Candeias, state of Bahia. We also trained 350 teachers in 200 schools in a program that benefited 4,800 students. 36 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic • The Mosaic Institute in Brazil also promoted programs for local development. For example, we funded a Social Entrepreneurship program, developed in Cajati, state of São Paulo, that supports efforts to build entrepreneurial capacity for local businesses. We also provided funding for an initiative in Tapira, Minas Gerais, that helps communities expand economic opportunities and reduce reliance on the mining industry. • In Brazil, we established a social bidding initiative that provides funding for projects that promote water stewardship. In 2019, nine projects were selected to receive funding and as a result, Mosaic earned recognition for from the United Nations Global Compact related to our actions toward SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation. • Many of Mosaic’s community investments are focused on supporting hunger relief in communities and providing access to emergency food systems. Studies show that children who have sustained hunger have reduced abilities and capacity to learn in school. Access to regular food improves educational outcomes. Through work with the United Way and other local charities, Mosaic’s community investments help families achieve greater economic independence and improve educational outcomes for children. • In Saskatchewan, Mosaic committed $375,000 over 3 years to Regina Education and Action on Child Hunger (REACH) in support of: community kitchens, nutrition and cooking classes, the Mosaic-branded van for delivery of the Mobile Markets. All of this allows families to be self-sufficient by meeting both dietary and financial needs through non-emergency sources. This impacts over 12,000 individuals per year, over half of which are children. Additionally, many of Mosaic’s partnerships with community organizations continue to support positive healthcare, education, housing and recreational opportunities for our neighbors. Please see 203-1 and Mosaic’s Giving Map for more information. 204-1 Proportion of spending on local suppliers at significant locations of information We report on purchases from local suppliers in the United States, Canada and Brazil. For the purposes of this indicator, operations in these areas are considered “significant” since they are in key geographies where our mining and chemical manufacturing, and as a result, most of our supply chain activities, take place. LOCAL SUPPLY CHAIN (PERCENT) OPERATIONAL LOCATIONS 2019 NOTE: Excludes governmental, raw materials, clubs and organizations, employeerelated and freight and warehouse expenditures. Includes as locals in the Phosphate (United States) 87 Phosphates segment all vendors with addresses in Louisiana and Florida, and in Phosphate (Peru) 97 the Potash segment all vendors with addresses in New Mexico, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Phosphate Peru spend categories exclude raw materials, diesel, potable Potash (Canada and United States) 63 water and power and defines local as all vendors in Peru. Mosaic Fertilizantes spend categories include indirect expenditures and logistics. Figures include all Mosaic Fertilizantes 99 vendors with addresses within the country of operations. 37 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic Management Approach: Anti-corruption and Anti-competitive Behavior Mosaic operates in a regulated industry and in areas throughout the world with varying degrees of perceived corruption. Mosaic also has routine interactions with foreign government officials and agencies related to obtaining licenses and approvals, customs, land use and other matters. The risk of corrupt practices exists in the countries where we operate as government officials and agencies are inherently involved in the production, sale, and distribution of our fertilizer products through the related laws and regulations governing these activities. Mosaic must comply with all applicable laws of the United States, and all other countries in which we do business, that are designed to prevent bribery and corruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics demands compliance from our employees and requires any employees who have been assigned a company computer user ID-which is more than 5,200 employees—to complete online code of conduct training and certify compliance with the code annually. In 2019, 95% of salaried employees completed the Code of Conduct certification. Mosaic also maintains a 24-hour independently administered confidential and anonymous incident reporting hotline for all Mosaic employees. In addition, our company conducts a robust risk assessment to identify risks related to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). A robust fraud risk assessment is also completed in the Sarbanes-Oxley compliance efforts. We recognize the significance of the FCPA and have established a Worldwide Anti-corruption Policy. We conduct periodic FCPA audits of selected various geographic locations and respective individuals – including but not limited to: country managers, sales representatives, accounting/finance personnel and supply chain – whose job responsibilities require a keen awareness of and compliance with the FCPA. 205-1 Total number and percentage of operations assessed for risks related to corruption and the significant risks identified During 2019, Mosaic reviewed the following pervasive elements of our anticorruption program: Tone at the Top, Policies and Procedures, and Training, to provide assurance that Mosaic is taking the appropriate measures to mitigate the risk of an employee or representative (third parties) engaging in activities that may violate FCPA or other anticorruption laws or regulations. These reviews were conducted for all our operating segments (Potash, Phosphates and Mosaic Fertilizantes). In addition, Mosaic performed audit procedures at the Company’s operations in China, and, at the Canpotex joint venture. Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index ranks 180 countries and territories by their perceived levels of public sector corruption. We do not have production facilities in any of the 20 countries with the lowest ranking. 38 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Economic 205-2 Communication and training on anti-corruption policies and procedures Mosaic requires all salaried employees (which includes all management employees) to complete the online Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA ) training. In addition to the online training, instructor-led training is also provided to certain employees based on their location and job responsibilities. As part of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the “Code of Conduct”) certification process, which is required annually of all salaried employees, employees are specifically asked to certify as to their compliance with the FCPA in the past year. Most recently, the 2018 Code of Conduct certification, completed in early 2019, had a 95 percent completion rate. View 404-1 for more information. Board members receive the Code of Conduct training and are recertified annually, most recently with a 100 percent completion rate in 2019. Regarding business partners, Mosaic’s service agreements generally require suppliers to agree to follow the Mosaic Code of Conduct, a section of which addresses preventing bribery and corruption. The Supplier Code of Business Conduct and Ethics states that suppliers adhere to the same level as required by Mosaic employees. Mosaic’s purchasing policy requires suppliers to acknowledge Mosaic’s Code of Conduct biannually in writing. Mosaic’s Worldwide Anti-corruption Policy and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics are both publicly available on our website. 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken In 2019 there were two incidents of corruption, in which gifts were solicited or offered in exchange for preferential treatment. In one of those incidents, the employee was dismissed. In the other incident, a relationship with a business partner was terminated. There were no public legal cases brought against Mosaic or its employees in 2019. 206-1 Total number of legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices and their outcomes In 2019, there were no legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust or monopoly practices. 39 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment Management Approach: Materials In line with Mosaic’s principle of responsibility, we strive to be good stewards of natural resources, using them as efficiently as possible. We use various mineral resources and materials to make our crop nutrition products. For example, limestone is used to produce our animal feed products and for water treatment. Sulfur, a byproduct of crude oil and natural gas desulfurization, is used to produce steam, electricity and sulfuric acid, which is used to produce phosphoric acid. We use byproduct heat from sulfuric acid production to generate steam that we use in our operations and to generate electricity. Sulfur is also used in the production of our MicroEssentials® product line. Various micronutrients, including, zinc and sulfur, are key ingredients in our MicroEssentials product line. Ammonia is used in our finished products, diammonium phosphate (DAP), monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and MicroEssentials, and to neutralize the pH of the stack gases at our Esterhazy potash mine. Coproduct and byproduct materials that are generated during the extraction and beneficiation of potash and phosphate are addressed in the waste section of this report. Mosaic strives to improve recovery and reuse of its wastes in Brazil, where the regulatory construct is more supportive of reuse of products such as phosphogypsum, a byproduct of the phosphate manufacturing process. Mosaic products, predominantly fertilizer and animal feed ingredients, are used in agricultural operations. To the extent possible, bulk transport is used to minimize the need for extensive packaging and therefore packaging waste throughout the supply chain. Mosaic supports and helps promote The Fertilizer Institute’s (TFI) Bulk Blend Workshops and Manual, which eliminates the need for packaging of major raw materials or the final product. 301-1 Materials used by weight or volume MATERIALS MINED OR CONSUMED (MILLION TONNES) MATERIALS 2019 Ammonia 1.30 Limestone 0.48 Phosphate Rock 19.1 NOTE: Ammonia consumed depicted in the table above are Potash Ore 32.96 for production of phosphate crop nutrients. Sulfur value Sulfur (Long Ton) 4.49 represents long tons used for our own production in 2019. 301-2 Percentage of materials used that are recycled input materials Sulfur is the most significant recycled raw material in our manufacturing processes. The sulfur used is recovered from crude oil and natural gas processing and then recycled in our plant operations to produce sulfuric acid, which we use to make phosphoric acid, steam and electricity. Our use of this product prevents an excess of sulfur that otherwise could be disposed of in landfills. In 2019, sulfur made up approximately 2 percent by weight of our total raw materials. 301-3 Percentage of products sold and their packaging materials that are reclaimed by category Mosaic products, predominantly fertilizer and animal feed ingredients, are used in agricultural operations. To the extent possible, bulk transport is used to minimize the need for extensive packaging throughout the supply chain. Mosaic supports and helps promote The Fertilizer Institute’s (TFI) Bulk Blend Workshops and Manual, which eliminates the need for packaging of major raw materials or the final product. In any given year, approximately 75 percent of the sales volumes (tonnes) from our business are sold in bulk. 40 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment Management Approach: Water, Energy, Emissions, Biodiversity, Effluents and Waste and Environmental Compliance Respect for the natural environment is essential to the sustainability of our business. From our potash mines in Saskatchewan to our Florida phosphate operations and mining, manufacturing and distribution facilities in Brazil, we strive to optimize our production processes and reduce our environmental impact. Our management of water, energy and greenhouse gas emissions and waste is guided by our Environmental, Health and Safety Policy and commitment to the United Nations Global Compact. Our sustainability targets, progress toward which we report annually, help focus our efforts and track our progress on these key issues. We support a variety of formal and informal Mosaic channels through which stakeholders can submit concerns. Beyond outreach directly to Mosaic, the public has an opportunity to comment on state or federal rules and permits through Public Notice and formal comment periods. Please see 413-1 for more information. Water We recognize that water is a critical natural resource that is essential to the sustainability of our operations, as well as the communities and ecosystems in which we operate. In our direct operations, we consume significant volumes of water in the mining and production of our phosphate and potash crop nutrient products. The primary sources of water for our operations are surface water; rainwater captured within the footprint of our facilities; and groundwater. Our facilities monitor and evaluate water use to confirm it is minimized, and water recycling and reuse are being maximized. Secondary sources of water include water supplied by local authorities and partially treated industrial and domestic reclaimed water, also supplied by local authorities. Surface water withdrawals include once-through cooling water used by our Louisiana operations and sea water used at our Miski Mayo phosphate joint venture in Peru. Discharges from Mosaic’s Florida and Louisiana phosphate operations to downstream water bodies are highly regulated through federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (permits that are administered by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ)). Discharges are monitored, sampled and analyzed regularly by Mosaic, with reports provided to regulatory agencies to demonstrate compliance with permit limitations. The limitations are based on the water quality standards that protect the designated uses of the receiving water body. Mosaic’s Saskatchewan facilities maintain a “zerodischarge” approach. When the discharge of freshwater is warranted following a high precipitation event, it is approved in advance by multiple regulatory agencies. As it relates to the use of our products, crop nutrient products like those Mosaic manufactures have the potential to run off farmland and into waterways, which can contribute to impaired water quality. By preserving the quality of water, minimizing our own water use, and supporting and promoting agricultural practices that achieve the crop yield benefits of fertilizer while reducing nutrient losses to the environment, we are reducing the environmental impact of fertilizers on the global food supply. Broadly, our water stewardship efforts are focused on: • Preserving and maintaining the quality of the water resources we use in the communities where we operate; • Maximizing water recycling and reuse; • Monitoring and evaluating our water use and driving facility-level conservation efforts; • Developing partnerships with industry and government to use alternative water sources; • Reporting performance and communicating with stakeholders; • Promoting the 4R Nutrient Stewardship framework to minimize the impact of crop nutrients on waterways 41 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment Energy and Emissions Fertilizer production is an energy-intensive activity. We use energy and generate direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions in the mining, production, distribution and use of our phosphate and potash crop nutrient products. Since our company’s formation in 2004, we have invested in initiatives aimed at reducing energy use and emissions— efforts that have resulted in operating cost savings and improvements in environmental performance. By improving the efficiency of our operations and promoting sustainable agricultural practices, we are adapting to the potential threats of climate change and reducing the environmental impact of fertilizers on the global food supply. Our approach to managing energy and greenhouse gas emissions includes: • Emphasizing operating efficiency • Maximizing generation of electricity produced from waste heat at our phosphate manufacturing facilities • Investing in energy-efficient technologies and evaluating alternative energy sources • Leveraging our agronomic expertise to promote efficiencies in agricultural systems, which have the potential to enhance customers’ productivity • Advocating for balanced clean energy policy that encourages the generation and consumption of existing, low-cost resources, such as waste heat recovery • Reporting our energy and GHG performance and communicating with stakeholders Biodiversity Protection of biodiversity is critical to global sustainable development and a significant component of Mosaic’s sustainability efforts. In both our phosphate and potash operations in the United States, Canada and Brazil, prior to the start of mining or when extending or expanding a mine permits are secured from local, regional, state and federal government agencies. This exhaustive planning and approval process protects water, air, ecology, wildlife, transportation, safety and other environmental, health, and public welfare considerations. We work with multiple parties to evaluate ecological resource preservation opportunities and to avoid and minimize any harm to state and federally protected wildlife species found on mine properties. Phosphate mining represents a temporary disturbance of ecological resources. Once mining is complete, we conduct acre-for-acre reclamation and return mined lands to productive uses for wildlife and people. To promote biodiversity, Mosaic may introduce certain species into reclaimed lands, such as the gopher tortoise, that may have previously resided on the parcel but moved prior to mining. All introductions and relocations of protected species are conducted in accordance with federal and state requirements and guidelines. Phosphates and potash operations’ interaction with wildlife in the United States is regulated by state and federal agencies such as the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). These agencies maintain lists of protected species for which Mosaic develops species-specific habitat management plans for the proper protection measures are in place. Protection of these species is also reviewed and approved through the Federal, State and local permitting processes for our Florida phosphate mines. In our potash facilities located in Saskatchewan, Canada, our approach to evaluating potential impacts to wildlife includes biological assessments for projects located in new or expanded footprint areas. Since potash mining is underground, such impacts are rare once a facility is in operation. Assessments include field surveys to identify rare species of plants, birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians of special concern that may be impacted. Survey methods follow the recommendations of the provincial and federal agencies. Biological assessments for all expansion areas at the potash facilities followed this approach. We work closely with regulators as to comply with all applicable regulations and agency-approved management plans and to fund and/or conduct research that promotes the goal of wildlife and habitat conservation. 42 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment Waste Large quantities of byproduct materials generated as a result of mining and processing of potash and phosphate referred to in this report as “mining wastes” are managed during the operation of a facility, and upon its closure. We apply industry best practices to manage and reuse overburden, tailings and byproducts associated with our mining and production practices. Potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt and clay, are stored in tailings management areas. A portion of the excess salt generated from potash mining is processed and then used for commercial purposes, including road salt, water softener salt, and use in food grade products and industrial uses. Phosphate clay residuals from mining are deposited in clay settling areas (CSAs) located within the approved mine boundaries. These CSAs are eventually dewatered and reclaimed. Overburden and sand tailings produced at our phosphate mines are used in reclamation and mitigation conducted at the mines. Wet phosphogypsum, a byproduct of our phosphate manufacturing process, is managed in permitted phosphogypsum management systems (“gypstacks”) in the United States. In Brazil some phosphogypsum is stacked, whereas the remainder is sold to third parties for use in agricultural and industrial applications. In 2019, we sold approximately 80% of the total volume of phosphogypsum generated at the Cajati and Uberaba facilities. We store the process water that separates from phosphogypsum during the dewatering process in gypstacks. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations related to these materials. Certain solid wastes generated by our phosphates operations in the United States are subject to regulation under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and related state laws. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules exempt “extraction” and “beneficiation” wastes, as well as 20 specified “mineral processing” wastes, from the hazardous waste management requirements of the RCRA. Accordingly, certain residual materials like phosphogypsum, as well as process wastewater from phosphoric acid production, are exempt from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations. Phosphogypsum and process wastewater nonetheless still are subject to extensive regulation. Mosaic’s operations generate a variety of nonhazardous solid wastes, including domestic refuse, construction and demolition debris, and waste lubricants. Our waste management program provides assurance that all of our locations have a process in place to minimize waste generation and that waste management practices do not adversely affect the environment or health and safety of employees and the public. We endeavor to choose on-site process chemicals that are the least hazardous, thereby seeking to lower risk to occupational health and safety and minimizing waste management implications. Mosaic facilities generate hazardous waste during production and maintenance operations. The types of hazardous solid waste generated at Mosaic’s United States facilities typically include spent cleaning solvents, paint-related wastes and some spent laboratory chemicals. At concentrate facilities, wastes generated during production and maintenance operations include waste that is characteristically hazardous for corrosivity and/or toxicity (e.g., low pH and/or metals content). Each location has an appropriate hazardous waste management system to ensure that the waste is properly and safely disposed. No hazardous wastes are shipped internationally for disposal. We continue to improve our comprehensive waste management strategy, accounting for federal, state and local requirements and to align it to the Mosaic environmental health and safety management system. Environmental Compliance We support a variety of formal and informal Mosaic channels through which stakeholders can submit concerns. Please see 413-1 for more information. 43 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment 303-1 Total water withdrawal by source GLOBAL WATER WITHDRAWALS (,000m3) 2015 2016 2017 2018* 2019 Groundwater 68,270 65,085 78,846 72,847 70,843 Municipal 730 914 7,050 1,296 1,003 Reclaimed (third party) Water 7,515 9,247 9,249 9,888 8,642 Surface Water 224,168 233,512 232,393 301,441 218,550 Total 300,683 308,758 327,538 385,471 299,038 Note: Reclaimed (third party) water includes waste water sources from industry or municipalities. We use reclaimed water as alternative source water to offset reliance on freshwater sources. Surface water includes once-through cooling used at our Uncle Sam, Louisiana facility, and seawater used at our Miski Mayo joint venture in Peru. *2018 Reclaimed water has been restated because of a data error. 2018 surface water value has been restated to include seawater from our Miski Mayo joint venture. Please see our discussion of freshwater intensity for our year-over-year performance toward our freshwater reduction target. One Mosaic facility — our Miski Mayo joint venture in Peru — is located in a basin considered to be in high or extremely high water stress according to the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas tool. However, this facility operates almost exclusively on seawater, which undergoes a process of desalination before it is used. Actual groundwater withdrawals from this facility represent less than 1% of Mosaic’s total groundwater withdrawals. In alignment with our Sustainability Targets, we have modified our water intensity reporting to reflect a freshwater intensity measurement. In setting a water target, our intent is to drive water efficiency improvements across our business and to increase the use of alternative sources. Mosaic’s freshwater withdrawals per tonne of dry product crop nutrient and animal feed production are as shown below: FRESHWATER INTENSITY (m3/TONNE) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Mosaic legacy 1 4.86 4.76 4.85 4.52 4.85 Mosaic companywide 2 6.69 6.66 NOTE: Mosaic Legacy figures do not include recently acquired Mosaic Fertilizantes facilities in Brazil since they were not 1 part of the original target setting process. 2Companywide freshwater intensity includes acquired facilities. For withdrawals and total intensity broken down by business segment, please see our 2019 Environment Metrics Supplement. 44 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment 303-2 Water sources significantly affected by withdrawal of water All of Mosaic’s operations operate using recycled or reused water when possible to minimize reliance on freshwater resources. Our Central Florida operations use captured rainfall as an “alternative water supply.” Groundwater use is heavily regulated and is used by Mosaic to supplement captured rainfall. Local regulations promote the use of available alternative water supplies, such as reclaimed water from municipalities, before groundwater use. Mosaic Florida sites received reclaimed water from six municipal waste water treatment plants in 2019 at an average rate of 6.1 million gallons per day (MGD). Mosaic Florida Phosphates operations do not withdraw water from nationally or internationally protected surface water sources. However, Mosaic has two withdrawal points from springs: Lithia Springs and Buckhorn Springs. This water is used at Mosaic’s Riverview facility. In 2019, an average of 3.1 million gallons per day (MGD) was pumped from Lithia Springs and approximately 0.18 MGD from Buckhorn Springs, representing approximately 8 percent of the annual average spring flow for these springs. Although the state of Florida has over 700 springs, 30 of which have been designated as Outstanding Florida springs and are afforded extra protection, neither Lithia nor Buckhorn Springs are on the Outstanding Florida spring list. Nonetheless, Lithia Springs is a valuable recreational asset to the local community. Mosaic and its predecessors have leased Lithia Springs as a 160-acre recreational park to Hillsborough County since 1957. In the Potash business, water use, including source and allocated volumes, are subject to site-specific regulations and permits. Water used in the operations process is recycled or reused, when possible. Our Saskatchewan potash operations withdraw from provincially regulated surface water and groundwater sources. Many of these sources also provide drinking water for nearby communities, and the surface water sources, including Cutarm Creek, Buffalo Pound Lake and Zelma Reservoir, are also used for recreational purposes. None of these sources are designated as national or international conservation areas. The Mosaic Fertilizantes business does not withdraw from nationally or internationally protected water sources, though some facilities are located near water bodies or regions that have significant biodiversity value. For example, our Cajati mine is located approximately 15-20 km from a Ramsar-listed protected area in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana that contains diverse landscape and animal and aquatic environments. No withdrawals happen from water bodies within this protected area, but we do withdraw water from the Jacupiranguinha River, which is an important natural resource for the region and local community since it is home to endemic species and serves as a source of public water supply for the community. Some of our facilities withdraw from sources in or near communities that are also used for drinking water or recreational purposes. All our facilities are heavily regulated and subject to facility-specific regulations, monitoring requirements and permits relating to water source and allocations. Please see 303-1 and 303-3 for additional context. 303-3 Total volume of water recycled and reused Figures are based on total water used by facility, less freshwater withdrawals.

Our total direct energy consumption in 2019 was 107.25 million GJ. Direct Energy Consumption by Source Approximately 88 percent of Mosaic’s worldwide total direct energy consumption in 2019 was from two sources: waste heat from sulfuric acid production and natural gas. The remaining portion was made up of petroleum products and propane.

Moving forward, it will exclude COGENERATED ELECTRICITY cogenerated electricity from our Belle Plaine, Saskatchewan facility, which PETROLEUM PRODUCTS* produces cogenerated electricity in a process using natural gas. The quantity of natural gas used to create 1.15 million GJ of power at Belle Plaine in 2019 is included in companywide natural gas totals. The remaining cogenerated electricity includes power generated from waste heat from the sulfuric acid manufacturing process in our Florida, Louisiana and Brazil phosphate operations. In 2019, our North America phosphates operations used a portion of steam energy from the sulfuric acid manufacturing process to produce 5.5 million GJ of electricity through a process called cogeneration, approximately 85 percent, or 4.4 million GJ, of which was used internally at our plants and mines. We consider the waste heat from sulfuric acid production to be a direct primary energy source for our North America phosphate operations. We exported approximately 800,000 GJ of power to the local utility grid in North America in 2019. Three of our recently acquired Brazil facilities used a similar process to harness waste heat from the sulfuric acid manufacturing process, resulting in generation of approximately 317,000 GJ of energy for use at their operations. In 2019 our Brazil operations sent approximately 2,000 GJ of electricity to the utility grid. Mosaic looks for opportunities to improve the efficiency and expand the electricity output of our cogeneration assets. Mosaic could have additional opportunities for harnessing emissions-free power under a more supportive regulatory construct. We advocate for a balanced renewable energy policy that incentivizes and expands the generation and consumption of existing, low-cost renewables, such as waste heat recovery, and promotes fairer pricing for third-party renewable producers when selling power back to the electrical grid. 46 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment DIRECT ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY BUSINESS SEGMENT 2019 (%) POTASH DISTRIBUTION 17% <1% MOSAIC PHOSPHATE NOTE: The Phosphates and Mosaic Fertilizantes FERTILIZANTES 63% businesses use a significant amount of waste 20% heat energy from the sulfuric acid manufacturing process, which is accounted for here.

This plan includes strategies for lowering purchased energy consumption through more efficient processes and maximizing use of cogenerated energy. We also emphasize energy efficiency in our office facilities. Mosaic’s Florida headquarters in FishHawk was designed and constructed to Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) standards and maintains its ENERGY STAR certification. Mosaic’s leased Regina, Canada, offices were built to LEED standards and included the purchase of interior design elements, furniture and products, as well as other energy efficiencies associated with LEED. The Regina office was LEED certified in 2017. Similarly, Mosaic’s Colonsay mill dry building in Saskatchewan was designed and constructed according to LEED standards. The LEED certification process for this building is underway. In 2019 we completed behavioral change, energy efficiency, fuel switch and process optimization projects that resulted in energy savings of more than 200,000 GJ. 48 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment 305-1 Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) 305-2 Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) WORLDWIDE GHG EMISSIONS (MILLION TONNES CO2e ) BUSINESS SEGMENT/EMISSION TYPE 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Phosphates 2.83 2.69 2.3 2.56 2.29 Direct Emissions 1.97 1.92 1.5 1.87 1.67 Indirect Emissions 0.86 0.76 0.81 0.69 0.62 Potash 1.90 1.80 1.81 1.83 1.66 Direct Emissions 0.95 0.97 0.90 0.93 0.91 Indirect Emissions 0.95 0.83 0.91 0.90 0.74 Mosaic Fertilizantes 0.05 0.07 0.05 0.88 0.63 Direct Emissions 0.04 0.04 0.03 0.78 0.56 Indirect Emissions 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.10 0.08 Emissions from Biofuels (CO2 ) 0.18 0.16 Distribution 0.01 0.03 0.02 0.01 0.01 Direct Emissions 0.00* 0.02 0.00* 0.00* 0.00* Indirect Emissions 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01 Total Direct Emissions 3.58 3.13 Total Indirect Emissions 1.69 1.45 Total Emissions 4.78 4.56 4.17 5.28 4.58 Figures higher due to inclusion of recently acquired Mosaic Fertilizantes facilities in Brazil.

GHG emissions reductions resulting from the energy saving initiatives reported in 302-4 equal approximately 43,000 tonnes of CO2e, the equivalent of taking more than 8,000 average United States cars off the road for a year. For more information on Mosaic’s efforts to reduce GHG emissions and address climate change, please see our 2019 CDP Climate Change response. The results of a value chain exercise we completed in 2016 confirmed that the GHG impacts associated with the downstream application of our products — primarily potash and phosphate crop nutrients — are minimal. However, Mosaic promotes the use of best agricultural practices, including research and practices to minimize GHG emissions and other environmental impacts associated with the use of crop nutrient products. Further, Mosaic supports the minimization of GHG emissions and other environmental impacts from the global food supply by encouraging stakeholders to enhance their understanding, adoption and promotion of 4R Nutrient Stewardship. Mosaic maintains active partnerships with industry-leading research centers, targeting agriculture efficiency and productivity improvements. In 2019 we conducted 335 small plot trials in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China, Canada, India, Northern Latin America (Mexico to Peru) and the United States. 305-7 NOx, SOx and other significant air emissions CRITERIA AIR AND OTHER POLLUTANTS (,000 TONNES) NORMALIZED EMISSION TYPE 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 NOX 4.2 3.27 2.85 3.25 0.19 CO 1.39 1.43 0.9 1.06 0.06 PM 5.73 6.05 6.09 6.24 0.36 SO2 15.97 16.55 15.77 19.31 1.12 VOC 0.25 0.24 0.2 0.28 0.02 NH3 1.82 1.84 1.61 1.01 0.06 F 0.13 0.11 0.14 0.28 0.02 H2S 0 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.00* SAM 0.16 0.16 0.3 0.34 0.02 HF 0 0.13 0.13 0.14 0.01 NOTE: Figures higher due to inclusion of recently acquired Mosaic Fertilizantes facilities in Brazil.

As of December 31, 2019, Mosaic owned or maintained mineral interests in about 364,000 acres of land in Florida related to our phosphate surface mining operations. These mine areas may abut or contain habitat and wildlife corridors, many of which are recognized on official state maps* as being high in biodiversity. While Mosaic lands are not adjacent to, nor do they contain land registered as IUCN protected areas, many of these lands are permanently protected through conservation easements. Through December 2019, Mosaic owns or controls more than 32,000 acres in Florida that are designated as non-impacted floodplain, high-quality wetlands, and other preservation for which Mosaic has granted conservation easements. As of 2019, Mosaic operates three Canadian potash facilities, all located in the southern half of the province of Saskatchewan, including our solution mine at Belle Plaine, two interconnected mine shafts at our Esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at Colonsay. We continue the expansion of capacity in our Potash segment with the K3 shafts at our Esterhazy mine. Following ramp-up, these shafts are expected to add an estimated 0.9 million tonnes to our annual potash operational capacity and provide an infrastructure to move ore from K3 to the K1 and K2 mills. Mosaic has mineral rights to approximately 616,000 acres in Saskatchewan for potash mining and surface rights to approximately 34,000 acres. Mosaic’s United States potash operations include a shaft mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, with mineral rights to approximately 77,000 acres for potash mining and approximately 7,200 acres of surface rights. Less than 10% of our reserves are within 5 kilometers of lands that have been categorized as protected through mechanisms such as Crown Conservation Easements, IUCN or the Wildlife Habitat Protection Act. It is important to note that unlike in a traditional metals mining setting, potash shaft mining in Saskatchewan occurs at more than 3,000 feet below surface, and potash solution mining requires limited acreage for surface infrastructure. Therefore, the only surface areas that are disturbed are the actual footprint of the mine shaft and the adjacent above-ground processing facilities and tailings management areas. Mosaic operates five phosphates mines and one potash mine, and four crop nutrient production facilities in Brazil, totaling approximately 312,000 acres. Some Mosaic facilities in Brazil, such as the Cajati mine, are located in regions with high biodiversity value. The Cajati mining operations occupy approximately 4,677 acres near the Ribeira Valley region in the state of Sao Paulo. Though not within a protected area, this facility is near a region that is considered to be of high cultural and biodiversity value due to existence of prominent archaeological sites, diversity of flora and fauna and threatened species as defined by IUCN. Similarly, there are approximately 712 acres of protected area near our Uberaba production facility, which occupies approximately 1,438 acres in the state of Minas Gerais. Though not registered as IUCN protected areas, this land and others adjacent to many of our mining or production facilities are protected by stringent site-specific permit requirements and government regulations. *Examples of official state maps include the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s Integrated Habitat Network maps as well as the Critical Lands and Waters Identification Project (CLIP) tool for the Florida Natural Areas Inventory 51 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment 304-2 Descriptions of significant impacts of activities, products and services on biodiversity in protected areas and areas of high biodiversity value outside protected areas Mosaic’s Florida phosphate surface mine operations involve land clearing and dewatering. As part of the permitting process for our phosphate mines, regulatory agencies review comprehensive site survey data and assessment reports to determine and approve temporary impacts to species and habitat. Site specific Wildlife and Habitat Management Plans are developed for each mine, which outline measures to be implemented to protect and manage wildlife, listed species and their habitats, including provisions for pre-clearing surveys and species relocation for less mobile species, such as the gopher tortoise. Other species affected by temporary habitat loss include: Caracara, Florida sandhill crane, little blue heron, southeastern American kestrel, wood stork, and Sherman’s fox squirrel. In addition, in preparation for mining the groundwater table is drawn down for safety of personnel and equipment and to allow more efficient recovery of the phosphate ore. The groundwater level, however, is restored once mining is complete and the area is backfilled. Perimeter recharge systems are used to maintain any ephemeral adverse impact from groundwater drawdown occurs on Mosaic’s property boundary. The typical duration between land clearing and restoration of habitat is about 10 years. The re-population of constructed habitat areas—mainly due to their connection to other habitats and foraging areas, demonstrate the reversibility of the impacts. Because mining occurs in a sequential pattern, while new areas are being cleared for mining, habitat restoration in other areas is being completed such that habitat areas remain available for the affected species at all times. As with any land disturbance activity, affected land lends itself to nuisance plant species proliferation. Mosaic, however, uses aggressive approaches to promote reclamation and mitigation are effective in establishing biodiversity. In fact, post reclamation wildlife surveys indicate that even though the ground surface may be affected for a number of years as a result of the mine process, revegetation and repopulation of these sites with wildlife species is successfully achieved. Many bird species are attracted to the water features contained within the active mine operation and remain onsite throughout the process. These are in part, why the state of Florida deems phosphate mining to be a temporary land use. Please see our website for more information. Potash mining operations in Canada and the United States use shaft and solution mining techniques. Because of the limited footprint on surface features, such as surface infrastructure and tailings management areas, impacts to wildlife and habitats are also highly localized and relatively small in scale. Prior to surface development, Mosaic’s Saskatchewan facilities consult multiple stakeholders as part of best management practices and procedures that minimize risk to wildlife and habitats in our operating areas. Phosphate mining operations in Brazil use an open pit process to extract phosphate reserves. The process is heavily regulated and there are procedures in place to minimize impacts to wildlife and habitats. Each of our mining operations in Brazil has a management plan and environmental compensation strategies that address the locations’ unique biodiversity needs. As an example of our environmental compensation strategies, we set aside a portion of the mining site— approximately 20 percent of the project footprint—as part of our efforts to preserve and protect unmined land. Please see 303-2, 304-1 and MM2 for more information. 52 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment MM1 Land disturbed or rehabilitated In our Florida phosphate operations, Mosaic reports our Florida mining and reclamation activities to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) Mining and Mitigation Program. As of the date of this publication, the 2017 through 2019 figures have not been fully validated and deemed complete by FDEP. We provide estimates of mined and reclaimed acres for those years in the table below. Once we have satisfied all reclamation requirements with respect to mined and disturbed lands, the FDEP “releases” those acres from further reclamation obligation and those reclaimed lands, are then considered “released acres” by FDEP. Accordingly, an increase in the annual released acreage is the result of our satisfaction of those reclamation requirements. Our Brazil phosphate operations use an open pit process to extract phosphate reserves. Once mining is complete, land recovery efforts include resloping and revegetating the mined area. In addition to the totals below representing our Florida phosphate operations’ mining and reclamation activities, the Mosaic Fertilizantes business mined and/or modified approximately 16,697 acres and recovered approximately 2,360 acres in 2019.

Accordingly, these figures are estimates only and may be revised in future reports. MM2 Number and percentage of sites identified as requiring biodiversity management plans All active mine sites within the United States, Canada and Brazil are required to operate pursuant to federal, state/ provincial and local regulations related to management of habitat and wildlife. Mosaic has three operating mines in Florida; all (100%) have both Wildlife and Habitat Management Plans and Wetland Mitigation plans to promote and maintain biodiversity. While Mosaic’s Carlsbad, NM potash mine is an underground mine, it maintains an active migratory bird program. In Saskatchewan wildlife management plans and procedures are used to ensure compliance with applicable legislation, project approvals and commitments. In Brazil, each of our five active mine sites has a biodiversity management plan in place. Environmental Stewardship, including biodiversity and preservation of important ecological sites, is a critical part of Mosaic’s sustainability efforts. 53 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment 304-3 Habitats protected or restored In our Florida phosphate mining operations, we restore or reclaim every acre of land we mine or disturb, with an emphasis on habitat. We report those activities in MM1. Consequently, there are at least as many acres in habitat after mining as before. In addition, environmentally sensitive lands—typically about 15 percent of a project site— are set aside for preservation, with additional reclaimed wetlands and some uplands (such as gopher tortoise recipient sites) protected in perpetuity through conservation easements. For example, a typical 10,000 acres mine site may be composed of about 25% wetland and 30% upland habitat, with the balance in other uses such as agriculture. Frequently—prior to mining— much of this habitat is fragmented or unconnected due to historic agricultural practices. Thus, holistic mitigation plans allow restoration to be consolidated and intertwined — as well as interconnected to the high-quality preserved land — to promote wildlife re-establishment and migration as well as in providing buffers for streams and flowways. Success of these restoration efforts is determined by standards imposed by regulatory agencies, and independent assessments by third party ecological professionals. Mosaic’s Florida business planted approximately 667,596 trees in 2019, reclaiming uplands, significant upland habitats and wetlands. Please see MM1 for information on our reclamation activities in 2019. Mosaic has fostered partnerships with, and funding for, a variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and academic institutions to advance our understanding of the habitats we manage through reclamation. Examples of these groups include Tampa Bay Watch, The Nature Conservancy, Archbold Biologic Station and Audubon, Florida. Mosaic’s Potash business segment is similarly committed to habitat restoration. For example, in 2012, Mosaic made a grant to Ducks Unlimited for $2 million that will restore at least 500 acres of wetlands over a 10-year period in Saskatchewan. 2019 marked the eighth year of this agreement. To date, approximately 439 acres have been restored as part of this initiative. As part of our environmental compensation efforts in the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment, we set aside a portion of a mining site—approximately 20 percent of the project footprint (but in certain cases as much as 80 percent)—to preserve and protect unmined land in its natural state. Additionally, as part of other mining requirements, we complete other environmental compensation actions such as planting trees. As of 2019 approximately 10,000 acres were classified as protected, preserved or restored. As another example of the Mosaic Fertilizantes business’s efforts, in 2019 we invested in wildlife and forest preservation programs in the southwest region of the state of Minas Gerais. We also contributed to efforts to preserve and monitor at-risk avian species including the Brazilian merganser. 54 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Environment 304-4 Total number of IUCN Red List species and national conservation list species with habitats in areas affected by operations, by level of extinction risk Mosaic does not specifically manage wildlife species per the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) List designations, but rather in accordance with rules established for threatened or endangered species by regulatory agencies with authority in the regions in which we operate.

As an overarching principle, water that falls within the active, operational footprint of Mosaic’s phosphate mining and fertilizer production facilities is actively managed, used in our operations, treated if necessary and discharged through NPDES outfalls pursuant to water quality standards stipulated by permits. Discharges are monitored, sampled and analyzed regularly by Mosaic, with reports provided to regulatory agencies to demonstrate ongoing compliance with permit limitations. For our Canadian Potash business, in certain high precipitation events, off-site discharges of freshwater surface runoff are warranted and are approved in advance by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment and the Saskatchewan Water Security Agency. There was one such instance in 2019. Please see MM3 for a discussion of our Potash segment’s brine disposal methods. None of our Brazil facilities discharge directly into designated protected areas.

Of those, four were events related to water quality permits. In 2019 10-K and 10-Qs, Mosaic reports any environmental enforcement action that it has identified as potentially material to investors, or if not potentially material, as potentially meeting or exceeding a significance threshold of $100,000. In 2019, there were no such enforcement actions. Management Approach: Supplier Environmental Assessment 308-2 Significant actual and potential environmental impacts in the supply chain and action taken In 2016, we worked with a third party to complete an assessment of our value chain, in part, to identify the environmental impacts associated with our top suppliers. The analysis included suppliers to which approximately 90 percent of our supply chain expenditures in North America were made, representing more than 3,500 suppliers. Through this exercise we determined that the environmental impacts associated with our supply chain are primarily associated with the purchase of manufactured ammonia—specifically, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing this material. We report those emissions in 305-3. We will continue to engage with suppliers to evaluate and report their performance, while identifying opportunities to mitigate and reduce their individual company and broader industry’s environmental impacts. Another potential impact relates to downstream use of crop nutrient products which, when used improperly, can run into waterways and contribute to impaired water quality and can also nourish algal blooms. Mosaic supports and promotes the 4R Nutrient Stewardship framework to achieve the agricultural benefits of fertilizer and reduce nutrient loss to the environment. Since 2004, Mosaic has invested over $25 million with more than 180 organizations on waterrelated initiatives, including nutrient stewardship. Our efforts have increased adoption of 4R practices on over 11 million acres in North America within the last six years. Of those 11 million acres, over five million have been validated as 4R acres through 4R Nutrient Stewardship Certification and 4R Designation programs across North America. 60 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social Management Approach: Employment, Labor/Management Relations, Diversity and Equal Opportunity At Mosaic, the strength of our business relies on the commitment of an exceptional global team of employees.

We are an equal opportunity employer, and our recruiting practices focus on matching the best possible candidate to the position. Mosaic uses salary ranges that are competitive with market pay ranges for positions of comparable responsibility, functional knowledge, impact and other compensable factors. Gender is not a factor when determining compensation. Each salary range has a minimum or threshold salary for a new hire, although Mosaic typically sets the actual salary above this minimum. 65 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social Management Approach: Occupational Health and Safety We are dedicated to providing a safe, healthy and respectful work environment for an engaged, inclusive workforce. Mosaic’s Environmental Health and Safety Management System, aligned to ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and ANSI-Z10, integrates internationally regarded best management practices into our operations while affirming our ongoing safe and environmentally responsible performance. We strive to continually improve Mosaic’s management system through efforts such as annual selfassessments, which are reviewed by a combined internal and external consultant audit team. Mosaic’s safety management system is designed to identify, evaluate and control risks. This proactive approach allows us to understand the risks, take action and prevent incidents from occurring in the first place. Mosaic’s proactive approach includes targets for risk reduction controls at all facilities which continues the drive toward zero injuries and incidents. Incident management is one of ten elements of the management system and focuses on thorough incident investigation resulting in corrective and preventative actions. Mosaic’s best practice is to communicate incident investigation findings to ensure lessons learned are shared throughout the company. Though rare, emergencies can occur in our business, and the ability to respond promptly and effectively is critical. Mosaic’s overarching approach to crisis management includes risk anticipation and mitigation, site-specific emergency response plans, and routine crisis simulation drills involving Mosaic employees from various functions and emergency response professionals from the communities where we operate. Our internal crisis management intranet site outlines response plan specifics, including roles, procedures, guidelines and protocols for handling crises and communicating with stakeholders. Ultimately, our goal is zero harm to people and the environment. Globally, all Mosaic employees, service providers and contractors are held to the same high standards outlined in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 403-1 Percentage of total workforce represented in formal joint managementworker health and safety committees that help monitor and advise on occupational health and safety programs Mosaic has safety committees at a majority of our global operations, representing more than 96 percent of employees. All Mosaic facilities located in Brazil, the United States and Canada have formal joint safety committees. The role of these committees, which are composed of employees from all levels, is to promote safety awareness and reinforce a working environment that promotes connectivity, teamwork and productivity among employees while supporting Mosaic’s pursuit of an incidentand injury-free workplace. 403-2 Type of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days and absenteeism, and total number of work-related fatalities, by region and gender 403-3 Workers with high incidence or high risk of diseases related to their occupation Mosaic follows United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards to calculate recordable injury frequency rates (RIFR) on a global basis. An OSHA recordable injury is an occupational injury that requires medical treatment that is more than simple first aid. The most common injuries are: cuts/lacerations/ avulsions; fractures; sprains/strains; pain; and bruises/contusions. 66 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social Lost time incident frequency rate (LTIFR) calculates the frequency rate of lost time injuries. This measure is an indicator of incident severity. Lost days begin the day after the lost time incident occurs and calendar days are counted, with no exception for weekends, holidays, vacation or scheduled time off. Though not a global safety metric for Mosaic, we are providing MSHA all-incidence rate to satisfy a request from the SASB Metals & Mining Sustainability Accounting Standard. As reported here, total recordable incidence frequency rate (TRIFR), differs slightly from MSHA all-incidence rate in that it includes the prescribing of medication for ailments. The MSHA allincidence rate excludes incidents involving the prescription of medication except when it is related to an eye injury. In 2019, there was one such incident of prescription of medication that met the definition to be included in TRIFR but not MSHA all-incidence rate. Occupational disease rate (ODR) accounts for illnesses caused by the work environment including respiratory conditions heatstroke or heat stress, and hearing loss. Employees who work in areas with elevated noise in the operational environment are at potential risk for hearing loss. To mitigate this risk, Mosaic uses engineering controls to reduce the noise of our equipment; where this cannot feasibly be accomplished, Mosaic requires the use of hearing protection or even double hearing protection. Contractor safety is also a priority. We select, screen and audit contractors using the ISNetworld Rating – a global system in which contractors and suppliers report their safety performance and conformance to regulatory and internal health, safety and procurement requirements. In 2018 Mosaic implemented the use of the ISN Site Tracker Tool to further drive contractor safety improvements, improve accountability and accurately track safety performance. There were no work-related fatalities in 2019.

Mosaic does not discriminate based on association, per our Commitment to Human Rights, which is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the most widely recognized definition of human rights and the responsibilities of national governments; the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declarations on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Per our Commitment to Human Rights, Mosaic aims to strengthen and enforce human rights in our policies and operations globally, including in our supply chain. 70 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social 408-1 Operations and suppliers identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and measures taken to contribute to the effective abolition of child labor 409-1 Operations and suppliers identified as having significant risk for incidents of forced or compulsory labor, and measures to contribute to the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor Mosaic does not have any operations that are identified as a significant risk for child labor or forced or compulsory labor practices. Mosaic abides by all applicable child labor laws, as well as our global hiring and employment policies. In the United States and Canada we do not employ anyone under the age of 18. We do not tolerate forced or compulsory labor. Mosaic complies with all statutory requirements in the locations where we operate, as well as our own employment policies, including our Commitment to Human Rights, which is guided by the UDHR, the most widely recognized definition of human rights and the responsibilities of national governments; the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Per our Commitment to Human Rights, Mosaic expects all of our business partners to comply with labor and employment laws in the countries where we operate, including laws pertaining to child labor and forced labor. 411-1 Total number of incidents of violations involving rights of Indigenous peoples and actions taken MM5 Number of operations taking place in or adjacent to Indigenous peoples’ territories Although Mosaic does not conduct any operations on, or immediately adjacent to, any lands of Indigenous Peoples, in Canada there are four First Nations reserves (Cowessess First Nation, Ochapowace First Nation, Kahkewistahaw First Nation, and Sakimay First Nation) that are located within 100 kilometers of our Esterhazy, Saskatchewan potash mining operations. In addition, Cowessess First Nation leases approximately 160 acres of mineral lands to Mosaic for potash mining purposes, and Mosaic may from time to time enter into additional agreements to lease mineral rights owned by other First Nations. Mosaic has had no reported incidents related to violations involving rights of Indigenous Peoples for the period covered in this report. In Brazil there are three Quilombola communities—made up of approximately 650 people—residing near the company’s Potash operations in the state of Sergipe. There were no reported incidents related to violations of the Quilombolas’ rights in the period covered by this report. As a legal requirement prior to future Potash project development in Sergipe, Mosaic participated in a process with the Quilombola population to develop the Basic Environmental Plan for Quilombos (PBAQ) of Terra Dura, Patioba and Canta Galo. This collaborative process, as well as the outcome, were overseen and validated by public authorities. An Indigenous community of Mbya Guarani resides near our Fospar facility in Brazil. In 2019, we engaged this group in efforts to help preserve their customs and culture. There were no reported incidents related to violations of their rights in the period covered by this report. We do not have any reserves in or near areas of conflict. 71 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social Management Approach: Local Communities Our local communities are our homes, and we have a vested interest in their sustainability. We understand that for Mosaic to prosper, so must our communities. We support formal and informal communication channels to connect our employees, communities, partners and customers. Examples include our Community Advisory Panels (CAPs) in Central Florida, as well as regional and international microsites intended as open lines of communication between Mosaic and local communities. 413-1 Percentage of operations with implemented local community engagement, impact assessments, and development programs In alignment with Mosaic’s Environment, Health and Safety policies, we are committed to conducting all business activities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees, our contractors, our customers and the public. Our guiding principles—which state that we are responsible, innovative, collaborative and driven—define how we conduct business, how we interact with colleagues, and how we treat our communities and planet. Accordingly, 100 percent of our operations have impact assessment and development programs. We employ a variety of approaches to systematically assess and manage the diverse impacts of industry on the various communities in which we operate. Sustaining Our Global and Local Operations We serve customers in approximately 40 countries. We mine phosphate rock in Florida and Brazil. We process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in Florida, Louisiana and Brazil. We mine potash in Saskatchewan, New Mexico and Brazil. We have other production, blending or distribution operations in Brazil, China, India and Paraguay, and we are majority owner of a strategic equity investment in a phosphate rock mine in the Bayovar region in Peru. We also have a strategic equity investment in a joint venture that operates phosphate rock mine and chemical complexes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. View a list of our locations (65 as of the date of this report). Although Mosaic continues to refine and adapt community investment programs throughout South America and Asia, due to the nature of our business and potential impact, this report heavily emphasizes Central Florida in the United States; Saskatchewan, Canada; and Brazil. Our operations in Saskatchewan, Central Florida and Brazil work diligently to engage local communities. Mosaic’s engagement within local communities includes monthly meetings with a series of CAPs, civic organizations, elected officials, civil servants and other opinion leaders. Mosaic reaches the broader community through print, broadcast, billboard and digital ads, news and social media outlets, direct mail, and public education initiatives. When the business plans to expand operations, we host community forums and participate in public hearings convened by local and regional governments. Assessing Our Environmental Impact Mosaic is committed to conducting and reporting the results of environmental impact assessments. In April 2013, the final Areawide Environmental Impact Statement (AEIS) on Phosphate Mining in the Central Florida District was released by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) for public review. Administered by the ACOE in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act, this process analyzed the environmental scope and potential impacts of phosphate mining in Central Florida. The Mosaic Potash segment conducts regular environmental impact assessments, reporting the findings to the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment. All environmental impact assessments have been submitted and approved to date. Additionally, the Mosaic Potash facilities in Saskatchewan conduct thorough biological assessments of proposed expansion sites, such as the assessments for any new tailings expansions, as well as the K3 site at Esterhazy. Each of these assessments includes field surveys to identify rare species of plants and animals of special concern to identify if mitigation programs are required. 72 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social Developing and Consulting In Our Communities The Mosaic Company, The Mosaic Company Foundation and The Mosaic Institute in Brazil make investments in our global communities through philanthropic grants, employee engagement and in-kind donations. Combined contributions in 2019 were more than $12 million. In 2019, Mosaic operations in Florida committed more than $4.1 million, and operations in Saskatchewan committed more than $4.3 million to enrich and improve communities where we have offices and operations. In Brazil we invested more than $800,000 in local communities. Mosaic employs regional, full-time public affairs (PA) staff to support all communities where we have an operating footprint. Mosaic PA staff are committed to maintaining an open dialogue with the people in our communities, assessing local needs and building partnerships designed to improve community vibrancy for local residents. Independent CAPs help facilitate this work. Underwritten by Mosaic, CAPs serve as a forum for open discussion among representatives of the local community and provide a place for companies to discuss community response to industry developments and plans. In 2019, Mosaic’s Brazil operations completed dam emergency simulations in cooperation with civil defense groups, emergency personnel, municipalities and other stakeholders. Additionally, we engage communities that are potentially impacted or impacted by our operations through programs that build trust and encourage two-way dialogue aimed at addressing environmental issues. Recognizing Indigenous Rights In some locations, there are cultural implications to our business that Mosaic addresses through community engagement. Mosaic recognizes the significance of building relationships with First Nation and Métis organizations throughout Saskatchewan. For example, Mosaic partners with the Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies’ Mining Industry Prep Programs, which are based in Saskatoon, Yorkton and Regina, to prepare Saskatchewan’s Indigenous workforce for careers in mining. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor who invests carefully and generously, and, through working with First Nations and Métis communities, we identify strategic opportunities to target grant funding to initiatives and projects that are important to the growth and sustainability in the areas where we operate. In 2016, the potash business segment realigned Indigenous engagement internally by merging the function within Public Affairs in order to create a more holistic outreach approach. Today, our engagement with Indigenous communities blends community investment initiatives with information on career opportunities, environmental responsibility, and opportunities for suppliers by connecting one-on-one with Indigenous communities and organizations, ensuring the right connections within Mosaic are made. In Brazil we engage Quilombola communities near our potash operations in Sergipe in cultural and educational initiatives aimed at achieving several outcomes: administrative and management training for community leaders and associations; prevention of sexual exploitation of children and adolescents; reduction and avoidance of alcohol and drug use; and support for traditional African festivals. Please see 411-1 and MM5 for more information. Engaging Our Stakeholders Mosaic is committed to stakeholder engagement and public outreach efforts.

However, as with all mining activities, the extraction and beneficiation of phosphate and potash to meet the global demand for mineral fertilizer has the potential to cause environmental impacts. One such impact at our mining facilities in Central Florida is the loss of farm output due to farmland being used for mining. The AEIS noted that Mosaic’s mining operations, as forecast for 2011 to 2050, will have a net positive economic impact on the local economy. Any economic effects from losses in farm output would be more than made up for by higher paying employment and economic activity resulting from mining. Additionally, land reclaimed from mining is returned to agricultural uses once released from reclamation requirements. Mosaic operates in a highly regulated and monitored industry. We work closely with state/provincial and federal officials on operations, expansions and sales to ascertain the environmental impact of industry activities on local communities. Through this collaboration, Mosaic has identified and implemented mitigation opportunities that safeguard local communities from potential negative impact. In Brazil we work closely with communities and local public authorities to communicate risks and safety precautions related to mining dams. These efforts include the formation of action groups that will be trained to recognize and act in emergency situations. In 2019 we completed dam emergency simulations in cooperation with civil defense groups, emergency personnel, municipalities and other stakeholders. Additionally, we engage communities that are potentially impacted or impacted by our operations through programs that build trust and encourage two-way dialogue aimed at addressing environmental issues. For more information on actual or potential impacts, please see the discussion of risk factors in our 2019 10-K. 74 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social MM6 Number and description of significant disputes relating to land use, customary rights of local communities and indigenous peoples MM7 The extent to which grievance mechanisms were used to resolve disputes relating to land use, customary rights of local communities and indigenous peoples, and outcomes In our Potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes businesses, there were no disputes related to the land use or customary rights of local communities and indigenous people in 2019. In Brazil, we offered to purchase private property and resettle a family residing near our Catalão facility. Negotiations were not successful and the matter was ultimately resolved through the judicial process. As it relates to our Phosphates business, we rely on numerous permit approvals to expand our operations or extend operations into new areas. Occasionally, counties and other parties oppose the issuance of some of those required permits by providing comments and live testimony at public hearings or initiating administrative or legal action. We proactively engage in an interactive dialogue with stakeholders, including local communities and interest groups, through means such as our Internet site and community microsites, tours of plants and mines, community advisory panels, town halls, and/or open houses. When significant disputes arise—defined here, for our Phosphates business, as administrative challenges to state-issued permits and litigation filed in federal and state courts—we resolve them through the appropriate channels. For more information on operating requirements and impacts, and the phosphate mine permitting process in Florida, please see our 2019 10-K. Management Approach: Public Policy As one of the world’s leading crop nutrient companies, Mosaic has a responsibility to be actively engaged in the promotion of sound and sustainable public policies. We proactively educate all levels of our employees and government officials on the key issues our company and operations face, our value to operating communities, and our vital role in the world’s food production. Mosaic supports elected officials, candidates for public office, and political committees that are supportive of Mosaic’s mission and share our views on important issues, such as maintaining a strong North American manufacturing and mining base, recognizing the importance of crop nutrients in maintaining domestic and global food security, and supporting reasonable science-based regulation with responsible environmental stewardship. Mosaic is a member of organizations such as The Fertilizer Institute, which represents the public policy needs of the fertilizer industry in the United States. Please see 102-12, 102-13 for a list of the industry organizations of which we are members. 75 2019 MOSAIC SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE Category: Social 415-1 Total value of political contributions by country and recipient/beneficiary Amounts of political contributions are reported based on when Mosaic issued the check, which in some cases may be in a different year than when the check was delivered and reported by the receiving candidate or organization.

MM9 Sites where resettlements took place, the number of households resettled in each, and how their livelihoods were affected in the process Mosaic’s potash and phosphate operations are well established mining regions with 50-plus years of operations. Mosaic purchased private properties near our operations in 2019, but no resettlements of communities in the United States or Canada took place. In Brazil, we offered to purchase private property and resettle a family residing near our Catalão facility. Negotiations were not successful, and the matter was ultimately resolved through the judicial process. As of the date of this report, we are monitoring the potential need for resettlements of households near our Catalão and Patrocinio facilities. Mosaic has community relations managers who communicate potential impacts from our operations effectively to community associations. Community relations managers also work in conjunction with our land management office to address any questions or concerns raised by the community. Our Potash business’s Land and Minerals Department works with individual landowners to ensure the appropriate level of consultation is employed, as is required by provincial legislation and internal policy. MM10 Number and percentage of operations with closure plans Mosaic’s phosphate mining is a land intensive operation. As such, our mine sites must go through a detailed permitting process that involves determination and approval of ultimate closure, post-closure care and/or reclamation of our facilities. View Land & Reclamation for specific details of our efforts. Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post-closure care of our phosphogypsum management systems at eight former and current phosphoric acid manufacturing plants in Florida and Louisiana. Similarly, Mosaic has plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post-closure care of all its Carlsbad and Saskatchewan mining operations. In Brazil we have closure plans in place as required by governmental regulations for the closure and post-closure care of all production facilities, except for one, which is currently under review as part of a lease renewal process with the government.
