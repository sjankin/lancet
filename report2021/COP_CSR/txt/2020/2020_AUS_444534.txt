As we continue to integrate sustainability across every aspect of the Australia Post Group, we have released new and ambitious environmental actions and commitments that are reflected in our 2020-22 Group Corporate Responsibility Plan. This broader Plan now supersedes the 2018-20 Environmental Action Plan. Diverting waste from landfll Management of waste is consistently ranked among our most significant environmental issues, as identified through our annual Materiality Assessment.

We are committed to having 100 per cent of our plastic satchels range made from recycled content plastics by the end of 2021. KEEPING OLD CLOTHES OUT OF LANDFILL We partnered with the Salvation Army and online clothing retailer THE ICONIC to launch an initiative encouraging customers to donate old clothes to charity, rather than allowing them to end up in landfill. In January 2020 the fashion site announced Giving Made Easy an online portal where customers can download a pre-paid postage label to send their pre-loved clothes to the closest Salvos store via the Australia Post network. The Salvos then distribute the clothes to its network of 330 stores Giving Made Easy reduces landfill through donations of clothing to charities where they are sold to help raise funds to support those experiencing homelessness, addiction, emergency situations and domestic violence, as well as those impacted by the summer bushfire crisis. 49 AUSTRALIA POST ANNUAL REPORT 2020 OUR ENVIRONMENT Our new waste and recycling targets We continue to roll out our electric delivery vehicles (eDVs), to our delivery fleet.

These targets expand on our existing commitment to positive environmental outcomes, represent leading best practice, adopt the waste hierarchy, and complement the Australian Government’s 2018 National Waste Policy. Energy efciency and reducing carbon emissions In 2010, when we set our 2020 target of reducing emissions by 25 per cent, our carbon intensity was 64 tonnes of carbon per million dollars of revenue. Today we are down to 40 tonnes of carbon per million dollars of revenue. Over this 10-year period, we have managed to grow our business by over 40 per cent while reducing our carbon intensity by 37 per cent. Although our operating activities will continue to be energy intensive, we have had great success in decoupling our economic growth from our greenhouse gas emissions. Installation of solar panels is contributing to a reduction in our Achieving our carbon reduction target has resulted in both Co2 emissions commercial and environmental benefits. Over the last 10 years, we have avoided over $75 million in costs, mainly from energy Carbon neutral delivery efficiency improvements and property consolidation, and saved In October 2019, we implemented carbon neutral delivery for all over 100,000 tonnes of Scope 1 and 21 CO2e emissions.

Directors’ responsibility for the financial statements The Directors of the Australian Postal Corporation are responsible under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 for the preparation and fair presentation of annual financial statements that comply with Australian Accounting and the rules made under that Act. The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as the directors determine necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, taking into account whether the entity’s operations will cease as a result of an administrative restructure or for any other reason. The directors are also responsible for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the assessment indicates that it is not appropriate. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements My objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, I exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. I also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material 92 PROTECT | SERVE | SAFEGUARD FINANCIAL AND STATUTORY REPORTS misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. • Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion. I communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that I identify during my audit. From the matters communicated with the directors, I determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. I describe these matters in my auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

I have undertaken a reasonable assurance engagement on Australian Postal Corporation’s compliance, in all material respects, with the Prescribed Performance Standards of the Australian Postal Corporation (Performance Standards) Regulations 2019 which are made under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 for the year ended 30 June 2020. The Prescribed Performance Standards require the Australian Postal Corporation to: (a) service 98% of all postal delivery points daily (except on a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday) and 99.7% of all postal delivery points at least two days each week (Regulation 7); (b) deliver at least 94% of reserved services letters to the indicated or appropriate address within the delivery time mentioned for the address according to the prescribed timetable (Regulation 8); (c) maintain mail lodgement points in Australia for the lodgement of postal articles (other than bulk mail) at each of its retail outlets and maintain at least 10,000 street posting boxes (Regulation 10); and (d) maintain at least 4,000 retail outlets at which products and services can be purchased; locate at least 50% of the retail outlets in zones classified as rural or remote, and in any event, not fewer than 2,500 retail outlets; locate a retail outlet in a metropolitan area such that at least 90% of residences are within 2.5 kilometres of a retail outlet; and locate a retail outlet in a non-metropolitan zone such that at least 85% of residences are within 7.5 kilometres of a retail outlet (Regulation 11). Basis for Opinion I have conducted the engagement in accordance with the Australian National Audit Office Auditing Standards, which include the relevant Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3100 Compliance Engagements issued by the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. I believe that the evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. 140 PROTECT | SERVE | SAFEGUARD FINANCIAL AND STATUTORY REPORTS Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors of the Australian Postal Corporation are responsible for: (a) the compliance activity undertaken to meet the requirements of the Prescribed Performance Standards; and (b) identification of risks that threaten compliance with the Prescribed Performance Standards and controls which will mitigate those risks and monitor ongoing compliance. Independence and Quality Control I have complied with the independence and other relevant ethical requirements relating to assurance engagements, and apply Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, and Other Assurance Engagements in undertaking this assurance engagement. Auditors’ Responsibilities My responsibility is to express an opinion on compliance with the Prescribed Performance Standards by the Australian Postal Corporation for the year ended 30 June 2020. ASAE 3100 Compliance Engagements requires that I plan and perform my procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Australian Postal Corporation has complied, in all material respects, with the Prescribed Performance Standards for the year ended 30 June 2020. An assurance engagement to report on the Australian Postal Corporation’s compliance with the Prescribed Performance Standards involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the compliance activity and controls implemented to meet the Prescribed Performance Standards. My procedures included obtaining an understanding of the compliance measures and examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the operation of these compliance measures. These procedures have been undertaken to form a conclusion whether, in all material aspects, the Australian Postal Corporation has complied with the Prescribed Performance Standards during the year ended 30 June 2020. Inherent Limitations Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the internal control structure it is possible that fraud, error or non-compliance with compliance requirements may occur and not be detected. A reasonable assurance engagement for the year ended 30 June 2020 does not provide assurance on whether compliance with the Prescribed Performance Standards will continue in the future.

Our monitor was based on a properly prepared, statistically valid sample of approximately 283,557 test letters. The sample size was determined with regard to information that Australia Post supplied about the postal network design parameters. Our testing involves comparing the delivery time taken for each test letter with Australia Post’s delivery undertaking for the mail path concerned. Test letters represented the full range of letter sizes and types recognised as ordinary mail, posted in locations having a daily clearance to locations having a daily delivery, from small to large letters. They were addressed by hand and machine fonts, reflecting the varied mailing practices of postal users. All addressing was in accordance with Australia Post’s specifications for the proper preparation of letter mail. The letters, as specified under the terms of our contract, were indistinguishable from other mail flowing through the Australia Post network. Our process for calculating the delivery performance was independently audited by Deloitte. For the year ended June 2020 the sample used by Kantar Australia, Insights Division (TNS Australia) was consistent with the sample frame provided by Australia Post. The attached certification from Deloitte states that “nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the results reported by TNS Australia for year ended 30 June 2020 have not been calculated all materials respects, in accordance with the Agreed Business Rules” Results For the year ended June 2020, the monitor showed that Australia Post delivered 97.1 per cent of all letters early or on time, and 98.9 per cent of letters were delivered on time or not more than one working day after your delivery undertakings. Refer to COVID-19 Impact within this letter outlining the impact of the pandemic on the service performance result. 142 PROTECT | SERVE | SAFEGUARD FINANCIAL AND STATUTORY REPORTS Opinion In our opinion based upon the audit procedures conducted, at a 95 per cent confidence level and with a maximum weighted actual precision limit of 0.1 per cent, these results present fairly the performance of Australia Post’s domestic letter service for the year ended June 2020 against the scope provided. COVID-19 Impact The COVID-19 pandemic generated circumstances beyond Australia Post’s control and qualifies as a force majeure event. However, a decision was made in consultation with Australia Post and communicated with ANAO and its agent, that all delayed samples notwithstanding the COVID-19 impact were included in the service performance result for financial year ending June 2020 and therefore were not removed under a force majeure event; impacting performance results from March to June 2020. Temporary Regulatory Relief, in the form of temporary changes to Australia Post’s Prescribed Performance Standards, was implemented by the Federal Government with effect from 16 May 2020 until 30 June 2021; and encompasses extended delivery timing for intrastate letters and suspension of the Priority Letter service.

The firm applies Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and Related Services Engagements, and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Assurance Practitioner’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on results reported by TNS Australia of Australia Post performance metric based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, in order to express a conclusion whether, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the results reported by TNS Australia for the period have not been, in all material respects in accordance with the Agreed Business Rules. That standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Australia Post performance metric is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 involves identifying areas where a material misstatement of TNS Australia the reported results of Australia Post performance metrics is likely to arise, addressing the areas identified and considering the process used to prepare and calculate Australia Post performance metrics. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and consisted primarily of: · Understanding the process used to prepare and calculate Australia Post performance metrics · Independent re-performance of the calculation of the delivery performance metric using data extracted from the Computer Information System (CIS) · Choosing a random sample of invalidated (‘dudded’) transactions, and obtaining supporting evidence to identify for those transactions in the sample, whether the process (as agreed to between TNS Australia and Australia Post) for ‘dudding’ transactions was adhered to. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower 2 145 AUSTRALIA POST ANNUAL REPORT 2020 Survey certification than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion providing reasonable assurance about whether the results reported by TNS Australia for year ended 30 June 2020 have not been calculated all material respects, in accordance with the agreed business rules. Inherent Limitations Although we performed limited procedures on the data provided, the accuracy of the recalculations relied upon the data provided by TNS Australia being accurate, complete and valid, the Agreed Business Rules being current and correct at the time of TNS Australia providing the details to Deloitte as well as the full population for testing. The scope of this engagement did not include providing assurance on the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the processing of data. Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control structure it is possible that fraud, error, or noncompliance with the agreed business rules may occur and not be detected. Further, the internal control structure, within which the processes that we have reviewed operate, has not been reviewed and no opinion is expressed as to its effectiveness. A review is not designed to detect all weaknesses in control procedures as it is not performed continuously throughout the period and the tests performed are on a sample basis. Any projection of the operation of the monitoring processes to future periods is subject to the risk that the procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with them may deteriorate. The conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis. Limitations of use This report has been prepared solely for the information and internal use of TNS Australia in accordance with our engagement letter dated 14 October 2019 and is not intended to be and should not be used by any other person or entity. We understand that a copy of this report will be provided to Australia Post by TNS Australia for their information only. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to Australia Post or to any other persons or users, other than TNS Australia, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared. We accept no duty, responsibility or liability to any party, other than TNS Australia, in connection with this report or this engagement.
