MEGA TRENDS Demographic changes The world’s population continues to grow at 1.1 per cent per year, especially in quickly developing economies, with Africa and Asia expected to contribute most to future growth. At the same time, urbanisation is driving the trend towards densification in megacities dominated by high-rise buildings. This leads to a need for the construction of more homes, offices, hospitals, schools and transportation through new and upgraded infrastructure as well as increased energy consumption. Productivity The scarcity of labour, raw materials and energy across the globe is driving up the cost base in many construction and industrial sectors. This makes efficient vertical access even more critical to productivity and profitability for the Group’s customers. At the same time, Industry 4.0 through automation and big data creates opportunities for enhanced products and services, to increase future productivity for customers. Sustainability The increased global focus on sustainability is manifested in different ways, including the transition to renewable energy and stricter work environment legislation. Health and safety requirements increase the demand for vertical access solutions in both mature markets as well as emerging markets, while also increasing the pressure on businesses to switch to more sustainable products and processes.

CASE: EIFFEL TOWER, PARIS High payload at iconic structure Alimak has delivered vertical access equipment for the Eiffel Tower several times since the 1980s. The iconic structure has more than six million visitors each year and requires maintenance to stand the test of time. Since October, 2018, the Société d’Exploitation de la Tour Eiffel (SETE) has entrusted the concession of the Eiffel Tower’s dining areas to Umanis, led by Sodexo Sports et Loisirs, in partnership with three shareholders: Michelin-starred chefs Frédéric Anton and Thierry Marx, as well as the start-up Ubudu. The new offer aims to enhance French and Parisian gastronomy to improve the experience of visitors to the Eiffel Tower. In 2019, Alimak Group France was selected on a project with Umanis to deliver vertical access for the renovation project of the restaurant “58 Tour Eiffel”, the brasserie on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower. Alimak was chosen as the rental supplier due to the need for high capacity lifting and a strong technical service offering. A building site hoist Scando 650 with the capacity to lift 2,000 kg was installed in an unusual configuration consisting of a t­ riple mast column instead of only one for a standard installation. This configuration allows the installation to reach 50 metres high with only one top anchorage. This involved complex design challenges and installation only during the night, so as not to disturb the flow of tourists. Until spring 2020, the Alimak hoist will transport goods and people for the brasserie refurbishment. 24 Operations Alimak Group, Annual Report 2019 Industrial Equipment Significant improvements in profitability were made during 2019 for business area Industrial Equipment.

The Group’s share of the total premiums for ITP2 at Alecta is 0.02064 per cent (0.01857). On December 31, 2019, Alecta’s surplus, expressed as the collective consolidation ratio, amounted to 148 per cent (142). The collective consolidation level consists of the market value for Alecta’s assets as a percentage of the insurance obligations calculated in accordance with Alecta’s actuarial calculation assumptions, which do not correspond with IAS19. Alecta’s collective consolidation level is normally allowed to fluctuate between 125–175 per cent; if it falls below 125 per cent or goes above 175 per cent, measures are to be taken to create conditions to restore the consolidation level to within the normal range. In the event of low consolidation, one measure can be to increase the agreed price for new subscriptions and to increase existing benefits. In the event of a high consolidation, one measure can be to introduce a reduction in premiums. The discount rate used should reflect riskfree interest rate for the period the company is estimated to have the risk. This is achieved by applying the interest rate for housing bonds with a duration corresponding to remaining duration of the pension obligation. The discount rate based on this method is 1.25 per cent (2.1 per cent). A sensititivity analysis has been performed for the defined benefit plans. If the discount rate were to decrease with 0.5 per cent this would increase the value of the Swedish pension libaility by MSEK 3.0, the German liability by MSEK 2.7 and the UK libaility by MSEK 8.6.
