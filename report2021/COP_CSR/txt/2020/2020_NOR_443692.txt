Further, with this communication, we express our intent to continue to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to further progress, making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company. AF Gruppen will continue to make clear statements regarding our commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. Our annual Corporate Social Responsibility report addresses our progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our suppliers and subcontractors must confirm compliance with the AF Gruppen Supplier Declaration, through which the UN Global Compact and all relevant legislation form integral parts. AF Gruppen has a policy of zero tolerance in respect of any conduct failing to comply with the provisions contained in the Supplier Declaration. We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company’s efforts to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to annually report on progress according to the Global Compact COP policy.
