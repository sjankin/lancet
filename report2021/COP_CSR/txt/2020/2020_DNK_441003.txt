Impairment test for goodwill Goodwill is monitored by management at the level of TPA Holding I A/S as one CGU. The group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment on an annual basis. The recoverable amount of the entity is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require the use of assumptions. The calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a nine-year period. Cash flows beyond the nine-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors Interest rate risk The group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: currency risk, interest risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings related to the acquisitions. Borrowings issued at The group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair potential adverse effects on the group’s financial performance. value interest rate risk. Group policy is to hedge as a minimum 67% of the cash flow interest rate risk on the term loan A. The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge this risk. The Financial risks of the group are managed centrally. The overall risk management guidelines and policies have been approved by the board of directors. The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as Sensitivity analysis written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative Profit or loss is sensitive to higher/lower interest from borrowings and fair value changes of interest rate derivatives as financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.

All other variables are held constant. The groups revenue and expenses are mostly in the functional currency of the operating entity creating a natural Credit risks currency hedge. Consequently, the group treasury’s risk management policy is not to hedge foreign exchange rate risks. Credit risk is managed on group basis, except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances. Each local entity is responsible for managing and analysing the credit risk for each of their new clients before standard payment and The main borrowings are in USD or DKK. Board of Directors have decided not to hedge borrowings in DKK and the delivery terms and conditions are offered. For accounts over a certain size group management has to be consulted. groups main currency risk is therefore related to loan in DKK.
