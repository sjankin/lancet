We created a Sustainability Strategy that involves all departments. We can have a bigger positive impact when we work together and for the same goal, inside and outside the company. We are supporters of a multicultural workplace and have employees from over 12 different nations, which is a substantial number taking that we only have 150 people working at Estanc. We have a Family Friendly Employer badge and by having happy employees we contribute to the happiness of the families as well. We had an energy and resource audit to have a complete overview of our consumption and made an investment plan to cut costs and use environmentally friendly solutions. Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. We received a special award from the Estonian Ministry of the Environment for our environmental management in the 2019 elections of the Estonian Environmentally Friendly Company and were selected to represent the country in the European Business Awards for the Environment which will be held in 2020. Now more than ever, it is important to continue responsibly and in the same path, to fight the climate change. Sustainability is well-rooted into Estanc’s mission, strategy, and our longterm vision. In this Communication in Progress report we will describe what action we took in the areas of human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption.

ESTANC | POST-INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIAL COMPANY 4 ESTANC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 INTEGRATION OF THE SDG'S INTEGRATION OF THE SDG’S Sustainability is integrated to our core business strategy and embedded into our organizations’ culture. We focus our efforts in areas where we can deliver the greatest positive impact. Considering that our products help to contribute to the alleviation of some of the industry’s and world’s greatest sustainability challenges, the core topics we commit to are: ESTANC | POST-INDUSTRIAL INDUSTRIAL COMPANY 5 ESTANC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 INTEGRATION OF THE SDG'S • We launched a Sustainability page on our website. In the Sustainability page we give context of what sustainability means to us, showcase our goals, and promises as well as communicate the practical steps we have implemented to reduce our ecological footprint. This page should also relate to future members of Estancteam, to whom future-oriented sustainable behaviours should be an inspiring topic and being a part of sustainability issued conversations beyond question. • When walking in our workshop, you may notice signs stating which action have been taken under a certain SDG. For example, in our preparation hall, there is a pool where we collect rainwater for pressure test instead of using clean drinking water and we have marked it with a SDG12 sign. • Greatest results happen when working in teams. In the beginning of 2019, we put together a team of five people from different departments to create the A-team of Sustainability. Our intention was to bring different views on the table to come up with creative solutions and create a stronger culture of sustainability across the company. The team mapped out the steps that had been taken towards sustainability so far, set new goals and commitments through the framework of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and developed a Sustainability Strategy for 2019-2022. The strategy involves all departments and embeds sustainability into our core business, helping us to be even more ambitious and responsible in many areas. These SDG’s are showcased in our presentations, production halls and office building to start the conversation as well as display our practices.
