2016 2017 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS Dear Friends, I am pleased to present to you the Progress Report of Kozloduy NPP EAD for the 2016 2017 period. The successfully completed activities over the past period in pursuance of the commitments as put forward in the Management Policy Statement, give us ground to proudly and with due responsibility define the Bulgarian nuclear power plant as a major factor that contributes to the stability of the energy sector with its internationally recognized high safety level of the nuclear facilities, decisive involvement in the environmental protection, and last but not least, with the remarkable expertise of the Bulgarian nuclear power engineers. An unconditional priority in this period was the continued enhancement of safety. In 2017, we presented our achievements to the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) Moscow Center within the framework of the Peer Review and the pilot Crew Performance Observation of the Main Control Room Crews at the full-scope simulator. Thus, we confirmed not only our conviction in the significance of benchmarking and sharing good practices in the safe use of nuclear energy, but also our willingness to continuously improve all aspects of the work process. The lasting trend to a high level of reliability and efficiency resulted in excellent performance indicators achieved by Kozloduy NPP, which deservedly rank the Bulgarian power plant at a leading position among the best nuclear power plants in the world. Undisputed success is the implementation of the long-term operation project of Units 5 and 6. The license issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Agency in 2017 for the operation of Unit 5 of the Kozloduy NPP for a new 10-year period and the forthcoming finalization of the project for Unit 6 lifetime extension in 2018 reaffirm Bulgaria's energy strategy goals to further develop its nuclear energy in the time to come. To confirm our support for the UN Global Compact principles in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environment and anticorruption, in this Progress Report we present our actions aimed at their integration into the management policy and actual everyday activities at the Bulgarian nuclear power plant. The successful completion of the tasks planned for the year, thanks to the good organization, high professional level and the strong team spirit of the nuclear power plant employees, give us the confidence that Kozloduy NPP will continue to operate, as ever, safely and reliably, and will contribute to the achievement of the global environmental goals that modern society faces today.

The results of radiological indicators from the analyses of plant environmental samples in 2017 are within the background levels specific for the region, and no impact from the nuclear power plant operation was found. The human-induced activity levels detected are many times below the permissible limits for the relevant radiological indicators and analysed samples, which confirms that the radiological situation is completely favourable. In 2017, all conditions and measuresin the permits issued to the plant as per the Environmental Protection Act, were fulfilled. All the necessary information, records and reports were provided to the competent environmental authorities. An amendment to the permit for the discharge of waste water into the Main Drain Channel was made. In pursue of the Non-Radioactive Waste Management Program for licensed external organizations for subsequent safe treatment in 2016, 84.3 tons of nonradioactive waste were delivered while in 2017 the amount was 58 tons. The second stage of the nonradioactive domestic and industrial waste landfill entered commercial operation in March 2017. The results from the analysis of 3 000 water samples in 2017 show that there was no upward trend in the monitored indicator values. There were no recorded values exceeding the permissible limits resulting from the operation of Kozloduy NPP.
