ESG Data Third-Party Opinion I was impressed by the Company’s attitude of sincerely as early as possible. I think this indicates the flexibilresponding to expectations from outside the Company. ity to revise material issues promptly in response to The fact that the environmental policy, which was a changing awareness of the issues and progress on revised for the first time in 20 years, will evaluate initiatives. I also believe the Company deserves high and review the achievement level in units of 10 years marks for its stance on making this an open process. Mr. Keisuke toward 2050, is also a good reinforcement to show In this way, it can be said that this report has concrete progress in the future. With this edition, the further strengthened its function as a communication Takegahara Company elucidates the first stage, or Environmental tool by strengthening the connection with business Executive Officer Targets 2030. Measures to address climate change strategy in a way that corresponds to the new mediDeputy Chief include setting the numerical targets of reducing CO2 um-term management plan. What I would like to Research Officer emissions from new vehicles by 40% (compared with expect in the future is the story-like part throughout. Development Bank of fiscal 2010 levels) by 2030, as well as lowering CO2 While maintaining the two-part structure (the first Japan Inc. emissions from business activities by 40% (compared half describing management and strategy and the with fiscal 2014 levels). It is easy to imagine that there second half reporting on overall activities), I feel that was considerable internal debate about the issuance constant efforts to improve the report’s readability, The Sustainability Report 2020 focuses on presenting of such commitments amid the difficult economic such as building ESG data separately from the twonew directions in line with the publication time of the environment at home and abroad, but at this time part. On the other hand, I still have the impression first year of the new medium-term management plan when the post-corona glares at green recovery is that the two-part are not connected smoothly. “Small but Beautiful.” Mitsubishi Motors’ sustainability drawing worldwide attention, the long-term outlook I I would like to expect further ingenuity in how to management system has made great strides during think it is epoch-making that it was clearly stated. As show the latter part, such as enhancing the descripthe previous medium-term management plan, such as a CO2 reduction measure for new vehicles, top mantion of the part corresponding to the strategy establishing the CSR Management Committee chaired agement commits to combine the technologies of emphasized in the former. There may be room to by the CEO and the Sustainability Promotion Departalliance partners in addition to your core technologies consider the need to fit all the information into a ment that functions as the secretariat, formulating a such as PHEVs. It was also impressive that he sugsingle report at that time. As a change of pace in the new corporate vision and mission, identifying Materigested future strategies. back half, personally I would like to see more extenality (material issues). In this report, the “New EnvironAs direct initiatives targeting environmental sive information on the technologies that are key to mental Planning Package” has finally been launched in issues, the New Environmental Plan Package stands furthering the New Environmental Plan Package, the a concrete form. The Environmental Vision 2050 presout for focusing on three points: climate change, R&D investments supporting these technologies, and ents a major direction to contribute to the realization resource depletion and environmental pollution. The strategies related to investments in human capital of a society with zero CO2 emissions, and then sets the scope of the theme of environmental pollution preand other intangible assets. Following the presenmilestone “Environmental Target 2030” that connects vention is broad, and it may not be significantly diftation of the long-term strategy, it is thought that the backcast from 2050 and extension of current ferent from the past in terms of effectiveness, given external interest will be directed to its effectiveness efforts. This clarifies the long-term timeline of MITSUBIthat it is considered to be a high-level concept for in the future. I look forward to further enhancing the SHI MOTORS’ environmental efforts. Having taken this many issues in fact, but it is worth noting here that Company’s non-financial information disclosure as it opportunity last fiscal year to request such efforts, the materiality identified in FY2018 is being reviewed entered this new phase.
