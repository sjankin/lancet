With that being said we launched the DMG Happiness Academy to help our employees achieve three things; a. Happiness Framework and Values, b. Living Positively and Building Positive Communication, c. Leaving the Wheel of Wellness, Goodness and Success. The Happiness Academy is of the utmost importance for the employees’ journey at DMG and so far 769 employees have successfully completed the academy sessions. As port of DMG’s including the employee’s family in the success, there are plans of extending the program to family members to ensure that our Jan. 2020 DMG 3rd COP 8 employees truly gain the maximum benefit as well as help them live a more positive life both at work and at their homes. The program aims to help employees live by the wheel of wealth better which is a a DMG copy righted initiative that addresses the needs for a good wellbeing. It works on four main areas; spirit, Body, Mind and heart. DMG year is divided into the four seasons of the wheel. Each quarter has its relevant activities, events and emails with relevant information and instructions. All DMG premises are branded with the initiative leaving all working places with a cheerful and encouraging spirit.  Activities In the aim of helping employees achieve a happier life DMG has launched several activities and benefits that ensure that employees are satisfied at their job.

These trips are for employees and their families with the same benefits to further develop the DMG community.  ‫ ﺍﻻﻗﺭﺑﻭﻥ ﺍﻭﻟﻲ‬Al-Akraboon Awla initiative This program was started by DMG employees to assist our casual labor in the first place (casual labor are those whom are not officially belonging to the group of companies and are managed by external parties). The program aims at maintaining the minimum requirements of their basic needs. The requester is not obliged to return the money once proved eligible. The initiative supported over 30 cases 95% of the cases covered chronic diseases including cancer related therapies and the rest were directed to other basic needs requirements.

Environment: Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. The Real Estate and Engineering Sector is without question one of the hardest sectors to work in. we have taken it upon ourselves to challenge that and the group began working on several green initiatives that not only extend to the facilities we use but also the communities we are developing. • New Building DMG has moved into a new state of the art building in May, 2018 and while we pride ourselves in the superior design of it, what is even more remarkable is the green technology used in the building. The new HQ for the DMG group is the first of its kind where we have made several technological investments that work on cost cuttings, energy savings, overall employee wellbeing. 1. The new building uses a motion sensor system that operates by evaluating sound, movement and heat. The system automatically shuts off if there are no sounds /movements to ensure that no energy is wasted. 2. The building is surrounded by glass panels that are designed to trap heat in the winter and assist the cooling in the summer time to minimize the use of all cooling devices and cut down on all negative emissions. 3. Only LED lights are being used to minimize electricity consumption. Jan. 2020 DMG 3rd COP 10 4. All energy used such as heat, electricity is controlled by panels placed on each floor where it can be customized to ensure maximum efficiency. • DMG going green 1.

In its recent projects, I city, DMG will use groundwater to irrigate the greenery area of the edible plants. 4. “Curve” a group company partnered with an entrepreneur producing “Compost or organic fertilizers”. Curve financed the project and developed the right technical specifications with the entrepreneur ending with a satisfying good final product that employs almost the population of an entire village. The partnership lasted for almost a year leaving us with a list of “dos and don’ts” to work on in similar future initiatives. • Future plans o All DMGs future project will be powered by Solar panels. o Along with the foundation’s entrepreneurship program we will create a waste management program that caters towards management of construction waste in a responsible manner. o DMG enforces a no-smoking policy in all its premises, where a special area is designated for smokers to keep a clean and healthy work environment. o An irrigation system will be implemented on all facilities where it utilizes water in an efficient manner.
