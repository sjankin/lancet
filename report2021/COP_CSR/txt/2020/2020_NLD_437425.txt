We will do this by disclosing any relevant policies, procedures and activities that we have undertaken.

O 7 DocuSign Envelope ID: 4A6C5E7D-FC09-4BE0-9523-CF364682E087 Human Rights Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and; Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Assessment, Policy and Goals TIP Trailer Services respects the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and is dedicated to making sure that the company is not complicit in human rights abuses. Respect for human rights is embedded in our Code of Conduct. Every business transaction we make must therefore be grounded in a foundation of ethical behaviour. Our approach is informed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the core conventions of the International Labour Organization and the United Nations’ Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen, which requires our employees, suppliers, contractors and consultants to conduct themselves with integrity and to be accountable to the highest standards of business conduct and ethics. Implementation  Our employees are required to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. This legal environment is reflected in our policies which all our employees are expected to read and understand.  The have implemented the TIP Respectful Workplace Conduct Policy laying down the rules employees must follow to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring in our workplace.  We require our suppliers, contractor and consultants to adhere to the same high standards of business conduct and ethics. They must therefore understand and comply with the TIP Integrity Guide for Suppliers, Contractors and Consultants (“Supplier Guide”).  We have established three channels for our employees to report concerns about incidents that have occurred in the workplace. They can raise a formal complaint with Human Resources or Compliance. The third channel consists of an informal network of Ombudspersons who are trained in remaining impartial and in keeping confidentiality.  We have implemented a new incident reporting mechanism that is expected to be launched in Q1 2020. This platform is independent from TIP’s management and 8 DocuSign Envelope ID: 4A6C5E7D-FC09-4BE0-9523-CF364682E087 enables our employees to reach out to the familiar three channels by phone or by filling out an online report form (anonymously if allowed by local law).

That includes observing applicable laws in the relevant jurisdictions in which we operate that relate to: freedom of association; privacy; labour relations; the prohibition of forced, compulsory and child labour; immigration; working time and other wage-hour laws; and employment discrimination. Beyond legal compliance, we strive to create an environment considerate of all employees where TIP business is being conducted. We are strongly committed to developing diversity among our leadership. In nominating candidates for our Boards, we support the trend towards higher participation of women. However, we do so without compromising the company’s commitment to hiring the best individuals without discrimination.
