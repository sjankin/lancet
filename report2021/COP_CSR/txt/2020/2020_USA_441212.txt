2019 Corporate Responsibility Report OUR VALUES IN ACTION CONTENTS Message from Dear Fellow Stakeholder: Bob Sulentic As this report is being ﬁnalized in May 2020, the world remains gripped by [102-14] COVID-19, though we are encouraged by recent signs that the public health crisis may be easing. We express our sympathies to everyone who has been adversely aﬀected and our thanks to those on the front lines of the battle with this disease. Throughout the crisis, we have placed a priority on the well-being of our people, clients, suppliers and communities. The pandemic is the ﬁrst global humanitarian challenge since CBRE signed the Business Roundtable Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation in August 2019. The Statement acknowledged CBRE’s responsibility to our communities, alongside clients, employees, suppliers and shareholders, as essential to the way we do business. The devasting public health and economic eﬀects of COVID-19 have presented CBRE with an unfortunate opportunity to put our community commitment into action. Our people have stepped up to help clients navigate COVID-19's challenges and also answered the call within their communities. Please visit United. We Rise. to read some of their stories. We also organized the largest fundraising campaign in CBRE’s history, CBRE’s recognizing that our corporate response, like the challenge facing the world, needed to be unprecedented. In total, we raised $15.3 million for COVID-19 relief eﬀorts (exceeding our $15 million goal), thanks to the generosity of our people and a substantial company contribution. These funds are supporting organizations doing vital work in communities worldwide, and through our newly formed Employee Resilience Fund, our CBRE colleagues who are struggling ﬁnancially due to the pandemic. Throughout this report, we detail many other ways we are advancing our obligations to our stakeholders. Our continued progress is being recognized by third-party authorities, such as Barron’s, which placed CBRE #13 on its Most Sustainable Companies list, S&P Dow Jones, which included us in Responsibility its Sustainability World Index, and Bloomberg, which named us to its Gender-Equality Index. Finally, in this report, we aﬃrm CBRE’s support for the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) for the 13th year in a row. We invite you to read further to learn more about our many corporate responsibility initiatives. We regard these practices as vital to our company’s purpose and ongoing success. We hope that you and your families stay safe and well. Robert E.
