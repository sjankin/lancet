As an independent, employee-owned global U.K. Department for International Development and development company, our mission is to make a lasting Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the European difference in the world by helping people improve their Commission and European Bank for Reconstruction and lives. We envision a world in which communities and Development. societies become more prosperous, fairer and better governed, safer, healthier, and environmentally more We are also doing fascinating work with the World Bank sustainable. Integral to that mission is a commitment (piloting development impact bonds in Palestine), the to uphold human rights and labor standards, promote U.K. Department of Health and Social Care’s Fleming environmental responsibility, and combat corruption in Fund (fighting antimicrobial resistance in Bangladesh, all its forms.

Historically, development agencies have little experience bridging the investment and development domains, structuring transactions, or sourcing deals. But under DAI’s management, INVEST is creating a network of partners with the expertise to close this gap, enabling USAID to target distinct development challenges with tailored finance solutions. By the fall of 2019, that network of 195 development and investment entities had mobilized $68 million of private capital, with an additional $377 million in the pipeline. These are impressive numbers, but we are measured not only by what we achieve but how we achieve it. We strive to offer value and to live by our cardinal values of integrity, responsibility, excellence, and global citizenship. We have an obligation to treat everyone our work touches with dignity and respect, especially if they are somehow vulnerable or dependent on DAI for assistance or support. DAI has for years maintained a robust Ethics and Compliance department to ensure that we live up to this ideal, and in 2019 we augmented this team by appointing a Global Director of Safeguarding who oversees DAI’s efforts to establish, enforce, and embody a culture of zero tolerance for sexual abuse and harassment. We will make safeguarding a point of emphasis in 2020 and beyond. In the pages that follow, we provide snapshots of DAI projects spanning the 17 SDGs—from facilitating clean energy finance in Morocco and creating safe learning spaces in Honduran schools to energizing the agricultural economy in Bangladesh’s Southern Delta and helping women meet the critical need for health workers and midwives in northern Nigeria. James Boomgard In these as in all of our endeavors, we remain committed President and CEO to shaping a more livable world in the spirit of the UN Global Compact and its underlying principles.

Global in reach and outlook—fielding 700 corporate and 5,000 project staff—we are delivering development results on roughly 200 projects in some 100 countries, from stable societies and high-growth economies to challenging environments racked by political or military conflict, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, Libya, and Somalia. In late 2019, DAI acquired the distinguished European consulting firm Human Dynamics, a pre-eminent supplier of international development services to the European Commission, further extending our reach and enhancing our ability to support the SDGs. Our tagline (“shaping a more livable world”) speaks to a mission that is unchanged since our founding in 1970: helping people improve their lives. We work for international development agencies, private corporations, and philanthropies to tackle fundamental social and economic development problems. DAI is perennially one of the leading partners for the world’s leading bilateral and multilateral aid donors. Current clients include the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the European Commission (EC), the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the U.K. Department of Health and Social Care, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the French Development Agency, the World Bank, the MacArthur Foundation, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, in addition to various private corporations.

Surveys showed these women found kitchen gardening enjoyable. Some sold surplus produce at markets to earn income while saving money by growing food themselves. Formerly unproductive land was turned to productive use. Supported by men and community elders, nearly all the women were still maintaining their gardens by the project’s end. RADP-North worked in the provinces of Badakhshan, Baghlan, Balkh, Jawzjan, Kunduz, and Samangan—home to 5 million people—where drought and conflict in recent decades have sapped the region. It resuscitated the agriculture economy by introducing high-value fruit, nut, and vegetable crops and rejuvenated the struggling livestock sector. 14 DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019 PHOTOS COURTESY: USAID AFGHANISTAN RADP-NORTH IMPACT $8.3M $28M OF CONFIRMED SALES IN INCREASED PROFITS and $20 million in followup by partner orders for dried fruit and agribusinesses $10.7M nuts achieved through beneficiaries’ attendance at tradeshows IN INCREASED VALUE OF LIVESTOCK nearly achieved by reducing mortality, increasing reproduction, and selling 7,700 20,000 WOMEN TRAINED IN more animal byproducts KITCHEN NUTRITION GARDENS ESTABLISHED DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019 15 NIGERIA SUPPORTING WOMEN HEALTH WORKERS Northern Nigeria suffers high rates of under-5 child mortality, with up to 90 percent of pregnant women delivering babies without a skilled birth Well trained attendant.

In 2019, a DAIimplemented solar energy financing project for the industrial park was selected for the 2019 World Bank President’s Award for Excellence. The $11.2 million financing package—comprised of a grant through the World Bank’s Finance for Jobs program, a loan from the International Finance Corporation, and political risk insurance from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency—was honored for adopting a collaborative approach and overcoming risks presented by Gaza’s legal and operating environment to ensure the project’s financial sustainability. The increased energy supply will enable expanded production and the creation of approximately 800 new jobs in food, wood, metals, and other business sectors operating in the park. The 7-megawatt, 57,000-square-meter rooftop photovoltaic system is scheduled to be operational by year’s end. It will mark the largest solar array in the West Bank and Gaza and first privately financed infrastructure project in a decade in Gaza.

This adverse environment causes uncertainty and increased investment risk, greatly limiting enterprise development. Two recently completed DAI-led projects in Palestine helped spur the entrepreneurship and job creation needed to promote sustained economic growth, higher levels of productivity, and technological innovation. Launched in 2011, USAID’s Palestine Compete project assisted nearly 1,800 firms in areas such as business planning, access to finance, technology, and marketing.

Oman defines ICV as value that is retained in-country that can support local business development, develop Oman is human capability, and stimulate productivity in the Omani economy: “In short, products made and services provided by skilled Omanis.” looking to The country’s pioneering work to enhance ICV has heretofore focused diversify its on its extensive petroleum and natural gas industry. But today, Oman is looking to diversify its economy and reduce dependence on the production economy and export of fossil fuels. Under the mandate of the late Sultan Qaboos, Oman is committed to economic diversification and increased employment and reduce opportunities for Omanis beyond oil and gas. And the government and private sector are coming together to instill the ethos of ICV across Oman’s dependence on entire economy. the production In 2019, DAI launched a study on behalf of public and private sector partners in Oman to help develop a comprehensive national strategy that and export of extends and optimizes ICV principles outside of the oil and gas industry. fossil fuels. Data is key to the success of this strategy. Currently working in two of 10 target sectors, DAI is engaging with the Government of Oman and private sector stakeholders to develop a methodology that will allow for rigorous data collection and analytical work. We will then integrate this analysis into a recommendation for the National ICV Strategy. DAI is also partnering with an Omani conglomerate to design and implement its 2020 corporate social investment initiative, which is intended to nurture a passion for science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics (STEAM) among Omani youth and to support Oman’s next generation of STEAM innovators and leaders. Working with industry-leading technology vendors to create a tailored curriculum, DAI will manage STEAM Centers that serve schools and children throughout the Sultanate. 30 DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019 In 2019, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) selected DAI to develop the first phase of a multisector in-country value strategy for Oman.

It identifies key constraints to job creation and income growth and develops socially and environmentally responsible strategies to tackle these constraints and reduce inequalities in income and opportunity. The planned impact is to create 45,000 jobs (75 percent for women) and increase incomes for 65,000 poor households. Among its activities, Enterprise Partners is facilitating access to finance for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), directly benefitting 11,000 MSMEs; supporting sustainable cotton and textile production, and linkages with the manufacturing industry; addressing competitiveness challenges in the leather sector; expanding access to improved inputs and good agronomic practices for fruit and vegetable farmers; and addressing labor market constraints in Ethiopia’s booming industrial parks. In its advocacy work, Enterprise Partners has helped to change 10 rules and regulations in favor of access to markets, access to finance, and job creation. It has directly linked 20,000 workers to employment—90 percent of them women—thereby increasing their income, expanding their opportunities, and helping to reduce inequality. Enterprise Partners has facilitated $21 million in sales and $245 million in investment by promoting high-value business models premised on corporate social responsibility and better business relations among industry actors and government. 32 DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019 IMPACT $21M in sales and $245M in investment facilitated by promoting highvalue business models premised on corporate social responsibility and better business relations among industry actors and government 10 PHOTOS COURTESY: DFID ETHIOPIA ENTERPRISE PARTNERS PROGRAMME RULES AND REGULATIONS CHANGED 11,000 in favor of access to markets, access to finance, and job creation MSMES with access to 20,000 finance WORKERS directly linked to employment (90% of them women), increasing their income, expanding their opportunities, and helping to reduce inequality DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019 33 INDONESIA TACKLING THE SAFE WATER AND SANITATION CHALLENGE IN CITIES Better management of urban growth will be crucial to guarantee sustainable cities. It is not uncommon for citizens in and around Indonesia’s major cities to spend up to two hours a day transporting expensive water to their homes for drinking and cooking. In addition, a lack of sewage and wastewater infrastructure in many densely populated, low-income areas leads to tainted ground and surface water, creating serious health risks from waterborne diseases. USAID’s Indonesia Urban Water, Sanitation and Hygiene—Penyehatan Lingkungan untuk Semua, or Environmental Health for All, (IUWASH PLUS) project and its predecessor, IUWASH, have brought reliable water supply to more than 3 million people and safely managed sanitation services to more 230,000 city dwellers. The IUWASH PLUS team works with civil society groups and local governments to mobilize demand for improved drinking water and sanitation services, as well as to build the capacity of private businesses, utilities, and national programs to provide these services in a fair and sustainable fashion.

In West Africa, Liberia contains more than half of the region’s remaining rainforest, covering more than 40 percent of the country—some 4.3 million hectares. Support to the implementation of the FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreement (FLEGT VPA) has helped to align Liberia’s government, private sector, and forest communities around responsible forest management. Funded by DFID, the EU, and the Norwegian Government, this DAI-led assistance is increasing the value of traded timber products, strengthening forest law enforcement and governance, and promoting more equitable sharing of forest benefits.

APIK works at the national level and in three provinces—East Java, Southeast Sulawesi, and Maluku—selected because they represent distinct landscapes that are common across Indonesia, specifically a large watershed, coastal areas, and small islands.

Charged with upholding DAI’s culture of zero tolerance for sexual abuse and harassment, the Global Director of Safeguarding ensures that DAI staff can readily raise issues of sexual abuse and do so confident in the expectation that DAI will listen with sensitivity and discretion, investigate allegations promptly and fairly, protect the complainant from repercussions or retaliation, and take decisive action to address any wrongdoing. A qualified barrister and a former Senior Human Rights Adviser for DFID, Maguire is well versed in the issues of safeguarding, sexual abuse, and harassment. She presented on safeguarding at DFID’s suppliers conference in September 2019, for example, and contributed substantially to DFID’s October 2019 report, Safeguarding in the Aid Sector. Maguire—who has led human rights and justice sector programs for DAI in Kenya, Pakistan, and Sierra Leone—also served as lead author on ActionAid UK’s April 2019 positioning paper on violence against women and girls. The Justice Deficit: A Global Overview aims to deepen and develop global positions, policy, and advocacy work on violence against women and girls, and offers policy recommendations for national governments and international donors. It focuses on the role played by the justice system in preventing and responding to this prevalent form of human rights abuse. Safeguarding is of the highest priority for DAI. As DFID Secretary of State Alok Sharma said in introducing his department’s October report, “If we do not get things right on safeguarding, and ensure the protection of the most vulnerable, then we fail in our ultimate goal to support the world’s poorest and jeopardize all the positive work aid does.” DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019 49 HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLE 1: DAI treats all human beings with dignity, fairness, and respect, and upholds these fundamental Businesses should human rights both in the workplace and through its work in the international development support and respect sector.

In addition, DAI is conscious about the choice of our partners globally and engages only with vendors, suppliers, consultants, subcontractors, grantees, and clients who operate in compliance with human rights laws and in accord with DAI’s Code. DAI fully supports the prevention and prohibition of human trafficking and forced labor, and complies with U.S. and U.K. government laws and regulations as well as cooperating country laws and regulations around the world to prevent modern slavery, human trafficking, and forced or child labor. This compliance and commitment is also a pre-requisite of any subcontract or partnership into which DAI may enter. Furthermore, our employees and consultants are duty-bound to report any instances of child labor and human trafficking we may encounter in our work across the globe. Among various project-level initiatives on human rights, DAI was contracted in 2019 to perform the Final Evaluation of Human Rights Programmes in Georgia by the European Union, under its Services for the Implementation of External Aid Framework Lot 3: Human Rights, Democracy, and Peace.

In 2019, through USAID’s Honduras Unidos por la Justicia (United for Justice), DAI assisted human rights defenders to improve reporting and investigation of human rights violations; provided 25 grants to local organizations to strengthen the rights of vulnerable populations; and supported internships for at-risk youth. Unidos also provides institutional strengthening to the Public Prosecutor’s office and the Office of the Special Prosecutor for Human Rights to streamline the handling of human rights cases and is developing web-based tools to support data collection by the Human Rights Observatory. Created by the Ministry of Human Rights, the observatory will function as an early warning system for social conflicts related to civil, cultural, social, economic, environmental, and political rights, especially those of vulnerable groups. Also, Unidos provided training on human rights to 90 business leaders and worked on the development of a human rights policy for businesses.

Crucially, LIFT simultaneously promotes environmental sustainability because a key outcome of better tenure security—evidenced across several countries—is that smallholders with secure stakes in their land are more likely to invest in it, particularly through long-term, more sustainable agricultural investments such as perennial crops and trees, which boost the long-term fertility of the soil.

All DAI staff must complete mandatory annual training on ethics and provide a written certification that they have reviewed, understood, and agree to comply with DAI’s Code. DAI has an ethics hotline where staff can anonymously report suspected violations and a strict non-retaliation policy against anyone who makes a good-faith report of ethics or compliance concerns. Additionally, DAI publishes a regular newsletter on ethics quoting encountered and adapted case studies from our collective experiences to enhance our learning across the globe. DAI’s Ethics and Compliance Officers monitor ethical issues and their timely resolution. An analysis of this information is provided to the Global Ethics and Compliance Committee, which responds to changing vulnerabilities and trends through updates to training, communications, policies, and practices. The Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer reports regularly to DAI’s Board. Among DAI’s various field activities to combat corruption in 2019 are USAID projects active in Guatemala, Kosovo, Ukraine, and Sri Lanka:  In Guatemala, the Fiscal and Procurement Reform Project has helped the government launch its general registry of government providers (RGAE), which pre-qualifies persons and firms to provide goods, services, and infrastructure to the Government of Guatemala. The RGAE upholds international standards of legal and technical registration, and reduces opportunities for fictitious persons and firms to bid on government contracts. In the first nine months of implementation, the RGAE saw a nearly eight-fold increase in registered providers.  Similarly, the Transparent, Effective, and Accountable Municipalities (TEAM) Activity helped the Government of Kosovo shift in 2019 from manual, paper-based procurement to a fully electronic process. Requiring all companies to submit their bids online brings transparency to public procurement. Previously, citizens, civil society organizations, and watchdog groups had difficulty accessing contracts for public works, services, or goods, but in 2019 TEAM helped the government amend legislation requiring all contracting authorities to publish pdf scans of their contracts on the e-Procurement platform. Today, more than 12,000 public contracts are available to citizens online. 58 DAI UNGC Communication on Progress 2019  In 2019, the Financial Sector Transformation project was instrumental in the adoption of two financial sector laws that will have a fundamental impact on anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. The Base Erosion and Profit Shifting law removes loopholes in international tax regulation that allow companies to conceal their profits and avoid taxation through PHOTOS COURTESY:USAID KOSOVO TEAM PROJECT moving them into low-tax countries. The Anti-Money Laundering law introduces a new risk-based approach to combat money laundering, increases penalties and executive discretion to level fines and open investigations, and achieves compatibility with Financial Action Task Force recommendations and European Directives on money laundering. Both laws are expected to be passed by Parliament by the end of 2019.  In response to the UN Convention against Corruption, the Strengthening Democratic Governance and Accountability Project (SDGAP) worked with Sri Lanka’s Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) to develop a policy that informs the National Action Plan for Combating Bribery and Corruption. The consultative process spanned nine months across all nine provinces of Sri Lanka, culminating in a launch of the plan attended by 1,000 senior-level partners. SDGAP also supported CIABOC in drafting a consolidated law addressing bribery, corruption, and asset declaration.
