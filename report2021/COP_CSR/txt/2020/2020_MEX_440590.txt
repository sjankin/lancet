This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Core option and has added content and information resulting from requests from our material topics and stakeholders. We adhere to the best reporting practices considering the GRI Reporting Principles for defining report content and quality: sustainability context, materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, completeness, accuracy, balance, clarity, comparability, reliability and timeliness. The Sustainability and Corporate Communications Department, which reports directly to the Chief Sustainability, Corporate and Public Affairs Officer, has prepared this Report. In this document we share our achievements and challenges for 2019; we present our vision on economic, social and environmental issues; and, we summarize material information relative to the period from January 1 to December 31, 2019 – both for the Gas segment and for the Power segment. Our Report includes the Company’s activities dedicated to transport and store natural gas, LPG and ethane; to store liquefied natural gas; to distribute natural gas; and, to generate power through the combined-cycle plant and our wind farms and solar parks. The document does not include disclosures on the storage terminals that are under construction or under development – these will be included in the Report once they commence operations. Health and safety contents include information on operating assets and projects under construction, unless otherwise indicated. Throughout the Report, we describe the formulas used to calculate figures and specify the operating units on which we report the information, as well as any change in measurement with respect to the information reported in previous years. All figures in this Report are expressed in US dollars; and, unless otherwise indicated, the exchange rate used in the conversions is $18.8452 pesos for USD$1. Figures reported with no decimal points in the report, unless otherwise indicated, were rounded off. The numbers were rounded up above 0.5 and rounded down below 0.5. Given that IEnova has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2015, this Report constitutes our fifth Communication on Progress (COP). We include herein the progress we have made regarding the Ten Principles and our contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 180 BEYOND ENERGY I EN OVA 181 INDEPENDENT ASSU RAN CE REP O RT [102-56] 182 BEYOND ENERGY I EN OVA 183 GRI CONTENT INDEX [102-55] DISCLOSURE DISCLOSURE INDEPENDENT NUMBER TITLE PAGE AND/OR DIRECT RESPONSE OMISSIONS ASSURANCE 102-16 Values, principles, 15, 76-83 standards, and norms of behavior 10217 Mechanisms for advice and 78-83 Yes, concerns about ethics pages 182, 183 102-18 Governance structure 49, 66-72 102-19 Delegating authority 49 102-20 Executive-level 49 responsibility for The Chief Sustainability, Corporate and For the Materiality Disclosures Service, GRI Services reviewed that the economic, environmental, Public Affairs Officer chairs the GRI content index is clearly presented and the references for Disclosures and social topics Sustainability Committee which, according to its bylaws, reports to the 102-40 to 102-49 align with appropriate sections in the body of the report.
