Here, we present a selection of more specific consumer and lifestyle trends that impact how Nobia develops new products and kitchen concepts.

ANTON ÖBERG, INSIGHT MANAGER TRENDS 1 HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE HOUSING Today, health is no longer only about exercise and diets but also the home environment and interior decoration. Awareness of the impact of our homes on our physical and mental well-being is increasing among construction companies, architects and interior designers as well as consumers. The healthy home covers a number of aspects, several of which go hand in hand with sustainability. Indoor air quality, for example, 2 NEAT AND TIDY or the occurrence of noise and irritating sounds – and not least the use of sustainable materials that have a With continued high levels of conpositive impact on people and the sumption , a lack of storage is an environment. increasing problem for many household. More and more people are getting rid of unnecessary items to create a sense of order in their homes and simplify their lives. But wardrobes, kitchen cabinets and drawers are still not enough for many households. That is why it is becoming increasingly important for interior design companies and kitchen manufacturers to develop space-efficient and smart storage solutions that help people keep their daily lives neat and tidy. PERSONAL INTERIOR 4 DESIGN CHOICES Inspired by professional influencers and self-taught interior design stylists on social media, many consumers are beginning to make more conscious and bold design choices. Nobia’s own consumer studies also show 5 that many have an emotional need to create a home and a kitchen 3 THE SOCIAL HOME CIRCULARITY In a time when global consumption has that reflects their own personality and lifestyle.

These customer segments are sized differently in different European countries, and can in turn be divided into renovation and new construction. Professional customers can be divided into project customers and builders. The estimated value of the European kitchen market is approxi­ 5bn.

In the markets where Nobia has a presence, the estimated value is approximately EUR 2.5bn. Nobia has a strong position in both the Nordic region and the UK. Kitchens are sold through various channels – specialised kitchen stores, furniture stores and builders’ merchants, for example – and to some extent directly on the Internet. Nobia sells through own stores, franchise stores and a large number of retailers who often specialise in kitchens or who are active as builders’ merchants.

Nobia’s position is strongest in the Nordic region. The professional market covers major construction and property companies, property developers and private and municipal landlords as well as builders and smaller, local construction companies. Put simply, the market can be described in two segments: small local builders and tradesmen, and the large project customers. The project customer can be divided into social housing and other customers in the construction sector. In large countries such as the UK, kitchen suppliers focus to a large extent on a specific segment while Nobia operates in all professional segments through various channels. Professional customers have similar product requirements as consumers, but different service needs. The most important competitive advantages for major projects are dedicated projTH E PRO F E S S I O N A L M A RK E T ect management, successful deliveries of large orders on time, and products that are easy to install.

The proposed location of the facility, which will be one of Europe’s most modern, is in Jönköping so as to achieve the best possible transportation and logistics efficiency as well as customer proximity. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2020 and in 2024 it will replace Nobia’s existing plant in Tidaholm. A total of approximately SEK 2bn is being invested in automation and other production equipment as well as a high level of environmental and sustainability performance, which will make it Nobia’s largest investment ever. Lead times for customer order-driven kitchen manufacturing will decrease substantially, and the investment strengthens Nobia’s position as Europe’s leading kitchen specialist. 24 N O B I A A N N U A L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 NORDIC REGION We have introduced Nordic Swan eco-labelled worktops Since early 2019, we have had the pleasure of offering our customers Nordic Swan eco-labelled laminated worktops in the Marbodal, Sigdal, and Norema brands in Sweden and Norway. We were then one of the first in the market to offer Nordic Swan eco-labelled laminated worktops. Demand for Nordic Swan eco-labelled products is increasing. To meet demand, we expanded our product range during the year by offering Nordic Swan ecolabelled laminated worktops as a supplement to our previously eco-labelled cabinets, doors and accessories. The process of securing the Nordic Swan ecolabel for Nobia’s brands in Sweden and Norway was initiated in 2018. Compliance with the criteria for materials, chemical content, traceability and so forth is ensured in partnership with suppliers. Our worktops have meet with a positive reception from customers, who can now supplement their eco-labelled cabinets and doors with a Nordic Swan eco-labelled worktop. The Nordic Swan is an eco-label that helps the consumer make positive choices for the environment. Before a product can be labelled with the Nordic Swan, it is evaluated and analysed from a life cycle perspective including content, manufacturing and use as well as how the product is handled once it has been consumed. The Nordic Swan places strict requirements and demands documentation and extensive testing from independent laboratories to ensure that all the requirements are met. The advantages of a Nordic Swan eco-label are many. A product with the Nordic Swan eco-label passes tough environmental, health, quality and functional requirements. In other words, they are long-lasting products that contain a minimum of hazardous chemicals and promote a healthier indoor environment.

Commodore designs, manufactures and installs kitchens in the upper mid-price segment for customers in property development and housing construction, whereas CIE is a retailer that designs and installs premium kitchens for top-class development projects in London. Lengthy relationships with property developers and a proven ability to successfully manage large, complex kitchen projects in everything from design and production to installation have allowed the company to win several prestigious assignments. As a kitchen supplier, providing options for the final appearance and feel of each individual kitchen in a major project is important. These projects include Battersea Power Station, Southbank Place and South Quay Plaza, which will be one of Europe’s tallest residential blocks with a height of 220 metres and 68 storeys. 28 N O B I A A N N U A L A N D S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T 2 0 1 9 UK REGION Improved customer offering for trade customers in the UK In 2019, Magnet took the next step and sharpened its offering for builders (Trade customers) after successfully repositioning its brand in 2018 with a focus on private customers in the UK. Trade customers are an important target group, since local builders complete between three and five kitchens a year, compared with a private customer who on average replaces their kitchen every 15 to 20 years. Builders also have a strong influence on consumers’ choice of kitchens, which is why building relationships with local builders is extremely important for retailers. 160 of Magnet’s over 200 stores in the UK were adapted during the year to the new concept, which is built on the idea that being a customer should be simple for builders. The offering includes a competitive loyalty programme, a more attractive selection of kitchen and joinery products in stock for the best availability, and dedicated business developers supporting the builders.

The work is taking place with partners such as the Delft University of Technology. Every materials flow has been charted step by step as part of the project. In partnership with suppliers and customers, we have looked at circular solutions concerning innovation in new business models. This includes choice of materials and kitchen use as well as product upgrades and replacement. We now have a kitchen concept with a theoretically longer service life than the normal 20 years. The kitchen is easily customisable so that an entirely new kitchen is no longer necessary when tastes or circumstances change. Repairs are easier since the kitchen has not been glued together. All the parts are loose and click into place. The circular kitchen has been developed in accord­ance with a modular “plug and play” principle. The designed details of the cabinets can be customised with a style package. This way, the design and appearance of the kitchen can easily be adapted to the user’s sometimes changing tastes. Replacing the entire kitchen is nearly never necessary. Approximately 40 kitchens will be tested among customers in 2020.

For the waste that we do generate, we follow what is called the ‘waste hierarcy’. In Nobia UK, we took the step last year from recycling to re-using large amounts of our waste wood and initiated a partnership with other businesses including a local furniture company. Waste wood in the form of board material that previously went to materials reclamation can now be re-used in production of headboards and other furniture. We have also initiated an additional partnership in which wood chips from our manufacturing go to a company that sells bedding. In this way, we enable waste from our production to become new resources. The initiative encompasses approximately half of the waste wood that previously went to material recycling at our UK plants and has yielded financial benefits for all these plants. Wood sold has generated new revenue while reducing our waste costs.

The purpose of the ERM process is to provide a Group-wide overview of Nobia’s risks by identifying them, evaluating them and providing a basis for decision-making regarding the management of risks, and to facilitate monitoring of the risks and how they are managed. The Corporate Governance Report, on pages 100– 109, presents further descriptions of the internal controls used to manage the risks associated with financial reporting. Sustainability and climate-related risks are integrated in our overall business risk assessment process. Furthermore, we have sustainability risk assessments as integrated parts of our supplier assessment and product management process.
