We caution the readers of our financial reports to follow a similar approach by considering nominal and constant currencies non-IFRS measures only in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, changes in revenue, operating expenses, operating profit, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Despite these limitations, we believe that the presentation of our non-IFRS measures and the corresponding IFRS measures, together with the relevant reconciliations, provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations. 64 Performance Management System To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Economic, Additional Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Environmental, and Social Performance Information Reconciliations of IFRS to Non-IFRS Financial Measures for the Years 2019 and 2018 € millions, unless otherwise stated 2019 2018 IFRS Adj.

In 2019, 68% of customers gave us a score of 7 or higher. This means that a large majority of customers are satisfied or highly satisfied with SAP. Because the percentage of customers that rated us 9 or 10 is slightly smaller than the percentage of customers who rated us 6 or below, our Customer NPS for 2019 is –6 (2018: –5). We did not reach our target of +1 in 2019. While we have reported Customer Net Promoter Score since 2012, we revamped our program in 2018 with 2019 as the first full year of results. For 2019, SAP set a very aggressive target against a stringent metric. As we gather more insight on how the number reacts to the improvements we are making, we will continue to get better in forecasting the results. With our Experience Management (XM) innovations from Qualtrics, we have more information from our customers than ever and can react to it faster, helping us make changes that customers can see and feel in their interactions with SAP and our software. As we continue to receive open and direct feedback from our customers, we are also incorporating XM across the company. In particular, programs such as Customer First, Build Customers for Life, and Insights to Action will continue to drive improvements. We expect this continuous feedback to help us achieve our goal of improving customer loyalty. Therefore, we aim to increase Customer NPS by three to five points in 2020 and to steadily increase the score through 2023 and beyond. Starting in 2020, Customer NPS is included as a KPI in Executive Board remuneration as part of the short-term incentive component.

In 2019, cash inflows from operating activities decreased by €807 million to €3,496 million (2018: €4,303 million). This is particularly due to an increase in income tax payments (€2.3 billion in 2019 and €1.7 billion in 2018), higher payments related to restructuring (€0.9 billion in 2019 and €0.1 billion in 2018), and higher share-based payments (€1.3 billion in 2019 and €1.0 billion in 2018). Our days sales outstanding (DSO) for receivables, defined as the average number of days from the raised invoice to cash receipt from the customer, remained flat in 2019 at 71 days (2018: 70 days). Following the new lease accounting rules (IFRS 16), we had a positive impact on operating cash flow from the reclass of leasing payments into cash flows from financing of €0.4 billion. Cash outflows from investing activities were €7,021 million in 2019 (2018: €3,066 million). We paid, net of cash received, a total of €6.1 billion for the Qualtrics acquisition in 2019, compared to €2.1 billion in 2018, mainly for Callidus. Instead of investing in the expansion of our data centers, there was a strong focus on improving capacity utilization, resulting in a decrease in capital expenditures on purchases of intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment by €642 million to €817 million. For more information about current and planned capital expenditures, see the Assets section and the Investment Goals section. Net cash inflows from financing activities were €102 million in 2019, compared to €3,283 million in 2018. In 2019, we drew €2.5 billion of an acquisition term loan for Qualtrics. We refinanced €0.5 billion of the acquisition term loan through the issuance of the same amount under a commercial paper program (Commercial Paper) we launched in September 2019.

Comparative Figures Effective January 1, 2018, we started to apply IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ retrospectively, using the cumulative catch-up approach and the practical expedient to apply the new standard only to contracts that were not completed as at January 1, 2018. On adopting IFRS 15, SAP changed several of its accounting policies. Under the cumulative catch-up approach, the amounts for the financial year 2017 presented in the financial statements were not restated to conform to these policies. Also effective January 1, 2018, we started to apply IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’ using the exception from full retrospective application. The impact from a different classification of financial assets, the new impairment rules, and the different treatment of cost of hedging were recognized in retained earnings of the opening balance sheet on January 1, 2018. Comparative figures for the financial year 2017 presented in the financial statements were not restated.

Income Tax-Related Litigation We are subject to ongoing tax audits by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Currently, we are in dispute mainly with the German and only a few foreign tax authorities. The German dispute is in respect of intercompany financing matters and certain secured capital investments, while the few foreign disputes are in respect of the deductibility of intercompany royalty payments and intercompany services. In all cases, we expect that a favorable outcome can only be achieved through litigation. For all of these matters, we have not recorded a provision as we believe that the tax authorities’ claims have no merit and that no adjustment is warranted. If, contrary to our view, the tax authorities were to prevail in their arguments before the court, we would expect to have an additional expense of approximately €2,013 million (2018: €1,746 million) in total (including related interest expenses and penalties of €982 million (2018: €842 million)).

Section D – Invested Capital 167 To Our Combined Group Consolidated Financial Further Information on Economic, Additional Stakeholders Management Report Statements IFRS Environmental, and Social Performance Information Goodwill Impairment Test The key assumptions on which management based its cash flow projections for the period covered by the underlying business plans are as follows: Key Assumption Basis for Determining Values Assigned to Key Assumption Budgeted revenue growth Revenue growth rate achieved in the current year, adjusted for an expected increase in SAP’s addressable cloud and database markets; expected growth in the established software applications and analytics markets. Values assigned reflect our past experience and our expectations regarding an increase in the addressable markets. Budgeted operating margin Operating margin budgeted for a given budget period equals the operating margin achieved in the current year, increased by expected efficiency gains. Values assigned reflect past experience, except for efficiency gains. Discount rates Our estimated cash flow projections are discounted to present value using discount rates (after-tax rates). Discount rates are based on the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) approach. Terminal growth rate Our estimated cash flow projections for periods beyond the business plan were extrapolated using segment-specific terminal growth rates.

The results for 2018, for example, showed that Non-Financial Performance Indicators a 1pp change in the Business Health Culture Index affected our At SAP, we put a monetary value on how selected non-financial operating profit by €90 million to €100 million (non-IFRS). indicators have impacted our operating profit. For example, how Having illustrated this impact with concrete numbers, we are well we engage with our employees and inspire them to commit to now turning our focus to a broader perspective of impact (for our purpose and strategy, support a healthy business culture, and example, see Our Contribution to the UN Sustainable Development succeed in reducing our carbon emissions. Goals and The Next Logical Step). We still strongly believe in the fundamental conclusions of the analysis, but do not see a need to continuously update specific monetary values on the wellestablished connections, since the values have not been subject to any large fluctuations over the years. Instead, they have increased steadily, as expected. What We Have Achieved: Promoting Sustainability Measures as a Way to Boost Financial Performance Documenting the financial impact of non-financial indicators has helped us move closer to achieving our sustainability goals. Rather than simply stating the business case for social or environmental change, we also have the numbers to back it up. Our findings have helped us shift the conversation for managers, investors, employees, and other key stakeholders, and firmly establish non-financial indicators as playing a crucial role in our financial success. As a result, engaging employees or reducing our emissions is no longer seen as a nice-to-have, but rather as essential to carrying out a successful business strategy. By embedding this approach into our decision-making and quarterly business reviews, our sustainability performance steers our business alongside factors such as revenue and profit. Our goal is for all senior managers and experts at SAP to recognize – and be Figure 1: Connectivity Between Social, Environmental, and Economic Performance. SAP’s main KPIs are marked in orange. held accountable for – the fact that improving such measures as employee engagement also boosts financial performance. To achieve this, we created cause-and-effect chains that show how specific actions we take at SAP lead to shifts in behavior. This Embedding Non-Financial Performance behavior impacts on our business and has a financial consequence. Indicators into Our Solutions By doing so, we established more than just a correlation between We will continue to share our approach and methodology with non-financial and financial indicators. It also reveals why and how our customers to help them win in the marketplace. We believe that something such as employee engagement ultimately leads to gains companies achieve higher profits – resulting from both greater cost or losses in business performance. We believe that such insights are efficiency as well as revenue growth – by addressing economic, a prerequisite for fully modeling the financial impact of nonsocial, and environmental considerations in a holistic and integrated financial performance. manner. More importantly, these companies are better equipped to lead in the future, as they navigate the world’s most pressing Magnitude of Financial Impact challenges and help to bring about long-term sustainable change. From 2014 to 2018, SAP used techniques such as linear Using the connectivity model, we have been able to embed nonregression analysis to document the financial impact of four nonfinancial KPIs into our solutions, including, for example, SAP Digital financial indicators: Business Health Culture Index, Employee Boardroom.

We also considered a materiality assessment for the ICT industry by the Results Global E-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) as well as the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). When identifying our key topics and their boundaries, we looked first at areas related to our operations and supply chain. Second, we looked at topics related to how our software can help our customers contribute to the achievement of the SDGs. Prioritization During the prioritization stage, we looked at the extent to which each individual topic affects our ability to create value at SAP. We assessed whether this value was financial, operational, strategic, reputational, or regulatory. All topics that were identified as delivering value in three or more areas were then included on our short list of seven categories, as follows: – Business conduct – Climate and energy – Financial performance – Human and digital rights – Human capital – Innovation and customer loyalty – Impact on society Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with selected stakeholders to validate the shortlisted topics. We asked stakeholders to rate topics on a scale from 0 to 5 (where 0 is not important at all and 5 is very important) based on the following questions for the first six categories: Materiality Matrix Non-Financial Topics (the chart only shows topics – To what degree does this topic influence SAP's ability to create with high or very high scores) value?

Plus, we identify SAP’s waste and water number of employees. This average is calculated by adding the consumption as additional environmental aspects. FTEs at the end of each quarter and then dividing the result by four. By looking at the energy usage and emissions throughout our entire value chain, we gain insights to help us manage our Carbon Emissions environmental performance and, in turn, help our customers to do the same.
