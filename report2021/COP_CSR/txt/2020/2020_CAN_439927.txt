The HRAC process develops a list of hazards for activities or projects, and then guides application of appropriate controls to reduce the risk associated with each identified hazard to an acceptable level. All employees receive training in using the HRAC process, modified for their job tasks and exposure to hazards. Each employee is responsible and authorized to stop work immediately if they become aware of an unsafe act or condition that could place anyone in danger, or if they are not confident in the work plan. This is referred to as the Stop Work Authority and is directly endorsed by the CEO. Incidents, hazards, and near misses are required to be reported. Incident reports are submitted to a central database by people directly involved in the incident. For serious incidents and high potential incidents, a team of HSSE experts is established to investigate, issue a lessons-learned document, and recommend corrective action. 403-3 Occupational health Occupational health services as defined for GRI 403 are provided by a variety of HSSE services and operations processes and practices. Workplace inspections, both field and office, occur on a regular basis sourced in legislative requirements and in best practices. HSSE representatives provide information and guidance on health, safety, and hygiene topics, as well as perform ergonomic assessments to optimize workstation performance and comfort. Facilities and projects document responsibilities around first aid and emergency response planning. Some services around Wellness and Employee and Family Assistance are provided in conjunction with Stantec’s Human Resources structures and programs. 403-4 Worker participation, Stantec’s senior vice president of HSSE has a reporting hierarchy that includes the HSSE consultation, and vice president, directors, managers, advisors, and office safety and environment communication on coordinators (OSECs). There is an OSEC designated for each office location to facilitate occupational health and office-level worker participation and connect employees in local offices to our broader safety HSSE systems, resources, and professionals. An HSSE training and communications manager provides access to and communicates relevant information on health and safety to workers using a variety of print, electronic, and video media. The percentage of workers represented in management-worker health and safety committees is omitted because such committees are not commonly required of a professional service firm. When required by local regulations, we support the formation of office-based committees but do not track the percentage of workers represented. 2019 STANTEC SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | A-16 APPENDIX A – GRI CONTENT INDEX SASB or Direct Answers, TCFD (if GRI Standards and Disclosures Public Report References, or Reasons for Omissions applicable) 403-5 Worker training on So that employees can keep themselves and others safe, at the start of employment and occupational health and annually thereafter, mandatory online training and review is required on our corporate HSSE safety expectations, critical risks, and workplace best practices.

Previously, in Scope 1, we reported natural gas for owned offices as well as landlord-controlled offices where we paid the utility bills directly. In Scope 2, we reported landlord-controlled offices where we were billed the energy usage through the landlord. However, the landlord-controlled invoice payment could change year-to-year, producing arbitrary variability in whether the same natural gas usage fell to Scope 1 versus Scope 2. This year, we began reporting only owned office natural gas usage in Scope 1 (there is only one owned office that uses natural gas) and all landlord-controlled natural gas usage in Scope 2. • In 2019, Stantec temporarily gained operational control of a UK waste-to-energy plant that was designed and constructed by a joint venture with a divested construction entity (divested at the end of 2018). This plant has been sold and is no longer overseen by Stantec.

Even SASB IF-EN103-2 management approach, though our physical operations do not have a direct impact on Indigenous Peoples and 160a.2 103-3 evaluation communities, we prioritize the importance of respectful interactions with Indigenous communities in recognition of our commitment to inclusion and diversity as well as our desire to be good neighbors. This commitment to positive interactions with Indigenous Peoples began shortly after Stantec’s founding in 1954, when our project work expanded from Edmonton, Alberta to northern Canada, and success was dependent on respectful Indigenous connections. Since then, building and maintaining positive relationships with Indigenous Peoples has been a Company tenet. Stantec builds and maintains sustainable relationships and strong partnerships with Indigenous Peoples and communities by recognizing, supporting, and respecting the diversity and distinctiveness of the Indigenous cultures of our employees, our Indigenous partners, our Indigenous clients, and the Indigenous businesses we work with. Stantec has an Indigenous Relations Program and 11 Indigenous Business Partnerships that work with our project teams so that our client work protects the rights of Indigenous Peoples. The current focus of our formal program is Canada, the United States, and Australia with the intention to continue expansion to other countries where we operate. We judge the effectiveness of our Indigenous Relations program by the positive feedback received from leaders and community members. The success of our Indigenous Partnerships is measured by revenue generation, which provides direct investments to Indigenous communities and supports economic growth.

Though the following topics do not appear on Stantec’s materiality assessment, we still deem them important and recognize we have an impact in these areas, most often through the projects we do for clients.

For countries of significant presence operations, the average hourly rate of our lowest wage group is consistently higher than the minimum wage in that country.
