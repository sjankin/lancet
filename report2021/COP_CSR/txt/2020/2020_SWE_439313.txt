The second largest emission source is due to our use of natural gas in production. One important building block of the Climate Roadmap is to establish bio-coke and green energy gas as fuel sources. We also aim to develop technology to remedy the root cause of our environmental impact, and not only solve the symptoms. One example is to develop methods of using bio-coke, not only as a renewable fuel but also as an alternative to anthracite, as a carbon addition to steel melts.

Sustainability strategy In 2016, we launched our first sustainability strategy based on stakeholder dialogue and materiality assessment. It was visualised as “Mount Sustainability”, consisting of five paths, each with six stations that illustrated the climb towards being a sustainability leader. In 2019, we have reviewed our strategy and are happy to present the outlines of the updated version in this report. Developments since 2016 Since 2016, Mount Sustainability has served us well not only by raising awareness, pointing out the right direction and communicating our ambitions, but also by raising questions and clarifying in which areas our toughest challenges lie. This has helped us identify where to deepen our knowledge and understanding to be able to act decisively. For example, it has become even clearer that the path “Climate neutral operations” is a huge challenge, not only Höganäs’ new sustainability strategy with focus on five areas; workplace, for us as a company but for the whole industry due to our society, climate, environment and products.

Sustainability Report 2019 | Höganäs 19 Workplace Technical upgrade in Goslar plant The installation of a new wet grinding plant at the Goslar production site in Germany has increased the annual production capacity of boron carbide by 150 per cent. Boron carbide is used, among other things, in industry as wear protection. In addition to the increased capacity, safety, airconditioning and ergonomic improvements were also achieved. Another focus was on the automation of the boron carbide production. The plant was equipped with an automatic grinding bead dosing system, eliminating the need for manual addition. The heart, however, is the new control system with which all relevant process parameters are monitored, adjusted and archived. This means that it is now even possible to monitor the highly automated plant remotely via the control system of the boron plant. The plant runs almost completely automatically – only the suspension must be prepared manually and the process has to be checked regularly.

Safe and ethical Causing no harm to people and the environment throughout the value chain Each of these pillars are extensively described based on a thorough analysis of present challenges for our business, identified areas where to make the changes, the desired achievements and example indicators for how to track performance. Achieving this vision requires mastering a set of key enablers, or skills, that need to be fostered. Three key enablers have been identified that represent the (e.g. greenhouse gases), quantification of the product footcapabilities needed for making the sustainability product print is necessary to channel activities towards sustainable vision a reality: development.

In 2019 we handled a total of 611,000 (719,000) tonnes of direct materials to produce around 500,000 tonnes of prodconcentrations of substances extracted from the earth’s crust ucts and 46,000 (59,000) tonnes of side stream products. Our largest raw material volumes are non-renewable in the sense that they are extracted from the earth’s crust. These materials are mainly iron ore, limestone and fossil process concentrations of substances coal or coke. produced by society We also buy non-ferrous metals like copper, chrome, nickel, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese and cobalt. A significant part of non-ferrous metals are secondary materials. Approximately 50 per cent of our raw materials base condegradation by physical means sists of secondary, or recycled materials.

We will use the solar energy to power office buildings and forklifts.” Turning renewable Our use of natural gas is a big source of carbon dioxide emissions. Our ambition to replace fossil fuels with non-fossil alternatives based on renewable sources is ongoing. There have been few realistic alternatives for replacing fossil fuels for Höganäs, due to the need for precise process control, high temperature and purity. To initiate a change where we can replace fossil natural gas with a renewable alternative, we started a collaboration with Cortus Energy and other companies and stakeholders to utilise the Woodroll® process invented by Cortus Energy. After several lab studies demonstrating the possibilities of the Woodroll process – the gasification and restructuring of biomass to synthesis gas – Cortus Energy built at pilot Reducing carbon footprint The one drawback has been slower transit times. A jourthrough transport ney that will typically take 4-5 days for a truck, will take around 6-7 days by train and 13-16 days by boat.

Our major Swedish production sites are already certified, and other production sites are on their way towards compliance and will be certified during the years to come. Our energy efficiency initiative, the “Energy Challenge”, has been successful, seeing a steady decline in energy use. The target is a 10 per cent reduction per produced tonne of metal powder between 2010 and 2020. The result for 2019 was a 7.1 (8.2) per cent decrease in energy use per produced tonne compared to 2010. In 2019 further steps were taken to increase the total ­energy efficiency. One example is installation of variable-frequency plant at our site in Höganäs, Sweden, to perform tests on an drives that reduce power demand for electric motor-driven industrial scale. The plant was completed in December 2019, systems such as ventilation, fans, pumps and compressors. and during 2020 it will deliver gas to Höganäs’ manufacturing In Sweden we commissioned a new state-of-the-art annealprocess and serve as a replacement for natural gas. ing furnace, thereby replacing older furnaces.
