The project was completed through a partnering project in close cooperation between the municipality, architects and NCC.

All of the spaces can be used for educational activities and the school’s outdoor environment offers a complementary educational environment. In addition, The Falkoner Center following renovation. all of the classrooms are close to the surrounding nature. Focus on the needs of operations The school’s design is based on a new and innovative approach to how a school should work, with the focus on an environment of learning and high educational values. It has evolved from the needs of operations, and through the considerable involvement of both teaching staff and pupils. This makes the school sustainable over time and means that in can be used in the optimal way for educational activities. The new school was built beside the old one and has space for 470 pupils. The building has a three-section brick body with abundant indoor natural lighting and teaching spaces that face north.

TRANSLATION RESERVE The translation reserve includes all exchange-rate differences that arise from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations that have compiled their reports in a currency other than that in which the consolidated financial statements are presented, in NCC’s case, SEK. The translation reserve also includes exchangerate differences that arise from the remeasurement of liabilities and currency forward contracts entered into as instruments to hedge net investments in foreign operations. FAIR VALUE RESERVE The fair value reserve includes the accumulated net change in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets up to the time that such assets have been sold or their value impaired. HEDGING RESERVE The hedging reserve includes the effective portion of the accumulated net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments attributable to hedging transactions that have not yet occurred. REVALUATION RESERVE The revaluation reserve arises from step acquisitions, multi-stage acquisitions, meaning an increase in the fair value of previously owned portions of net assets resulting from step acquisitions.

The Parent Company recognizes Group contributions received and granted as appropriations, which is in accordance with the alternative rule in RFR 2. For tax reasons, the Swedish Financial Reporting Board has granted exemption from the requirement that listed parent companies must recognize certain financial instruments at fair value. NCC applies the exemption rules and has thus refrained from recognizing certain financial instruments at fair value.

Total –59 –65 Working capital and reinvestment requirement: The requirement has been assumed to match the figure for 2019, with a growth rate equal to the sustainable long-term growth rate. The assumption has been based on previous experience and estimates of future requirements. Discount rate: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated for the various units on the basis of beta value, and local conditions in respect of market rates and tax, as well as a market-based capital structure for the various operations. The latter is based on the operational risk and the opportunities to leverage the operation. Although the discount rates vary among the different cash-generating units, in NCC’s scenario it totals 8.9 percent (7.3) percent before and 7.0 percent (6.1) after tax. 48 NCC 2019 FINANCIAL REPORT Note 17 Tangible fixed assets GROUP PARENT COMPANY Owner-occupied Machinery and Machinery and 2019 properties equipment Total equipment Recognized cost on January 1 1,524 7,937 9,461 82 Investments 100 810 909 33 Reclassification to tangible fixed assets held for sale –4 –96 –100 Divestment and scrappage –59 –583 –642 Reclassifications –9 –403 –412 –52 Translation differences during the year 20 92 112 Recognized cost on December 31 1,571 7,757 9,328 62 Accumulated impairment losses and depreciation on January 1 –609 –5,400 –6,008 –57 Divestment and scrappage 7 461 468 Reclassifications 3 295 298 Translation differences during the year –8 –51 –59 Impairment losses for the year1) –13 –8 –21 Depreciation during the year –58 –559 –617 –2 Accumulated impairment losses and depreciation on December 311) –677 –5,262 –5,938 –59 Accumulated write-ups at beginning of the year 21 21 Accumulated write-ups on December 31 21 21 Residual value on January 1 915 2,559 3,474 24 Residual value on December 31 894 2,516 3,410 3 1) Accumulated impairment losses on December 31 –36 –55 –91 GROUP PARENT COMPANY Owner-occupied Machinery and Machinery and 2018 properties equipment Total equipment Recognized cost on January 1 1,445 7,568 9,012 63 Investments 100 887 987 18 Increase through acquisitions 14 14 Divestment and scrappage –42 –661 –703 Reclassifications –5 –1 –7 Translation differences during the year 26 131 157 Recognized cost on December 31 1,524 7,937 9,461 82 Accumulated impairment losses and depreciation on January 1 –565 –5,295 –5,859 –55 Divestment and scrappage 18 543 561 Reclassifications –8 –8 Translation differences during the year –12 –85 –97 Impairment losses for the year1) –3 –2 –6 Depreciation during the year –40 –559 –598 –2 Accumulated impairment losses and depreciation on December 311) –609 –5,400 –6,008 –57 Accumulated write-ups at beginning of the year 21 21 Accumulated write-ups on December 31 21 21 Residual value on January 1 880 2,294 3,173 8 Residual value on December 31 915 2,559 3,474 24 1) Accumulated impairment losses on December 31 –23 –46 –69 NCC 2019 FINANCIAL REPORT 49 Note 18 Shares in Group companies Investments in associated companies and Note 19 joint ventures CARRYING CARRYING PARENT COMPANY AMOUNT GROUP AMOUNT Name of company, Corp.

The fair value for unlisted long-term bonds and long-term liabilities to credit institutions, was calculated by discounting future cash flows with current market rates for similar financial instruments.

The point of departure is that resource-efficient societal responsibility is an important part of the solution to climate change and that a shift from linear to circular material flows is necessary to maintain welfare levels in the future. In Denmark, NCC has been active in the “Gentræ” project, an industry-wide innovation project within the framework of “Circular Construction Challenge – Rethink Waste”. This project involves the collection of surplus wood from construction sites for resale as recycled wood. NCC is also continuously improving its recycling capacity in a growing number of asphalt plants, enabling more ecologically adapted operations. In 2019, recycled asphalt granulate accounted for 25 percent (21) of hot asphalt production. NCC cooperates closely with the Group’s waste-management partners in a number of areas to enable the recycling or reuse of materials. Examples include the use of recovered concrete as construction materials in the reinforcing and bearing structure, garden waste that becomes new topsoil, metal scrap that is recycled into new metals, corrugated board that becomes new paper and shrink wrap that is used in the production of new plastic. NCC also contributes to NCC 2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 87 research projects in collaboration with other players concerning the recycling of flat glass, concrete, plastics and gypsum and is an active partner in strategic innovation initiatives, such as Smart Built STANDARDIZATION THROUGHOUT Environment, InfraSweden2030 and Re:Source.
