Uranus tugboat Message from the Board Introduction The Brazilian economy continues to struggle with growth of approximately 1% a year in each of the last three years following the 2015-16 crash, making it the worst recovery from recession on record. Against the backdrop of poor economic growth in Brazil, a difficult trading environment and a higher average US Dollar/Brazilian Real (“US$/ R$”) exchange rate, revenue in US$ terms fell 11.7% in the year. The key operational indicators at our Container Terminals and Towage businesses both weakened against the 2018 comparative. Operating Volumes 2019 2018 % Change Container Terminals: Handling (‘000 TEUs*) 1,027 1,073 -4.2% Towage: Harbour Manoeuvres (#) 53,088 56,114 -5.4% Offshore Support Vessels: Days in Operation (#) 5,128 5,126 0.0% *TEUs stands for “twenty-foot equivalent units”. Significant progress was made in expanding the Salvador Container Terminal during the year. The civil works to extend the terminal’s principal quay from 377 metres to 800 metres are now over 90% complete and we expect to complete the quay extension by the second half of 2020. This will allow the simultaneous berthing of two super-post-Panamax ships at our terminal and is an important development in improving our operational efficiency and development of our facilities. This important investment reflects our ongoing commitment to support our customers and maintain the port of Salvador as an engine for creating jobs and reinforcing economic growth in the state of Bahia. During 2019 we received US$29.7 million in loans from the Brazilian Economic and Social Development Bank to provide financing for the civil works of the terminal’s expansion. Container volumes handled at the Salvador Container Terminal in 2019 grew 3.7% over the prior year to 334,446 TEUs (2018: 322,655 TEUs) driven by higher international trade, cabotage and transshipment movements. Container volumes handled at the Rio Grande Container Terminal at 692,858 TEUs, were 57,190 TEUs lower than the prior year (2018: 750,048 TEUs) mainly due to a 68,900 TEUs reduction in transshipment volumes which were impacted by the cancellation of two feeder services from Argentina that migrated to other ports in the last quarter of 2018. Revenue from our offshore support bases remained disappointing as demand from the offshore oil sector remains soft. As a result, an impairment of US$13.0 million was recorded by the Offshore Support Base division (Brasco) in the year against goodwill and intangibles. Integrated Annual Report 2019 _ 2 Integrated Annual Report 2019 _ 3 Message from Message from the Board the Board The number of harbour towage manoeuvres performed in the year was 5.4% lower at Results 53,088 (2018: 56,114), mainly due to the competitive environment and a reduction in iron ore exports from Brazil. Towage market over-capacity caused partially by weak demand Profit for the year at US$31.9 million was US$14.3 million lower than the prior year (2018: from the offshore oil and gas industry continues to influence both volumes and prices in US$46.2 million) primarily due to reduced foreign exchange losses on monetary items harbour towage although we did see improvement in prices later in the year. We remain of US$2.8 million (2018: US$18.5 million) and better results from our joint ventures with the leading supplier of towage services in Brazil with a fleet of 75 tugboats operating a US$0.6 million attributable profit (2018: US$ 4.1 million loss). Results were adversely in all major ports and terminals of the country. During the year the Shipyard division impacted by a US$29.2 million decrease in operating profit and a US$11.1 million increase in Guarujá, São Paulo state, delivered another tugboat to our fleet, the escort tug WS in finance costs. Operating profit at US$75.2 million (2018: US$104.4 million) fell due to Aries, which joins the WS Sirius (delivered in 2018) as the two most powerful tugboats lower revenue, which was 11.7% lower in US$ terms, softer operating margins (excluding operating in Brazil. The WS Aries has 90 tonnes of bollard pull and a render recovery impairment charges) which at 21.7% were 1.0% lower than the prior year (2018: 22.7%) winch, which allows for the automatic control of maximum pull on the towline while and an impairment of US$13.0 million recorded by our Offshore Support Base division keeping the tow length constant.

Operating WS Aries offers a greater range of options during operations making for a safer operating margins were impacted by weaker margins in our Towage and Offshore Support Base environment. The Company now operates four tugboats equipped and certified as escort businesses. The fall in revenue to US$406.1 million (2018: US$460.2 million) was primarily vessels, which means that the towline can be used at cruising speeds and the vessels due to a higher average US$/R$ exchange rate and a difficult trading environment. can operate more than 100 nautical miles offshore.

The Company’s shipyards continue to provide important vessel construction and maintenance services for our towage and offshore support vessel fleets.

The fall in revenue was principally due to the higher average US$/R$ exchange rate and a difficult trading environment. Towage revenue at US$159.5 million was US$6.1 million lower than the prior year (2018: US$165.6 million) as results continued to be impacted by the competitive environment although there was some firming of prices in the year. The increase in competition and lower iron ore exports from Brazil resulted in harbour towage manoeuvres performed in the year declining 5% to 53,088 (2018: 56,114). Additionally, Towage revenue was impacted by a US$2.0 million fall in income from special operations to US$11.2 million (2018: US$13.2 million). The project-based nature of special towage operations (ocean towage, shipyard support, firefighting and salvage assistance) means revenue streams are more unpredictable than harbour towage. Shipping Agency revenue at US$9.2 million was 7% lower than the prior year (2018: US$10.0 million). Container volumes handled fell 4% to 1,027,300 TEUs (2018: 1,072,700 TEUs) mainly due to a 68,900 TEUs reduction in lower-priced transshipment volumes moved through our Rio Grande Container Terminal. Due to the decrease in overall throughput, lower import warehouse revenue and the higher average US$/R$ exchange rate in the year Container Terminal revenue declined 8% to US$167.8 million (2018: US$183.0 million). Despite vessel turnarounds in the year increasing 14% to 762 (2018: 670) revenue at our offshore support bases decreased US$1.4 million to US$19.4 million (2018: US$20.8 million) again mainly due to currency impacts.

Following the standard Third-party Shipyard revenue was US$19.5 million lower at US$4.5 million (2018: US$24.0 coming into effect, leases have been recorded as assets and liabilities (right-of-use million) due to the poor market for small and medium-sized vessel construction in Brazil assets and financial lease liabilities).

Our offshore support bases continue to experience difficult trading conditions in the near term. An impairment of $13.0 million Operating profit 11.1 was recorded in the year as a result of a more conservative approach to valuation Finance costs (17.7) (see note 10 of the financial accounts for further details). Operating margins for the Deferred tax 1.6 year excluding the impairment declined to 21.7% (2018: 22.7%) principally due to poorer Profit for the period (4.9) margins at our Towage and Offshore Support Base businesses. Excluding the impacts of IFRS16 operating profit in the current period would have fallen to US$77.0 million and margins to 19.0%. IFRS16 principally impacts our Container Terminal, Offshore Support Circular from the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission (“CVM”): Base and Logistics divisions.

Interest on bank loans and overdrafts decreased US$1.5 million to US$10.8 million (2018: US$12.3 million) due to lower variable interest rates. Profit Before Tax Profit before tax for the year decreased US$19.3 million to US$53.4 million compared to Exchange Rates US$72.7 million in 2018. This was primarily due to a US$29.2 million decrease in operating profit and a US$11.1 million increase in finance costs.

This represents an effective tax rate for the year of 40.2% (2018: statement are set out in the table below: 36.4%) compared with the corporate tax rate prevailing in Brazil of 34%. The remaining difference in the effective tax rate is due to deferred tax items and expenses that are not included in determining taxable profit in Brazil. The net impact of these items on the effective tax rate in the year at -1.6% was in line with the prior year (-1.9%) while both deferred tax items and expenses not included in determining taxable profit are lower in the current year mainly due to lower exchange rate movements in the income statement.

We have an official integrated risk management policy with a structured process, applicable to the entire organisation enabling identification, evaluation, monitoring, reporting and response to risks. It supports strategic decision making in accordance with market best practices. The integrated risk management process uses guidelines established by our Board of Directors and Executive Officers, defining objectives, targets and limits for risk management, in addition to enforcing the risk policy and compliance with integrated risk management standards. Our management is supported by control units and responsibilities related to integrated risk management are structured according to the concept of three lines of defence, namely: FIRST LINE Business Units responsible for ensuring the efficiency and effectiveness of its processes and controls against business risks, performing activities related to mitigation control and risk containment in accordance with the integrated risk management policy. SECOND LINE Support Areas responsible for backing the first line with specific tools and methodologies, monitoring the performance of the first line and its own processes. We seek to foster a risk management culture, providing a methodology and managing the integrated risk management process in order to promote, support and regularly align how the risk management process is conducted throughout the Company. These activities involve identifying, evaluating, categorising, responding to, monitoring and reporting risks. THIRD LINE The third line of defence comprises the Internal Audit department, which is structured independently and is responsible for evaluating and reporting on the activities of the first two lines and contributing to their improvement.

We further strengthen our strategic vision in HSE by incorporating zeal for the people’s safety, the environment and communities in our corporate values. The promotion of an HSE culture currently involves dedicated employees as well as many different management tools which include policies, procedures, awareness programmes, audits and process reviews. HSE guidelines are based on the concepts of continuous improvement, relationship with stakeholders, emergency response, risk management, training, legal compliance, leadership and responsibility. HSE has a formal agenda with the Company’s Executive Committee, with monthly meetings to deal exclusively with issues related to the topic. This governance structure, in turn, flows through to other committees and subcommittees for each business unit. We are one of the most consistent winners of the DuPont award on Occupational Health and Safety Management in Brazil, having received four awards in the last five editions held for this category.

Despite achieving a high level of safety, we continuously monitor our performance to further improve work practices and prevent future accidents. Occupational Health Our long-term goal is to maintain our lost-time injury frequency rate below or equal to Health Programme 0.5 by 2022.
