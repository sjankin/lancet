Best practices, established in the philosophy and the continuous improvement system, should be shared and distributed both horizontally and vertically throughout the organization, with processes that support that distribution, and that are constantly improving. Replication of Best Practices does not only refer to the practice of repeating the positive aspects of other operations; it is also the culture of sharing information between departments. Therefore, it is crucial for this exchange to include successes and failures. The expectation is that improvement is not complete until its replication is confirmed and the learning is shared with others. In 2018, a Best Practices Procedure was created, through which the processes were announced for sharing knowledge and encouraging greater participation of the associates. The goal was to ensure MXN 852 MILLION support within processes and to replicate the best practices detected inside and outside the organization, in accordance with the Continuous Improvement Manual.

Responsible and Transparent Information All of Arca Continental’s products contain nutritional information on the packaging, and all non-returnable Coca-Cola packages that we handle contain Daily Nutritional Guidelines. We are committed to parents and their right to responsibly decide what their children consume. That is why, since 2008 we have followed the Code on Self-Regulated Food and Beverages Advertising directed towards Children (PABI Code), years before it became a governmentmandated requirement. Following the guidelines of this code, 100% of our business units avoid advertising or communication directed towards children under 12 years of age. We have also created a special selection of beverages and snacks in our portfolio for Consumption at School Establishments in Mexico (Establecimientos de Consumo Escolar en México – ECoES), which strictly comply with the requirements established by the Secretaries of Health and Education. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 27 Health and safety [403-1] Our objective is to return home healthy and safe, to take care of our work colleagues and the equity of the company, and to strive for safety in the communities we serve.

This has been achieved through programs that allow associates Industrial and Commercial to learn to observe and anticipate what should be done when unsafe or non-standard acts or conditions are seen, before they happen, and to always be aware of the risks to which they are exposed, so that they can act in the manner that is safest for the associate, work colleagues, family, and the community. Therefore, we have included preventative programs in our initiatives, which facilitate adoption of a change in culture through a change in behavior.

Its purpose is to ensure the implementation of all safety, health and environmental requirements and procedures related to administration of contracted personnel. This procedure applies for all departments that have relationships with contractors before, during, and after performing work for Arca Continental. Additionally, in Mexico we have ARIBA, a platform where we follow up on the contractor certification process, which ensures that we have products and services that comply with our quality, security and safety standards. We are currently developing REIM, which is an incidentinvestigation platform. This tool will allow us to create reports with our fixed contractors, as well as the number of hours they work, and the pertinent incidents report, if needed. The data obtained will be included in Arca Continental’s LTIR and TIR indicators. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 30 Risk Management At Arca Continental, the risk management process is performed at the Board level by the Audit and Corporate Practices Committee, Senior Management, and the Risk Coordination Committees, whose goal is to ensure the continuity and sustainability of the business.

Arca Continental is susceptible to numerous factors that might place the organization at risk. The following list of elements enumerates some of the organization’s latent risks, its operations in different territories, its economic performance, and how it is perceived by stakeholders, among others. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 32 Scarcity of supplies and materials Cyber security used in the preparation of our Our systems and those of third-party providers could be vulnerable to damage or interruption caused by products circumstances out of their control, including failure We are required to purchase certain supplies and to protect the data of our customers, consumers and materials previously authorized by The Coca-Cola associates.

Despite this, or biodegradable content. we must ensure that these standards are not violated. Thus, we use various means of communication to follow Existing or future regulations in up adequately on every complaint and comment we receive from our customers and consumers. We also product labeling perform preventive internal and external audits. The authorities of some countries where we operate have requested that our products include labels with warnings and nutritional information. If new labeling requirements are implemented, our production costs and sales levels could be impacted. It is vital for our operation to have the necessary valid permits and licenses. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 33 Derivative financial instruments We use derivative financial instruments in order to reduce exposure to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in the price of some of our raw materials, to reduce exposure to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations for dollar-denominated debt, as well as the variable rates at which we pay our securitized debt. Likewise, any breach in paying specific securitized debt on listed companies presents a risk to the organization. Changes in the tax system It cannot be guaranteed that the tax system applicable to our securitized debt will not undergo modifications in the future that might affect the way interest accrued in relation to those instruments is handled, the transactions with that securitized debt, the bondholders, or us. Breach of the Code of Ethics Any situations or behaviors that breach or violate what is established in our Code of Ethics impact the perception and performance of the organization in the international markets. The human rights of everyone with whom we have contact must be fully respected. This responsibility, both internal and external, extends to our associates and the rest of our value chain. Any type of violence, discrimination, and abuse of power, to name a few issues, are in violation of the culture and values of Arca Continental, therefore they will never be tolerated, and appropriate measures will be taken. Any act or circumstance that causes harm to third parties or their property and for which compensation must be paid, could potentially damage the company’s image, as well as its relationship with the community in the regions where we are present. Respecting and complying with consumers’ rights and obligations is vital for retaining their loyalty, and it is indispensable for ensuring the well-being of our associates through the guarantee of their labor rights, health and safety. Transparency and compliance with the codes and voluntary agreement to which we have adhered are of great importance to how we are perceived by other institutions and stakeholders. Theft, poor use, or taking advantage of the company’s resources for personal ends places the company’s integrity at risk. Any situation that makes Arca Continental susceptible to anti-competitive practices, such as money laundering, corruption, conflicts of interest, political proselytizing, and terrorism financing, is avoided at all costs and is strictly condemned in the organization. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 34 Associates The success of our company is linked to the quality of the people that are part of it. Thus, we encourage well-rounded development and the well-being of our associates in a fair and inclusive work environment. We also provide ongoing training in safety, integrity, human values, and continuous improvement, which has allowed us to create a virtuous circle of productivity and innovation. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 35 Labor Environment Labor Benefits [401-1, 401-2, 202-2] At Arca Continental, we strive to provide an optimal working environment that is harmonious and At Arca Continental we have an Integral Compensation productive for our associates.

A central part of our strategy is to promote the circular economy, as we work on making our packaging sustainable. That is why we have taken significant steps and made investments in countries where we operate, reincorporating our packaging into the value chain at the end of its life cycle. In 2018, the Coca-Cola System announced the goals of a World Without Waste, among which we published the following for 2030: 1. Our packaging will be 100% recyclable. 2. Our packaging will contain at least 50% recycled material. 3. We will encourage collection of 100% of the packaging that we put into the market. Thanks to our efforts, today Arca Continental is one of the most advanced bottlers in the Coca-Cola System in these goals. As our leadership shows, in 2018 the company became a signatory to The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment: Signatory Pack, headed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the United Nations Environment Programme. This agreement, which seeks to slow contamination by plastics, was signed by PetStar, ECOCE and Coca-Cola, and supports creating solutions to produce and manage plastic packaging. As part of this agreement, Arca Continental has agreed to use at least 20% recycled content in all our non-returnable PET plastic bottles in all regions by 2025. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 80 AQUARIUS WAS LAUNCHED IN RETURNABLE TWO-LITER REFPET BOTTLES.

We will use Arca Continental’s Sustainable Packaging Principles this category when the sum of the environmental apply to all operations and countries where we are footprints of the material and the process are less present. To analyze the environmental footprint of all than any other economically viable option, prioritizing our packaging, both primary and secondary, we classify recycling for same use (cradle-to-cradle) through the materials and uses of packaging in two ways: partners. • Number of package uses. A package may be IV. Multiple lives, multiple uses. This is the used once, or on multiple occasions (for example, a most favored scenario, as long as the environmental returnable bottle) before the material or the package footprint of the product and process is smaller than the loses the necessary qualities for it to be reused. other categories. • Number of lives of the material. There are materials that can be recycled to create the same or another product. Now there are materials that allow containers to be recycled many times, and there are also materials that are difficult to use, with limited recycling, or materials for which recycling is not economically viable. These two dimensions allow us to classify packaging into four categories, as shown in the following graph. Arca Continental’s principles of sustainable packaging indicate the company’s stance and method of procedure in each of these categories: I. One single life and one sole use. We will avoid and redesign this category for all future packaging and product designs, both primary and secondary. MULTIPLE LIVES Prioritize materials with a smaller environmental Best scenario footprint ONE SINGLE LIFE Favor materials with a Avoid smaller environmental footprint ONE SINGLE USE MULTIPLE USES 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 83 Recycling performance Over the last seven years we have worked hard to lighten the weight of our PET bottles. Our success in this area has a huge impact on our processes, because by decreasing the amount of plastic used, the amount of energy used in containers is reduced, and our logistics and final disposal processes are improved. Due to these efforts, this year we have saved more than 1,571.74 tons of PET resin, which is equal to 6,374.75 tons of CO2 not emitted into the atmosphere. Our strategic alliances with recycled food-grade PET providers (PCR – post consumer recycled) and Bio PET have contributed to the incorporation of these materials into our plastic containers. In 2019, we consumed 42,332 tons of these materials in our operations, which represents 24.72% of our total consumption of PET. Note that this percentage varies by country, given the availability of materials.

This guideline extends to our business partners (providers and brokers).” We have an online Provider Portal where any provider who wishes to enroll in the system and offer us their services can read and agree that they will comply with and respect our Code of Ethics; this means that currently 100% of our providers are informed and committed to adding to our efforts to stamp out corruption and bribery.

As we are committed to community development, our tax obligations are paid in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As stated in our principles of compliance, at Arca Continental the use of mechanisms such as transfer prices, tax evasion and tax havens to decrease the company’s obligations are not tolerated. Transfer prices are calculated and audited pursuant to best international practices. Every year an independent third party issues a tax report certifying due compliance with those obligations.

A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Annual Report presented to Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (CNBV) and the Annual Information presented to the stockholders (but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon), which are expected to be made available to us after to the date of this auditor’s report. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. When we read the other information not yet received, we will issue the report on required by the CNBV and if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those Charged with Governance and, if required, describe the issue in our report. OTHER MATTER This version of our report is a translation from the original report, which was prepared in Spanish. In all matters of interpretation of information, views or options, the original Spanish language version of our report takes precedence over this translation. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. AUDITORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. • Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 121 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES • Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company and subsidiaries to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Company and subsidiaries audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those Charged with Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those Charged with Governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those Charged with Governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements At December 31, 2019 and 2018 (Figures expressed in thousands of Mexican pesos, unless otherwise specified) NOTE 1 THE ENTITY AND ITS OPERATIONS: Arca Continental, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries (AC or the Company) is mainly engaged in the production, distribution and sale of soft drinks pertaining to the brands owned by or licensed from The Coca-Cola Company (TCCC). AC shares are registered at the National Securities Registry of the National Banking and Securities Commission (NBSC) and are quoted on the Mexican Stock Exchange. According to the bottler’s agreement signed between AC and the bottler authorization granted by TCCC the latter, AC holds the exclusive right to conduct this type of activities with Coca-Cola products in different territories in Mexico, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru and the United States (US). The Company’s portfolio of beverages includes cola and flavored soft drinks, purified and flavored water, and other carbonated and non-carbonated beverages in sundry presentations (see Note 27). Additionally, the Company produces, distributes and sells food and snacks through its brands Bokados, Wise, Deep River brands and other brands used by its subsidiaries Nacional de Alimentos y Helados, S. A. de C. V., Bbox Vending, S. de R. L. de C. V., Industrias Alimenticias Ecuatorianas, S. A. (Inalecsa), Vending del Ecuador, S. A., Wise Foods, Inc. (Wise Foods) and Old Lyme Gourmet, Co. (Deep River); as well as dairy products of high added value under the Industrias Lácteas Toni, S.A. (Toni) brand in Ecuador. AC conducts its activities through subsidiary companies of which it is the owner or of which it controls, either directly or indirectly, most of the common shares representing their capital stock (see Note 29). The term “the Company”, as used in this report, refers to AC and its subsidiaries in the aggregate. In 2017, AC transferred to its subsidiary AC Bebidas, S. de R. L. de C. V., (AC Bebidas) its interest in the capital stock of its subsidiary and associated companies, as well as its joint operation, mainly engaged in the soft drinks business. On April 1, 2017 AC Bebidas acquired from Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) the 100% of capital stock of Coca-Cola Southwest Beverages, LLC (CCSWB) in exchange for an interest in the AC Bebidas capital stock of 20% (as of December 31, 2017 AC maintained 79.86% of interest in AC Bebidas and CCR the 20.14%). Additionally, effective as from October 2018, AC transferred the net assets of its branch in Ecuador to AC Bebidas. These transfers were conducted at the book value of these entities, as shown in AC’s consolidated financial statements and because it is a transaction within the group, it had no impact at the consolidated level. Moreover, with the transfer of its Ecuador branch’s net assets and liabilities in 2018, AC’s interest in AC Bebidas reached 80%. Arca Continental, S. A. B. de C. V. is a variable capital publicly traded stock company incorporated in Mexico, domiciled at Ave. San Jerónimo 813 Poniente, in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The symbol “$” in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements refers to thousands of Mexican pesos. The acronym “US” refers to thousands of US dollars, unless otherwise indicated. NOTE 2 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS: 2018 A. ECUADOR BRANCH CONTRIBUTION On October 15, 2018, AC contributed to AC Bebidas, the Ecuador branch’s assets and liabilities in exchange for increasing the interest in the subsidiary by 0.14%. This transaction was conducted within the framework of the Transaction Agreement entered into in 2017. For accounting purposes, the transfer of the net AC Bebidas assets was considered a business combination of entities under common control, and therefore the net assets transferred were accounted by AC Bebidas at values at the Arca Continental consolidated level (predecessor accounting) as from the date on which the transfers were made, not including comparative figures, based on Company accounting policies. Under this treatment, there was no difference between the historical book value of the net assets acquired of $349,216 and the contribution value, determined on the basis of the tax cost thereof. As a consequence of the predecessor’s accounting, the Ecuador branch’s $6,362,940 goodwill recognized by AC was transferred to AC Bebidas and no additional goodwill was recognized in connection with this transaction. After this contribution, AC’s interest in AC Bebidas is 80%, with Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR) holding the remaining 20%. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 129 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C.

L. (Peru Beverage Limitada), a subsidiary of The Coca Cola Company, through which it acquired 223,774,704 common shares of Corporación Lindley S.A. (CL) with full voting rights and representing 38.52% of the common shares not listed at the Public Registry of the Securities Market of the Securities Market Superintendence of Peru. As a result of said purchase of shares, AC Bebidas currently holds 99.78% of CL voting shares. As the sole and total price for the purchase of said shares, AC Bebidas paid Peru Beverages Limited the amount of $9,622,876 (US$506.8 million) in cash, equivalent to US$2.26 dollars per share. The difference between the book value of the minority interest acquired and the amount paid is shown under stockholders’ equity in the retained earnings. At December 31, 2017, there were 355,903,118 common shares issued by CL and 15,801,752 investment shares. Investment shares carry no corporate rights such as voting rights or the right to attend stockholders’ meetings; neither do they confer the right to appoint members of the Board of Directors. The percentage of voting shares December 31, 2019 and 2018 is 99.78% NOTE 3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The consolidated financial statements and notes thereto were authorized for issuance on March 5, 2020 by the undersigned officers. Following is a summary of the most significant accounting policies followed by the Company and its subsidiary, which have been applied consistently in preparing its financial information in the years presented, unless otherwise specified. A. BASES FOR PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements of Arca Continental, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). IFRS include all International Accounting Standards (IAS) in effect, as well as all the related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”), including those issued previously by the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for: (i) derivative financial instruments designated as hedging measured at fair value, and (ii) net assets and the results of the operations conducted by the company in Argentina, a hyper-inflationary economy, which are stated in the terms of the current unit of measure at the closing date of the period reported on (see Note 3d.). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimations. It also requires Management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a greater degree of judgment or complexity and those involving assumptions and estimations that are significant for the consolidated financial statements are described in Note 5. B. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES i. New standards and changes adopted by the Company The company has applied the following standards and modifications for the first time for the annual reporting period beginning on January 1, 2019: • IFRS-16 Leases Adoption of IFRS 16 resulted in changes in accounting policies and adjustments to the amounts recorded in the financial statements (see Note 30). The new accounting policies are explained in note 3m. In accordance with the transitory provisions of IFRS-16, comparative figures were not restated. • IFRIC-23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments This interpretation clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement criteria of IAS-12 Income tax, when there are uncertain tax positions, these refer to those positions where there is uncertainty about whether the competent tax authority will accept such position under the current tax laws. In such cases, the Company will recognize and measure its assets or liabilities for current or deferred taxes by applying the requirements of IAS-12 based on tax income or losses, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates determined by applying this Interpretation. In assessing how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of tax income or tax losses, tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, the Company assumes that it will be inspected the amounts that the authority is entitled to examine and have full knowledge of all related information when conducting such inspections. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 130 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES The Company applied IFRIC-23 as of January 1, 2019, recognizing a consolidated liability of $161,130 against retained earnings at that date, without modifying the comparative periods presented. To determine this consolidated liability, the management applied its professional judgment and considered the prevailing conditions of the fiscal positions that it has taken at the date of adoption in its different subsidiaries and the faculties of the corresponding authorities to evaluate the fiscal positions held, using the most likely amount method, which predicts the best resolution of uncertainty when the possible results are concentrated in a single value. As of December 31, 2019, there have been no changes in the facts and circumstances considered by the management to determine the value of their positions. ii. New standards and interpretations not yet adopted The Company has identified no other standards that have not yet gone into effect and which could have a significant impact on the entity in current and future reporting periods and in foreseeable future transactions. C. CONSOLIDATION i. Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company exercises control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed or is entitled to variable yields arising from an interest in the entity and is capable of affecting yields through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries consolidate as from the date on which control is transferred to the Company. They cease consolidating as from the date on which said control ceases (see Notes 2 and 29). When combinations are made in the form of the acquisition of businesses under common control, the Company initially records the assets transferred and the liabilities incurred at the predecessor value in the books of the selling entity at the date of the transaction, which includes adjustments to fair value and goodwill of previous combinations. Any difference between the equity issued by the Company or the consideration paid and the predecessor values are recorded directly in stockholders’ equity. Acquisition-related costs are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. The Company uses the purchase method of accounting to record business combinations. The consideration transferred in the acquisition of an independent entity is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity issued by the Company. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of all assets and liabilities resulting from a contingent consideration agreement. When payment of any portion of the consideration in cash is deferred, amounts to be paid in the future are discounted at present value on the date of the transaction. The discount rate used is the incremental rate of the Company’s debt, as this rate is similar to that which would be obtained in a debt from independent sources of financing under comparable terms and conditions, depending on their characteristics. The contingent consideration is classified as capital or as a financial liability. The amounts classified as financial liabilities are subsequently disclosed at fair value with the changes recognized in the consolidated results. Acquisition-related costs related to the acquisition are recorded as expenses as they are incurred. The identifiable assets acquired and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially valued at their fair value at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on the basis of fair values or in proportion to the non-controlling interest in the net assets of the acquired entity, as opted for in each particular case. The surplus of the transferred consideration, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity and the fair value at the acquisition date of any previous interest held in the equity of the acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. If the total amount of the transferred consideration, the minority interest recognized and the previous interest held in the acquired entity are lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquired subsidiary, in the event of a purchase at below market price, the difference is directly recognized in the statement of income. Unrealized balances and profits on transactions between entities belonging to the Company are eliminated in consolidation. Unrealized losses are also eliminated. The subsidiaries’ accounting policies have been amended when necessary to ensure that they are in line with the Company’s policies. ii. Changes in the interest in subsidiaries without loss of control The transactions with the non-controlling interest not conducive to a loss of control are recorded as transactions in stockholders’ equity, that is, as transactions with stockholders in their capacity as such. The difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the interest acquired in the book value of the subsidiary’s net assets is recorded in stockholders’ equity. Gains or losses on the sale of non-controlling interest are also recorded in stockholders’ equity. iii. Sale or disposal of subsidiaries When the Company no longer controls, any interest retained in the entity is revalued at fair value, and the change in book value is recorded in income for the year. The fair value is the initial book value for accounting purposes, subsequent to the retained interest in the associate, joint business or financial asset. Any amounts recognized previously recorded in comprehensive income with respect to said entity is accounted for as though the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This implies that amounts previously applied to other comprehensive income are reclassified as income for the year. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 131 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES iv. Associated companies Associates companies are all entities over which the Company exercises significant influence, although not control or joint control, which generally occurs when the Company holds from 20% to 50% of the voting rights in the associate. The company’s investment in associates includes the goodwill related to the acquisition, net of accumulated impairment losses. The existence and effects of the potential voting rights currently exercisable or convertible are consider in evaluating whether or not the Company controls another entity. Furthermore, the Company evaluates the existence of control in cases where it holds no more than 50% of voting rights but is in a position to control financial and operating policy. Acquisition-related costs are charge to income when incurred. The investment in shares of associated companies is value by the equity method. That method is used to initially recorded investments at acquisition cost. Said investments are subsequently value by the equity method, which consists of adjusting the value of the investment by the proportionate part of profits or losses and the distribution of profits by capital reimbursements subject to the acquisition date. If equity in an associated company is reduced but the significant influence is retained, only a portion of the amounts previously applied to comprehensive income will be reclassified to income for the year, when appropriate. Equity in the results of associated companies are recognized in the income statement, and equity in movements in other comprehensive income, subsequent to acquisition, is recognized in other comprehensive income. The Company presents the equity in net profits of associated companies considered integral vehicles through which the Company conducts operations and strategies as part of operating income. Post-acquisition accrued movements are adjusted against the book value of the investment. When the Company’s interest in the losses of an associate equals or exceeds its investment therein, including any other accounts receivable, the Company recognizes no additional losses, unless it has incurred in obligations or has made payments on behalf of the associated company. On each reporting date, the Company determines whether or not there is any objective evidence of impairment of the investment in the associate. If so, the Company calculates impairment as the difference between the recoverable value of the associate and its book value and records that figure in “Equity in losses/gains of associates” by the equity method in the statement of income. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its associates are eliminated according to the interest the Company has in each. Unrealized losses are also eliminated, unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment of the asset transferred. In order to ensure consistency with Company policies, the accounting policies of associates have been modified as appropriate. When the Company no longer exercises significant influence over an associate, any difference between the fair value of the investment retained, including any consideration received from disposal of a portion of the interest, and the book value of the investment is recognized in income for the year. When an investment in associates is transferred due to restructuring under common control, it is valued at fair value by the entity receiving the transfer. v. Joint agreements The Company has applied IFRS 11 to all its joint agreements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified either as a joint operation or a joint business, depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Company has determined that its joint agreement qualifies as a joint operation. In joint operations, each joint operator records its assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the percentages specified in the contractual agreement. A contractual agreement can be a joint agreement even if not all of its parts have joint control over of agreement. Revenue arising from the joint operation regarding goods or services acquired by the Company as joint operator, as well as any unrealized profit with third parties are eliminated as part under consolidation and reflected in the consolidated financial statements until they are realized with third parties. D. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION i. Functional and reporting currency The amounts included in each of the financial statements of the Company’s entities must be measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (functional currency). AC, as ultimate holding entity, chose as its method to determine its functional currency, the Mexican peso, the primary economic environment where it operates as an independent legal entity, therefore, the consolidated financial statements are presented in Mexican pesos. Note 29 provides descriptions of the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries. ii. Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are converted to the functional currency using the exchange rate in effect on the transaction or valuation dates, when items are re-measured. Exchange gains and losses from settlement of those transactions and from conversion of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency at the closing exchange rates are recognized as exchange fluctuations in the statement of income, except when deferred to other comprehensive income because they qualify as cash flow coverage. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 132 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES iii. Conversion of foreign subsidiaries Income and the financial position of all Company entities whose functional currency differs from the Company’s reporting currency are translated to the reporting currency as follows, depending on whether or not the subsidiary’s functional currency is in a hyperinflationary economy. Non-hyperinflationary economy • Assets and liabilities on each statement of financial position presented are converted at the closing exchange rate in effect at the date of the statement of financial position. • The Stockholders’ equity of each statement of financial position presented is converted to the historical exchange rate. • Income, costs and expenses shown in each statement of income are converted at the average exchange rate (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the accumulated effect of transaction rates, in which case, the exchange rate in effect on the transaction date is used). • All resulting exchange differences are recorded under comprehensive income. Goodwill and adjustments to fair value arising at acquisition date of a foreign transaction that are to be measured at fair value are recognized as assets or liabilities of the foreign entity and converted at the closing exchange rate. Exchange differences are recorded in comprehensive income. Hyperinflationary economy • Assets, liabilities (including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising at the acquisition date) and stockholders’ equity of the financial position, as well as the income and expenses shown in the income statements, are translated to the exchange rate prevailing at the close of the statement of financial position, after being restated to their functional currency; and • Assets, liabilities, capital, income and expenses for the comparative period are maintained according to the amounts obtained from the translation of the year in question, that is to say, of the financial statements of the preceding period. Said amounts are not adjusted to subsequent exchange rates, as the Company presents its financial information in Mexican pesos, which correspond to a currency of a non-hyperinflationary economy. When a foreign operation is disposed of, any exchange difference pertaining to net worth is reclassified to the statement of income as part of the gain or loss on disposal. The exchange rates used in preparing these financial statements are as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Pesos to the US dollar 18.87 19.66 Pesos to the Peruvian sol 5.70 5.83 Pesos to the Argentine peso 0.32 0.52 Pesos to the Euro 21.18 22.47 The average exchange rates used in preparing these financial statements are as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Pesos to the US dollar 19.29 19.21 Pesos to the Peruvian sol 5.78 5.83 Pesos to the Argentine peso 0.40 0.70 Pesos to the Euro 21.58 22.63 Translation of financial statements Prior to its translation to pesos, the reporting currency of the consolidated financial statements, the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy are adjusted for inflation so as to reflect changes in the purchasing power of the functional currency. In order to determine whether or not an economy is hyperinflationary, the Company evaluates the qualitative features of the economic environment, as well as the quantitative features established by IFRS, when an inflation rate accrued over the most recent three-year period is equal to 100%. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 133 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Inflation in Argentina As from July 1, 2018, cumulative inflation over the past three years in Argentina exceeded 100%; therefore, the Argentine peso was qualified as the currency of a hyperinflationary economy. As a result of this situation, the financial statements of the subsidiaries located in said country, whose functional currency is the Argentine peso, has been restated as per the requirements of International Accounting Standard 29 “Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies” (IAS 29) and have been consolidated as per the requirements of IAS 21 “The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates”. The purpose of meeting said requirements is to consider the changes in the general purchasing power of the Argentine peso and thus present the financial statements in the current unit of measure at the reporting date. The financial statements of said operations prior to restatement were prepared using the historical cost method. The inflationary adjustment was calculated considering the indexes established by the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils in Economic Sciences (FACPCE) based on the price indexes published by the National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC). The price indexes used for restatement of the financial statements are: YEAR INDEX 2019 283.4442 2018 184.2552 2017 124.7956 The financial information pertaining to the subsidiaries in Argentina are restated as follows: a. The amounts corresponding to non-monetary items of each statement of financial position, that are not measured at the date of the statement of financial position at fair value or net realization value, as applicable, are restated applying the change in the general price index to the historical cost, from the date of acquisition or the date of the last measurement at fair value, to the date of the statement of financial position; b. The amounts corresponding to monetary items shown in the statement of financial position are not restated; c. The components of capital of each statement of financial position are restated: 1) At the start of the first period in which IAS 29 is applied, using the change of a general price index, from the date on which the items originated to the date of restatement, except for retained earnings, which arise from the rest of the balances in the statement of financial position. 2) At the end of the first application period, in subsequent periods, all of the elements of capital are restated, applying a general price index, from the start of the period, or from the date of the contribution, if subsequent. d. Income and expenses are restated applying the change in the general price index, from the date on which the expenses and income were recognized, to the date of the report. e. Gains and losses in purchasing power arising from the net monetary position are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as part of the financial result (Note 25). Initial recognition of hyperinflation in the consolidated financial statements where the reporting currency does not pertain to a hyperinflationary economy does not require changing the comparative balances; therefore, the accumulated effect arises from the existing difference between the equity at the 2017 close corresponding to the subsidiaries in Argentina and the initial equity for 2018, due to the effects of restatement of said entities’ financial information. The accumulated effect of initial application of IAS-29 on the consolidated financial statements amounted $2,998,446 and was recognized in the retained earnings. The Company opted for recognizing the adjustment of the items, including the capital, on the effect of translation of foreign entities, which as of December 31 of 2019 and 2018 was $2,100,710 and $957,439, respectively. On March 3, 2020, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) ratified its agenda decision regarding the translation of a hyperinflationary foreign operation (IAS-21 and IAS-29) and the Company is in the process of analyzing the accounting treatment that it will apply for the accumulated effect derived from the initial application of IAS-29 and its subsequent effects, to modify its accounting policy, having the possibility to choose between the two methods: a) present the effects of hyperinflation and translation to reporting currency in the cumulative translation adjustment of foreign entities if the Company considers that the combination of both effects comply with definition of exchange difference in accordance with IAS-21, or, b) to present in OCI the translation effect if it comply with definition of exchange difference of IAS-21 and, consistent with paragraph 25 of IAS-29, to present hyperinflation effect in equity (split method). 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 134 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES E. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits available for operations and other highly-liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less, all subject to immaterial risk of change in value or country risk. F. CLIENTS AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE Clients and other accounts receivable are amounts owed by clients on goods sold or services provided in the ordinary course of business. Accounts receivable are generally settled within a 90 days term, and are therefore classified as current. Clients and accounts receivable are initially recognized on the basis of the consideration, unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognized at fair value. The Company holds clients and accounts receivable for the objective of collect the contractual cash flows and therefore, measures them subsequently amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The provision for losses is based on assumptions on the risk of default and expected loss rates. The Company applies the simplified approach allowed under IFRS 9, which requires that losses expected over the lifetime of the instruments to be recorded as from initial recognition of accounts receivable and uses judgments upon making these assumptions and upon selecting the data for calculation of impairment, based on the Company’s historical information, in the existing market conditions, as well as in future estimations at the end of each reporting period Due to the short-term nature of the other account receivable, the book value thereof is considered the same as its fair value. For most non-current accounts receivable, fair values are also not significantly different from their book values. G. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Financial assets i. Classification The Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories: • Those subsequently measured at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and • Those measured at amortized cost. The classification depends on the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of cash flows and where these cash flows are consistent with the definition of solely payments of principal and interest. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses are applied to the year’s gain or loss. The Company reclassifies debt instruments when, and only when, its business model for managing those assets changes. ii. Recognition and disposal Regular purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized on the trade date, the date on which the Company agrees to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from financial assets expire or are transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards ownership. iii. Measurement At the initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value profit and loss (FVPL), transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. The transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit and loss. Financial assets with embedded derivatives are entirely considered when determining whether cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest. Debt instruments Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model to manage the asset and the cash-flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories which the Company classifies their debt instruments: • Amortized cost: Assets held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at their amortized cost. Interest income from these financial assets are included in the financial income, using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss, arising on derecognition is recognized directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains (losses) together with for age exchange gain and losses. Impairment losses are presented as a separate line statement of income. • FV-OCI: Assets held for collection of contractual cash flows and for the sale of financial assets, when the cash flows of assets represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FV-OCI). Movements in book value are recognized through other comprehensive income (OCI), except as concerns recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest income and exchange rate gains and losses applied to income. When financial assets are disposed of, the accumulated gain or loss previously recognized in the OCI is reclassified from capital to income and recognized in other income (expenses). Interest income from said financial assets are included in the financial income, using the effective interest rate method. Exchange gains and losses are shown in income and financial costs, and impairment expenses are shown as a separate item in the statement of income. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 135 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES • FVPL: Assets failing to meet the amortized cost or FV-OCI criteria are measured at fair FVPL. A gain or loss in a debt instruments subsequently measured at FVPL is applied to income and shown in net terms in other income (expenses) in the period in which it arises. The Company reclassifies debt instruments when, and only when, it changes its business model for managing those assets. Equity instruments The Company subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of financial assets are recognize in other financial income or expenses in the statement of income as applicable. iv. Impairment The Company assesses on forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments at amortized cost and FV-OCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether a significant increase in credit risk has arisen. For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified method permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recorded recognized as from initial recognition of accounts receivables, see note 8a. for further details. v. Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities were offset and the net amount is shown in the statement of financial position when the right to offset amounts recognized is legally binding and there is the intention to settle them on net bases or to simultaneously realize the asset and pay the liability. The legal right should not be contingent upon future events and must be executable in the regular course of business operations as well as in the event of non-compliance, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, no financial assets and liabilities have been offset. H. DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Recognition of changes in fair value depends on whether or not the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, on the nature of the item hedged. The Company designates certain derivatives as: • Fair value coverage of recognized assets and liabilities or of a firm commitment (fair value hedges). • Hedging of a particular risk related to the cash flows of assets and liabilities recognized. At inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between hedge instruments and the items hedged, the risk-management objective and the strategy for conducting hedging transactions. The fair values of derivative financial instruments designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 21. Movements in the hedge reserve in net capital stock is shown in Note 20. The complete fair value of derivative hedging instruments is classified as a non-current asset or liability, when maturity of the remaining hedge item exceeds 12 months, and as a current asset or liability when maturity of the remaining hedge amount is under 12 months. i. Cash-flow hedging qualifying for hedge accounting The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualified as cash flow hedging is recognized in the cash-flow hedge reserve in capital stock. The gain or loss related to the non-effective portion is immediately applied to income under financial income and expense. When options contracts are used to hedge forecasted transactions, the Company designates only the intrinsic value of options as a hedge instrument. Gains or losses related to the effective portion of the change in the intrinsic value of options are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve under capital stock. The changes in value over time of options related to the hedged item (aligned time value) are applied to other comprehensive income (OCI) in the costs of the hedge reserve in capital stock. When forward contracts are used to hedge forecasted transactions, the Company generally designates only the change in fair value of the forward contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses related to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of forward contracts are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve under capital stock. The change in the forward element of the contract that refers to the hedged item (“aligned forward element”) is recognized in other comprehensive income in the costs of the hedge reserve in capital stock. In some cases, the Company can designate the total change in the fair value of the forward contract (including forward points) as a hedging instrument. In those cases, gains or losses related to the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the overall forward contract are recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve under capital stock. The amounts accumulated in capital stock are reclassified in the periods in which the hedged item is applied to income, as follows: • When, subsequently, the hedged item gives rise to recognition of a non-financial asset, both deferred hedging gains and losses, and the value of the time deferred of options contracts or forwards points (if any) are included in the initial cost of the asset. Deferred amounts are ultimately applied to income for the period, as the hedged item affects the gain or loss. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 136 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES • The gain or loss related to the effective portion of interest rate swaps that cover variable interest rates of loans is applied to income under “financial expenses”, at the same time as the interest expense of the hedged loans. When a hedge instrument matures, it is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, any deferred accumulated gain or loss and hedging costs deferred in capital remain at that time in capital until the forecasted transaction occurs, giving rise to recognition of a non-financial asset. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gain or loss and the deferred hedging costs reported in capital are immediately reclassified to income. ii. Derivatives no qualifying for hedge accounting Certain derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in fair value of any derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are immediately applied to income and included in other income (expenses). I. INVENTORIES Inventory is shown at the lesser of cost and net realization value. Cost is determined using the average cost method. The cost of finished products and of products in progress includes design, raw materials and direct labor costs and other direct costs and general manufacturing expenses (based on regular operating capacity). Borrowing costs are excluded. Net realization value is the sales price estimated in the normal course of Company operations, less the respective variable selling expense. J. NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE Non-current assets (or groups of assets) to be disposed of are classified as held for sale when their book value is mainly recoverable via a sales transaction considered to be highly likely. Those assets are recorded at the lower of the value arrived at by comparing the balance in books and fair value less cost of sales; they are not depreciated or amortized as long as they are classified as held for sale, and are shown separately from other assets in the statement of financial position. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company holds no assets available for sale. K. PREPAYMENTS Prepayments represent disbursements made by the Company for insurance, advertising or leases where the benefits and risks inherent in the goods to be acquired or the services to be received (such as prepaid insurance premiums) have not yet been transferred. L. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, except for those assets in Argentina, considered an hyperinflationary economy, that are expressed in terms of the current unit of measure at the closing date of the period reported, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The cost includes expenses directly attributable to acquisition of the asset. Subsequent costs are included in the book value of the asset or recorded as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when the Company is likely to receive future economic benefits arising from the same and the cost of the property, plant and equipment can be reliably determined. The carrying amount of replaced parts is derecognized. Repair and maintenance expenses are recognized in the statement of income in the year in which they are incurred. Significant improvements are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset in question. Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method, considering each components separately. Following are the average useful lives of the families of assets: Buildings 30 70 years Machinery and equipment 10 25 years Transportation equipment 10 15 years Furniture and other equipment 3 10 years Bottles and delivery containers 2 7 years Refrigerators and sales equipment 10 years Computer equipment 4 years Land and investments in process are valued at cost and are not depreciated. Spares and parts for use over more than a year attributable to specific machinery are classified as property, plant and equipment under other fixed assets. The costs pertaining to general and specific loans directly related to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which require a substantial period (12 months or more), are capitalized to form part of the acquisition cost of said qualifying assets until the moment they are ready to be used for the intended purpose. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the determination of said costs is based on specific and general financing. The residual and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period and if expectations differ from prior estimates, the changes are recorded as a change in accounting estimate. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 137 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Assets classified as property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment testing when there are events or circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recovered. An impairment loss corresponds to the amount at which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recovery value. Recovery value is the greater of fair value net of selling costs and the asset’s value in use. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recovery value, impairment of an asset’s carrying value is recognized and the asset is immediately recognized at its recovery value. Gains or losses on asset disposals are determined by comparing the sales value and the carrying value and are recognized in “Other income (expenses), net” in the statement of income. Returnable and non-returnable containers (bottles) Company operations involve both returnable and non-returnable containers. Returnable containers are recorded as fixed assets under property, plant and equipment and are depreciated by the straight-line method, based on their estimated useful lives. Under certain historic operating practices in certain territories, returnable containers provided to customers are subject to agreements whereby the Company retains ownership of the container and requires the customer to pay a deposit. The container is controlled by the Company via its commercial distribution network and the Company is entitled to charge customers for identifiable breakage. Non-returnable containers are recorded in consolidated income as part of cost of sales, at the time of sale. M. LEASES The Company adopted IFRS-16 “Leases” as of January 1, 2019, when application of this standard became mandatory, using of the modified retrospective method. The Company leases various offices, warehouses, machinery, equipment and vehicles. Rental contracts are typically made for fixed periods but may have extension options. Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. The lease agreements do not impose any covenants other than the security interests in the leased assets that are held by the lessor. Leased assets may not be used as guarantee for borrowing purposes. Contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. The company allocates the consideration in the contract to the lease and non-lease components based on their relative stand-alone prices. However, for leases of real estate and transportation equipment for which the Company is a lessee, it has elected to apply the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and instead accounts for these as a single lease component. Leases are recognized as a right-of-use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is available for use by the company. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following: • The amount of the initial measurement of lease liability, and • Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date. Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset’s useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis. IFRS 16 offers practical expedients, therefore, payments associated with short-term leases and leases of insignificant value assets are recognized on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise computer and telecommunication equipment and small items of office furniture. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments: • Fixed payments and • Variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate Lease payments to be made under reasonably certain extension options to be exercised are also included in the measurement of the liability. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if readily determined, or the incremental interest rate of the Company, being the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, guarantee and conditions. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, the company: • Where possible, uses recent third-party financing received by the individual lessee as a starting point, adjusted to reflect changes in financing conditions since third party financing was received 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 138 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES • Uses a build-up approach that starts with a risk-free interest rate adjusted for credit risk for leases held by those subsidiaries, which does not have recent third party financing, and • Makes adjustments specific to the lease, ei. term, country, currency and security. The Company is exposed to possible future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and is adjusted against the right-of-use. Lease payments are allocated between principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. In determining the lease term, Management considers all facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Extension options (or periods after termination options) are only included in the lease terms if there is a reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or not terminated). Accounting policies applied until December 31, 2018 Until December 31, 2018, the Company classified the leases as financial or operating leases depends on the substance of the transaction rather than on the form of the contract. Leasing in which a significant portion of the risks and benefits pertaining to ownership were retained by the lessor was classified as operating leasing. Payments made under operating leasing (net of any incentive received by the lessor) were charged to the statement of income by the straight line method over the term of the lease. Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and benefits of the leased property were classified as financial leases. Financial leases were capitalized at the outset of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of minimum lease payments. If determination was practical for discounting minimum payments at present value, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used; otherwise, the incremental rate on the lessee’s loan was used. All of the lessee’s initial direct costs were added to the original figure recorded as an asset. All lease payments were applied to liabilities and the financial charges until a constant rate for the balance was achieved. The respective lease obligations were included in non-current debt, net of financial charges. Interest on financial costs was charged to income for the year during the lease period so as to produce a periodic constant interest rate in the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under financial leases were depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. N. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill represents the acquisition cost of a subsidiary in excess of the Company’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, determined at the acquisition date. Goodwill is shown separately in the statement of financial position under “Goodwill and intangible assets, net” and is recorded at cost, except for those assets in Argentina considered an hyperinflationary economy that are expressed in terms of the current unit of measure at the closing date of the period reported, less accumulated impairment losses, which are not reversed. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the book value of goodwill related to the entity sold. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill is assigned to the cash generating units. The assignment is made to cash generating units or cash generating groups of units expected to benefit from the business combination from which the goodwill arises, identified in accordance with the respective operating segment. Intangible assets are recorded when they are identifiable, they provide future economic benefits and there is control over such benefits. Intangible assets are classified as follows: i. Indefinite-life intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment testing. To date, no factors have been determined that might limit the useful life of these intangible assets. Indefinite life intangible assets consist mainly of: a) bottler agreements entered into by the Company with TCCC, which grant rights to product, bottle and distribute TCCC products in the territories in which the Company operates, b) brands with which Nacional de Alimentos y Helados, S. A. de C. V. (Nayhsa), Wise Foods, Deep River, Tonicorp and Inalecsa market their products, which are considered of high value and positioning in the market and c) Tonicorp, Monster Energy and Ades distribution rights. The aforementioned bottler agreements have specific expiration dates and do not guarantee they are perpetual; however, based on own experience and market evidence, the Company considers it will continue to renew these agreements and has thus assigned them as indefinite life intangible assets (see Notes 5, 12, and 27). Brands and distribution rights have no expiration and are those used by the Company to operate in its snack and dairy product segments. Those in definite-life intangible assets are assigned to cash-generating units (CGU) for impairment-testing purposes. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 139 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES ii. Defined-useful-life assets are recognized at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairment losses recognized. They are amortized by the straight-line method, according to the useful life, determined based on expected future economic benefits, and are subject to testing when there is evidence of impairment. These intangible assets correspond to the non-compete agreements of some business combinations and to certain distribution rights, certain brands and software, which are amortized in 5, 10 and 30 year periods according to each asset’s features (see Note 12). The estimated useful lives of definite-life and indefinite-life intangible assets are reviewed annually. O. IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS Assets with an undefined useful life, such as goodwill, are not depreciated or amortized and are subject to impairment testing once a year or before that when there are indications of impairment. Assets subject to amortization are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value might not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recovery value. The recovery value of an asset is defined as the higher between the value-in-use and the fair value of an asset less the related sales costs. In order to evaluate impairment, assets are grouped based on the minimum levels of cash flows that can be identified separately (cash generating unit). Impaired non-financial assets other than goodwill are reviewed in search of possible impairment reversal on each reporting date. P. SUPPLIERS AND OTHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE These balances represent liabilities arising from goods and services provided to the Company prior to the period end, that have not been paid. Suppliers and other accounts payable are presented as current liabilities, unless the payment is not due within 12 months following the reporting period. They are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently valued at amortized cost, using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amounts of trade and other payables are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature. Q. DEBT The debt is initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. The debt is subsequently recognized at amortized cost. Any differences between the amounts received (net of transaction costs) and the settlement value are recognized in the statement of income during the term of the loan, using the effective interest rate method. Loans are eliminated from the statement of financial position when the obligation specified in the contract is met, canceled or expires. The difference between the book amount of a financial liability that has been canceled or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including non-monetary assets transferred or assumed liabilities, is applied to income as other financial income or costs. R. FACTORING A liability owed to suppliers is eliminated from the statement of financial position when it is settled, that is to say, when the obligation is eliminated, canceled, or expires. The Company contracts financial factoring for financing of accounts payable to suppliers in Peru and when changes in terms and conditions indicate that the liability owed to suppliers is no longer extant, a new financial liability is considered to be owed to the factoring entity, resulting in cancellation of the original liability owed to the supplier. S. INCOME TAXES Income taxes reflected in the statement of income represent tax incurred in the year, as well as the effects of deferred taxes on income determined by the method of assets and liabilities, applying the rate established in current legislation or substantially enacted and in effect on the balance sheet date in the location in which the Company operates, and generate taxable income from all temporary differences determined by comparing the book and tax values of assets and liabilities expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled, considering any unamortized tax losses prior to analysis of recovery. Tax is applied to income, except to the extent it relates to other comprehensive income, in which case, tax is recorded in other comprehensive income. The effect of changes in tax rates is recognized in income for the period in which the rate change is determined. Management periodically evaluates positions declared in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable legislation is subject to interpretation. The Company recognizes provisions when necessary based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. A deferred tax asset is recorded only when there is likely to be future taxable income against which to apply deductions arising from temporary differences. Deferred taxes on income applicable to temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint agreements is recorded, except when the temporary difference reversal period is controlled by the Company and temporary differences may not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is the legal right to do so and when taxes are collected by same the tax authority. T. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Company provides the following employee plans: 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 140 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES i. Pension plans Defined contribution plans: A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions to a separate entity. The Company has no legal or assumed obligations to pay additional contributions if the fund fails to maintain sufficient assets with which to pay all employees the benefits related to service in the current and past periods. Contributions are recorded as employee benefit expenses on the date on which the contribution is due. Defined benefit plans: A benefit plan is defined as the pension benefit to be received by an employee upon retirement, which usually depends on one or more factors, such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the statement of financial position with respect to defined-benefit plans is the present value of the definedbenefit obligation at the end of the accounting period, less the fair value of plan assets. Obligations for defined benefits are calculated annually by independent actuaries via the projected unit credit method. The present value of defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using discount rates (per IAS 19) denominated in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid and with maturity dates are similar to those of the pension liability. In countries with no in-depth market for said instruments, market rates for government bonds are used. Remeasurements of the liability caused by gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to stockholders’ equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The cost of past services is recognized immediately in income. ii. Termination benefits Termination benefits are paid when the Company terminates employment prior to the regular retirement date or when an employee accepts termination of employment in exchange for those benefits. The Company recognizes termination benefits when there is a verifiable commitment to conclude the work relationship of certain employees and a formal detailed plan providing so and that cannot be surrendered. In the event there is an offer that encourages employee resignation, the related termination benefits are valued based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. The benefits payable over the long-term are discounted at present value. iii. Short-term benefits The Company provides short-term employee benefits, which can include wages, salaries, annual bonuses and bonuses payable over the following 12 months. The Company recognizes a provision when it is contractually obligated or when the former practice has created an obligation. iv. Employees’ statutory profit sharing and bonuses The Company records a liability and an expense for bonuses and employee profit-sharing when it has a legal or assumed obligation to pay those benefits and determines the amount to be recorded based on profits for the year, after certain adjustments. U. PROVISIONS Liability provisions represent a present legal obligation or an obligation assumed as a result of past events where resources are likely to be required to comply with the obligation, when the amount in question has been reliably estimated. No provisions are recorded for future operating losses. Provisions are measured at the present value of the amount necessary to cover the obligation at the date of the financial statements and are recorded on the basis of management’s best estimation. V. CAPITAL STOCK The Company’s common stock is classified as capital. Incremental costs attributable directly to the issuance of new shares are included in equity as a deduction of the consideration received, net of taxes, nevertheless although the Company has incurred in no such costs. W. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME Comprehensive income Consists of net income, plus remeasurement of the defined-benefit liability and other capital reserves, net of taxes, which are composed of the effects of conversion of foreign entities, the effects of derivative financial instruments for cash flow hedging and interest in other items of the comprehensive income of associates, as well as other items required by a specific provision to be reflected in stockholders’ equity, which do not constitute capital contributions, reductions or distributions. X. FUND FOR REPURCHASE OF OWN SHARES The Stockholders periodically authorize disbursement of a maximum amount for the acquisition of own shares. Own shares acquired are shown as a decrease in the fund for repurchase of own shares included in the consolidated statement of financial position under retained earnings, and are valued at their acquisition cost. These amounts are stated at their historical cost. Dividends received are recognized by decreasing their historical cost. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 141 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES With respect to the sale of shares from the repurchase fund, the amount obtained in excess or deficit of their historical cost is recognized in the premium on the sale of shares. Y. SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment reporting is presented consistently with the internal reports provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the highest authority for making operating decisions, allocation the resources and evaluating the operating segments’ yield. Z. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company manufactures and sells carbonated and non-carbonated beverages under TCCC’s trademarks, dairy products, foodstuff and snacks wholesale, in the markets in which it operates, based on formal and informal agreements entered into with different customers in the Modern and Traditional Channel, in which prices are negotiated continually, given the turnover of products and the competitiveness it must maintain in the market. Income from these sales is recognized at the fair value of the consideration collected or to be collected and represents the amounts receivable on the sale of products, net of discounts, returns and taxes. The Company recognizes revenue when control of the products is transferred, which is when the products are delivered to the customer, and there is unsatisfied obligation that could affect acceptance of the products by the customer. Delivery is effective when the products are delivered to the specific location, the risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and the customer has accepted the products. Further to the above, it is concluded that the Company’s revenue is generated at a specific point in time. In the Modern Channel, retail products are sold at a discount for volume, based on total sales during the period, which is usually under 12 months, given the dynamics of displacement of the products in the market. Revenue on these sales is recognized based on the price established in the agreements, net of discounts for estimated volume. Accumulated experience is used to estimate and foresee discounts, using the expected value method. No element of financing is considered present, due to the fact that sales are, for the most part, made in cash for the Traditional Channel, or with a credit term for the Modern Channel. An account receivable is recognized when the products are delivered and the payment is not in cash, and only the passage of time is required before the payment is made. Sales discounts are considered variable consideration and are reflected in the client’s invoices, therefore, discounts are recorded at the time of sale, that is, revenue is recorded net of discounts. The list price is already discounted; therefore, make an estimate is not needed. AA. EARNINGS PER SHARE The basic profit per share is calculated dividing the net profit attributable to the controlling interest by the weighted average of common shares outstanding during the year. The amounts used in the determination of the basic profit per share are adjusted on the basis of the diluted profits from taking into account the weighted average of the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding, assuming the conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares. BB. BOTTLER INCENTIVE AGREEMENT At its discretion, and as per the bottler’s incentive agreement, TCCC provides the Company a number of incentives, including contributions for the maintenance of equipment of cold drinks, advertising and marketing expenses, and others. The terms and conditions of those agreements require reimbursement when certain stipulated conditions are not met, including minimum volume performance requirements. Incentives provided by TCCC for maintenance of beverage refrigeration equipment and/or advertising and marketing expenses are deducted from the respective expense. NOTE 4 RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: I. RISK MANAGEMENT The Company’s operations are exposed to different financial risks: market risk (including exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and risk for price of production materials and other production materials), credit risk and liquidity risk. It is Company policy to contract derivative financial instruments held only for hedging, in order to reduce the risks related to its financial liabilities, and to cover certain purchases, projected operations and firm commitments set in foreign currencies. The exposure to credit, market and liquidity risks is managed through the Company’s Financial Risk Committee. The company’s main exposure to financial risk is mainly related to the security liabilities at variable interest rates and to present or future currency commitments, all related to its line of business or certain forecasted operations, such as prices of raw material and other production materials, accounts receivable from customers and liquidity. The Company has current Master Agreements for Derivative Financial Instrument Operations or ISDA Master Agreements in order to ensure that a number of quotations are available when deciding whether to carry out transactions with instruments of that type, which are used only for raw material exchange rate price coverage, and are documented in simple instruments such as swaps and forwards. The company’s operations with swaps allow only the conversion of different currencies or interest rates (variable or fixed or vice versa). 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 142 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES All the Company’s derivative financial instrument operations are previously analyzed, approved and periodically monitored by the Financial Risk Committee. That committee submits proposals to the General Director, who in turn periodically informs the Board of Directors. Both the Financial Risk Committee and the General Director review the performance of those instruments on a quarterly basis, and make any required advance cancellations, changes in term, etc. The Company’s derivative financial instrument operations are contracted and managed by the corporate office, which contracts any necessary transactions for its subsidiary companies which do not contract this type of operations individually. CL and CCSWB are exceptions to that rule, i.e., they handle their own operations. The Company operates that type of agreement with recognized banking and financial entities with a robust operating and financial structure. Market risk a. Foreign currency risk (exchange rate) The foreign currency risk is related to the risk of the fair value of future cash flows from a financial instruments fluctuating due to changes in the exchange rate. The Company is exposed to exchange rate risks stemming from: a) its net exposure of foreign currency assets and liabilities, b) income from export sales; c) purchases of raw materials, production materials and capital investments made in foreign currencies, and d) the net investment in subsidiaries and joint operations held abroad. The Company’s greatest exchange risk exposure is the exchange rate of the Mexican peso to the US dollar, the Peruvian sol and the Argentine peso for conversion of investments to the reporting currency. It is Company policy to operate mainly in the markets in which its subsidiaries reside. Accordingly, debt is contracted in said markets’ local currency, except Mexico and Peru (see Note 14). Net sales are expressed in Mexican pesos, Argentine pesos, US dollars and Peruvian soles. During 2019 and 2018, 41.81% and 40.08% of sales were generated in Mexican pesos, 3.43% and 5.11% in Argentine pesos, 44.17% and 44.07% in US dollars, and 10.59% and 10.74% in Peruvian soles. Those are the functional currencies of each of the consolidating entities (see Note 29). Following is the Company’s exposure to exchange risk at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The enclosed tables show the book value of the Company’s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Figures in thousands of Mexican pesos At December 31, 2019 2018 US ARGENTINE PERUVIAN US ARGENTINE PERUVIAN DOLLAR PESO SOL DOLLAR PESO SOL Monetary assets $ 22,490,180 $ 1,393,766 $ 3,967,996 $ 19,011,822 $ 1,667,814 $ 3,266,166 Monetary liabilities (16,066,718) (647,819) (3,429,770) (12,999,022) (1,263,591) (4,013,324) Non-current (22,752,584) (100,446) (1,670,940) (25,604,347) (167,970) (1,843,885) monetary liabilities Net position $ (16,329,122) $ 645,501 $ (1,132,714) $ (19,591,547) $ 236,253 $ (2,591,043) Following is a sensitivity analysis related to the adverse impact on the comprehensive income the Company would have due to its exposure to the net foreign currency position at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively: Hypothetical variation (maintaining all other variables constant) 2019 2018 One-peso increase to the dollar $ (865,225) $ (996,691) A 50-cent increase / decrease with respect to the Argentine peso (1,024,039) (225,906) A 50-cent increase / decrease with respect to the Peruvian sol 99,392 222,007 This exposure is to the movements in exchange rates related to conversion from US dollars, Argentine pesos and Peruvian soles to Mexican pesos of the results, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries in the US, Argentina, Ecuador and Peru. As detailed later in this Note, the Company also contracts coverage derivative financial instruments to cover certain commitments in foreign-currency involving the purchase of raw materials and other production materials. The Company does not cover the risks related to conversion of its subsidiaries and joint operations, the effects of which are recorded in stockholders’ equity. The intrinsic value of foreign currency options is determined with respect to the spot exchange rate of the relevant market. The difference between the exercise rate contracted and the market’s discounted spot exchange rate is determined as the time value. It is discounted when it is material. Changes in the time value of options related to hedged elements are deferred in the costs of the hedging reserve in capital and the time value is amortized linearly to income. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 143 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES See Note 21 for further information on foreign currency risk hedging instruments. b. Interest rate risk The interest rate risk arises mainly from the Company’s sources of financing. The main exposure comes from variable interest rate obligations based on the TIIE (Interbank interest rate) and bank debt subject to LIBOR interest. Fixed rates expose the company to the fair value risk. The Company occasionally enters into derivative financial instrument agreements with a view to minimizing the market risk and the potential effects arising from a significant rise in interest rates. The derivative financial instruments occasionally contracted by the Company are interest rate swaps on security liabilities subject to variable interest rates. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company maintains an interest rate swap to hedge $1,000,000 from variable rate to a fixed rate at 7.369% (see Note 14). Additionally, at December 31, 2019, the Company maintains two interest rate swaps to hedge $2,450,000 from variable rate to a fixed rate at 7.225%. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, a large part of the debt, considering its value in pesos, was referred to a fixed interest rate. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 $38,282 and $40,816 million representing 72% and 73% of the overall debt, was referenced to a fixed interest rate. In order to manage interest rate risks, Company policy is designed to reduce volatility of its financial expenses and keep an ideal percentage of debt in fixed rate instruments. The financial position is mainly fixed as a result of the use of long and short term debt and the occasional use of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps. The terms and conditions of the Company’s obligations at December 31, 2019 and 2018, including exchange rates, interest rates, maturities and effective interest rates, are described in detail in Note 14. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, if the TIIE or the LIBOR has risen by more than 100 base points (1.00%), all other risk factors remaining constant, the detrimental impact on comprehensive income would have been $134,336 and $10,460 ($133,045 and $14,693 in 2018), respectively. See Note 21 for further information on foreign currency risk hedging instruments. c. Risk of price of raw materials The main exposure to variations in the prices of raw materials and other production materials has to do with the supply of sweeteners, diesel, aluminum for cans and plastic containers used in the production of soft drinks. The main raw materials and other production materials are concentrates acquired from TCCC, sweeteners, diesel, aluminum for cans and plastic containers. The Company is exposed to the risk of exchange fluctuations related to the prices of sweeteners, diesel, aluminum for cans and plastic containers, which, in the aggregate, represent approximately 22% (23% in 2018) of the cost of sales of beverages at December 31, 2019. The Company contracts hedges for the purchase of these raw materials and other production materials with a view to offsetting the effect of variations in exchange rates (see Note 21). At December 31, 2019, appreciation of one Mexican pesos or one Peruvian to the US dollar, with all other variables remaining constant, would have had a (negative) positive impact on valuation of derivative financial instruments in stockholders’ equity of ($556) and $611, respectively. The impact on net income for the period would not be material because the instruments exposing the Company to those risks are under highly effective cash flow hedging. See Note 21 for further information on instruments for hedging against the risk of raw and other production materials. Credit risk Regular operations expose the Company to potential default when its customers and counterparties are unable to comply with their financial or other commitments. The Company mitigates this risk by entering into transactions with a wide range of counterparties and considers that third parties that could affect its operations are unlikely to give rise to unexpected financial difficulties. The Company has established conservative policies for the management of cash and temporary investments which make it possible to minimize the risk arising from that type of financial asset, aside from which, operations are conducted only with highly accredited financial entities. The risk exposure related to accounts receivable is limited, given the large number of customers located in different parts of Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador and the US; however, the Company maintains certain reserves for impairment losses of accounts receivable from customers. Risk control includes determining the credit standing of the customer, taking into account its financial situation, past experience and other factors. Given the fact that a significant portion of the Company’s customers have no independent rating of their credit standing, management determines the maximum rated risk for each, considering their financial position and past experiences, among other factors. Credit limits are set in accordance with policies established by management, which applies controls to ensure compliance. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 144 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES During 2019 and 2018, approximately 44.9% and 50%, respectively, of the Company’s sales were in cash. As much as 48.3% and 40.5% of net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively, were made to institutional customers. See Note 8 for further information on credit risk. Liquidity risk The Company finances its liquidity requirements and capital resources mainly through the cash generated from operations and debt and private bonds issued at short, medium and long term. The Company has access to local and international bank credit to cover its treasury requirements, aside from which, it has been assigned the highest rating for Mexican issuers (AAA) and a rating of A and A2, both issued by independent rating agencies, which makes it possible to evaluate local and international capital markets in the event that resources are needed. The Company cash surpluses are invested according to the guidelines established by the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of the Planning and Finance Committee. The Financial Risk Committee, comprising basically executives from the Financial and Planning Management areas, decides on a series of custodian entities of proven prestige and liquidity. Foreign-currency investments in specific projects are authorized only in US dollars or euros. The Company does not invest in capital markets or investment companies and repurchase operations are entered into only with federal Mexican and US government paper. Those operations are conducted with the largest and most prestigious banks in Mexico. The foreign banks in which investments can be made are those with the greatest international coverage. Investments are made in Federal Government and Bank Debt Securities. AC does not invest in Private and/or Corporate Paper. The factors that could reduce the sources of liquidity include a significant reduction in demand or the price of its products, which could limit the amount of cash generated from its operations, and a reduction in the corporate credit rating, which could impair the Company’s liquidity and increase its new debt costs. The Company’s liquidity may also be affected by factors such as depreciation or appreciation of the peso and changes in interest rates. Company settles obligations with cash flows arising from operations. The Company’s remaining contractual maturities of financial liabilities, which include basically capital and interest payable in the future up to the date of maturity at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are: UNDER 1 1 TO 3 3 TO 5 OVER 5 TOTAL YEAR YEARS YEARS YEARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2019 Current and non-current debt $ 9,932,223 $ 24,852,723 $ 7,443,360 $ 27,759,719 $ 69,988,025 Suppliers, related parties, derivative finan11,589,415 225,843 11,815,258 cial instruments and sundry creditors Lease liabilities current and non-current 406,898 470,026 273,734 446,533 1,597,191 $ 21,928,536 $ 25,322,749 $ 7,942,937 $ 28,206,252 $ 83,400,474 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 Current and non-current debt $ 6,170,583 $ 27,800,510 $ 11,278,727 $ 31,192,028 $ $76,441,848 Suppliers, related parties, derivative finan12,825,615 6,034 12,831,649 cial instruments and sundry creditors $ 18,996,198 $ 27,800,510 $ 11,284,761 $ 31,192,028 $ 89,273,497 At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has not unused credit facilities. ii. Capital management The Company goal in managing its capital (which includes stockholders’ equity, debt, working capital, and cash and cash equivalents) is to maintain a flexible capital structure that will reduce the capital cost to an acceptable level of risk, protect the Company’s ability to continue operating as a going concern, and to take advantage of strategic opportunities that will allow it to generate returns for the shareholders. The Company manages its capital structure and adjusts it when changes arise in economic conditions and in the risk features of the underlying assets. The Company monitors its capital based on the Net Debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio. That ratio is calculated by dividing the Net Debt by the EBITDA, which is the way in which the Company measures is operating cash flow. The net debt is calculated by subtracting the cash and cash equivalents balance from the total debt (including the current and non-current portions, as shown in the consolidated statement of financial position). The Net Debt to EBITDA ratio at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows: 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 145 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V.

NOTE 5 ACCOUNTING ESTIMATIONS AND JUDGMENTS: The Company has identified certain key accounting estimations on which its financial condition and results of operations depend. Those accounting estimations normally involve an analysis or are based on subjective judgments or decisions that require management to make estimations and assumptions affecting the figures reported in these consolidated financial statements. The Company’s estimates are based on historical information when applicable, and other assumptions considered reasonable in the circumstances. Current results can differ from those estimated under different assumptions or conditions. Furthermore, estimations normally require adjustments based on changing circumstances and on securing more recent or more accurate information. When preparing these consolidated financial statements, the most critical accounting estimations under IFRS are those requiring management to prepare estimations and assumptions affecting the reported figures involved in determining the value in use for identification of impairment of indefinite-life intangible assets, fair-value accounting for financial instruments, goodwill and other indefinite-life intangible assets such as the result of business acquisitions and pension benefits. A. ESTIMATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FIGURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: i. Estimated impairment of indefinite-life intangible assets. The identification and measurement of impairment in indefinite-life intangible assets, including goodwill, involves the estimation of fair value (value in use or fair value. Those estimations and assumptions could have a significant impact on the decision as to whether or not to recognize a charge for impairment and on the magnitude of that charge. The Company analyzes valuation considering relevant internal information as well as public market information. Fair value estimations are mainly determined on the basis of discounted cash flows and market comparisons. Those approaches use significant estimations and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including terms), discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows, multiples of exit cash flows, perpetual growth rates, determination of appropriate market comparable and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparable. Certain level of risk inherent in these estimates and assumptions that the Company considers has been made in its valuations is possible, since in case the actual results were lower than the estimates an impairment charge would have to be recorded. ii. Pension benefits The present value of pension-related obligations depends on the number of factors determined on an actuarial basis, using a number of different assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost (income) of/for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. The Company determines the proper discount rate at each year end. That rate is the interest rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle pension plan obligations. To determine the proper discount rate, the Company considers the discount interest rate as per IAS 19 “Employee benefits”, expressed in the currency in which the benefits are to be paid, at maturity dates approximating the dates pertaining to the pension obligation (see Note 17). B. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING THE COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE AS FOLLOWS: i. Investments in associates Management has evaluated the level of influence exercised by the Company on its investment in Jugos del Valle, S. A. P. I. and has determined that it exercises significant influence, although it shareholding is below 20%, given its representation on the Board of Directors and certain contractual terms. Consequently, that investment has been classified as an associate. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 146 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES ii. Interest in joint operation Management has evaluated the terms and conditions contained in the stockholders’ agreement for joint agreement of JV Toni, S.L. in Holding Tonicorp, S.A. (Tonicorp) and has concluded that it should be classified as a Joint Operation because it considers that the design and purpose require AC’s beverage business in Ecuador to acquire, distribute and market the Tonicorp production, thus transferring to the two stockholders jointly controlling the agreement substantially the rights to the benefits and liability obligations of Tonicorp and its subsidiaries, which according to IFRS 11 ,”Joint Agreements”, requires the agreement to be classified as such (see Note 29). iii. Useful lives of intangible assets The Company’s indefinite life intangible assets include the aforementioned bottler agreements entered into between AC and TCCC, which have specific expiration dates and do not guarantee they are perpetual; however, based on own experience, during the business relationship of over 90 years with TCCC, and market evidence, the Company considers it will continue to renew these agreements and has thus assigned them as indefinite life intangible assets (see Note 27). NOTE 6 SEGMENT REPORTING: Segment reporting is presented consistently with the internal reports provided to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the highest authority for making operating decisions, allocation the resources and evaluating the operating segments’ yield. An operating segment is defined as a component of an entity on which there is separate financial information which is evaluated on a regular basis. The Company controls and evaluates its continuous operations from both a geographic and product perspective. Management considers performance in Mexico, the US, Ecuador, Argentina and Peru. From the perspective of the product, management considers beverages and other products in those geographic areas separately. Segments, by product to be reported by the Company, are: • Beverages (including carbonated, non-carbonated, dairy beverages and carboy and individual format purified water): This segment produces, distributes and sells TCCC brand beverages in different territories in Mexico, the US, Argentina, Ecuador and Peru as well as Santa Clara dairy beverages in Mexico and Toni in Ecuador. The Company’s portfolio of beverages and dairy products includes cola and flavored soft drinks, individual purified and flavored water, dairy beverages and other carbonated and non-carbonated beverages in sundry presentations. • Other segments complementary businesses: This section represents operating segments that are not considered reportable segments on an individual basis, as they do not meet the quantitative limits, as established in the standard applicable to any of the years reported on. In accordance with this standard, the operating segments whose total income is equal to or under 10% of the Company’s total income need not be reported individually and can be grouped with other operating segments that do not meet the 10% limit, provided the sum of these grouped operating segments does not exceed 25% of total income. These segments comprise the following complementary businesses: a. Beverages in the individual format that are marketed in vending machines (Mexico and Peru). b. Snack food (Mexico, Ecuador, Peru and the US). The Company evaluates the performance of each of the operating segments based on profits before the net financial results, taxes, depreciation, amortization (operating flow or EBITDA), considering that said indicator represents a good measure for evaluating the operating performance and the capability to satisfy capital and interest obligations with respect to the Company’s debt, as well as the capability to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. However, the EBITDA is not a financial performance measure under IFRS and should not be considered an alternative to net income when measure operating performance, or to cash flows when measuring liquidity. The Company has defined the EBITDA or operating flow as a consolidated operating profit (loss) after adding or subtracting the following, as the case may be: (1) depreciation, amortization, and (2) non-recurring expenses incurred (such as severance, business combination expenses among others, classified in the Other expenses line item, net in the statement of income). Operations between operating segments are carried out at market value and accounting policies used in preparing information per segment are consistent with those described in Note 3. Following is condensed financial information on the operating segments to be reported on: 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 147 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V.

The Company applies the simplified approach contained in IFRS 9 for measuring expected credit losses, using an expected loss provision over the lifetime of the instrument for all accounts receivable from customers. In order to measure expected credit losses, accounts receivable from customers have been grouped on the basis of their shared credit risk features and days past due. The expected loss rates are based on the profiles for payment of sales in a 24-month period prior to December 31, 2019 or December 31, 2018, respectively, and on historical credit losses experienced within that period. Historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and prospective information on macroeconomic factors affecting client capacity to settle the accounts receivable. On that basis, the provision for losses at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was determined as follows for accounts receivable from customers: 1 TO 30 31 TO 60 61 TO 90 91 TO MORE OTHER DECEMBER 31, 2019 CURRENT DAYS DAYS DAYS 180 DAYS THAN 180 TOTAL CURRENT PAST DUE PAST DUE PAST DUE PAST DUE DAYS PAST DUE Average rate of 1.30% 1.30% 1.30% 1.30% 1.30% 81.51% expected loss Gross book amount of $ 160,929 $ 7,286,627 $ 836,236 $ 111,532 $ 67,661 $ 124,706 $ 344,919 $ 8,932,610 accounts receivable Loss provision $ $ (91,355) $ (14,358) $ (1,273) $ (785) $ (5,652) $ (228,718) $ (342,141) 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 150 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S.

Indicators showing that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, among others, the fact that the debtor suggests no payment plan to the Company and the impossibility of making contractual payments over a period of more than 180 days past due. Impairment losses from accounts receivable is shown as net impairment losses under operating income. Subsequent recovery of amounts previously canceled are credited to the same line. B. FINANCIAL ASSETS AT AMORTIZED COST Other assets at amortized cost, which includes accounts receivable from related parties, are also subject to impairment requirements under IFRS 9. The impairment loss identified is immaterial. C.

A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES At December 31, 2019, except for Beverages Ecuador and Toni CGUs, the estimation of the recovery value of the CGUs identified was conducted through the value in use, using the revenue approach. The value in use was determined by discounting future cash flows generated by the continuous use of the CGUs, using the following key assumptions, among others: Range among CGUs 2019 2018 Rate of growth in volume 0.5% 3.3% 2.0% 4.8% Rate of growth in income 1 3.7% 35.1% 6.7% 11.7% Operating margin (as a % of income) 5.0% 22.5% 5.3% 23.0% Other operating costs 5.1% 24.6% 4.8% 24.8% Annual CAPEX (as a % of income) 1.8% 7.6% 9.9% 2.1% Discount rate 5.8% 15.5% 4.7% 11.9% (1) Including the hyperinflation effects At December 31, 2019 and 2018: • The determination of cash flows is based on the financial projections approved by Management for a five-year period and considering a multiple of operating cash flow to perpetuity and are dependent on the expected growth rates of the volume, which are based in historical performances and the expectation of growth of the industry in which AC operates. • The discount rate was calculated based on the weighted average of the capital (at market value) of the cost of all sources of financing that form part of the capital structure of CGUs (liabilities with cost and shareholding capital) and reflect the specific risks related to AC’s relevant operating segments. • The volume of sales is the average growth rate over the five years projection period. It is based on past performance and Management expectations for market development. • The sales price is the average growth rate over the five years projection period. It is based on actual industry trends and includes long-term inflation forecasts for each territory. • The operating margin corresponds to the average margin as a percentage of income over the five-year projection period. It is based on actual sales margin levels and product mixture. Given the nature of the operation, no increases are expected in the cost of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers, which may have required an adjustment in the determination of future margins. • Other operating costs are fixed costs of CGUs, as a percentage of income, which do not differ significantly from sales volumes and prices. Management projected those costs on the basis of the current business structure, and adjusted increases for inflation. They do not reflect any future restructuring or cost reduction measures. The percentages disclosed above are the average of other operating costs for the five-year projected period with respect to income. • Annual CAPEX represents the percentage of income for investing in machinery and equipment in order to maintain operations at current levels. It is based on historical management experience and on plans for machinery and equipment replacement as required in accordance with the Coca-Cola System. No incremental income or cost reductions are assumed in the value-in-use model as a result of these investments.

AND SUBSIDIARIES Management considers that a possible change in key assumptions used, within a reasonable range surrounding same, would not result in the book value of the CGUs materially exceeding value in use. As a result of the macroeconomic, political and social factors occurred in Ecuador in 2018, the cash flow projections of the businesses in this country were affected, therefore the Company complemented the impairment analysis with the fair value method, different from the value of use, prepared using more conservative bases for the Ecuador Beverages CGU. The additional calculation was made by evaluating the fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCOD) of the underlying assets. The valuation is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to non-observable data used in the valuation. In the case of Toni CGU, management decided to carry out the same approach in order to detect any possible impairment. No impairment was identified in any CGU. Management approach and the main assumption used to determine FVLCOD of the CGUs was EBITDA multiples, which the Administration considers to be and acceptable factor in the beverage industry. % excess of FVLCOD over book value 2019 2018 Cash generating unit Ecuador Beverages 72% 20% Toni 8% 9% As a result of annual testing for impairment, the Company recognized no impairment losses in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 (see Note 5).

A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES Debt restrictions: Most long-term debt agreements specify normal conditions, mainly as concerns the delivery of internal and audited financial information. Failure to provide that information within the specified term to the satisfaction of the creditors could be considered a case of advance expiration. Furthermore, long-term debt certificates are subject to certain restrictive obligations, which, among other things, unless authorized in writing by the holders of the debt certificates, limit the capacity to: • Change or modify the main line of business or operations of the Company and of its subsidiaries. • Incur or assume any guaranteed debt on a lien, including the subsidiaries, unless: i) simultaneously at the time of creating any lien, the issuer (the Company in this case) guarantees in the same manner its obligations pertaining to the debt certificates, or ii) the liens are permitted as described in dual revolving debt certificate programs. • In the case of mergers in which the company is merged, the surviving company must expressly assume the Company obligations as issuer of the debt. Furthermore, certain bank loan agreements and the private bonds of CCSWB contain obligations similar to the foregoing and require compliance with of financial ratios interest coverage and maximum debt over cash flow ratios, noncompliance with which requires dispensation by the respective bank. The fair value of the non-current debt is disclosed in Note 21. The fair value of current debt is equivalent to book value, as the discount impact is not significant. Fair values at December 31, 2019 and 2018 are based on a number of different discount rates, which fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (see Note 21). At December 31, 2019 and 2018, and at the date of issuance of these financial statements, the Company and its subsidiaries had duly complied with the obligations set down in the loan agreements.

ASSOCIATED RISKS As concerns the defined benefit pension plan and major medical expense plans, the Company is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are listed below: Asset volatility Labor liability obligations are calculated at a discount rate determined as per IAS 19. If plan assets show returns below that rate, the difference is recorded as a deficit. The Company intends to reduce the risk level to a minimum, through investment in assets with a profile similar to the liabilities in question, and considers that due to the long-term nature of the labor obligations and to AC’s strength, the level of investment in capital instruments is a relevant element that forms part of the Company’s long-term strategy, with a view to managing the plans efficiently. Changes in the discount rate A decrease in the discount rate would result in an increase in plan obligations. However, that would be partially offset by the increase in value of bonds held by those plans. Inflation risk Certain labor obligations are linked to inflation and higher inflation would result in an increase in plan obligations. Life expectancy Most plan obligations give rise to benefits for their members, which means that an increase in life expectancy would lead to an increase in plan obligations. The Company has modified none of the processes and activities involved in managing the aforementioned risks in relation to prior years. Investments are diversified, and therefore, circumstances relating to any investment would have no significant impact on the value of plan assets.

The Company recorded a deferred tax asset of $331,983 and $225,080 for 2019 and 2018, respectively, with respect to remaining tax losses of $1,412,760 for 2019 and $1,032,338 for 2018, which can be amortized against future tax profits. At December 31, 2019, accrued unamortized tax losses of the Mexican entities totaling $392,250 expire in 2027-2029 and those of the foreign entities totaling $1,020,510 expire from 2020 to 2027. At December 31, 2019, the Company has not recorded estimated deferred tax liabilities of approximately $6,387 million ($2,422 million in 2018) arising from the difference between the tax cost of the shares of subsidiaries and the value of net consolidated assets, mainly due to undistributed profits and exchange effect, among others, because based on the exception applicable to the Company, it considers that it will not sell its investments in subsidiaries any time in the near future and has the policy of paying dividends to its subsidiaries only up to the amounts on which tax has been paid. NOTE 19 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY: At the April 4, 2019 General Ordinary Stockholders’ Meeting (April 26 2018), it was agreed to pay cash dividends from the CUFIN equivalent to $2.30 pesos per share ($2.20 pesos in 2018) on all shares issued at that date, totaling $4,057,851, which were on April 16, 2019 ($3,881,423 in 2018). The Company’s capital stock at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was comprised as follows: Subscribed capital stock Number of shares FIXED VARIABLE TOTAL Total shares at December 31, 2019 and 2018 902,816,289 861,466,867 1,764,283,156 The Company’s capital stock consists of a single series of ordinary, nominative shares with no par value, and no restrictions on holding. They confer the same rights to their holders. In accordance with the Mexican Corporations Law, the net profit for the year is subject to the legal provision that requires that at least 5% of the net profit of each year be allocated to increase the legal reserve until it is equal to one fifth of the social capital paid. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the legal reserve amounts to $1,726,046 and is included in retained earnings. At December 31, 2019, 5,820,235 own shares are retained in the repurchasing fund. The Mexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% tax on profits generated as from 2014 paid to parties resident abroad and to Mexican individuals in the form of dividends. That tax must be withheld by the Company and is considered a definitive tax. However, the Company’s retained earnings up to December 31, 2013 are supported by the balance of the CUFIN (previously taxed retained earnings), and will therefore not be subject to said withholding. Dividends are not subject to income tax if paid from the aforementioned CUFIN. Dividends in excess of that account are subject to 42.86% tax if paid in 2020. Tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against income tax for the current period or for the following two periods. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 174 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES According to the Mexican Income Tax Law, in the event of a capital reduction, any excess of stockholders’ equity over capital contributions, restated for inflation (CUCA), is accorded the same tax treatment as dividends, provided the Company lacks sufficient CUFIN balances to offset the deemed dividend. At December 31, 2019, the tax value of the CUFIN and the value of the CUCA total $30,981,083(*) and $31,981,477 respectively. (*) Stemming from earnings at 2013 $5,802,015 and rest from subsequent years $25,179,078.

The estimated book value and fair value of other financial assets and liabilities are shown below: December 31, 2019 BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE ASSETS Derivative financial instruments $ 140,324 $ 140,324 LIABILITIES Derivative financial instruments $ 351,062 $ 351,062 Non-current debt $ 46,500,428 $ 46,575,090 December 31, 2018 BOOK VALUE FAIR VALUE ASSETS Derivative financial instruments $ 102,585 $ 102,585 LIABILITIES Derivative financial instruments $ 116,793 $ 116,793 Non-current debt $ 53,154,854 $ 53,384,378 II. IMPAIRMENT AND EXPOSURE TO RISKS Note 8 contains information on impairment of financial assets on the Company’s exposure to the credit risk. III. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY The Company applies the three-level hierarchy in measuring and disclosing fair value. Classification of an instrument within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest value of significant data used in the valuation. Following is a description of the three levels of hierarchy: Level 1 Prices quoted for identical instruments on active markets. The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on prices quoted in the markets at the date of the statement of financial position. A market is considered to be active if quoted prices are clearly and regularly available through a stock exchange, trader, broker, industry group, price setting service or regulating body, and those prices currently and regularly reflect market transactions in conditions of independence. Level 2 Prices quoted for similar instruments on active markets; prices quoted for identical or similar instruments on non-active markets; and valuations through models where all significant data are observable on active markets. The fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market is determined via valuation methods. Those valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market information in cases where it is available and depends as little as possible on the entity’s specific estimations. If all significant data required to measure an instrument at fair value are observable, the instrument is classified in this Level. Level 3 Valuations performed through techniques whereby one or more of the significant data are not observable. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. Company valuations consider relevant and observable market data to the extent possible. If one or more relevant variables is/are not based on observable market information, the instrument is included in Level 3. IV. DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND MEASUREMENT The Company generally uses quotations of market prices (when available) to determine fair value and classifies said data as Level 1. If market quotations are not available, fair value is determined using standard valuation models. When applicable, those models project future cash flows and discount future figures at observable data set at present value, including interest rates, exchange rates, volatility, etc. Items valued using said data are classified according to the lowest level of data that is significant for the valuation. Therefore, an item can be classified as Level 3, even when some of the significant data are observable. Additionally, the Company considers assumptions for its own credit risk, as well as for the risk of its counterparty. Assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost and at fair value are summarized at the top of this Note. There were no transfers between levels 1 and 2 nor between levels 2 and 3 in the periods shown. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 177 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES V. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company’s derivative financial operations have been privately concentrated at a number of financial entities whose financial soundness is supported by high ratings assigned by rating securities and credit risks entities. The documentation used to formalize operations is common documentation, as specified in the following contracts: Framework Contract For Derivative Financial Operations or ISDA Master Agreement, drawn up by the “International Swaps & Derivatives Association” (ISDA), accompanied by accessory documents used in this type of operations, generally known as “Schedule”, “Credit Support Annex” and “Confirmation”. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the following derivative financial instruments exist in Mexico: foreign currency forwards and interest rate swaps; and in Peru, currency call spread, sugar hedge futures and coverage cross currency swap and in the US, currency forwards, aluminum and diesel hedge were held at December 31, 2019. Classification of derivatives Derivatives are only used for economic hedging and not as speculative investments. However, when derivatives fail to meet hedge accounting requirements, they are classified as “held for trade” for accounting purposes and are recognized at fair value with changes in income. They are shown as current assets and liabilities to the extent they are expected to be settled within the 12 months following the end of the reporting period. The Company holds the following derivative financial instruments: a.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company held cash flow hedging financial instruments corresponding to forwards and swaps, as well as sugar futures for hedging, aluminum and diesel swaps, which were determined to be highly effective. For foreign currency hedges, the Company generates hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match the terms of the hedged item exactly. Therefore, the Company conducts a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. If changes in circumstances affect the terms of the hedged item to the extent that the critical terms no longer match the critical terms of the hedging instrument exactly, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method to evaluate effectiveness. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 179 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES In foreign currency hedges, ineffectiveness can arise if the moment of the forecast transaction changes from that originally estimated, or if there are changes in Mexico’s credit risk or of the counterpart. The Company contracts interest rate swaps with critical terms similar to those of the hedged item, such as the reference rate, the starting date, payment dates, maturities and the nominal amount. The Company does not hedge 100% of its loans, which means that the hedged item is identified as a portion of current loans in effect up to the nominal amount of the swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, the economic relationship was 100% effective. Hedging ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps is evaluated using the same principles as those for hedging of purchases of foreign currencies. Can occur due to: The adjustment to the creditor/debtor value in interest rate swaps that does not correspond to the loan, and The differences in critical terms between interest rate swaps and the loans. There was no ineffectiveness during 2019 or 2018 with regard to the derivative financial instruments contracted by the group.

As a result of said elimination, the Company found it necessary to deconsolidate for tax purposes as from December 31, 2013. The last portion of tax payable on that deconsolidation amounting to $35,446 was paid to the Mexican tax authorities in April 2018. In 2019, the Company determined an individual tax profit of $306,600 (tax profit of $85,930 in 2018). The tax result differs from the book result mainly due to items accrued over time and deducted differently for book and tax purposes, to recognition of the effects of inflation for tax purposes and to items only affecting the book or tax result.

AC Bebidas pay to AC royalties for the use of this agreement. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 183 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES During the more than 90 years of business relations with TCCC, the latter has never refused to renew bottling agreements with AC or to enter into a new agreements to replace previous ones. As a result, indefinite useful lives were assigned to those intangibles (see Note 5). Management considers that TCCC will continue renewing contracts and extending bottling permits when they expire or will enter into new agreements or issue new permits to replace those currently in effect, although there is not absolute certainty that this will be the case. If that is not the case, the AC business and operating results will be adversely affected. Additionally, bottling agreements signed with TCCC establish that AC may bottle no beverages other than those of the Coca-Cola brand, with the exception of those specifically authorized in the aforementioned agreements. CONCENTRATE SUPPLY TCCC provides the concentrates used in producing the products sold and is unilaterally entitled to set prices on said raw materials. If TCCC significantly increases concentrate prices, AC operating results could be negatively affected. CONTINGENCIES IN PERU At December 31, 2019, a number of claims have been filed at the tax office and other judicial and labor processes have been brought by the Company for a total of approximately $423,744 (approximately $547,953 at December 31, 2018), which are pending a definitive sentence. Management and the Company’s legal advisors consider that those processes could have an unfavorable result for the Company in the amount of approximately $99,296 ($157,763 at December 31, 2018); they also estimate that lawsuits classified as remote or possible will be resolved favorably for the Company, which is why no provision has been created at December 31, 2019 (see Note 16). CONTINGENCIES IN ECUADOR At December 31, 2019, the Company has filed a number of claims at the tax office for a total of approximately $603,917 (approximately $567,514 at December 31, 2018), which are pending a definitive sentence. Management and the Company’s legal advisors consider that those processes could have an unfavorable result for the Company in the amount of approximately $106,873 ($100,593 at December 31, 2018); they also estimate that lawsuits classified as remote or possible will be resolved favorably for the Company, although a provision was created at December 31, 2019 for $75,370 (see Note 16). CONTINGENCIES IN ARGENTINA At December 31, 2019, a number of claims have been filed at the tax office and other judicial, labor and administrative processes have been brought by the Company for a total of approximately $103,317 (approximately $190,452 at December 31, 2018), which are pending definitive sentences. Management and the Company’s legal advisors consider that those processes could have an unfavorable result for the Company in the amount of approximately $21,257 ($33,331 at December 31, 2018); they also estimate that lawsuits classified as remote will be resolved favorably for the Company, which is why no provision has been created at December 31, 2019.

According to the NPSG Governance Agreement, TCCC and the RPBs have formed a national product supply group (the NPSG Board) composed of a CCSWB representative, a TCCC representative and one representative each of the remaining RPBs. That NPSG Board now has the maximum number of members (nine). The NPSG Agreements require the Company to comply with a product supply schedule to other RPBs, based on the needs of the US system, where the company does not unilaterally decide on respective volumes. This can give rise to revenue volatility in NPSG income. For the periods ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, they totaled $2,312,925 and $3,299,438, respectively. The Company evaluates the performance of its sales operations with third parties totally independently in the territory operated by CCSWB. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 186 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B.

TRANSACTIONS WITH NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS Except for the acquisition of non-controlling interests described in point i. above, in the years ended on December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no transactions with non-controlling interests and no conflicts of interest to be disclosed. See Note 2. IV. INTEREST IN JOINT OPERATION At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company holds a 50% investment in JV Toni, S.L., a Spanish company, for the purpose of joint operation of its investment in Holding Tonicorp, S. A. and its subsidiaries, as shown below: Holding percentage FUNCTIONAL ENTITY COUNTRY OPERATION 2019 2018 CURRENCY Holding Tonicorp, S. A. Ecuador A 89 89 US dollar Industrias Lácteas Toni, S. A Ecuador B/C 100 100 US dollar Plásticos Ecuatorianos, S. A. Ecuador D 100 100 US dollar Distribuidora Importadora Dipor, S. A.

The rights to the benefits and the obligations for the liabilities of Tonicorp and its subsidiaries were therefore transferred to the two stockholders jointly and substantially controlling the agreement. Consequently, the agreement has been classified as a joint operation (see Notes 3 and 5). The AC consolidated financial statements therefore include its interest in the assets and liabilities of that joint operation as from the date of contribution. The clauses of the joint partner agreement contemplate options for the purchase/sale of the portion pertaining to the other partner in the event of a change of control or change of business strategy of either of the two partners. NOTE 30 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES DUE TO ADOPTION OF IFRS-16: As indicated in note 3a., above, the group has adopted IFRS 16 Leases retrospectively from January 1, 2019, but has not restated comparatives for the 2018 reporting period, as permitted under the specific transition provisions in the standard. The reclassifications and the adjustments arising from the new leasing rules are therefore recognized in the opening balance sheet on January 1, 2019. The new accounting policies are disclosed in note 3m. On adoption of IFRS 16, the group recognized lease liabilities in relation to leases which had previously been classified as ‘operating leases’ under the principles of IAS 17 Leases. These liabilities were measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate as of January 1, 2019. The weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied to the lease liabilities on January 1, 2019 was 6.95%. For leases previously classified as finance leases the entity recognized the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability immediately before transition as the carrying amount of the right of use asset and the lease liability at the date of initial application. The measurement principles of IFRS 16 are only applied after that date. I. PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS APPLIED In applying IFRS 16 for the first time, the group has used the following practical expedients permitted by the standard: • Applying a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics; • Accounting for operating leases with a remaining lease term of less than 12 months as at January 1, 2019 as short-term leases; • Excluding initial direct costs for the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application, and • Using hindsight in determining the lease term where the contract contains options to extend or terminate the lease. The group has also elected not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains a lease at the date of initial application. Instead, for contracts entered into before the transition date the group relied on its assessment made applying IAS 17 and Interpretation the IFRIC4 Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease. 2019 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT 189 ARCA CONTINENTAL, S. A. B. DE C. V. AND SUBSIDIARIES II. VALUATION OF LEASE LIABILITIES 2019 Operating lease commitments disclosed as at December 31, 2018 $ 1,057,893 Discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate of 6.95% 1,023,907 (Less): short-term leases not recognized as a liability (22,467) (Less): low-value leases not recognized as a liability (161) (Less): contracts reassessed as lease contracts (61,737) Add/(less): adjustments as a result of a different treatment of extension and termination options 588,783 Add/(less): adjustments relating to changes in the index or rate affecting variable payments (64,314) Lease liability recognized as at January 1 2019 $ 1,464,011 Of wich are: Current lease liabilities $ 425,344 Non-current lease liabilities 1,038,667 $ 1,464,011 III. VALUATION OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS The associated right-of-use assets for property leases were measured on a retrospective basis as if the new rules had always been applied. Other right-of use assets were measured at the amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the balance sheet as at December 31, 2018. IV. ADJUSTMENTS RECOGNIZED IN THE BALANCE SHEET ON JANUARY 1, 2019 The change in accounting policy affected the following items in the balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 in an increase of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities by $1,464,011, without affecting accumulative gain or loss.
