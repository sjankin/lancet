The aim of this project was to strengthen direct trade of high quality shelfready products from Africa. Consequently, African Coffee Roasters was established in 2015 and the factory was constructed in the first half of 2016 with commercial production beginning in September of 2016. At African Coffee Roasters we offer a value collaboration between coffee producers and coffee consumers. We are owned by Coop Denmark Coop Danmark (80%) and the Danish Investment Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) (20%). Our entire operations are located in Athi River within the Export Processing Zone.

We support our vision and mission by demonstrating that is economically, socially and finacially sustainable to roast coffee ina country of origin while serving the needs of both the coffee producer and coffee consumer. We develop the coffee supply chain by increasing efficiency and transparency in coffee trade by shortening the value chain. In turn we gain access to high quality coffee which we present to our consumers at a fair price while contributing to the development of the producer's business and living conditions.
