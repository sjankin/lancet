According to the GHG Protocol, scope 2 emissions from power consumption are calculated separately according GRI 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions to location-based and market-based emissions factors. Location-based methods are based on factors for certain geographic regions (such as a country), whereas market-based factors are – where possible – based on a company’s individual electricity using information about the emissions actually generated by the energy producer. Location-based greenhouse gas emissions are calculated according to factors published by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

If, in the course of audits at individual production may be at risk sites, irregularities or violations are identified, we work together with our suppliers to develop solutions to improve the situation. Depending on the severity of the deviations identified, we reserve the possibility of a contractual penalty for the supplier. This is in turn used to improve the situation on site. During the reporting period, no business activity and no significant supplier was considered to be in violation of the freedom of association and collective bargaining rights of its employees.
