In 2019 we gave over NOK 40 million of our profit back to the local community, both directly from the bank and through the two foundations that own us, Sparebankstiftinga Sogn og Fjordane and Sparebankstiftinga Fjaler. For the bank it is important that our profit benefits the local community, and that the projects we fund have broad appeal. In that way, everyone wins, including businesses, culture, education and families with children. Several of our gifts in 2019 went to eco-friendly activities and aims. You can read all about these gifts in the section of the annual report about sustainability and climate change.

Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 9 Working with the business community We are the leading bank for businesses in Sogn og Fjordane, and we take our role as a partner to the business community very seriously. We have almost 40 employees who work closely with the business community in Sogn og Fjordane, and with over a third of the market we are in a strong position. Our advisers and industry experts are constantly working to ensure that our customers receive the support and expertise they need. We use our local knowledge and decision-making for the benefit of the local business community. Businesses need spaces that help them to network and share knowledge. One such space that benefits both us and other parts of the business community is our annual event for senior managers, which in 2019 was attended by 70 people. We also held breakfast meetings in both Førde and Stryn, as well as attending meetings and events organised by other companies. These events play an important role by providing places where the business community can mingle and meet. In addition, we donate some of our profit, which helps to make businesses in Sogn og Fjordane even stronger.

Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 12 Leading the way on equal opportunity In competition with 90 other companies in Norway, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane was judged best in the area of equal opportunity. That was the verdict of the latest SHE Index was published in October. Out of a maximum of 100 points, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane scored 94, which put it ahead of big companies like DNB, OBOS, Schibsted and IKEA. “I’m really proud that we were rated best in the area of equal opportunity in competition with many of Norway’s biggest companies! We’ve been working systematically on diversity and equal opportunity at the bank for some time, and it’s incredibly rewarding to see the fruits of that”, says Trond Teigene, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane’s CEO. Thanks for your vote of confidence! In the annual EPSI survey of banks, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane did really well. Amongst all of the participating banks, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane came second for customer satisfaction and loyalty. No-one in the survey received higher marks for trust and customer relations than Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane. The same was true when looking at who had the most satisfied mortgage customers. The bank’s mobile banking app, which we have developed ourselves, also achieved a fine third place. “This is the first time we’ve participated in this survey, and it’s fantastic that we’ve achieved such great results. I believe it says a lot about the kind of bank we are, and of course it’s a great tribute to our hard-working employees”, says Linda Vøllestad Westbye, Director of Retail Banking. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 13 Sustainability report 2019 Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane aims to play a positive role in supporting the transition to a more climatefriendly and sustainable society. Society is becoming increasingly concerned about climate change and sustainability, and we want to become better at explaining what we’re doing to help and how we will communicate it. Not just because the topic is increasingly important to our customers and investors, but also because it is the right thing to do. We wish to be a driving force for the environment in Sogn og Fjordane. Our sustainability report for 2019 is our first such report. It sets out our work on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) criteria, including what we have done so far and our plans for the future. Sustainability is part of our strategy, so it falls within the remit of the Board of Directors and senior management team. Our longterm goal is for our sustainability reports to meet the standards of the GRI, the leading international body on sustainability reporting. We consider our sustainability report for 2019 and the work we’ve done in conjunction with it a step in the right direction. Putting our own house in order Eco-Lighthouse In 2019, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane was certified as an Eco-Lighthouse, which means that we are taking real responsibility for the environment. We shall demand that our suppliers and partners have a conscious policy on sustainability. In order to demand this of others, we must first put our own house in order. Becoming Eco-Lighthouse certified shows that we also set high standards of ourselves. As part of the certification process, we set up an environment committee at the bank. The environment committee makes suggestions and promotes eco-friendly measures within the company. We wish to continuously reduce the environmental impact of our own operations. In order to monitor progress on this, we will start reporting our annual greenhouse gas (GHG) accounts. 2019 will be the first year that we report them. The accounts are based on the GHG Protocol, which is the most widely used standard for reporting the greenhouse gas emissions of companies. The purpose of preparing GHG accounts is to analyse our impact on the climate and assess what we should do to reduce the emissions from our operations. Since these will be our first GHG accounts, we don’t have any comparable figures, but they will enable us to set specific goals for reducing our own emissions in 2020. Since 2008, we have wholly offset the emissions of our fleet of vehicles through a GreenPlan agreement with LeasePlan. This involves buying UN-certified carbon credits equivalent to our actual CO2 emissions based on our mileage and fuel consumption. Being climate neutral means that we compensate for the environmental impact of the CO2 emissions of our vehicles by reducing GHG emissions somewhere else in the world by the same amount. We were also one of the first banks in Norway to start using video conferences to reduce our business travel. We now have around 30 permanently installed video conferencing systems. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 14 Initiatives that we support By supporting international initiatives, we can create a good framework and direction for work on sustainability and climate change. UN Sustainable Development Goals The UN Sustainable Development Goals, which are the world’s joint blueprint for a sustainable future, include goals to eliminate poverty, combat inequality and stop climate change by 2030. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane supports the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals. As a bank, we can influence most of the goals, but we have identified the ones where our role is particularly important. We will define specific actions in relation to these goals and work systematically to achieve them. The four goals that we consider most relevant to our activities are: Quality Education, Gender Equality, Decent Work and Economic Growth and Climate Action. Goal 4: Quality Education • Internally: Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane shall help all employees to develop a good understanding of the bank’s internal guidelines on ethics and fraud, and monitor compliance with them. In 2019, employees did a compulsory e-learning course on anti-money laundering and digital security, amongst other things. • Externally: Teaching school pupils throughout Sogn og Fjordane about financial matters. The programme “In charge of your own life” has taught sixth-form college students about their personal finances. This is a partnership with Ungt Entreprenørskap, and the teachers are employees at the bank. 7,000 sixth-form college students have taken part since the programme started in 2013. The bank also works with Ungt Entreprenørskap on a programme on personal finance and career choices for secondary school pupils. Goal 5: Gender Equality • Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane aims to be one of the best places to work in Sogn og Fjordane. This includes providing equal opportunity and fair treatment to all employees. We are therefore working to maintain and increase diversity at the bank, both through our day-to-day operations and in our recruitment policy. We support the women’s empowerment principles and came top of the SHE Index. Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth • The bank shall help ensure that profitable projects and investments receive financing, and by doing so promote economic growth in Sogn og Fjordane and the rest of Norway. • The bank shall itself achieve satisfactory profitability and give its shareholders and society an acceptable return on the capital invested in the bank. The bank shall provide an inclusive and safe working environment. Goal 13: Climate Action • Internally: The bank shall reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. We shall continue to be Eco-Lighthouse certified. • Externally: The bank shall offer products and services that encourage customers to choose sustainable options. Spread knowledge and raise awareness. Support initiatives to promote sustainability in the local community. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 15 UN Global Compact In 2019 we signed up to the UN Global Compact, which is the UN’s voluntary set of principles for corporate sustainability. This commits us to running our business in line with ten principles on human rights, labour, the environment and anticorruption. The Women’s Empowerment Principles The bank has also signed up to the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), which consist of seven guiding principles on action to promote equality and empower women in the workplace and in society. The WEPs were drawn up jointly by the UN Global compact and UN Women. In 2020, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane will sign up to the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI) principles for responsible banking. The principles are supposed to encourage banks all over the world to contribute to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and obligations under the Paris Agreement. Corporate social responsibility Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane’s biggest responsibility to society is to achieve satisfactory profitability. This is what allows it to promote growth and development in Sogn og Fjordane. The bank’s profit benefits Sogn og Fjordane. The bank shall provide capital to businesses and ordinary people to finance sound projects, enabling us to be a driving force for Sogn og Fjordane. Our good local knowledge and proximity to our customers shall be used to benefit the local business community. Some of our profit is donated and used to generate activity in our local communities. In 2019 we also made donations towards environmentally and climate friendly activities, and that will remain a priority in the future. Good credit scoring models are one of our most important tools for responsible lending. The models estimate the ability and willingness of customers to repay their loans. We must offer the right credit limits to the right customers. Our advisers should be transparent when they explain our products, terms and conditions, interest rates and fees. Through our lending activities, we can help to promote sustainable development. We shall demonstrate corporate social responsibility and help our customers to take sustainable decisions. One way to achieve that is to offer green products on attractive terms. Corporate banking market Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane shall help ensure that profitable projects and investments receive financing, and by doing so promote economic growth in Sogn og Fjordane and the rest of Norway. We take climate change into account in our credit checks on corporate customers. For instance, we look at whether the customer is particularly exposed to climate change or is engaged in activities that may be harmful to the climate. In 2019 we created new forms to help our customer advisers in their discussions with customers. The aim is to raise our corporate customers’ awareness of how they will be affected by climate change and to influence customers to take action to reduce their risk exposure and their own emissions. Climate change and sustainability are also covered by all of our industry reports. In addition, we are providing capital to sustainable projects, for example by creating a green framework for financing renewable energy projects. As a lender, we want to help to make society more sustainable. For example, we don’t want to finance businesses that operate in the following industries: • Gambling • Manufacture of controversial weapons or armament manufacture without government approval Tobacco • Companies that produce or help to spread pornographic material Retail banking market Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane wishes to encourage its customers to make sustainable choices by offering them green products on favourable terms. Through SpareBank Midt-Norge 1 Finans AS, we offer green car loans. This gives customers who choose a green car better terms than a normal car loan. At the end of 2019, we had provided 217 loans for electric cars. We also offer various kinds of sustainable investment funds through a partnership with Norne and their suppliers of investment funds. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 16 Green mortgages In 2019 we have worked hard to develop and introduce green mortgages and green home improvement loans for our customers. Green mortgages offer more attractive terms to customers who buy energy-efficient homes with an energy performance rating of A or B. Green home improvement loans Green home improvement loans offer attractive interest rates to customers who upgrade their homes to make them more energy-efficient. Customers can obtain a loan to finance one or more upgrades, such as replacing window glass or installing a heat pump, retrofit insulation or solar panels. Charitable donations and sponsorships Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane’s vision is to be a driving force for Sogn og Fjordane. As a local savings bank, we have a longstanding tradition of returning part of our profit to the local community through gifts and sponsorship agreements. In 2019 we allocated NOK 40 million of our profit to the local community, both directly from the bank and through our owners, Sparebankstiftinga Sogn og Fjordane and Sparebankstiftinga Fjaler. The bank also sponsors around 50 clubs and organisations all over Sogn og Fjordane. Sparebankstiftinga Sogn og Fjordane shall make donations to projects that benefit society in general within the fields of healthcare, humanitarian work, physical activity, culture, business development, research and education. Gifts from Sparebankstiftinga shall promote diversity, quality of life and development.

Explanation of the various types of equity: Equity share capital: Equity share capital comprises capital that in accordance with the articles of association is linked to equity certificates. Profit after taxation attributable to equity share capital is allocated to the dividend equalisation reserve in proportion to the ownership ratio, after deducting dividends and a proportionate share of interest paid to investors in hybrid capital. The dividend equalisation reserve may be used to maintain the payment of dividends to the equity certificate holders, if the bank’s equity position allows it. Primary capital: Primary capital comprises capital that is not equity share capital. Profit after taxation attributable to primary capital is allocated to primary capital, after deducting gifts and a proportionate share of interest paid to investors in hybrid capital. Hybrid capital: Hybrid capital consists of hybrid debt that meets the criteria for being defined as equity and core capital under rules on capital adequacy. Interest on hybrid capital is split between the dividend equalisation reserve and primary capital in proportion to the ownership ratio, and is in practice allocated together with profit. Reserve for unrealised gains on available-for-sale financial assets: The reserve for unrealised gains on available-for-sale financial assets comprises unrealised gains on shares and other ownership interests classified as available for sale. After the transition to IFRS 9 at 01/01/2018 the Group no longer uses this category, and unrealised gains on shares are presented under “Reserve for unrealised gains, other”. Reserve for unrealised gains, other: The reserve for other unrealised gains comprises unrealised gains on financial instruments whose valuation is different under IFRS and Norwegian accounting principles. Other equity: Other equity comprises retained earnings from various subsidiaries and unallocated profit. Dividends and gifts: Proposed dividends and gifts are included under equity until their disbursement is adopted by the AGM.

Overall risk exposure shall reflect the Bank’s risk profile, and risk management shall help the Bank to achieve its strategic goals. This shall be done by creating a strong business culture with a good understanding of risk management, and with a good appreciation of the risks that could have a major impact on the profitability of the Bank. ORGANISATIONAL STRUCTURE Board of Directors The Board of Directors adopts goals and strategies and is responsible for ensuring that the Bank has effective and adequate risk management systems and internal controls. The Board has various sub-committees that also play important roles in the risk management process: The risk management committee does the preparations for the Board’s work on assessing and supervising the Bank’s exposure to risk. The committee makes preparations for the Board’s assessment of quarterly risk management reports from the executive management, the annual ICAAP and ILAAP reports, the annual internal control report, the internal auditor’s annual report and annual plan and the annual finance strategy and associated limits on risk exposure. The committee prepares items that deal with the monitoring and management of the bank’s individual areas of risk and overall risk, focusing on whether our corporate governance procedures are appropriate for our risk profile and the extent of our business. The audit committee does various preparatory jobs for the Board. Amongst other things, this includes monitoring and assessing the independence of the auditor, assessing and recommending auditors, and reviewing and assessing the Bank’s financial reporting. The audit committee reviews the interim and annual financial statements, with a particular focus on accounting principles, critical estimates and judgements including for expected credit losses, related parties and the work of the auditor. CEO The CEO shall ensure that risk management frameworks, strategies, procedures and guidelines are implemented and communicated throughout the organisation. The CEO is also responsible for ensuring that risk management procedures and internal controls are effective and are documented. The three lines of defence The risk management system is based on there being three lines of defence. The lines of defence represent the Bank’s model for risk management, risk control and compliance. The Bank’s various business areas, which represent the first line of defence, are delegated responsibilities by the CEO. This line of defence also implements risk assessments and risk-reduction measures and controls to ensure that the Bank is operating in accordance with legislation and with internal guidelines and frameworks. One important principle for risk management is that the first line of defence always owns the risks. The Bank’s risk management and compliance department is the second line of defence. This department shall ensure that the first line of defence acts in accordance with guidelines and regulations. It shall also write risk and compliance reports for the Board, as well as reporting any breaches of frameworks and guidelines. The head of the department, who is independent from managers with responsibility for taking risk, does not take part in decision-making directly related to the Bank’s various business areas. The department reports directly to the CEO, but it also has a direct line of reporting to the Board for situations where the second line of defence considers this necessary or desirable. The internal auditor, who reports to the Board, constitutes the third line of defence. The internal auditor shall check that the financial institution is organised and run responsibly and in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. The Board shall organise and establish guidelines for the internal auditor. The external Auditor is also part of the Bank's system for supervision and risk management and performs financial audits. The external Auditor is elected by the General Meeting, after statement from the Audit Committee in accordance with the law for financial firms. The Auditor gives an annual report to the General Meeting, and has meetings with the Board throughout the year. The Auditor prepares a letter to the management which is presented to the Board. In the letter to the management, the Auditor assesses the internal control of the bank and points out possible areas where internal control could be improved. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 55 Sparebanken Sogn Bustadkreditt ANNUAL og Fjordane 2018 REPORTÅRSMELDING 552018 55 Note 5 Risk management (cont.) CAPITAL ADEQUACY AND AREAS OF RISK Capital adequacy ratio Each year, the Board reviews and adopts the Bank’s capital requirements and Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). It also adopts a credit strategy and finance strategy, as well as limits for capital adequacy, credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. Quarterly reports allow the Board to evaluate the Bank’s risk exposure compared with its corporate governance goals. The Bank has complied with the capital adequacy requirements of the Financial Institutions Act and relevant regulations, including the international rules on capital requirements CRD IV. These rules consist of three pillars: • Pilar 1 Minimum capital requirement. • Pilar 2 The internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP). • Pilar 3 Disclosure of financial information. Pillar 1: As of 31.12.2019, the minimum Core Tier 1 capital requirement for non-systemically important banks was 12.5%. In addition, 1.5% of hybrid capital and 2% of supplementary capital is required. Pillar 2: Pillar 2 requirements must be met by Core Tier 1 capital. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane has a Pillar 2 requirement of 1.9%, which must be added to the requirements for Pillar 1. The Bank sets out its assessment of Pillar 2 risks in the ICAAP document that is presented to the Board each year. Pillar 3: The Bank’s disclosures on capital adequacy and risk management are described in a separate document published on the Bank’s website. The changes to Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 in recent years have made the capital requirements for Norwegian banks much stricter. So have the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway’s capital requirements for Norwegian banks. The Bank’s areas of risk The Bank sets aside capital for credit risk and operational risk in Pillar 1, and for market risk, operational risk, shareholder risk and credit risk (including concentration risk) in Pillar 2. In addition to the above risk categories, we are also exposed to risk in other areas: liquidity risk, business risk, climate change risk, compliance risk and cyber risk. No capital has been set aside for these risk categories under Pillar 2. Credit risk Credit risk is the danger of losing money as a result of customers/counterparties being unable or unwilling to fulfil their payment obligations to the Bank. The vast majority of the Bank’s credit risk relates to loans, but credit risk also arises from the obligations of customers under interest-bearing securities, currency services, guarantees and credit facilities. The Board provides the framework for the bank’s credit risk through its credit policy and rules on the granting of loans and credits. Each autumn the Board also adopts an annual credit strategy which provides guidelines for credit activities the following year. The Bank also has credit underwriting guidelines, and it monitors compliance using first and second line credit checks. Operational risk By operational risk we mean the risk of losses due to human error, external actions or failures and defects with the Bank’s systems, procedures and processes. We have established an incident database for assessing, recording and measuring operational problems. A strategy for managing operational risk has also been developed. Market risk Market risk is the danger of losses related to unfavourable fluctuations in market prices, in our case related to positions and activities in the interest rate, currency and stock markets. The Board has placed limits on the Bank’s permitted interest rate risk and on its exposure to foreign exchange markets. All of its exposure to shares comes from strategic, long-term investments. Concentration risk Concentration risk is the risk of losses that arises from lending a high proportion of your capital to individual enterprises or limited geographic regions or industries. Concentration risk is managed through the Bank’s risk management frameworks. They include guidelines on the exposure that the Bank can take on in each industry, including limits on the size of individual loans. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 56 Sparebanken Sogn Bustadkreditt ANNUAL og Fjordane 2018 REPORTÅRSMELDING 562018 56 Note 5 Risk management (cont.) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank will be unable to fulfil its obligations and/or finance an increase in assets without significant additional cost, either because it has to realise losses on the sale of assets or because it has to make use of unusually expensive financing. This is managed by monitoring exposure in relation to adopted limits and statutory requirements. Business risk The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway defines business risk as the risk of unexpected fluctuations in revenues for other reasons than credit risk, market risk and operational risk. This risk can arise in various business or product segments, and may be linked to macroeconomic fluctuations and changing customer behaviour. The above definition means that business risk also covers strategic risk and reputational risk. Examples of business risk include investments in unsuccessful new products, entering markets that prove unprofitable, and failure to respond to changes in customer behaviour by adapting the Bank’s products. Shareholder risk Shareholder risk can be defined as the risk of the Bank incurring losses from strategic ownership interests in companies and/or having to inject more capital into such companies. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane has set aside capital for its ownership interest in Frende Holding in line with the advice in the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway’s circular 12/2016. We also have strategic ownership interests in Sparebank 1 Finans and Balder Betaling. Compliance risk Compliance risk is the risk of the Bank failing to fully comply with laws and regulations. At a time of many new regulations coming in, for instance covering to anti-money laundering, data protection, MiFiD and credit risk, work on compliance has been a particular priority. Cyber risk Cyber risk is the risk of financial losses or a loss of reputation due to the failure of, or errors in, the Bank’s IT systems. New digital solutions often make life easier both for customers and bank staff. However, in many cases the introduction of new digital solutions also gives rise to new risks. These can be exploited to commit various kinds of cybercrime. The Bank takes cyber risk extremely seriously and systematically acts and invests to reduce the risk of cyber attacks. Climate change risk In the banking sector, climate change risk can be seen as the risk of changes in the climate or in environmental rules undermining the business models of banking customers in various ways, resulting in banks incurring losses. The term climate change risk also covers the risk of loss of reputation due to the Bank having exposure to industries or customers whose activities harm the environment. Climate change represents a threat to financial stability, so it is important for the financial industry to focus on climate change risk. Banks and other financial institutions can use their lending to show what types of investment and business activity they want to support. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane is conscious of the challenges that climate change poses, and environmental considerations are taken into account throughout its credit scoring process for new customers.

The Bank uses the models to classify all of its loans monthly, in the risk classes A-K, with A being the lowest risk class and K being loans in default. Based on that, it places its customers in three main groups: Low risk (PD of A to D), medium risk (E–G) and high risk (H–K). Probability of default (PD) Risk class from up to A 0,00 % 0,10 % B 0,10 % 0,25 % C 0,25 % 0,50 % D 0,50 % 0,75 % E 0,75 % 1,25 % F 1,25 % 2,00 % G 2,00 % 3,00 % H 3,00 % 5,00 % I 5,00 % 8,00 % J 8,00 % 100,00 % K 100,00 % 100,00 % CONSOLIDATED Guarantees and Gross loans undrawn credit facilities Loss allowances Corporate market 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Low risk (A–D) 8 008 7 447 1 686 1 955 11 14 Medium risk (E–G) 3 607 3 637 536 399 38 32 High risk (H–K) 1 253 1 213 292 149 253 231 Total for corporate market 12 868 12 297 2 514 2 503 302 277 Guarantees and Gross loans undrawn credit facilities Loss allowances Retail market 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Low risk (A–D) 25 962 24 416 2 922 2 754 2 2 Medium risk (E–G) 10 711 10 317 268 270 8 8 High risk (H–K) 1 549 1 401 14 18 21 22 Total for retail market 38 221 36 134 3 204 3 042 30 33 PARENT COMPANY Guarantees and Gross loans undrawn credit facilities Loss allowances Corporate market 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Low risk (A–D) 7 819 7 260 1 656 1 928 11 14 Medium risk (E–G) 3 551 3 579 536 399 38 32 High risk (H–K) 1 237 1 186 292 149 253 230 Total 12 607 12 025 2 484 2 476 302 276 Guarantees and Gross loans undrawn credit facilities Loss allowances Retail market 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Low risk (A–D) 12 486 11 987 1 461 1 389 1 1 Medium risk (E–G) 5 755 5 695 197 183 4 4 High risk (H–K) 816 776 11 16 15 17 Total for retail market 19 056 18 459 1 668 1 589 20 22 Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 59 Sparebanken Sogn Bustadkreditt ANNUAL og Fjordane 2018 REPORTÅRSMELDING 592018 59 Note 8 Credit-impaired assets and debt relief Past due assets An asset is considered past due when at least one of the customer’s accounts is overdue or overdrawn by at least NOK 1,000.

In the calculation below, properties are valued at their fair value based on the estimates of Eiendomsverdi AS, estate agent valuations, assessed valuations or valuations based on our knowledge of the property market. Valuations of collateral provided by retail customers shall as a general rule be reviewed at least every three years. In the case of the corporate market, most of the collateral consists of fixed assets such as real property, mortgages on ships, and licences or quotas. Other forms of collateral include liens on current assets such as factored accounts receivable, promissory notes and operating assets, and mortgages, guarantees and insurance contracts. Valuations of collateral provided by corporate customers shall as a general rule be reviewed at least once a year. It is difficult to calculate the collateral ratio for advances to corporate customers, both because collateral goes across companies and due to greater uncertainty about valuations. The Bank’s estimates of collateral ratios at the portfolio level are not sufficiently reliable, so the table below only shows estimates for the retail market. The table below gives the proportionate distribution of assets by their collateral ratio. The collateral ratio is calculated at the customer level, by dividing the value of the collateral by that of the outstanding asset. If the collateral ratio is below 100%, the value of the assets exceeds that of the collateral.

The behavioural scoring models are used to expected credit losses that meets the requirements estimate the PD for all existing assets at the end of of IFRS 9. The model calculates the Expected Credit each month. Loss (ECL) for all loan accounts, guarantees and undrawn credit facilities. The ECL is an unbiased Loss given default (LGD) estimate based on several future scenarios. The LGD represents how much the Bank expects to lose in the event of a default, and it incorporates the The model splits loans into three stages. Upon initial following components: recognition, a loan is generally allocated to Stage 1. If the account’s credit risk has increased significantly – The likelihood that a credit-impaired asset will be since initial recognition, it is moved to Stage 2. cured Credit-impaired assets are allocated to Stage 3, – The projected collateral ratio for the exposure using the same definition of credit-impaired as used – The expected recovery rate for the unsecured for internal risk management, as stated in Note 7. part of an exposure An account shall always be allocated to the highest – External costs associated with debt recovery stage that it qualifies for. A floor is also set for losses if the account is not For assets in Stage 1, expected credit losses are cured. At 31/12/2019, this floor was 1% for retail calculated for the coming 12 months, whereas for customers and 2% for corporate customers. Stages 2 and 3, expected credit losses are calculated for the lifetime of the asset. When calculating the collateral ratio, the expected sales value of the underlying collateral is used. For The ECL is calculated using parameters that residential and commercial properties, the sales estimate the exposure at default (EAD) and loss value is set at 80% of the estimated value. For other given default (LGD), as well as the probability of kinds of collateral, the value is discounted further default (PD) for any given period. depending on the kind of collateral. The projected sales values are based on 3 future scenarios for Individually assessed allowances house prices. Where there is objective evidence that an asset has fallen in value, it is individually assessed for Exposure at default (EAD) impairment. This is also done if our standard The EAD represents the expected credit exposure interaction with a customer brings to our attention to the customer at a future date. For loans with a difficulties that cast doubt on the customer’s contractual loan repayment schedule, that schedule ability to repay the loan. is used as a basis for determining the EAD.

This Macroeconomic scenarios system gives different departments at the Bank As previously mentioned, the Bank takes into responsibility for different areas, such as developing account information about the future when and maintaining models, preparing macroeconomic estimating ECLs. This is done by incorporating scenarios, assessing scenarios and calculating three macroeconomic scenarios into the calculation: expected credit losses. a base scenario with a 50% weighting, and one pessimistic and one optimistic scenario each with a 25% weighting. ECLs are calculated based on the weighted outcomes of the three scenarios.

Scenario 1 reflects the expectations set out in Norges Bank’s monetary policy report. In addition, there is an optimistic macroeconomic scenario (scenario 2) where the Norwegian economy grows more quickly than expected, and a pessimistic macroeconomic scenario (scenario 3) where the Norwegian economy performs worse than expected. The table below shows the future scenarios used to calculate expected credit losses at 31.12.19.

If the future key policy rate were 10% higher than the one used in the table above, expected credit losses would increase by NOK 2 million. This would reduce the Bank’s pre-tax profit for the year to 31/12/2019 by NOK 2 million.

The capital requirement for market risk is calculated using statistical methods. The model uses a simulation-based methodology to generate the statistical distribution of market losses over a one-year period. The Bank has chosen to use a confidence level of 99.95%. The confidence level expresses the level of security that the Bank wishes to maintain. For example, a confidence level of 99.95% means that there is only a 0.05% probability that future losses will exceed the capital requirement calculated by the Bank. The model reports VaR. The methodology takes into account market volatility and the correlation between the various types of risk. However, it does not take into account the diversification effect that results from that correlation.

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Bank cannot meet its payment obligations when they arise, or replace deposits that are withdrawn, resulting in the Group defaulting on its obligations. Liquidity risk is managed and measured using several methods. The Board has established frameworks that limit the proportion of the Bank’s liabilities that mature within certain time periods, and goals for the long-term financing of illiquid assets (liquidity indicator). The Board has also established principles for a liquidity buffer.

The Group has the following pension schemes: 1. Defined contribution scheme Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane has a defined contribution pension scheme. The Group’s contributions are 7% of ordinary wages up to 7.1 times the National Insurance Scheme’s basic amount “G”, and 15% of ordinary wages between 7.1 and 12 times “G”. The contributions are paid into a defined contribution pension scheme provided by an insurance company. Employees are free to choose when they want to start receiving their pension, but it cannot be before they turn 62 or after they turn 75. The normal payout period is ten years. The pension contributions plus the accumulated return on them, less management fees, are the property of the individual employee, and pension funds can be inherited if the employee dies before his or her fund has been paid out. The defined contribution pension scheme is not included on the balance sheet. The pension expense for this scheme was NOK 12.9 million in 2019, excluding employer’s national insurance contributions. The estimated expense for 2020 is NOK 13.8 million. 2. Compensatory pension In conjunction with converting our defined benefit pension scheme into a defined contribution scheme in 2016, we agreed to compensate staff for the fact that their future pension funds would be lower than they would have been if Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane had maintained the defined benefit scheme. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 76 ANNUAL Sparebanken Sogn Bustadkreditt og Fjordane 2018 REPORTÅRSMELDING 762018 76 Note 25 Pension liabilities (cont.) The compensation scheme is a separate defined contribution scheme (Norw.: driftspensjon) that was established on 1 June 2016. The pension fund is built up through an individually fixed contribution that is earned monthly in arrears. The annual contribution goes up by 2.81% each year. Accrued pension fund assets are paid out as a retirement pension. Accrued pension fund assets receive 5.0% in annual interest during the accumulation period, and interest at the prevailing rate on Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane’s savings accounts during the payout period. Accrued assets up to NOK 2.5G are paid out as income. The total pension liability at 31/12/2019 was NOK 21.0 million excluding employer’s NI contributions. The total expense for 2019 was NOK 6.5 million excluding employer’s NI contributions and it is expected to be NOK 6.5 million for 2020. 3. Early retirement scheme (AFP) Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane has an early retirement scheme, known as an AFP scheme. For accounting purposes it is considered a multiemployer defined benefit scheme (Norw.: ytingsbasert fleirføretaksordning). The AFP scheme is funded through pension premiums, and it is recognised in the accounts as a defined contribution scheme, because the pension liability cannot be reliably measured. Consequently, no provision has been made on the balance sheet for the scheme. The AFP scheme allows employees to take early retirement on reaching the age of 62. The AFP scheme is based on a three-way collaboration between employers’ organisations, employees’ organisations and the state. The state covers 1/3 of AFP pension expense, while the employer covers the remaining 2/3. Participating entities are jointly and severally liable for 2/3 of the pension benefit payable. This liability applies in the event of both failure to make contributions and premiums proving to be insufficient. All of the Group’s employees are covered by the scheme. If early retirement is taken, the annual benefit is calculated based on the employee’s qualifying income up to 7.1G up to and including the year in which they turn 61. The scheme is run by the joint AFP administration, which also determines and collects the premiums. In 2019 the premium was 2.5% of salary between 1G and 7.1G, which was unchanged from 2018. The total cost of the scheme in 2019 was NOK 3.7 million, and we estimate that the cost next year will be NOK 4.0 million. 4. Agreement with former CEO (unfunded) Supplementary pension The former CEO, Arvid Andenæs, left the company on 31 March 2016. He is entitled to a supplementary pension which he will continue to receive annually until reaching the age of 82. NOK 10.1 million of the Bank’s pension liabilities at 31/12/2019 related to this pension. 5. Agreement with current CEO (funded) The current CEO took up his position on 1 April 2016. He is covered by the Group’s normal pension schemes, as well as having a supplementary defined contribution scheme and disability pension. Under the agreement for the supplementary defined contribution scheme, the Bank pays an annual pension contribution equivalent to 25% of his basic salary. In order to reduce financial risk and simplify the accounting arrangements, the Bank invests an amount equivalent to the pension contributions in unit trusts through an asset management firm. The supplementary disability pension entitles him to a disability pension equivalent to 70% of his basic salary over and above 12G. The disability pension becomes payable if he is incapable of work for more than 12 months and runs until the month in which he turns 67. The disability pension benefits are guaranteed through insurance premiums paid to an insurance company. The cost of the CEO’s pension schemes is shown in Note 26. Economic assumptions The Bank used the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board’s assumptions as at 31/12/2019 to calculate the liability related to the unfunded agreement with the former CEO. Parent company and group There is little difference between the figures for the parent company and group. We have therefore chosen to only show the consolidated figures.

Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 81 ANNUAL Sparebanken Sogn Bustadkreditt og Fjordane 2018 REPORTÅRSMELDING 81 2018 81 Note 28 Fair value of financial instruments Method used to calculate fair value of financial instruments Financial instruments at fair value See Note 1 Accounting Principles. Financial instruments measured at amortised cost Market prices are used to price loans and receivables from credit institutions and loans to customers. The value of loans that have been written down is determined by discounting future cash flows using the internal rate of return based on market conditions for equivalent loans that have not been written down. For a more detailed explanation of the valuation principles used for loans measured at amortised cost, please refer to Note 1 Accounting principles. The fair value of short-term liabilities to credit institutions is estimated as being their amortised cost. Long-term liabilities to credit institutions are measured at fair value based on an equivalent interest rate to the one paid by the Bank on its own bonds. Off balance sheet obligations and guarantees Other off balance sheet obligations and guarantees are measured at their nominal value. The fair value is shown on the balance sheet under the provisions. Mortgaged assets are measured at fair value, cf. Note 1 “Accounting principles”.

Loans to customers and customer deposits measured at fair value comprise fixed-rate loans and deposits. The acquisitions/purchases or sales/redemptions shown for the period represent the net change excluding changes in market value. Fixed-rate deposits and fixed-rate loans are valued based on discounted cash flows. The discount rate that we use is supposed to represent the interest rate on an equivalent new product issued at the reporting date, with the same term and cash flow. To help us value retail loans, we use the fixed rates offered by a representative sample of our competitors. For corporate loans we use our own model for those products, which is not an observable value to outsiders. Sensitivity analysis, level 3 For fixed-rate deposits the average remaining term is approx. 0.54 years. Using a simple duration-based approach, a 1 percentage point fall in interest rates will increase the value of our fixed-rate deposits by approx. NOK 9.5 million. For fixed-rate loans the weighted average remaining term is approx. 2.7 years. The discount rate depends on the remaining term of the loan. At 31/12/2019, the discount rate for residential mortgage loans with a remaining term of three years was 2.86%. Calculated simply, a 1 percentage point rise in the discount rate will reduce the value of our fixed-rate loans by approx. NOK 132 million. Shares defined as level 3 assets are not listed on a stock exchange, have no known transactions and are shares for which the Bank has no observable assets that can be used for valuation purposes. In such cases we use our own valuations based on discounted cash flows or an analysis of key figures. For companies valued using a cash flow model, a required rate of return on equity of 9.48% has been used. A 10% reduction in the price to book ratio of a company valued using key figures and a 1 percentage point increase in the required rate of return in the cash flow models would cut the value by approx. NOK 59 million.

Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS has signed an agreement with Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane on the supply of loan servicing and administrative services. All of the company’s loans have been acquired from Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane, and an agreement has been signed with the Bank on the servicing of the portfolio. Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS takes on all of the risk associated with the loans that it acquires from its parent. Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS has been given access to good credit facilities with Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane. These will allow it to make interest and principal payments to the owners of covered bonds, enable it to make advances to customers with flexible mortgages, provide bridge financing when loans are being transferred, and fund the necessary surplus in the cover pool. Further details of the credit facilities: Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS has four credit facilities with Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane (SSF): a) A 3-year credit that matures in January 2023. The credit facility is to be used for buying mortgage loans from SSF. It has a limit of NOK 750 million, but can only be used for the bulk transfer of loans. b) A credit agreement to ensure that owners of covered bonds will be paid even if the mortgage credit subsidiary is unable to meet its obligations. The limit on the facility at 31/12/2019 was NOK 349 million. Under the agreement, the obligations of the Bank relate to all payments due to the owners of the covered bonds over the coming year. c) A credit facility that can be used to finance advances to customers with available credit within their flexible mortgages. At 31/12/2019, the limit on the facility was NOK 1,566 million. d) A credit facility related to overcollateralisation. The facility shall only be used to buy loans for inclusion in the cover pool, and to buy instruments that qualify as part of a liquidity buffer. At 31/12/2019, the limit on the facility was NOK 1,360 million, but this limit depends on the volume of covered bonds issued at any given time. e) Bustadkreditt and Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane signed an ISDA agreement in 2018. The ISDA agreement regulates all derivative transactions between the parties. The ISDA agreement has the same structure as agreements between SSF and external entities, which means that changes in the value of interest rate swaps are measured daily and there is an exchange of collateral. When fixed-rate covered bonds are issued, SSF hedges the relevant amount with an external party and then performs an internal swap with Bustadkreditt. The same applies to interest rate hedging for fixed-rate loans. The parent company leases premises from Bankeigedom Sogn og Fjordane AS. All agreements and transactions adhere to arm’s length principles. Under IAS 24, we must collect the necessary information to ascertain whether there are any transactions between Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane and companies owned by senior managers at the Bank or elected officers at companies in the Group. A record has been made of all of the ownership interests held by Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane’s related parties, who are defined as senior Group management, the Board of the Bank, the Board of Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS, the Board of the Bank’s foundation, the director of the foundation and the Managing Director of Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS. For these people and their family members, information has been collected about any ownership interests of more than 20 percent in any type of enterprise. The information collected shows that no such companies supplied services to Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane in 2019. Eleven companies where related parties hold ownership interests of more than 20 percent are customers of the Bank.

For customers with foreign currency loans, the Bank has an agreement to set-off balances against an allowance account established for this purpose. In addition to the allowance accounts, currency loans are backed by ordinary collateral. The parent company has entered into ISDA agreements with all of its financial counterparties, and these agreements entitle the Bank to set-off in the event of default. The Bank has framework agreements for derivatives trading with both retail and corporate customers, which require customers to put up collateral to cover possible falls in market values. Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane AS has also signed ISDA agreements with its financial counterparties, but as of 31/12/2019 all of its derivative contracts were with the parent company. Note 47 Disputes In 2019 Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane was involved in one dispute. In this case, the Bank was sued for NOK 6,002,289 plus interest in its capacity as a guarantor. The claim against the Bank was rejected and the Bank was awarded costs. The plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal, which confirmed the decision of the district court and awarded the Bank costs. In 2020, Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane has been sued by a former employee who is demanding compensation for underpayment of a pension in an amount to be determined by the court. In the suit, the plaintiff has calculated the amount due as NOK 3,678,355, including interest on overdue payments. The suit also demands that starting in 2020 the pension shall be indexed each year in the way that the suit specifies. The plaintiff is also claiming costs.

Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 103 Bustadkreditt Sparebanken Sogn ANNUAL REPORTÅRSMELDING og Fjordane 2018 103 2018 103 Note 49 Hedge accounting Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane uses hedge accounting for fixed-rate debt securities issued by Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane. The aim is to counteract fluctuations in the value of fixed-rate bonds in issue. The hedged item (the bond in issue) is measured at fair value through “Net gains/losses on financial instruments” and the hedging instrument (the derivative) is measured at fair value with changes in value recognised through “Net gains/losses on financial instruments”. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane is the counterparty to the external derivative contracts, while Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane is the issuer of the hedged item. An internal swap is then carried out between Bustadkreditt Sogn og Fjordane and Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane, to counteract fluctuations in value at the parent company and subsidiary. Both the external and internal derivative contracts are covered by ISDA agreements, which regulate all derivatives trading. Within this framework, changes in the value of derivative contracts are measured daily and collateral is exchanged between the parties in the event of any fluctuations, in order to reduce the risks for both parties. At 31.12.2019, hedge accounting is used for five hedge relationships, and the hedged items and hedging instruments are directly linked by being subject to the same terms and conditions (coupon rate, term to maturity, face value). The hedge effectiveness has been calculated based on 1 percentage point shifts in the yield curve and what the impact on profit of this would be. The retrospective hedge effectiveness shows the past correlation between changes in the value of the hedged item and hedging instrument, measured in terms of their nominal value. 2019 2018 Hedging instrument Nominal opening value 2 000 500 Change in value 26 3 Hedged item Nominal opening value 2 000 500 Change in value – 27 –3 Net change in value – hedge ineffectiveness –1 0 Hedge ratio (value of hedging instrument to value of hedged item) 100,0 % 100,0 % Weighted hedge effectiveness 99,6 % 101,5 % Weighted retrospective hedge effectiveness 100,4 % 98,9 % Hedge accounting has been used for the following covered bonds and their associated hedging instruments: Nominal value Remaining term SSFBK15PRO to maturity Hedged item 500 31.08.2033 Hedging instrument 500 31.08.2033 SSFBK17PRO (split in three tranches) Hedged item 1 000 20.09.2034 Hedging instrument 1 000 20.09.2034 SSFBK18PRO Hedged item 500 19.06.2030 Hedging instrument 500 19.06.2030 Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 104 Sparebanken Sogn Bustadkreditt ANNUAL REPORTÅRSMELDING og Fjordane 2018 1042018 104 Declaration by the Board of Directors and CEO We declare that, to the best of our knowledge, the financial statements for 2019 have been prepared in accordance with current accounting standards, and that the information contained therein provides a true picture of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of the Group.

In our opinion: • The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the law and regulations. • The accompanying financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2019, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. • The accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by laws and regulations, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises information in the annual report, except the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the Deloitte AS and Deloitte Advokatfirma AS are the Norwegian affiliates of Deloitte NWE LLP, a member firm of Deloitte Touche Registrert i Foretaksregisteret Medlemmer av Tohmatsu Limited ( DTTL ), its network of member firms, and their related entities.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (Management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control. • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane ANNUAL REPORT 2019 107 Auditor’s report Page 3 Independent Auditor’s Report – Sparebanken Sogn og Fjordane • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the statements on Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposed allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on Registration and Documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the Company’s accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.

Measures (APMs) are defined by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) as “a financial measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than financial measure defined or specified in the applicable financial reporting framework”. AMSs are key figures that are not defined by IFRS and that are not shown in the notes to the financial statements. APMs are used in financial reporting to give a better idea of the Group’s financial performance or financial position. Many of our APMs are also used by other banks and are therefore useful for making comparisons with them. Many of the APMs that we report are important key figures for the Group. APMs are reported in the section on key figures, in the Directors’ Report and in the financial statements. All APMs are presented alongside comparative figures for previous periods. Definition and explanation of APMs: 1. Total assets: All of the assets owned by the bank. Explanation: Total assets is the standard term in the banking industry for all of the assets owned by the bank. 2. Average total assets: The bank’s average total assets over the course of the year. Explanation: This key figure is used when calculating income statement items as a percentage of total assets. 3. Return on equity: Profit for the financial year as a percentage of the opening equity balance at the start of the year, adjusted for capital increases. Hybrid capital (hybrid debt) classified as equity and interest on hybrid capital are not included in the calculation. Explanation: Return on equity is one of the Group’s most important financial key figures, because it is a measure of profitability in relation to the amount of capital invested. 4. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating income: Total operating expenses as a percentage of total operating income. Explanation: This key figure provides information about operating income relative to expenses, and is a useful measure of cost efficiency. 5. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating income excl. gains/losses on financial instruments: Operating expenses as a percentage of total operating income less the amount entered on the income statement under net gains/losses on financial instruments, such as gains/losses on shares and other financial investments. Explanation: This key figure provides information about operating income relative to expenses, and is useful for measuring cost efficiency. This key figure is less volatile than the key figure “Operating expenses as a percentage of operating income” and is a good indicator of the cost efficiency of the underlying banking operations. 6. Impairment loss as a % of gross loans: Impairment loss as a percentage of gross loans and advances to customers at the end of the financial period. Explanation: This key figure shows the relationship between the impairment loss and gross loans, which is relevant to an understanding of the size of losses in relation to lending volumes. 7. Loss allowance as a % of gross loans: The allowance on the balance sheet for expected credit losses as a percentage of gross loans at the end of the accounting period. Explanation: This key figure shows the relationship between the loss allowance on the balance sheet and gross loans, which is relevant to an understanding of the size of the Group’s loss allowance in relation to its lending volumes.
