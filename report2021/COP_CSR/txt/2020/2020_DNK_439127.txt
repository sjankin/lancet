The CSR Report is our seventh Sustainability Report and covers the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2019. The 2019 CSR report describes how SP Moulding A/S is working within the areas of human rights, social and employee aspects, environmental matters as well as anticorruption and bribery issues. Pursuant to § 99 a and § 99 b of the Danish Financial Statements Acts, this report constitutes the statutory statement on Corporate Social Responsibility as well as the underrepresented gender in management. The report also serves as our annual Communication on Progress (COP report), as required by the United Nations’ Global Compact (UNGC). It is based on qualitative and quantitative data from our business units, and all our sites in Denmark, Poland and China have reported data in a systematic manner. The report contains disclosures from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, and the reader will find references to the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards and indicators throughout the report. The list of used Standards and their location in the report can be found in the GRI Standards Content Index on page 35. We have followed the process of the GRI Standards and identified a list of material sustainability aspects that are currently the most important to SP Moulding A/S and its stakeholders. During this process, we have identified the sustainability impacts that are critical to be managed in our organization and we have established our management approach. SP Moulding furthermore continues to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a global agenda for change. The SDGs define global priorities and aspirations for 2030 and call on governments, civil society actors and businesses to apply their knowledge, innovation and creativity to contribute to solving the world’s sustainable development challenges. The 17 SDGs are interrelated, but each goal has its own targets to achieve. In 2017, SP Moulding initiated a process to use the goals to guide and inspire our CSR-initiatives which have continued in 2019. We have assessed the goals against our core business and most material sustainability aspects and identified the most material SDGs as well as the most relevant target(s) for each SDG: SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 3 Throughout the report, the reader will find references to the SDG’s and how SP Moulding contributes to specific targets pertaining to these goals. The report is organized into four main components, reflecting the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact: 1. Human Rights 2. Labour Rights 3. Environment 4. Anti-corruption. In 2019, none of our sites have received administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with laws, regulations and prevailing industry standard 1. The report has not been verified by a third party. However, a comprehensive work with the collection and internal verification of information has been completed during the preparation of this report. 1 GRI 307-1 and 419-1 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 4 A LETTER FROM THE CEO In SP Moulding, it is our ambition to contribute to sustainable development while at the same time developing our business.

SP Moulding will continue to strengthen its position in the Nordic countries where relevant. SP Medical will continue to intensify marketing efforts towards new customers, especially benefiting from the fact that the unit in Poland (Zdunska Wola) has become increasingly competitive in relation to labour-intensive tasks. The medical device expertise is strengthened on an ongoing basis, and the clean room production in Denmark and Poland will be expanded. SP Moulding wants to reflect society and – in particular – our customers, both in terms of gender but also in terms of nationality and ethnicity.

UN Global Compact – The Ten Principles Our support We embrace our responsibility to respect human rights and we commit to respecting all internationally recognized human rights standards, including the International Bill of Rights and the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We communicate our support of human rights in our CSR policy and we stipulate our human rights expectations to our suppliers through a Supplier Code of Conduct. The CSR policy is available in Danish and English. As recommended in the GRI Standards, SP Moulding conducts a materiality assessment as a part of our reporting cycle, during which we reflect upon our economic, environmental and social impacts (the latter including human rights, labour rights, societal issues and product responsibility). We disclose our significant impacts in our yearly Communication on Progress (COP) to the UN Global Compact. We strive to prevent and mitigate adverse impacts on human rights that we may cause or contribute to through our own activities and remedy violations of human rights in case we are involved in such. Negative impacts on human rights and labour standards may lead to significant fines and reputational damage and impact our social license to operate. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. Every year we initiate a structured data collection process during which our production sites report data on several non-financial indicators, representing the material aspects that we identify in the materiality assessment. SP Moulding has production sites in Denmark, China and Poland. Some of our suppliers are located in countries where the risk of adversely influencing human rights is greater than it is in Denmark. We want to work with our suppliers to SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 9 continuously promote their respect for human rights and our Supplier Code of Conduct (CoC) is instrumental for including our suppliers in the process. The CoC outlines our human rights expectations, it forms the basis for dialogue with our suppliers and we use it to monitor their responsibility. For all new suppliers, the CoC constitutes a part of their co-operation agreement with us. Existing suppliers have received and signed the Supplier Code of Conduct. As our suppliers of materials are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their CSR efforts, the management of our supply chain primarily focuses on our suppliers of tools. To prevent being involved in adverse impacts through these suppliers, we continuously conduct risk assessments and based on these, initiate self-assessment screening processes of the selected suppliers, which among other issues cover human rights. As a minimum this process is done every third year. The latest screening process took place in 2019. In the implementation of our CSR policy, we are especially focused on providing good employment conditions, ensuring development opportunities and a safe and healthy working environment for our employees. In SP Moulding, we regard our employees as our most important asset. Hence, we focus on employee satisfaction, safety and health as an essential part of risk management to avoid accidents, illnesses and lost working days. This focus naturally also concerns employee development and health and safety as we believe it improves the quality of life of individual employees and their families to the benefit of our company and the local community. SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 10 Indicators of Progress No incidents of involvement in human rights violations or negative impacts on human rights, including discrimination were reported in 20193.

Average hours of training 2019 (GRI 404-1) Figure 3 shows that male employees have – on average – received far more training than female employees. This is due to the employment category blue collar employees where the majority of the employees are male. The apparent gender gap in training is due to the fact that SP Moulding’s female blue-collar workers primarily work as operators, a position that requires far less training than e.g. tool setters, a position that is predominantly held by male employees. During 2019, career and development reviews10 have been performed in all our sites and for our different employee categories: 9 GRI 404-1 10 GRI 404-3 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 17 No. of Career and Development Reviews 2019 351 256 209 145 142 111 85 60 25 6 4 10 Management/ White collar Blue collar Total executives employees employees Male Female Total Figure 4. Career and Development Reviews 2019 (GRI 404-3) Supply chain – Human rights The most recent supplier screening took place this past year. The suppliers reported on several indicators concerning human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. We did not find any issues of concern leading to further investigations or on-site audit with regards to human rights11. 11 GRI 414-1 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 18 LABOUR RIGHTS Our support Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. UN Global Compact – The Ten Principles We find it important to comply with international human rights and labour standards. As stated in our CSR Policy, we recognize our employees' right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, and we denounce forced labour and child labour. We stipulate our expectations with regards to labour rights to our suppliers through a Supplier Code of Conduct (CoC). As an international company, we respect differences in cultures and traditions, and we value a diverse workforce. We always comply with national legislation on nondiscrimination and promote equal opportunities at the workplace. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all our stakeholders. Through its suppliers, SP Moulding is geographically represented in countries where compliance with human rights and labour rights is not a given. We want to work with our suppliers to continuously promote their respect for labour rights and have developed a Supplier Code of Conduct (CoC) that we use to do so. The CoC outlines our labour rights expectations, it forms the basis for dialogue with our suppliers and we use it to monitor their responsibility. For all new suppliers, the CoC constitutes a part of their co-operation agreement with us. Existing suppliers have also received and signed the Supplier Code of Conduct. As our suppliers of materials are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their CSR efforts, the management of our supply chain primarily focuses on our suppliers of tools. These suppliers are screened by SP Moulding for compliance with our CSR policy by participating in a Code of Conduct screening and self-assessment. Furthermore, the Chinese tool suppliers are asked to fill out a questionnaire once a year.12 12 GRI 407-1 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 19 To prevent being involved in adverse impacts through these suppliers, we continuously conduct risk assessments and based on these, initiate self-assessment screening processes of the selected suppliers, which among other issues cover labour rights. As a minimum, this process is done every third year. All our sites comply with international, national and local legislation. Employees have the right to freely unionise, express their opinions and participate or elect people to participate in collective bodies. Through our membership of the Confederation of Danish Industries (DI) we follow collective agreements on fair and equal salaries and employment conditions. At our sites in Denmark, wages and working conditions are determined in collective agreements subsequent from central and local negotiations. Through our membership of DI and in our daily practice, we support the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining and most of our employees are members of labour unions. In Poland and China, the conditions and rights of the employees are primarily stipulated by legislation, codes and regulation. In general, we follow national labour market regulations and make sure that the salary of our employees is fair and equal; that the workweek is limited to an absolute maximum of 48 hours; that overtime is infrequent and limited; and that employees are given reasonable breaks and rest periods. All employees are provided with an employment contract. Generally, we do not employ children or young workers below 18 years of age.

Plastics are a debated material when it comes to its environmental impact. Plastics have several positive benefits when produced and used wisely. It is a unique material, it is very durable, light weight and able to guard against contamination. Because of these characteristics plastics are increasingly used in e.g. the automotive and health care industries with positive effects on the environment and human health. The most fuel-efficient vehicles are light because the lighter the vehicle, the less fuel is consumed. When heavier components are replaced with plastics, the vehicles’ weight is significantly reduced and so is fuel consumption. Plastics can guard against contamination, and when used in medical devices this means fewer infections and increased comfort and safety for employees and patients. Despite these positive characteristics of plastics, it would be irresponsible not to recognise the detrimental environmental effect plastics have when they end up in our oceans or as landfill. These challenges are vital to address, and SP Moulding works to increase the use of recycled materials. SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 23 We are aware of current laws and regulations relevant to the environmental impacts of our activities, products and services. Transparency with regards to our legal compliance is crucial for us. We seek to promote the use of more environmentally friendly technologies and materials. We believe that it is good business to invest in environmental protection and to improve our environmental performance. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy to our employees and published it on our website to make it available to all interested stakeholders. Through our suppliers, we are present in countries where environmental compliance constitutes a challenge, which differs from the one in Denmark. We want to work with our suppliers to continuously promote their support and respect for the environmental principles of the UN Global Compact, and we apply our Supplier Code of Conduct (CoC) to achieve that. In our Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers and business partners are requested to respect the principles of environmental responsibility. For all new suppliers, the CoC constitutes a part of their co-operation agreement with us. Existing suppliers have received and signed the Supplier Code of Conduct. As our suppliers of materials are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their CSR efforts, the management of our supply chain primarily focuses on our suppliers of tools. To prevent being involved in adverse impacts through suppliers, we continuously conduct risk assessments and based on these, initiate self-assessment screening processes of the selected suppliers, which among other issues cover environmental impacts. As a minimum, this process is done every third year. We work systematically to prevent, minimise and remedy adverse environmental impacts of our activities and we manage environmental issues to ensure appropriate and continuous improvements. Based on our strategy regarding environmental protection, we evaluate all new investments in the factories and administration from an environmental point of view, securing that all projects comply with our ambitions to lower energy consumption, emissions and waste. This is done through action plans for the individual projects. Production and processes at all SP Moulding and SP Medical sites are certified in accordance with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. The business units of SP Medical (Denmark and Poland) are furthermore certified in accordance with ISO 13485. Also, SP Moulding in Stoholm is certified in accordance with IATF 16949. External audit companies perform audits yearly at all sites to verify our different ISO certifications. SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 24 Our management system includes key elements from IATF 16949. We comply with all environmental directives, among these the REACH (1907/2006/CE), Candidate list of Substances of Very High Concern and RoHS directive (2011/65/EU). Therefore, we also always provide safety data sheet with our products. We ensure legal compliance through training, awareness, operational control and monitoring. Environmental compliance is managed through internal procedures as part of our management system. Our Environmental Management system and CSR Policy make up the foundation for environmental compliance and optimization activities. Indicators of Progress We have not received any administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations in 201919. In the following, we inform about our environmental impacts with regards to energy, water, materials, greenhouse gas emissions and waste. Water Water withdrawal 201920 M3 Total volume of water purchased from municipal water supplies or 8,869 other water utilities in cubic meters used for any purpose. We always strive to reduce our use of fresh water at our production facilities, however as none of our factories are situated in locations with water scarcity, we do not conduct risk assessments in relation to freshwater usage. 19 GRI 307-1 20 GRI 303-3 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 25 Energy Most of SP Moulding’s electric power consumption can be allocated to injection moulding machines and operating equipment in our factories. SP Moulding is always considering how to reduce energy consumption. We track and examine our energy consumption using key indicators. We also invest in energy saving equipment and/or energy efficient installations. These actions help us reduce our total energy consumption. Purchase of Electricity Within the Organization 2019 (kWh) 26.703.906 6.488.290 Total Purchase of Electricity Purchase of Electricity Produced by Renewable Wind Energy Sources Figure 5. Purchase of electricity within the organization 2019 (GRI 302-1) Please note that approximately 40 % of purchased electricity in our Danish sites comes from wind energy, and 3 % comes from sun energy. However, SP Moulding has chosen not to pay for certification to document this. Energy is also consumed when heating SP Moulding’s factory buildings. Part of the energy consumption for heating comes from fossil fuels, more specifically natural gas and fuel oil. We are particularly focused on minimizing our consumption of fuel oil as it has several environmental disadvantages such as air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Of our six sites, none has used fuel oil or coal as a direct source of energy in 2019. Although it is not entirely without environmental impacts, natural gas is a relatively clean-burning fossil fuel. Half of our sites used natural gas as a source of energy in 2019.

Furthermore, they purchased and installed new machines for plastic molding to replace older machines. SP Moulding, Juelsminde, Denmark, invested in new electric injection moulding machines. SP Moulding, Poland, have continued the development, investing in new energy efficient machines and devices. SP Moulding, China, invested in a new more energy efficient 400T machine which replaced an older model. To reduce energy for business-related travel and employee commuting, we have, when possible: • Held video conferences (skype, Lync) • Held phoneor video meetings with customers • Encouraged our employees to use public transportation (such as bus, subway and bicycles) • Transported several employees in one car, when conducting business visits out of the company. • In China, a small bus has been arranged to pick up operators who live far away from the factory. 22 GRI 302-4 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 27 Greenhouse gas emissions To further reduce our organizational CO2 footprint, we continuously try to reduce transportation by delivering as large quantities per delivery as can be accepted by our customers. In addition, we focus on doing fully loaded transports for purchase of raw materials and for shipments of products to customers.

Furthermore, all our raw material suppliers comply with the REACH and RoHS directives. When using nanotechnology in our production we always make sure to comply with all international and national regulation. Our products are primarily packaged with plastic wrap and/or cardboard depending on the product in question.

Approved waste contractors collect all types of waste for recycling, incineration or other disposal. The 83,008 kilos of waste in the category ‘other’ are from SP Moulding’s site in Suzhou, China. Furthermore, we do not produce any hazardous waste on any of our locations.26 25 GRI 306-2 26 GRI 306-2 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 30 Supply chain Environment The most recent supplier screening took place this year. The suppliers reported on several indicators concerning human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. Furthermore, 3 new suppliers of raw material out of 19 were screened using environmental criteria. We did not find any issues of concern leading to further investigations or on-site audit with regards to the environment27. 27 GRI 308-1 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 31 ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. UN Global Compact – The Ten Principles Our support We believe in responsible behaviour and that we must take a clear stand against corruption in all its forms. We are obliged by legal obligations, including the UK Bribery Act, to work against corruption and facilitation payment. Our CSR Policy clearly states that we do not participate in corruption or bribery. We will not offer, promise or give any kind of bribes to improperly influence public officials, judges or business associates. We will also refrain from receiving or accepting any bribes ourselves. Individuals acting on our behalf are subject to the same obligation of not participating in any form of corruption or bribery. In our Supplier Code of Conduct, our suppliers and business partners are requested to support and respect anti-corruption principles. Corruption has a significant negative societal impact, as it undermines international development and damages the integrity of the private sector. Moreover, corruption may result in prison sentences, large fines and reputational damage, which would adversely impact our business’ sustainability and social license to operate. Implementation We have distributed our CSR Policy including our statement on corruption and bribery to our employees. We have started planning adequate procedures against corruption as well as formal training sessions on anti-corruption for core employees. Our management makes detailed controls on all sites and all significant transactions are analysed by our management. As part of the audit of our companies, the auditors consider the risk of bribery and the measures taken by management to reduce this risk. As explained previously, SP Moulding has production sites in Denmark, China and Poland. Some of our suppliers are located in countries where the risk of corruption is larger than in Denmark. Our Supplier Code of Conduct outlines our expectations regarding anti-corruption, and it forms the basis for dialogue with our suppliers and for monitoring their responsibility. For all new suppliers, the CoC constitutes a part of their co-operation agreement with us. Existing suppliers have received and signed the Supplier Code of Conduct. SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 32 As our suppliers of materials are large reputable international companies that already in a detailed manner publish their CSR efforts, the management of our supply chain primarily focuses on our suppliers of tools. To prevent being involved in adverse impacts through these suppliers, we continuously conduct risk assessments and based on these, initiate self-assessment screening processes of the selected suppliers, which among other issues cover anticorruption policies and procedures. As a minimum, this process is done every third year. We pay extra attention to processes and procedures in China due to the higher risk potential in this part of the world. Hence, we have established a specific audit team of 2-3 employees who audit our suppliers on a regular basis to ensure that our Supplier Code of Conduct and statement on anti-corruption is respected and adhered to. Indicators of Progress We have established a process with the purpose of communicating and training our employees in our anti-corruption policies and procedures. As part of this process, material has been developed and introduced in formal training sessions on anti-corruption for core employees. The training material has been designed to make clear how corruption can be avoided in daily routines and in interaction with external stakeholders and partners to SP Moulding. The material elaborates on different types of anti-corruption measures and make our employees familiar with concepts such as facilitation payment, bribery, trading in influence, gifts and hospitality arrangements. We communicate and train our employees on anti-corruption policies and procedures on an ongoing basis – below numbers show our progress in 2019: Communication and training on anti-corruption Denmark Poland China Total policies and procedures in 201928 Report the total number of employees that the anti226 26 252 corruption policy has been communicated to in 2019 Report the total number of employees who have 39 39 received training on anti-corruption in 2019 All staff members at SP Moulding China with contact to external clients, supplier and authorities received training in 2016. Training in 2019 has not been relevant as no new staff members in these areas have been hired. 28 GRI 205-2 SP Moulding A/S April 2020 Communication on Progress – 2019 Page 33 We have not received any administrative or judicial sanctions for failure to comply with anti-corruption laws. No claims or request for monetary sanction for corruption and no legal corruption cases against any of our sites were reported in 201929. Political contributions, affiliation and lobbying SP Moulding is a member of the Danish Plastics Federation which is a trade association for plastic converting companies in Denmark. As a member we contribute with an annual fee of DKK 142,240 to the association. Besides this membership we do not contribute to political or lobbying organizations, or political parties in general. Supply chain Corruption The most recent supplier screening took place this year. The suppliers reported on several indicators concerning human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. All new suppliers of tools were screened using criteria for anti-corruption and other impacts on society.
