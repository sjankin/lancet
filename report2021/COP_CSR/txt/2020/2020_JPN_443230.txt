I would also like to express our heartfelt sympathy to everyone who has been affected by the spread of COVID-19. People across the world are now facing an unprecedented battle against infectious diseases. And amid this battle, the shift toward a data-driven society is picking up speed, including the growing use of remote work arrangements, distance learning, video streaming, and remote medicine. The world is further applying technologies such as IoT, AI, and 5G toward building a society that is strong and resilient under all situations. As such, we expect to see the aggressive implementation of new information and communication technologies which are supported by semiconductor technology. Furthermore, together with semiconductors, displays—which translate data into visual form—are becoming even more important. As an industry leader for production equipment of semiconductors and flat panel displays, Tokyo Electron’s Corporate Philosophy is “We strive to contribute to the development of a dream-inspiring society through our leading-edge technologies and reliable service and support.” We will maintain our Corporate Philosophy by continually pursuing and expanding world-class profits in the mediumto longterm through utilizing all management resources to create technologies with the high added value found nowhere else in the world. In addition to the three pillars established in our medium-term management plan—product competitiveness, responsiveness to customers, and higher productivity—we have identified two material issues: people and workplaces, which is a source of corporate growth, and management foundation, which relates to corporate governance and compliance. In fiscal year 2020, we are reviewing our annual and medium-term goals for each material issue and conducting various activities toward achieving these goals. In addition to accelerating the reduction of our CO2 emissions activities in relation to our products and factories and offices, we carried out human rights due diligence within the group and our suppliers, and we began working in earnest to identify and remediate any human rights issues. In fiscal year 2014, to promote sustainability management in accordance with international frameworks, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and began implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) initiatives. Then in fiscal year 2016, we became a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and focused on expanding CSR activities in our supply chains. Moving forward, to properly fulfill our mission and responsibilities, we will continue to aim to remain a company that is loved and trusted by all stakeholders by promoting sustainability-focused management and contributing toward addressing issues of industry and society as well as their development. Your continued support and patronage are very much appreciated by all of us at TEL.

The primary objective of our project to introduce a new ERP1 system is to integrate each of our division’s previously discrete business systems, and to aggregate previously disaggregated internal data, enabling more centralized management. By freely utilizing the aggregated data in each business operation, we can quickly collect data needed for business decisions, make production schedules more reasonable and more efficient, visualize delivery dates for parts, and achieve stronger coordination between sales planning and production/procurement/ inventory planning. To make the system fully operational in fiscal year 2024, we are proceeding with introducing the system in a way that does not disrupt existing production lines. Given that the system involves business operations performed by a range of employees, as we seek to bring the system to fruition, we are building an internal framework for cooperation, sharing the merits of migrating to the new system and updates on progress in a timely manner with all employees, including the project members.
