This second edition of the Company's annual report continues to be faithful to our commitment to transparency, reflected since 2013 in the voluntary annual publications of the United Nations Global Compact Progress Reports. For 2019, GLOBALVIA remains one of the leading companies in the world in the management of transport infrastructure, with 26 concessions located in eight countries in Europe and America and the number of concessions with majority participation increases. In the 2018 report, I stated that the Company's efforts were focused not only on being a benchmark in the management of transport infrastructure, but also on managing our assets in a sustainable and responsible manner worldwide. The daily effort of all our professionals to make this happen has been recognized in 2019 by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB) which after conducting an exhaustive analysis of nearly 400 companies and funds that manage transport infrastructure has distinguished Globalvia as the most sustainable company among those analyzed in its sector. The recognized leadership stems from the sine qua non condition of compliance with our corporate values, formalized in the GLOBALVIA Code of Conduct and the policies and procedures that develop it within the framework of the Company's Integrated Management System ensuring that corporate vision is a reality every day. At GLOBALVIA we seek to anticipate and respond to global and regional trends and challenges in an integrated and innovative way. We assume our role to contribute to the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations for 2030, being fully aware that the current and future demographic and climatic reality requires new solutions for sustainable mobility. In this sense, we work to offer a differential, efficient and safe user experience, while we promote new sustainable business models that allow us to satisfy future needs taking advantage of current infrastructures and resources. All this without forgetting our vocation to develop long-term activities in a close and participatory way with the communities in which we find ourselves. I invite you to read this report that will allow you to know, in greater detail, the business model, strategy and Integrated Management System of GLOBALVIA, as well as its performance in the last financial year, ordered around the five main axes for the Company in sustainability matter: Corporate Governance, Talent, Environment, Economic and Social Development, and Quality and Innovation. Consejero Delegado de GLOBALVIA Javier Pérez Fortea 7 I. THE BUSINESS OF GLOBALVIA 1.1. Mobility infrastructure manager 1.1.1. Context Global Vía Infraestructuras S.A. (hereinafter GLOBALVIA) is the result of the 2007 merger of the infrastructure concession activity of FCC and Caja Madrid (now Bankia), with the objective of becoming the global leader in infrastructure management by combining the assets of both companies. In 2016 the pension funds PGGM (Netherlands), OPTrust (Canada) and USS (United Kingdom) became the owners of 100% of the Company’s shares, 50% of which had previously been held by the founding companies. The shareholders’ aim was to facilitate development of their concessions portfolio at the time and enable future investments to be made to continue their growth. 1.1.2. Vision and values a) Vision Representing a key strategic element of GLOBALVIA, the Vision constitutes a statement of the Company's aim and basic purpose as part of its commitment to the future. GLOBALVIA has the same Vision as when it started out in 2007: Become the foremost company worldwide in terms of efficiency in the management of transport infrastructure concessions (particularly highways and railways), thanks to a selective growth policy and strategic divestments to achieve the value sought by shareholders. GLOBALVIA understands that the only way to achieve this is by being an exemplary company with a business model based on efficient quality management, sustainability, responsible investment, innovation, transparency, and a commitment to stakeholders with their ongoing involvement. b) Values In order to be an exemplary company, implement the foregoing business model sought by the Company, and achieve the objectives set year after year, the collaboration and commitment of all the individuals working in the entity on a daily basis are essential. To this end, GLOBALVIA promotes the following fundamental values: integrity, teamwork, quality in management, results-orientated attitude, customer service, innovation, and respect for health and safety. These values form part of the Organization’s culture, representing who we are and who we want to be in the future. GLOBALVIA and the companies forming the Group consider it necessary that all personnel fully identify with the Organization’s corporate project and maintain a positive attitude towards the values. All GLOBALVIA employees must work using these values as behavioral guidelines. They are articulated and assessed internally through an Employee Management and Development System. This system enables everyone in the Organization to know these fundamental values and the correct form of conduct. 8 GLOBALVIA values 9 1.1.3. GLOBALVIA since its inception Year after year GLOBALVIA has consolidated its position, in a sustainable and responsible manner, as one of the leading transport infrastructure management companies worldwide, by number of concessions. Milestones in the history of GLOBALVIA 10 1.1.4. Countries where the Organization operates Since the main investment focus was reoriented towards OECD countries in 2010, from a geographical standpoint GLOBALVIA has been present in Spain, the United States, Chile, Costa Rica, Ireland, Mexico, Portugal and Andorra. GLOBALVIA’s current goal is to expand its activity in the countries where it operates, primarily in South America and the United States. 1.1.5. Business model GLOBALVIA’s business consists of managing highway and railway concessions of a varying nature, including greenfield and brownfield concessions. • Greenfield concessions include the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the concession; generally representing a greater return on investment and higher risk. For this type of project GLOBALVIA subcontracts the construction stage, sometimes involving local contractors. • Brownfield concessions constitute assets already in operation and include the financing, operation and maintenance of the concession. 11 GLOBALVIA business model GLOBALVIA value chain Business development Strategic identification with a long-term view of business opportunities. GLOBALVIA analyses tenders with the aim of being the successful bidder. Asset tender or acquisition However, GLOBALVIA usually acquires the assets directly from third parties after pertinent due diligence analysis. For greenfield projects, the Company creates the concession company, manages the expropriations and the construction contract, commercializes Concession implementation the infrastructure, and starts the operation. For brownfield projects, the Company transforms the pre-existing concession company to the GLOBALVIA model (“GLOBALVIA Way”). During this stage, GLOBALVIA optimizes concession management and seeks Concession operation to satisfy the different stakeholders. In some companies GLOBALVIA makes a strategic decision to divest one of Divestment the infrastructures. End of the concession The concession contract may come to an end pursuant to its terms, contract considering the corresponding clauses in each case. 12 1.1.6. Activities of the Organization Through its activity, GLOBALVIA generates value in all business areas related to the management of transport infrastructure concessions worldwide in different sectors. GLOBALVIA encompasses a total of 19 highways (with a majority stake in 12 of them), spanning 1,656.1 km, and seven railways (with a majority stake in 3), comprising 82.5 km of railway tracks, around the world.

Value generated and non-financial risk management a) Three lines of defense GLOBALVIA's goal is to maximize the value generated for its stakeholders from a financial perspective, in a sustainable manner with appropriate risk management. This model is based on the three lines of defense: Three lines of defense model in the non-financial area b) Integrated Management System (IMS) GLOBALVIA’s Integrated Management System (IMS) is designed to provide central oversight and control of a business model with companies distributed in very different locations, by applying common practices throughout the Group which harness new information technologies. This is made possible by GLOBALVIA’s multi-site IMS, whereby all the companies are linked to a single certificate. Main characteristics of the IMS To ensure correct performance, the Organization appoints an Integrated Management System Manager (IMSM) in each Group company. There is also a corporate team that coordinates the implementation and updating of the IMS in the GLOBALVIA Group. 19 i. IMS Policy GLOBALVIA has an Integrated Management System Policy, which is applicable to all the concession companies in which it holds a majority stake, as well as the Corporation. This policy, which was updated in 2019, states the Company's commitment to responsible management and its goal of satisfying stakeholder needs through 10 guiding principles. IMS guiding principles Principles Issues covered Establish a culture of quality management, sustainability, safety and compliance as a strategic element for the functioning of the Group. Determine the most suitable resources, products and services at any given time to achieve the stated objectives while contributing to the continuous improvement of the Integrated Management System and the Organisation’s performance in all areas. Comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as other standards adopted by the Group, in relation to commitments undertaken as regards the quality and sustainability of services, the elimination of hazards, and the reduction of safety risks identified.

Sustainability management GLOBALVIA is one of the leading players in the countries in which it operates, thanks to its responsible and sustainable business strategy and its long-lasting relationships of trust with stakeholders. Thanks to this, the sustainability index GRESB (Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark) has ranked Globalvia as a leader in ESG. Sustainability generates value for the Company in the environment where it operates, improves the Company's external reputation, enables a more integrated and comprehensive management, and makes it possible to create long-term vision and strategy. GLOBALVIA establishes the Company’s sustainability management, covering environmental, social and governance-related issues (ESG). These are the core factors in measuring the sustainability and ethical impact of the investment in a company or business: • Environmental (E): efficiency-related actions and measures taken to monitor and reduce the environmental footprint of assets • Social (S): the company's relationship with the impact on its stakeholders and the direct social impact of its activities • Governance (G): sustainability governance, policies and procedures, and sustainability approach at company or organizational level 1.2.1. 2020-2023 Strategic Sustainability Plan In 2019 GLOBALVIA started to design its 2020-2023 Strategic Sustainability Plan, with the aim of consolidating its leading position in terms of sustainability and integrating the strategy into the Company’s business model. 24 2020-2023 Strategic Sustainability Plan lines of action 1.2.2. Sustainability Committee In 2019 the Sustainability Committee reinforced its role as the main agent for designing the Company’s strategy in this area. The principal aims of the Sustainability Committee are to: • Establish long-term ESG objectives aligned with the Group's strategy • Review and validate the annual objectives • Identify opportunities for improvement • Report non-financial information to GLOBALVIA's senior management and governing bodies Roles and powers of the Sustainability Committee 25 Sustainability Committee members 1.2.3. Sustainability reporting a) Internal reporting to governing bodies The Sustainability Committee is the body responsible for preparing and supervising the proper drawingup of the Sustainability Report Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS) in accordance with the requirements of Law 11/2018 on Non-Financial Information. Once the report has been drawn up, it is voluntarily forwarded to the Audit and Risk Committee for review. Finally, this report is presented as a separate item on the agenda for approval by the shareholders at their annual general meeting. This Committee is also responsible for identifying and managing sustainability risks, which are overseen by the Risk Committee, whilst the Compliance Committee is responsible for ensuring compliance in sustainability matters. 26 b) External reporting: GRESB Since it started participating in GRESB’s sustainability index in 2016, GLOBALVIA has improved its score year after year and in 2019 it was ranked as the top infrastructure company, beating out around 400 other companies. There was also a notable increase in participants in 2019 compared to previous editions, reflecting the growing interest of investors in sustainable business models and the importance of ESG factors in decision-making. GLOBALVIA ranked as a leader in the GRESB 2019 sustainability index in the infrastructure sector In 2019 GLOBALVIA was ranked as the top company in its sector in terms of sustainability. The Company was rated number one in two different areas: in the infrastructure sector – a category comprising 393 companies – and in the highway management ranking – encompassing 22 companies. In 2019 the Company scored 93 points: This index takes into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. It is worth mentioning that GLOBALVIA obtained an environmental score of 100 out of 100. GLOBALVIA’s results demonstrate its commitment to leading the infrastructure management sector. 27 1.2.4. Sustainable financing of projects GLOBALVIA’s leadership in sustainability indices such as the GRESB does not only generate reputational benefits for the Company, but also an economic monetization through better financing conditions as a result of improving ESG-related performance. In 2019 Ruta de los Pantanos commenced the formalities to arrange sustainable financing (ESG-Linked Loan), the first of its kind within the GLOBALVIA Group. The spread on this loan is linked to improvement of a road safety indicator, as well as the Group's quality, environmental, and health and safety certifications. The Company collaborated with Sustainalytics for this process. Sustainalytics’ ESG risk classification identifies governance as a material sustainability issue for the highway and railway sector. GLOBALVIA's sustainability performance objectives are based on the following indicators: Category Indicator Sustainability performance objectives Base date Do not exceed 97% of the baseline indicator; the average of the last three years. The baseline indicator is calculated as the weighted average number of accidents with victims per The base date is Number of vehicle-km in GLOBALVIA's Spanish concessions dynamic. accidents with (Autopista Central Gallega, Concesiones de Madrid It considers the Social victims per and Ruta de Los Pantanos) in the previous three last three years vehicle-km in the years.

Although drivers and users are primarily responsible for the accidents, transport infrastructure plays a key role in reducing and mitigating risks. Structural flaws in the infrastructure must be repaired and failure to detect problems could have catastrophic ramifications, including the collapse of infrastructure. Highway operators are responsible for the ongoing maintenance of infrastructure and the implementation of safeguards to minimize accidents. Measures to prevent vehicle accidents include maintaining the road surface, lighting, signage and safety barriers in good working condition; proper care of the flora and fauna in and around the infrastructure; and the removal of foreign objects which could hinder the transit and use of the infrastructure, as well as keeping roads clear of snow and ice in adverse weather conditions. On the basis of GLOBALVIA’s current performance and average traffic accident figures in Spain, Sustainalytics considers the objective set by GLOBALVIA to improve road safety in three of its Spanish concessions (Autopista Central Gallega, Concesiones de Madrid and Ruta de Los Pantanos) to be relevant and material for the Company. Likewise, the highway works areas could be dangerous for the workers who build, repair and maintain the infrastructure. Safety risks include vehicle accidents, slips, falls, faulty machinery and/or the improper use of lorries, tools and other equipment, or the lack of adequate protection when using such items. Lifting heavy items and machinery can cause muscle strain or musculoskeletal disorders. Workers can also experience a prolonged exposure to extreme outdoor temperatures, high levels of noise and emissions, and hazardous substances. Highways and railways are intrinsically dangerous environments which expose workers to the risk of accidents. The ramifications of health and safety incidents include lost time, employee lawsuits and financial indemnification claims, accident investigations, and fines or sanctions. Investments in robust health and safety systems can identify risks and prevent incidents, including those suffered by contractors, to whom maintenance activities are often subcontracted. Best practices entail periodic risk assessments, employee training, operational guidelines and procedures, the use of protective equipment and tools, machinery maintenance, and periodic audits. GLOBALVIA’s governance indicator stipulates certification under ISO 45001, which refers directly to occupational health and safety and can help to reduce related risks. Credible certification schemes provide an additional guarantee that the programs are in line with international practice. 29 1.2.5. GLOBALVIA stakeholders a) Identification of stakeholders and their expectations In order to become the leading company worldwide in terms of efficiency in the management of transport infrastructure concessions, GLOBALVIA considers it essential to identify and manage its different stakeholders. Universe of relationships: creating value for and engaging stakeholders GLOBALVIA identifies its stakeholders through Context and Stakeholder Analysis. Such analysis is also used to determine the necessary actions to meet their needs and expectation. This exercise is reviewed annually within the framework of the Company’s Management System. b) Dialogue with stakeholders Through dialogue with stakeholders, as defined in the policies and procedures of its Integrated Management System (IMS), GLOBALVIA identifies which aspects of its activity have a major impact on the business environment. Specifically, the Stakeholder Communication Policy sets out the general guidelines for GLOBALVIA’s effective use of communication with stakeholders for transparent management of activities associated with its respective businesses, within a framework of respect for applicable legal and contractual obligations. 30 Main mechanisms for dialogue with stakeholders Internal stakeholders • Work climate surveys Employees • Suggestion box Other • Whistleblowing channel External stakeholders • Meetings Grantor authority • Periodic reports • Satisfaction surveys • Shareholder general meetings Shareholders • Committees • Meetings Shareholder teams • Reports • Customer satisfaction surveys • Call center Users • Chatbots • Email via website Suppliers • Stakeholder satisfaction surveys • Stakeholder satisfaction surveys Financial institutions • Meetings Asset partners • Meetings • Meetings Universities • Collaboration agreements • Meetings Third sector • Collaboration agreements • Meetings Local communities • Collaboration agreements • Social media Media • Press releases • Websites Investors • Road shows Other • Whistleblowing channel c) Stakeholder satisfaction management GLOBALVIA has a Stakeholder Satisfaction Measurement procedure that defines the principles, responsibilities and methodology for obtaining and analyzing information on stakeholder satisfaction, including that of users. This information is a key element of GLOBALVIA's continuous improvement process, and the procedure is applied to a large portion of GLOBALVIA’s activities. For users, there are different methodologies that may be applied depending on the nature of the concession. An example of this is the way systematic customer satisfaction surveys are performed and results processed in railway concessions certified under UNE-EN standard 13816 compared to those conducted for highway users. GLOBALVIA also uses its Context and Stakeholder Analysis to extract information to supplement the satisfaction surveys of users of the infrastructure it manages. 31 1.2.6 Global commitment to sustainable development The Company's firm commitment to the principles enshrined in the United Nations Global Compact, the Principles for Responsible Investment, and contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) laid down in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are key to understanding the efforts made by the Company in recent years. a) United Nations Global Compact GLOBALVIA, as a United Nations Global Compact signatory since 2012, is committed to incorporating the Global Compact and its 10 principles into the Company's strategy, culture and daily actions. b) 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development GLOBALVIA and the SDGs GLOBALVIA defines ESG objectives and actions based on the SDGs on an annual basis, focusing on those that are most closely related to its activity and promote the Principles for Responsible Investment. The Sustainability Committee analyzed the 17 SDGs in order to select the priority goals within GLOBALVIA’s strategy and operational framework: Quality education, Gender equality, Decent work and economic growth, Industry, innovation and infrastructure, and Climate action. The Company collaborates with other organizations to contribute to the rest of the SDGs 32 Contributions to SDGs Priority goals SDG GLOBALVIA contribution GLOBALVIA has agreements with different educational centres to offer scholarships and internships to young students and provide Group company personnel with financial aid and grants for studies. It also collaborates with SDG 4 Fundación Real Madrid to help children achieve their educational goals, with Quality education Fundación A LA PAR in their CAMPVS educational project geared towards helping people with disabilities in higher education, and with Fundación Adelias in building schools and other activities. The Company also fosters road safety education through various programmes, workshops, courses and campaigns. GLOBALVIA is striving to ensure that women are fairly and equally represented at all functional and hierarchical levels. Furthermore, it has joined the CEOE's SDG 5 “Proyecto Progresa”, with the participation of two Group collaborators, and the Gender equality Women’s Mentoring Programme advocated by the United States Chamber of Commerce. It also collaborates on campaigns to raise awareness and sensitivity about gender equality. GLOBALVIA offers scholarships and internships to young students, fosters job stability through social benefit agreements, and has measures in place to supplement mandatory occupational health and safety assessments, among other initiatives to promote decent work. The Company also collaborates with SDG 8 Fundación Adecco, through its Corporate Volunteering Programme, in a project Decent work and geared towards the employment of people with intellectual disabilities. economic growth GLOBALVIA also turns to different foundations (A LA PAR, PRODIS, Cáritas, UNICEF) to meet certain everyday needs by purchasing products made in special centers, thus helping the employability of people with disabilities or suffering from social exclusion. Through its business, GLOBALVIA contributes to the development of SDG 9 infrastructure in different countries. The Company also has a 2019-2021 Industry, innovation Strategic Innovation Plan, which is instrumental in adapting the business to new and infrastructure global trends. GLOBALVIA rolled out Business Continuity Plans in various Group companies in 2019. GLOBALVIA is aware that the consequences of climate change could be irreversible if urgent measures are not taken. Therefore, in 2019 it started to draw up its 2020-2023 Strategic Sustainability Plan, which includes the line of action “Infrastructure to mitigate climate change”. The Company thus imbues its business culture with different strategies, plans and policies to improve its SDG 13 capacity to manage climate change. The actions taken in 2019 include expanding Climate action the calculation of the Group's carbon footprint to include scope 3 emissions, installing electric charging stations in various infrastructure, and fostering the use of renewable energy, among others. Furthermore, 93.3% of GLOBALVIA Group companies have an AENOR-certified Environmental Management System (ISO 14001:2015). 33 #COMPANIES4SDGs In November 2017 GLOBALVIA joined the #COMPANIES4SDGs campaign, which aims to provide companies with a global campaign to make their employees and other stakeholders aware of the SDGs. This campaign was launched by the United Nations Global Compact Spanish Network together with Voluntariado y Estrategia and the support of IMPACT2030. Through the #COMPANIES4SDGs campaign, GLOBALVIA informs its employees about the SDGs in all the countries where it is present, as well as the individual everyday actions in which everyone can easily take part to make an impact. c) Principles for Responsible Investment GLOBALVIA supports the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and has introduced these principles into its operational procedures through the Integrated Management System (IMS). 34 1.3. Risk Management 1.3.1 Risk Control Policy GLOBALVIA’s risk management philosophy consists of a set of shared beliefs and attitudes that characterize the way the Company considers risk in all its actions. The Board of Directors is responsible for approving and monitoring the Risk Management and Control Policy, while the Audit and Risk Management Committee assists the Board in discharging these duties. Risk is controlled and managed throughout the Company and this is an integral part of the management function. The Risk Committee is responsible for implementing the Risk Control Policy together with senior management, and all staff are responsible for internal control and risk management. The Risk Control Policy, which was approved in 2016 and revised in 2017, establishes the framework for controlling and managing the risks that could prevent the Group from achieving its objectives. These risks may be internal or external. The main objectives pursued by this policy are to: • Increase shareholder value • Create a risk awareness culture that will help the Group achieve its objectives • Implement a standard approach to assessing, managing and controlling risk • Comply with laws and regulations in all countries where the Group operates • Comply with the corporate Code of Conduct and all internal regulations • Comply with all signed contracts • Provide a maximum level of assurance to shareholders • Identify risk on an ongoing basis and monitor the internal control system The Risk Control Policy is developed and complemented by Risk Maps for each company and for the Group which define the main risks that may potentially prevent the Group from achieving its strategic and operational objectives. Group High Level Risk Map Map of General Company Risks Risk maps for specific functions In 2019 GLOBALVIA began to develop a Sustainability Risk Map, which comprises specific sustainability risks. 35 1.3.2. Risk management a) Corporate Risk Management Model The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Model implemented in GLOBALVIA was established following best practices and is aligned with international reference frameworks. Types of high-level risks Financial risks Operational Strategic risks risks RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL Reputational Environment risk al risks Compliance risks b) Risk management bodies Risk Committee A key component of risk management is the Risk Committee, a permanent high-level internal collegiate body with autonomous powers of initiative and control, whose functions include surveillance and supervision of the main financial, operational, strategic, compliance, reputational and environmental risks. The objective of this committee is to verify that GLOBALVIA’s current risk controls are in line with the levels of risk appetite approved by the Board. In all cases they meet best practices in the market to promote consistent achievement of its objective of creating long-term value and maintaining the highest reputational levels in the market. The Risk Committee is also responsible for promoting the risk control culture throughout the organization. This committee meets at least once every six months. 36 The Risk Committee’s role and duties are as follows: • Review, analysis and approval of the corporate risk map. • Review, analysis and approval of risk maps drawn up by the Group companies. • Implementation of a methodology aligned with risk assessment and management best practices. • Advice to the Board on strategy regarding current and future risk appetite. • Verification that the risks borne by GLOBALVIA are compatible with the levels of risk appetite authorized by the Board. • Review of the impact on GLOBALVIA’s risk profile of the investment and divestment proposals submitted to the Board. • Monitoring that the required shareholder return on investments and divestments is in accordance with the asset risk profile and that GLOBALVIA’s risk strategy is considered. • Verification that the financial structure of GLOBALVIA and each of its companies is appropriate for their risk profile. • Periodic review of reliability of the risk measurement system. • , Analysis of the main risks that have materialized to obtain feedback for improving the risk measurement system. • Instilment of a risk control culture through the Board-approved Risk Control and Management Policy. GLOBALVIA’s Risk Committee is chaired by the CFO. Internal Audit area The Internal Audit area is an independent function that provides assurance to senior management and the Board of Directors regarding the proper functioning of systems and controls. Compliance Committee The Compliance Committee is responsible for reviewing the Company’s compliance risks and creating early warnings of possible violations. c) Sustainability risks Within this framework, the Sustainability Committee develops a Sustainability Risk Map and reports any significant risks related to this area to the Risk Committee: • High-level and Company risk map: o Corporate Governance o Corporate Social Responsibility o Legislation (environmental, occupational health and safety, others) • Specific risk maps: o Business continuity o Occupational Risk Assessments o Environmental aspects 37 1.3.3. Context Analysis and Non-Financial Risks As part of its Management System, GLOBALVIA periodically performs a Context and Stakeholder Analysis for each country and business line of the Company, which includes: • An analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) • A stakeholder analysis • An analysis of needs and expectations Context and Stakeholder Analysis The result of the general and specific analysis of each component of sustainability is considered in the assessment of non-financial risks. Current legislation and contractual requirements are also considered. Specifically: • Environmental risks: the direct and indirect environmental aspects affected are considered. • Social risks: different areas are reviewed: o Risks associated with occupational health and safety o Risks related to our infrastructure users o Risks in relation to the communities in which we are integrated. o Governance risks: assessment of governance bodies, business continuity, protection of personal data or data security. 38 1.3.4. Business Continuity Business Continuity has become a strategic priority for GLOBALVIA. Consequently, the Company has implemented a Business Continuity Management System in accordance with ISO 22301, the purpose of which is to establish the necessary procedures to mitigate the impact of a crisis on the business including one of an environmental nature. In 2019, the organization extended the roll-out of the Business Continuity Plans in several of its companies, making it possible to reduce the risks derived from a possible incident or contingency that could affect the Organisation’s main business processes. 1.3.5. Reputational Analysis When participating in tenders for new acquisitions, GLOBALVIA performs reputational analyses of partners and/or contractors related to the investment projects. The Company also analyses existing public information on projects and their context, especially in the digital domain. 1.3.6. Insurance Policy The Insurance Policy provides a framework for management and monitoring of risks to which GLOBALVIA is exposed through insurance within the limits established by the laws and regulations applicable to its activities and the countries in which it operates. This includes risks relating to ownership, liability and personnel. 39 1.4. Strategic, sustainable management of global trends The Company adopts a business strategy based on efficiency and uniformity, and a policy of selective growth and strategic divestments that creates value for shareholders and ensures continued commitment to the future. The Company is in the process of drawing up a Strategic Sustainability Plan for 2020-2023 to reinforce its business strategy in the short-, mediumand long-term. For GLOBALVIA key strategic elements for the functioning of the Company are global trend analysis and a management culture that focuses on quality, the environment, energy efficiency, social commitment and occupational health and safety. This promotes efficiency and contributes to the achievement of optimum, sustainable financial results. GLOBALVIA elements for anticipating and adapting to global trends GLOBALVIA is aware that we are not living in a time of changes but rather are fully immersed in a change of era that involves transformation in the way we work and provide services. Thus, the Company analyses global trends with an impact on its business in order to mitigate the associated risks and leverage the opportunities afforded by applying imaginative solutions. Based on this analysis the Company can prepare from within to make an impact outside the organization by ensuring that its Strategic Sustainability Plan is aligned with these global trends, thereby ensuring adequate management thereof. 40 A Strategic Sustainability Plan in response to global trends 1.4.1 Trend 1: Alternative and sustainable mobility Disruptive changes are being made to transport models of the last decades mainly due to the greater use of hybrid and electric vehicles as a less polluting alternative means of transport, the incipient appearance of autonomous vehicles as a real solution, the emergence of collaborative transport models facilitated by new technologies and new travel patterns induced by new lifestyles. a) Sub-trends Greater use of hybrid and electric vehicles The proliferation of hybrid and electric vehicles, which are a less carbon-intensive alternative means of transport, stems from greater environmental awareness. This growth is also fueled by environmental policies and standards such as the use of eco-labels, the implementation of low emission zones in cities, grants, benefits and subsidies for purchasing and using electric vehicles. Emergence of autonomous vehicles Fully autonomous vehicles are expected to be launched on the market in the near future. However, this will depend on technological development and the regulatory capacity of governments and public administrations. 41 Emergence of collaborative transport models Shared vehicles have emerged as an alternative to private cars. There has been a shift away from personally-owned modes of transport and products towards experience and service, the key being mobility provided as a service (MaaS). People are therefore buying mobility rather than a vehicle for themselves. New travel patterns Technology is impacting people’s lifestyles and, as a result, travel patterns are becoming more varied and less predictable. This is due to immediate accessibility to different types of transport, to e-commerce, which means you can purchase products and services without having to go anywhere, and to teleworking, which avoids the need to travel to workplaces. New users It is the users themselves who are driving transformation through increasing demands for more unique, special services that provide an experience guaranteed to be immediate. b) Risks and opportunities associated with the trend Risks Opportunities • Being party to long-term concession • The installation of charging points and contracts affects the Company’s flexibility to energy-generating lanes to encourage the adapt infrastructures to the new forms of use of electric vehicles. mobility. • Mobility is evolving faster than the regulatory • Role of infrastructures in the adoption of changes that accompany it, generating gaps autonomous vehicles.

The Company also considers it important to promote greater flexibility in concession contracts so it can adapt to growing uncertainty. The Company also has the mission of creating new mobility models with people at their core and providing a unique experience for users by transforming the infrastructures. Aware of the importance of seeing things from the user's point of view, in 2019 GLOBALVIA analyzed the user experience and deployed several lines of action. These include developing new services aimed at user mobility and alternative channels for interacting with users. The Company is currently testing new paid services and loyalty programs that will soon be available to all. 1.4.2 Trend 2: Digitalization and disruptive technologies in society We are at a point in time described by the World Economic Forum as the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to greater levels of automation and exchange of data. This is a reality in which the transport infrastructure sector is directly impacted by increasingly rapid advances in connectivity, data analysis and cybersecurity, among others. New ideas and opportunities are not confined to single geographic areas or sectors and competition for new technologies is therefore expected to intensify. a) Sub-trends Connectivity Connected vehicles enable communication between vehicles and drivers, other vehicles on the road and roadside infrastructures. These interactions allow not only generation of data and metrics but also communication of this information in real time. Big Data Data analysis has the power to transform the way governments, planners, developers, owners and operators manage infrastructure. Different governments are pushing for greater participation of big data in infrastructure, which means owners and operators will be required to have access to this information. Cybersecurity The actions of organizations in the digital domain and the transformation of their businesses pose an inherent challenge to security and data protection of their IT systems. Competition for new technologies New ideas and opportunities are not confined to a single geographic areas or sectors and competition for new technologies is therefore expected to intensify. 43 b) Risks and opportunities associated with the trend Risks Opportunities • The pace of data generation is faster than • Technology allows the Company to that of regulation, making it difficult for the streamline its operating processes and Company to adapt to new alternatives. minimize risks. • Infrastructures may become obsolete before • Connectivity between infrastructures, their delivery if they are not adapted to future vehicles and enterprises provides the trends and developments. opportunity to achieve higher levels of security. • Consolidated leaders in the sector do not • Access to data allows GLOBALVIA to acquire have a clear advantage over small technology knowledge about user behavior, preferences companies. and needs, to be able to provide them with a more individualized experience thereby building customer loyalty. • Digital transformation of the business and the • Data acts as a key catalyst for innovation and increase in digitally managed data expose the the development of new ideas. Company to information security conflicts (cyber-attacks, etc.). c) GLOBALVIA’s strategic response to the trend Given the continuous advances in technology experienced by society today, the Company is working to integrate technology into its internal processes and into the infrastructures and services it provides. It also aims to optimize the use of the data it manages to gain a better knowledge of users and of the business. To this end, GLOBALVIA has an open innovation strategy that focuses on combining the initiatives of competitors, private enterprise, public entities and the various stakeholder groups. The Company believes that multi-sectoral best practices can be incorporated by taking a collaborative approach, thereby accelerating the roll-out of new business technologies. It also believes that only by adopting certain blueprints and protocols for action can the security of the users be guaranteed. 1.4.3 Trend 3: Climate change The rapid growth in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere, with a 30% increase in the concentration of emissions over the past 60 years, is accelerating global warming. The Paris Agreement established a goal for 2100 of limiting the increase in global average temperature to less than 2ºC and endeavoring to confine the increase to 1.5ºC with respect to pre-industrial levels. The IPCC’s 2018 “Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC” stated that human activities have caused a 1.0oC rise in the earth’s temperature from pre-industrial levels and that if no action is taken, the temperature rise is likely to reach 1.5ºC between 2030 and 2052. Furthermore, the Global Risks Report 2019 has identified climate change risk as being the trend with the greatest number of interconnections with the other main trends and connections, whether environmental, social, geopolitical, economic or technological. 44 a) Sub-trends Increased social awareness The Paris Agreement, the thirteenth goal of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the #FridaysForFuture movement sparked by students calling for action against climate change are indicative of the importance of this trend in the global social agenda. Growing implementation of regulatory measures A Climate Change and Energy Transition Law is expected to be passed in Spain in 2020, making it possible to meet the European Union’s climate objectives and strategy. Weather events and natural disasters In recent years, climate change has led to more --and more intense-extreme weather events. b) Risks and opportunities associated with the trend Risks Opportunities • Increased social awareness of climate change • Heightened social awareness about climate exposes GLOBALVIA to reputational risk if it change offers GLOBALVIA the opportunity to does not take measures to reduce build up its reputation through successful greenhouse gas emissions management of this issue and reduce the environmental impact of conventional vehicles. • The Company will have to adapt to the new • GLOBALVIA already has an international regulations to avoid infringements and management framework for environmental sanctions. regulatory measures that fosters regulatory compliance and risk reduction in the management of new businesses. • The planned, rapid adaptation of Company• Extreme weather events can cause managed infrastructures to new weather destruction to the infrastructure managed by conditions could be a source of differential the Company, causing damage to roads and value for the Company. even traffic accidents. c) GLOBALVIA’s strategic response to the trend In 2018 GLOBALVIA introduced Business Continuity Plans to adapt quickly and systematically to situations that could collapse its operations. The objective of these plans is to provide an adequate response to crisis situations, including those arising from environmental risks. In addition, the Company has a tool in place to monitor legal compliance with environmental and occupational health and safety requirements. This is one of GLOBALVIA’s main tools to ensure the proper functioning of the IMS. In addition, it has specific objectives for reducing emissions through innovative projects that minimize the Company’s impact on climate change. 45 1.4.4 Trend 4: New markets and new business models As competition for new investment opportunities in developed markets continues to mount, searches for investment in emerging markets have intensified. In addition, projects of an unprecedented scale and complexity have been seen in recent years. a) Sub-trends Emerging markets In the short-term infrastructure players are expected to start placing greater emphasis on exploring opportunities in emerging markets. This will lead to better infrastructure, better quality of life and better global competitiveness in these markets. Leveraging of existing infrastructure Transport infrastructure will foreseeably adapt to the vehicles and users of today and of the future. Transport infrastructure management companies are expected to incorporate road sensors to collect information that will serve to improve the user experience, as well as renew and update infrastructures to facilitate the introduction of autonomous vehicles among other initiatives. b) Risks and opportunities associated with the trend Risks Opportunities • Emerging countries involve competitiveness • There is less competition in emerging risks related to deadlines, less regulation in markets than in other markets, due to the certain aspects, political context, knowledge need for investment capacity coupled with and skilled talent, quality and resilience of management ability in this type of context. infrastructures, and established minimum standards. • New business models will call for greater • These projects provide the opportunity to collaboration between the various players collaborate with local players, making it and bring unknown risks. easier to penetrate new markets and acquire • Large-scale projects are usually accompanied the necessary business intelligence. They also by their politicization, with the resulting provide the opportunity to collaborate with imbalances. international organizations and exchange best practices. c) GLOBALVIA’s strategic response to the trend GLOBALVIA’s target markets are OECD countries with special emphasis on Spain, the European Union and North America, which reduces its operational risk compared to that in other markets. Also, the Company is continuously on the lookout for business opportunities, both in developed and in emerging markets, including the management of large-scale projects and collaborations with prestigious local entities. GLOBALVIA’s innovation strategy includes the assessment of emerging technologies, new business models and potential disruptions to its activities. 46 II. GLOBALVIA’S FIVE PILLARS OF SUSTAINABILITY The Company understands sustainability as a logical consequence of its commitment to the environment. The long-term bond between the Company and the territories where it operates has led to a management model design in which sustainability is integrated throughout all the Organization's processes, considering the following pillars. These pillars provide the structure for most of the sections in this Sustainability Report Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement (NFIS). 47 2.1. Corporate governance 2.1.1. Good governance a) Responsible and diligent governance GLOBALVIA has a Code of Good Governance which sets out the responsibilities of its executives and is used by the directors and governing bodies to control management decisions. The Company’s corporate governance also defines expected commitments and practices, which are implemented via policies and principles to guide, promote and ensure good governance throughout the Group. Pursuant to this code, a management model has been devised in which sustainability is imbued throughout all processes in the value chain. GLOBALVIA focuses its activity on OECD countries and, therefore, its corporate principles are based on the guidelines defined by that organization. The Company’s expected principles, commitments and practices in respect of corporate governance also comply with the legal framework applicable to the Company and the regulatory requirements in the countries where it operates. GLOBALVIA also bases its principles on the requirements of the Spanish Companies Act and, although it is not applicable to the Company, the recommendations of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies. These corporate governance principles are enshrined in the Company’s Code of Corporate Governance. Components of good governance for GLOBALVIA 1. Articles of association: these have governed GLOBALVIA since its incorporation and they regulate the rights and obligations of its personnel and the way the Organization operates with third parties. 2. Policies and procedures: these encompass all corporate decisions establishing criteria and guidelines for the activity of Group companies at all levels. GLOBALVIA policies 48 3. Governing bodies: GLOBALVIA has the general meetings of shareholders, a Board of Directors, an Audit and Risk Committee, a Nomination and Remuneration Committee and a Steering Committee. GLOBALVIA governing bodies Additionally, in order to oversee and verify that GLOBALVIA’s processes are being carried out correctly in all the Group’s concession companies, the following internal control mechanisms are in place: • Governing bodies • Rules and guidelines • Risk management system • Internal audit area • Control function It should be noted that the Ruta 27 concession publishes an annual corporate report. b) General meetings of shareholders In 2019 the shareholders of GLOBALVIA Infraestructuras held four general meetings (one ordinary and three extraordinary) with an attendance rate of 100%. The points discussed in these meetings were: approval of accounts, appointment of auditors, resignation, appointment and re-election of board members, and distribution of reserves. All the points were approved. GLOBALVIA shareholder structure 49 c) Board of Directors The Board of Directors, the highest representative body of GLOBALVIA after the shareholders at their general meetings, comprises 12 members, which is within the range of 10 to 12 members established in the Company’s articles of association and the CNMV’s recommended range of 5 to 15 members. Only shareholders at their general meetings have the power to determine the number of board members in the established timeframe and appoint them. Board members need not be shareholders to be appointed. The main responsibility of the Board of Directors is to direct, manage and represent the Company. To this end, the Board meets at least once per quarter. Specifically, in 2019 the Board of Directors held six meetings with an attendance rate of 100%. Duties and powers of the Board of Directors In addition, the Board of Directors has set up two committees: the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, and the Audit and Risk Committee, to which it permanently delegates certain powers of the Board. However, some Board powers are exclusive to the Board of Directors. 50 Composition of the Board of Directors The Chairman of GLOBALVIA’s Board of Directors, Mr. Juan Béjar Ochoa, is not an executive and his role is independent from that of the Company’s CEO, Mr. Javier Pérez Fortea. 10 of the 12 Board members are proprietary directors, appointed by each of the shareholders in proportion to their interest in the share capital. Members of the Board of Directors Mr. Juan Béjar Ochoa Chairman Degree in Law and Business Administration and Management.

Members with previous experience in the sector (in management, academia or research) account for 83% of the Board, excluding executive members. The Board of Directors and its delegated committees have undergone annual evaluations since 2017. In 2019 the evaluations were carried out by an independent third party, following the recommendations of the Good Governance Code of Listed Companies, whereby the Board will periodically assess the performance of its members and committees, assisted by an independent external consultant at least every three years. As regards the independence of the Board of Directors, the first point on the agenda of every board meeting is for the directors to state whether or not they have any conflicts of interest in respect of the other items on the agenda. Nomination and Remuneration Committee GLOBALVIA's Nomination and Remuneration Committee, which reports directly to the Board of Directors and whose proposals must be ratified by the Board, was established to carry out duties related to the composition of the Steering Committee and the Company’s remuneration policy. Duties and powers of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee 53 Diversity is one of the issues considered in the selection process for directors. Directorships are not currently remunerated positions. The only paid positions in this respect are those of CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors, appointed by the shareholders of GLOBALVIA. These two people are not linked to the Organization through any employment contract, rather their relationship with the Organization is of a commercial nature. The CEO’s variable remuneration is proposed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. Senior management remuneration is indicated in point 23 b) of the notes to the consolidated annual accounts of GLOBALVIA Infrastructures and subsidiaries. The Committee comprises four members, all of whom are non-executive directors of the Group, each representing one of the Company’s shareholders. The members are appointed by the Board of Directors. Mr. Juan Béjar Ochoa, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, is also Chairman of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee In 2019 the Nomination and Remuneration Committee met five times, with an attendance rate of 100%. Audit and Risk Committee GLOBALVIA's Audit and Risk Committee, which reports directly to the Board of Directors and whose proposals must be ratified by the Board, was established to carry out duties related to risk management, internal control and financial reporting of the companies.

Duties and powers of the Audit and Risk Committee 54 The Committee comprises four members, all of whom are non-executive directors of the Company, each representing one of the Group’s shareholders. The members of the Audit and Risk Committee are appointed by the Board of Directors. Ms. Irina Frolova, who represents the shareholder PGGM, is the Chairwoman of the Audit and Risk Committee. Members of the Audit and Risk Committee The Audit and Risk Committee met six times in 2019, with an attendance rate of 100%. d) Steering Committee of the Group Members of the Steering Committee 55 e) Organizational structure of GLOBALVIA Organizational chart of the Company (Steering Committee positions only) 2.1.2. Integrity GLOBALVIA’s fundamental values are integrity, teamwork, quality in management, results-orientated attitude, customer service, innovation, and respect for health and safety. Integrity is the value that drives all Group personnel to behave in an ethical and responsible manner, such that all their decisions and actions are fully compliant with applicable laws, regulations, rules and internal and external procedures. a) Code of Conduct Content of the Code of Conduct GLOBALVIA’s Code of Conduct, and the policies, protocols and procedures through which it is implemented, set forth the basic principles and values for behavior of GLOBALVIA employees and third parties, serving as important components of the Company’s corporate culture. The Code of Conduct lays down a series of behavioral guidelines based on respect for human rights, and a series of procedures to train and brief personnel on the content and application of the Code, and to report and control any violations thereof. In this regard, GLOBALVIA adheres to the human and labor rights contemplated in Spanish and international legislation. Likewise, in 2013 it subscribed to the principles of the Global Compact (Communication on Progress, available here), the United Nations norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning multinational enterprises, and the social policy of the International Labor Organization (ILO), respecting the laws of each country and the ethical principles of their respective cultures. 56 Code of Conduct reference documents The Code of Conduct indicates the following: i. Scope: all Group personnel must comply with GLOBALVIA’s Code of Conduct, regardless of professional category. The same applies to all Group companies and GLOBALVIA investees who decide to subscribe to it. Furthermore, this Code extends to all GLOBALVIA stakeholders whose behavior could affect the Company’s reputation or interests. ii. Values: the Code of Conduct lays down the Group's values, which are required to achieve its goals and form part of the Company’s culture. 57 GLOBALVIA values iii. Norms of professional conduct: these rules establish that compliance with the Code of Conduct is an obligation inherent to the responsibilities of all personnel to whom it applies. Therefore, all employees accept, without exception, that any violation of this Code of Conduct will be considered a serious breach of their contractual obligations. Likewise, they accept that, in the event of a violation, GLOBALVIA will be entitled to apply the corresponding disciplinary measures, without prejudice to any other civil or criminal remedies available. The professional conduct guidelines in place cover the following: 58 iv. Norms of conduct between Group personnel: governing such conduct in general terms and in more specific relationships for management and executives. These stipulate that: • Professionals should foster relationships based on mutual respect, avoiding any kind of discrimination or other actions that may contravene the values and ethics of the Organization. • Any conduct, whether physical or verbal, that infringes upon the dignity of an employee, creating an intimidating, hostile or humiliating work atmosphere, is considered unacceptable. • Any behavior deemed inappropriate will be reported to Human Resources. v. Compliance Committee: its purpose is to ensure compliance with the Code of Conduct. vi. Ombudsman: responsible for collaborating with the Compliance Committee in managing the whistleblowing channel and handling the notifications received. vii. Whistleblowing channel: internal mechanism for reporting violations. viii. Moral Protocol: for preventive measures and action relating to cases of mobbing, gender discrimination or sexual harassment in the workplace. ix. Protocol against bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace for Group companies located in Costa Rica: specific protocol for the Ruta 27 concession, applicable to all employees without exception and without regard for managerial ranks. Publication of the Code of Conduct and training The Code of Conduct is given to all employees on their first day of work. This, together with the Corporate Governance Code and the principles are available on the intranet, to which all GLOBALVIA employees have access. To ensure that employees are familiar with the Code of Conduct and aware of its importance, GLOBALVIA has a video tutorial on the Code which includes information on the whistleblowing channel. The purpose of the tutorial is to convey the vision and values of GLOBALVIA to its employees. The video is shown to employees when they join the Company and they can watch it and learn at their own pace. Employees take a test after watching the video and must retake it every three years. Other training sessions are also held in the concession companies, especially the newer ones, to ensure proper application of the Code of Conduct. In 2019 one training session on the Code of Conduct was held for the Steering Committee and various sessions were held for the different business areas. Moreover, work was carried out on a new version of the Code of Conduct in 2019 to facilitate comprehension and clarify the basic pillars of the Code. The Code of Conduct is publicly available for all GLOBALVIA stakeholders on its website www.globalvia.com. 59 b) Whistleblowing channel For all GLOBALVIA professionals to comply with the Code of Conduct, and combat bullying, sexual harassment, fraud and any other crimes, GLOBALVIA has an internal mechanism for reporting inappropriate behavior: the whistleblowing channel. Employees can also file complaints or queries through the corporate emails info@globalvia.com and compliance@globalvia.com, the generic inboxes for Communications and Human Resources, and via the website and intranet. All these reports and complaints are forwarded and processed centrally through the whistleblowing channel. The information given through this mechanism must be provided with the utmost respect for the truth and absolute conviction that sending it is the right form of action. Knowingly filing a false accusation may result in disciplinary measures being brought by the Company as this would be illegal and immoral and would go against the principles and values of the Organization. To file a complaint, whistleblowers must identify themselves to ensure the seriousness and rigor of the system and the investigations required further to such reports. Therefore, no anonymous complaints will be admitted via the whistleblowing channel. All complaints or queries will be processed confidentially, protecting the identity of whistleblowers to prevent any reprisals. Their identity may only be disclosed outside the GLOBALVIA Group, to public authorities, if it is necessary to report a crime. For the initial classification of complaints and reporting to the Compliance Committee, there is an external figure, the Ombudsman, to whom all GLOBALVIA employees can report irregular situations: crimes, corruption, harassment, etc. The Ombudsman's main duty is to provide independent, impartial, confidential and informal assistance to managers, employees, customers and other stakeholders of GLOBALVIA. Once the complaints reach the Compliance Committee, an investigation will be carried out considering the specific circumstances of each case. GLOBALVIA whistleblowing procedure 60 In 2019 a total of five complaints were received in connection with violations of the Code of Conduct, and no queries. Two were related to compliance with the Code of Conduct, two did not include the name of the perpetrator, and one pertained to acts outside the workplace. The complaints referred mainly to issues related to the working environment of the whistleblowers (except the one pertaining to acts outside the workplace). None involved a crime as such, or corruption or human rights violations. Three of the complaints received in 2019 were made in Spain, one in Mexico, and one in Chile. The report issued by the Ombudsman to the Compliance Committee in December 2019 indicated the following results: all complaints were processed and filed. The average time for resolving complaints in respect of the Code of Conduct is less than 45 days, even though the Compliance Committee establishes a period of three months (90 days) for their resolution. c) Compliance Compliance Committee The Compliance Committee is an internal body that reports on compliance through the Audit and Risk Committee. The Compliance Committee is governed by its own regulations, with autonomous powers of decision-making and control. This regulation uses the Compliance Manual, the Corporate Governance Code and the Code of Conduct as reference. The main mission of the Compliance Committee is to oversee the programs for compliance with GLOBALVIA's rules, standards, contracts, policies, procedures and internal control, with the aim of ensuring their implementation and fulfilment. Thus, its objective is to identify, evaluate, report and monitor any compliance risks, understood as any violations of applicable laws or regulations, major contracts, the Code of Conduct, or policies and procedures defined in the Integrated Management System (IMS). The Committee also makes sure an ethical culture is developed throughout the Organization. Powers of the Compliance Committee 61 Members of the Compliance Committee The Ombudsman also assists the Compliance Committee in carrying out the following duties: • Helping to ensure that the Code of Conduct and information on ethics is made available to all employees, and that control measures are implemented to prevent criminal offences and infringements. • Managing the whistleblowing channel, receiving complaints through the channel, handling the case files that may ensue, maintaining the confidentiality of the whistleblower, and proposing measures to the Committee to be adopted in each case. Depending on the nature of the complaint received, the Ombudsman may contact the Compliance Committee to activate the Moral Protocol or instigate the appropriate investigation procedures. Compliance Policies to Prevent Crime and Anti-Bribery policy GLOBALVIA’s Criminal and Anti-Bribery policy, approved in 2018, implements the provisions of the Code of Conduct and, as a result, is laced into its ethical values, reaffirming GLOBALVIA’s commitment to a conduct that adheres to regulations and its ethical values. To this end, it has defined a framework of compliance principles for the prevention of crime This policy is in keeping with the culture of integrity and respect for the GLOBALVIA Group's rules and takes into consideration not only the interests of the Organization, but also any stakeholder requirements. It is therefore aligned with the strategic objectives of GLOBALVIA and, consequently, with its determination not to tolerate any conduct that may constitute a crime, including tax evasion. The Compliance Policies for the Prevention of Crime and Anti-Bribery policy are in turn supplemented by the following: • Catalogue of Misconduct and Expected Behavior Parameters • Manual for the Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection • Policy and Procedures for Relationships with Public Officials and Equivalents • Policy and Procedures for Gifts and Hospitality • Policy and Procedures for Donations and Sponsorship Compliance Manual GLOBALVIA has a Compliance Manual which has been in force since 2016 and establishes the roles and responsibilities of the Compliance Committee, the definition of the acceptable level of risk, and the identification and evaluation of compliance requirements. 62 The Risk Committee defines the acceptable level of risk in the different business areas and for compliance, the latter in coordination with the Compliance Committee. The resulting acceptable level of risk is documented and archived for consultation by the members of the Compliance Committee. The heads of each function identify and assess the compliance requirements associated with their roles based on: • Legal requirements • Contractual requirements • Internal policies and procedures • Other requirements and regulations associated with the Company's operations The compliance risks related to legal and contractual requirements are described in the Integrated Management System (IMS) manual and include: • Environmental requirements • Health and safety requirements • Construction contract requirements • Concession agreement requirements • Financial agreement requirements • Tax requirements • IT management, cybersecurity and data protection requirements • Criminal legislation requirements The Compliance Committee reviews the risks and identifies actions to mitigate them. In addition, all requirements carrying a higher risk than those accepted by the Risk Committee are mitigated through specific actions. Non-conformities can also be created to monitor the progression of risks that recurrently exceed the level of risk. Main progress in compliance in 2019 • More user-friendly version of the Code of Conduct • Training program on the Code of Conduct • Campaign to raise awareness about compliance at different levels of the Company • Further design and development of the Compliance Management System • Development of an employee training program • Approval by the Compliance Committee of the Code of Conduct and its implementing policies and protocols (including the Conflicts of Interest policy, Health and Safety policy, Media Use and Protection policy, Whistleblowing Channel procedure, Harassment protocol in Costa Rica, and Moral Protocol), the Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection, the Compliance Policies for the Prevention of Crime and Anti-Bribery policy, and other policies on integrity, and forwarding to the Audit and Risk Committee • Approval by the Audit and Risk Committee of the Crime Prevention Model and all its policies and procedures • Drawing-up of a Criminal Risk Assessment Document • Identification of controls, design of risk matrices and criminal controls • Training on the Crime Prevention and Detection Model • Disclosure and subscription of the Crime Prevention and Detection Model in the Spanish concession companies of the GLOBALVIA Group • Formulation of compliance surveys • Issue of Ombudsman's Report to the Compliance Committee 63 d) Crime prevention Manual for the Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection This Model ensures that the Group oversees and controls its directors, management, employees and third parties in order to prevent or reduce the risk of criminal offences, based on its corporate governance model. The specific objectives of this Model are to: (i) Formally reflect the GLOBALVIA Group’s express rejection of any actions or omissions on the part of its personnel which could instigate or foster the potential commission of a criminal offence, as well as informing the Organization’s employees of the importance of complying with this Model and the Code of Conduct. (ii) Identify the activities carrying criminal risks. (iii) Set out the procedures involved in the decision-making process for the activities mentioned in the previous point, as well as the controls that ensure such procedures are carried out. (iv) Allocate control and oversight duties to different bodies in the Organization in relation to this Model and designate the Compliance Committee as the supervisor of its functioning and compliance. (v) Establish the operating procedures of a whistleblowing channel to report potential criminal risks and violations to the Compliance Committee. (vi) Implement a disciplinary system to sanction violations of the contents of this Model, with the aim of remedying misconduct and imbuing a culture of compliance to avoid repeat incidents of such actions or omissions. (vii) Lay down the monitoring, oversight and verification procedures of this Model. (viii) Raise awareness of the Code of Conduct and Compliance Policies for the Prevention of Crime and Anti-Bribery policy among Organization personnel and third parties. (ix) Establish the model for managing financial resources to prevent the commission of criminal offences. The Manual for GLOBALVIA’s Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection is based on prevention activities that preclude or reduce the risk of misconduct; detection activities aimed at identifying violations of the Model or applicable legislation; response activities for the violations detected; and oversight and surveillance of the Crime Prevention Model to ensure that the control activities work correctly and foster improvements in the Model. 64 The activities cultivated by the model are as follows: Training on criminal risk assessment for the Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection was conducted in 2019. Moreover, as provided for in the Manual for the Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection, the criminal risks were assessed and a map/matrix was drawn up in order to identify the criminal risks that put the GLOBALVIA Group's activity in jeopardy, as well as the procedures to detect and evaluate them. This criminal risk map/matrix includes: • Risks associated with, inter alia, crimes of discovery and disclosure of secrets, bribery and influence peddling related to the market, consumers and against the tax authorities and social security. • Procedures and controls in order to detect and mitigate these risks. Moral Protocol GLOBALVIA has a Protocol for preventing and responding to bullying and/or sexual harassment in the workplace. This Protocol is applicable to all GLOBALVIA Group personnel except those pertaining to Group companies in Costa Rica, where a specific protocol is in place. The Protocol establishes the Company’s compliance with the Spanish Constitution, European Union legislation, the Workers’ Statute, and the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Construction Sector in relation to upholding dignity, the right to equality, moral integrity and non-discrimination. 65 The following measures are in place to prevent bullying and sexual harassment: • Increasing employee awareness and ensuring that they know not only the definitions and different types of harassment, but also the procedures for responding to bullying or sexual harassment. • It is the responsibility of every employee to uphold the principle of zero tolerance for any misconduct by taking appropriate disciplinary action. • Training sessions are held with the aim of identifying factors that contribute to the creation of a harassment-free workplace, promoting communication and proximity between supervisors and their teams. Protocol for preventing and responding to bullying and/or sexual harassment (Costa Rica) GLOBALVIA has a Protocol, which is only applicable in Costa Rica, for preventing and responding to bullying and/or sexual harassment in the workplace. The preventive measures set forth in this Protocol are the same as in the Moral Protocol. Money laundering In the context of the Company's implementation of the Compliance Policies for the Prevention of Crime and Anti-Bribery policy and the Manual for the Organization and Management Model for Crime Prevention and Detection, it has mechanisms in place to identify and assess criminal risks, including the analysis of money laundering offences. Control mechanisms are also established for such risks (e.g. the whistleblowing channel and Compliance Committee). Competition practices The Conflicts of Interest policy lays down specific non-compete rules and controls for GLOBALVIA Group personnel. e) Human rights As part of GLOBALVIA’s commitment to respect for human rights, the Company has continued to work towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those most closely related to human rights. The Company thus guarantees its commitment to the basic rights of equality, non-discrimination, dignity, freedom, work and education. In terms of human rights, GLOBALVIA is subscribed to the Global Compact, the United Nations norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, the Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning multinational enterprises, and the social policy of the International Labour Organization (ILO). Human rights are also enshrined in the legislation in force in the territories where the Company operates and GLOBALVIA endeavors to ensure they are known and respected, and to defend them. In 2019 the Company has not identified any risk related to the aforementioned matters significant or greater than any risk that might exist in other activities, since its service suppliers are mainly local and from OECD countries, where local legislation guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, as mentioned above, the Company has a procedure that establishes the guidelines to follow in the event of suffering or witnessing any reportable behavior or action, including violations of human rights. GLOBALVIA also has a whistleblowing channel through which complaints related to human rights can be lodged. 66 The Company performs reputational due diligences of potential partners in transactions under consideration as part of the Business Development Procedures. After market analysis, GLOBALVIA identified consultants specializing in this type of analysis to support this area. For each investment project, due diligence is performed on sustainability or ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) issues, including labor aspects, health and safety, and respect for human rights, among others. GLOBALVIA follows and promotes the provisions of the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO) concerning freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of discrimination in employment and occupation, the elimination of forced or compulsory labor, and the effective abolition of child labor. Likewise, to ensure that human rights are respected, GLOBALVIA makes the Code of Conduct available to its stakeholders and has procedures and policies that provide control over potential risks and minimize the possibility of their existence. The Sustainability Committee establishes specific measures and objectives to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensure respect for human rights. Furthermore, the Company controls and monitors compliance with labor, health and safety regulations, as well as the regulatory compliance of suppliers whose employees spend time at Group company facilities. These suppliers must be familiar with the Code of Conduct and document their compliance with different aspects of the aforementioned matters. A supplier certification and quality process forms part of the contracting and registration process in GLOBALVIA's invoicing systems, in which these aspects are considered. f) Responsible taxation For the good of society and to support long-term business policy by avoiding tax risks and inefficiencies when making business decisions, GLOBALVIA has approved a Corporate Tax Policy whose objective is to ensure compliance with tax regulations by all Group companies. The Corporate Tax Policy lays down the following principles: • Compliance with tax regulations. • Adoption of decisions in tax matters based on a reasonable interpretation of applicable regulations and closely related to the Group's activity. • Fostering of cooperative reciprocal relationships with the different tax authorities, based on respect for the law, collaboration, transparency and good faith. • Reporting of tax matters to the Board of Directors. • The consideration that taxes are one of the principal contributions to society. • The undertaking of all GLOBALVIA related party transactions at arm's length and duly supported transfer pricing. • Prevention, control and reduction of significant tax risks. In order to comply with the Tax Policy, GLOBALVIA is gradually developing the necessary control mechanisms to ensure, as part of good business management, compliance with tax regulations and the above principles by all Group companies. Under the supervision of the Audit and Risk Committee, a risk management system, which covers tax risks, is being implemented to identify such risks and design and include prevention and correction measures, as well as the relevant internal controls. 67 Under the coordination and supervision of the Company's Corporate Tax department, the above best practices will be carried out by the different departments responsible for the tax obligations of the entities comprising the Group, which will establish the control mechanisms and internal rules and procedures necessary to ensure compliance with current tax regulations. This will cover all the countries in which the Group is present and all the areas of its activity, enabling it to manage its tax positions in an integrated and consistent manner with all other risks. Through the Compliance Committee and Risk Committee, new mechanisms have been put in place to control possible residual risks inherent to GLOBALVIA’s activity, such as tax risks. GLOBALVIA is also updating all internal procedures, the tax management policy and risk map so that the Company can comply with the requirements of UNE 19602 on Tax Compliance Management Systems.

GLOBALVIA performs internal audits every year which are reported directly to the Audit and Risk Committee. In addition, the accounts are subject to an annual statutory audit. These audits are one of the methods implemented to identify suspicious payments that could be related to fraud or corruption. There were no cases of corruption related to GLOBALVIA in 2019. Moreover, none of the complaints received through the whistleblowing channel related to corruption. All members of the governing body have been informed of the Organization’s anti-corruption policies and procedures. Furthermore, all GLOBALVIA employees have access to these policies and procedures as they are published on the Company intranet. The anti-corruption policy is also published online at www.globalvia.com and is accessible to all Group staff and stakeholders. 69 2.1.3. Group company management The Integrated Risk Management System (IMS) is implemented in GLOBALVIA’s majority-owned companies (Group companies) to properly govern their management and oversight. This system is described in section 1.1.7 of this report. a) Good governance indicator associated with the sustainable financing of Ruta de los Pantanos As indicated in section 1.2.4 in relation to the sustainability-linked loan extended to Ruta de los Pantanos, GLOBALVIA's KPI for corporate governance is the certification of Pocahontas Parkway (USA) under ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, with the following yearly progression: Pocahontas Parkway implemented the IMS in 2019 to commence its certification in 2020, as per the timing foreseen in the context of the sustainable financing agreed. 70 2.2. Talent 2.2.1. Talent management in GLOBALVIA In order to operate and maintain the infrastructure GLOBALVIA manages, it is essential to have a team of people trained and committed to providing services of the utmost quality standards. To ensure this is the case and to not only comply with prevailing legislation but also to meet the challenging objectives and goals set by the Company, GLOBALVIA has different corporate policies and procedures in place. a) General process for human resources management This process has four objectives: • Define, implement and manage the organizational structures that make up GLOBALVIA and its system of duties, responsibilities, categories and remuneration. • Search for, select and recruit the best candidates for the positions defined in each organizational structure and provide them with training and a career plan. • Manage people, the work climate and labor relations. • Define, implement and manage quality control in work processes. • Attract talent. b) Human resources principles, rules and policies With the aim of employing the best talent under the best conditions and adhering to established ethical principles and basic values, GLOBALVIA lays down principles and norms in the Code of Conduct and has policies which indicate the necessary tools to achieve the foregoing objectives. 71 The following Code of Conduct principles and norms ensure the objectives are met: • Integrity: absolute respect for laws, regulations, rules and internal procedures. • Teamwork: collaboration, cooperation and communication. • Quality management: continuous learning, clear and rigorous procedures. • Innovation and anticipation. • Respect for health and safety. • Competition and conflict of interests. • Honesty and transparency. • Use of professional means and resources. • General norms of conduct for professionals, directors and management.

The following initiatives were of note: • The CEOE’s “Proyecto Progresa” in which two Group collaborators participated (Spain) • The Mentoring Program advocated by the United States Chamber of Commerce (Spain) 2.2.2. The GLOBALVIA Team a) GLOBALVIA professionals GLOBALVIA underwent various changes and optimized its methodology in 2019. This affects the comparison between the 2019 data presented and 2018. The main changes comprised: • Outsourcing of a large part of the operation and maintenance service in Autopista Costa Arauco (Chile). This resulted in 93 people leaving the Organization. • In 2018 the data presented corresponded to 919 employees and the report indicated that the Organization’s headcount totaled 947. • The classification of employees has been standardized in all the companies, distinguishing between so-called “Office Personnel” and “Field Personnel”. • In October 2019 Globalvia Inversiones was awarded the operation and maintenance contract for the toll-free radial highways in the Greater Dublin Area. It therefore incorporated Globalvia Jons, in which the Group is a majority shareholder. Consequently, 40 new employees have been hired but are not included in the scope of this report as they did not come under company management until the end of the year. Therefore, the total workforce in the Sustainability Report stands at 855 employees, compared to 895 in the annual accounts where they were considered. 72 At the 2019-year end GLOBALVIA 5 had a headcount of 855 employees, of which 25% are women and 75% men, in 2018 29% were women and 71% men. The Company is striving to attract more women to the Group. However, in 2019 five new women joined compared to 25 men. As regards the workforce age, in 2019 there are 53 employees fewer under the age of 30, and 20 fewer aged 30 to 50. Most of the Organization is aged between 30 and 50; 74% of GLOBALVIA Group company workers. This age group represented 71% of employees in 2018. In line with 2018, 51% of GLOBALVIA’s workers are located outside Spain, reflecting the international nature of the Company. In terms of country distribution, the biggest shift was observed in Chile where 93 employees left Autopista Costa Arauco. As regards Costa Rica, it is worth mentioning that of the 28 employees who could not be analyzed last year, 15 were Costa Rican. The countries with the highest representation of employees remain unchanged from 2018, with Spain accounting for 49% of Group employees, followed by Chile with 17%, Portugal 15%, and Ruta 27 in Costa Rica employing 13% of GLOBALVIA personnel. 5 This information corresponds to companies in which GLOBALVIA has a majority interest and control. 73 Headcount by country 420 146 124 112 24 21 5 3 España Chile Portugal Costa Rica EE.UU. Andorra México Irlanda b) Employees by professional category More than half of GLOBALVIA workers are field personnel, around 40% are office personnel, and almost 10% are directors 6. A year earlier 47% were field personnel, 42% office personnel, and 7% directors. At present, women are represented at all functional levels of the Organization. 23% of directors are women, while the level with the highest percentage of women is office personnel (46%), compared to 10% of field personnel. 6 The definition of each professional category has changed since last year. Directors are considered to be: In GLOBALVIA Corporation: CEO, heads of area and department heads. In branches: country managers. In concession companies: managers and heads of the concession company. 74 Employee distribution by category and gender in 2018 Women Men Directors 16 48 Office personnel 149 303 Field personnel 106 297 Employee distribution by category and gender in 2019 Women Men Directors 18 59 Office personnel 150 178 Field personnel 47 403 At present, women are represented at all functional levels of the Group. Women account for 46% of office personnel, 24% of directors, and 10% of field personnel.

Under 30s have a higher representation among office personnel, accounting for 14% of the total. Over 50s have a higher representation among field personnel, accounting for 17% of the total. c) Employees by type of contract In GLOBALVIA 94% of the workforce has a permanent contract. The use of temporary contracts has been reduced to just 6% of the workforce and is more prevalent in railway concessions, where teams need to be reinforced at certain times of the year when demand is higher. These figures demonstrate GLOBALVIA’s long-standing commitment to permanent contracts as a driver of employee growth and to foster staff engagement with the Organization. 75 Employee distribution by type of contract and gender in 2019 Women Men TOTAL Full-time permanent 198 592 790 Part-time permanent 9 7 16 Full-time temporary 6 39 45 Part-time temporary 2 2 4 TOTAL 215 639 855 Employee distribution by type of contract and age in 2019 Under 30 Between 30 and 50 Over 50 Full-time permanent 68 595 127 Part-time permanent 10 6 Full-time temporary 10 32 3 Part-time temporary 1 1 2 TOTAL 79 638 138 In terms of age and contract type, no significant differences are observed between one group and another.

Some directors are under part-time permanent contracts due to their links to various Group companies. Moreover, all employees of companies located in Andorra, Costa Rica, United States, Ireland and Mexico have permanent contracts. 76 d) Employee recruitment and turnover GLOBALVIA has a specific internal procedure to regulate the recruitment and selection of personnel. This procedure describes the entire process, encompassing the publication of job offers, evaluation of candidates, interviews and hiring. Distribution of recruitment and turnover by gender in 2018 Women Men TOTAL New hires 50 65 115 % new hires 18.4% 10% 12.5% Employee turnover 32 70 102 Employee departures 11.8% 10.8% 11.1% Distribution of recruitment and turnover by gender in 2019 Women Men TOTAL New hires 14 76 90 % new hires 1.64% 8.89% 11% Departures 66 80 146 Dismissals 0 40 40 Voluntary departures 18 35 53 Total employee 84 115 199 departures Turnover rate 1.9% 2.3% 4.0% Note: Calculation of employee turnover: ((Departures / (personnel at beginning of period + personnel at end of period)) / 2 * 100 “Departures” comprise services outsourced, temporary contracts ending and retirements. In this respect, the outsourcing of operating and maintenance services has resulted in 93 people leaving the Organization in Costa Arauco (Chile). Only 40 of the departures were dismissals, all men.

This agreement, in addition to providing a career transition program for professional reorientation, gives interested parties the chance to find new jobs after leaving the Group. Within the framework of this program, a consultant is assigned to assist departing employees in the transition to their next job, via job interviews, CV reviews, analysis of job offers and skill-building seminars. 2.2.3. Equality, inclusion and non-discrimination Equality, inclusion and non-discrimination are essential to GLOBALVIA's objective of achieving sustainable development and ensuring respect for the fundamental rights, principles and recommendations established by the International Labor Organization (ILO). GLOBALVIA manages the risks related to equal treatment, non-discrimination, inclusion of people with disabilities and universal accessibility, controlling compliance with applicable legislation, the implementation of different policies and procedures on these matters, as well as training and internal communications. 78 All measures implemented by the Group in this respect are based on the Code of Conduct principles, which include integrity, respect for applicable laws, regulations and standards, and the prohibition of any conduct contrary to the foregoing, such as gender discrimination. The Code of Conduct includes a specific section describing the protocol for the prevention of mobbing and sexual harassment in the workplace. This protocol ensures the Group complies with local legislation and, where applicable, the Workers' Statute and the Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Construction Sector in relation to upholding dignity, the right to equality, moral integrity and non-discrimination. GLOBALVIA's anti-discrimination and diversity management policies include the following: • Code of Conduct • Corporate Governance Code • Anti-bullying protocols • Protocols against bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace for the Group companies in Costa Rica • Whistleblowing procedure • General rules for ESG management • Labor Relations procedure • Equal Opportunities and Diversity policy GLOBALVIA has a specific policy on equality called the Equal Opportunities and Diversity policy, which lays down its commitment to fostering equal opportunities as one of the Company’s strategic objectives. This policy is applicable to all Group companies and implements the provisions of the Group’s Code of Conduct in effect. Broadly speaking, this policy sets out the Group's general guiding principles regarding diversity and inclusion, ensuring that nobody in the Group suffers discrimination on the grounds of race, skin color, age, gender, marital status, ideology, political opinions, nationality, religion, sexual orientation or any other personal, physical or social condition. A suggestions inbox is available on GLOBALVIA’s intranet for Group employees to send the Organization any comments, doubts or suggestions anonymously or with their name attached. No discrimination complaints were received via GLOBALVIA’s corporate whistleblowing channel in 2019. a) Gender The infrastructure sector has traditionally had a greater presence of men than women. GLOBALVIA is striving to ensure that women are fairly and equally represented at all functional and hierarchical levels. Moreover, as part of the Equal Opportunities and Diversity policy, in 2019 the Group started to draw up a corporate Equality Plan to be implemented in 2020. The Corporation will therefore comply with the legal requirement imposed on GLOBALVIA by Royal Decree-Law 6/2019 of 1 March 2019, on urgent measures to guarantee equal treatment and opportunities between men and women in employment and occupation, two years before it comes into effect. At corporate level, in September 2019 GLOBALVIA began the necessary formalities to implement an Equality Plan. After planning and launching the project, the Company diagnosed its current situation in terms of equality, including different pay gap analyses. 79 The Equality Plan applied in Metro de Sevilla expired in 2019. This plan established the equality objectives for Metro de Sevilla, the strategies and practices to be adopted in order to achieve them, as well as effective systems for monitoring and evaluating the targets set. The company is collaborating with the Corporation with a view to improving the renewed Equality Plan, respecting the general principles of the new Equality and Inclusion policy, and in keeping with the Equality Plan applicable to the Corporation. In 2019 negotiations were concluded for the Third Collective Bargaining Agreement of Autopista Central Gallega, in force until November 2023. These negotiations saw the Company and the workers' legal representatives agree on a commitment to draw up and approve an Equality Plan for the concession company before the end of the collective bargaining agreement. b) People with disabilities GLOBALVIA complies with the different standards and laws on integration and universal accessibility of people with disabilities. At present, 16 people with disabilities are working in GLOBALVIA Group companies. All Group companies in Spain subject to the 2% minimum quota of jobs reserved for the disabled are compliant with the provisions of the General Act on Persons with Disabilities. Distribution of employees with disabilities by country in 2018 Spain Costa Rica Costa Rica TOTAL Employees 5 2 1 8 Distribution of employees with disabilities by country in 2019 Spain Costa Rica Costa Rica TOTAL Employees 12 3 1 16 In 2019 GLOBALVIA entered into an agreement with Fundación Adecco undertaking to inform the foundation of vacant positions so that it could put forward candidates with disabilities or complex social situations. The Corporation opened a selection process in July 2019 which resulted in one of the people proposed by the Foundation being chosen. GLOBALVIA also promotes the procurement of products and services from Special Employment Centers (CEE). Examples in GLOBALVIA Corporation are merchandising products and the Family Day party held in collaboration with Fundación PRODIS and Fundación A LA PAR. The main objective of these foundations is to integrate people with disabilities in the labor market and both have CEEs certified by the Madrid Regional Government. Other Group companies such as Tranvía de Parla, Ruta 27, GLOBALVIA Chile and A23 Beira also have commitments to include people with disabilities. 80 2.2.4. Satisfaction and pride in belonging a) Work Climate Survey GLOBALVIA carries out work climate surveys with employees of the different companies every two years. In 2018 the second Work Climate Survey was carried out in all Group companies with the aim of obtaining information on the professional needs of employees, the degree to which the Organization satisfies these needs, the employee's level of performance vis-à-vis expectations, and the factors that motivate them within the Group. The survey results showed an exponential improvement in the happiness indices of Corporation – GLOBALVIA Inversiones employees. The general conclusions of the survey are that Group company employees need greater clarity in their professional development and growth, more training and feedback from their superiors. Another important point at all levels in all companies is to improve the work-life balance and employee benefits. The survey results were presented in the different Group companies in 2018 and 2019 in order to gauge the impression of collaborators firsthand. Several plans were devised as a result of the survey: • One at global level • One at corporate level • One at concession level At global level, the lines of action were geared towards improving employer communication and branding; at corporate level to improving leadership, future work and innovation; and at concession level to improving the human resources function, leadership and training. The mission of GLOBALVIA Inversiones’ Talent Management team, having worked on improving employee satisfaction and happiness indices for the past two years, is to continue our path to becoming an irresistible company. This translates into three specific objectives: • Implement a collaborative framework with the employees of all companies, tailored to their organizational and personal needs, ensuring fulfilment of Globalvia’s business plan. • Ensure the professional growth of our employees in respect of their career and their technical knowledge and skills. • Foster their physical and mental wellbeing, as well as personal growth during their time at the Company. In 2020 the different blocks will continue to work on meeting employee needs, subject always to the regulatory framework and the requirements of each company in which Globalvia is present. Work-life balance | “Flexible” flexibility – Globalvia has rolled out a project to draw up Equality Plans aimed at providing the necessary tools to ensure the presence of men and women who can develop their professional career without having to give up on their life projects. 81 Remuneration | Globalvia undertakes to continue duly recognizing the work of its employees, based on fairness and merit while offering new remuneration measures adapted to the realities of today's society. Development | One of the prime objectives of the Company’s HR teams is to facilitate the professional growth of our employees and their continuous improvement to harness the internal talent within all Globalvia companies. To this end, the Company has a commitment to publish all vacancies internally, prioritizing internal candidates over external applicants. Teamwork | In 2019 the Innovation Champions project sought to strengthen the bond between Globalvia teams in order to boost employee growth, synergies and the pride in belonging. As part of this project, 30 people have been selected from different organizational levels and companies to lead and collaborate on various innovation projects. Recognition | In order to imbue the Group with a culture of feedback, openness, honesty and a focus on collaborator growth, an app has been rolled out to facilitate feedback between collaborators at management and Corporation level. b) Engagement and pride in belonging It is extremely important to GLOBALVIA that its employees are committed and proud to form part of a Group at the forefront of transport infrastructure management. GLOBALVIA’s human resources policies and initiatives bear this objective in mind. In 2019 GLOBALVIA continued to work on the launch of Innglovation, its innovation line under which the Innovation Champions project was carried out. This initiative commenced in November 2018. In 2019 innovation ambassadors were identified in all Group companies to involve a range of profiles in the development of incremental and transformational innovation projects. In the interviews conducted with the different professionals of the companies, all the collaborators agree regarding the importance of this project in their day-to-day activity and their commitment to the Organization. 2.2.5. Organization of work and work-life balance a) Organization of work schedule In accordance with the Labor Relations procedure, the principle governing work schedules in GLOBALVIA aims to ensure the Group's needs are fully covered and to increase flexibility with respect to employee needs, particularly in relation to work-life balance. Transport infrastructure management involves providing users with services 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This requires considerable structuring and planning work, especially in the organization of employee shifts in concession companies. The work schedule organization in GLOBALVIA is determined by the labor legislation in force in each jurisdiction, to which all internal procedures and policies are subject. Each Group company acts pursuant to the corresponding collective bargaining agreements or other collective contracts in effect, as well as the provisions of any individual conditions applicable. GLOBALVIA always seeks the maximum consensus among the different parties involved when establishing work shifts. These collective bargaining agreements usually apply to all the Company's employees and regulate labor relations, inter alia, in respect of work schedules. 82 Based on the internal Labor Relations procedure, collective bargaining agreements set the maximum hours per year that employees must work in each company. For companies providing round-the-clock services, there is a shift work regime which is also regulated by the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements, collective contracts or internal work regulations, as applicable. Each company draws up its work calendar annually, which reflects the maximum hours per year, vacations and applicable public holidays. Working days and work schedules are also specified in individual employment contracts. In GLOBALVIA, the highest number of working hours per year is 2,445 and the lowest is 1,736. In corporate services, employees have flexible start, finish and lunch times and a shorter continuous working day from June to September. In concession companies, operations personnel have a shift system subject to the corresponding legal or operational restrictions, which are communicated to the employees at the beginning of each year. These shift regimes may vary according to the time of year due to public holidays. In May 2019, following amendments to the Workers' Statute, GLOBALVIA Corporation implemented a working time log system to record the start and finish times of employees every day. This system was implemented in all Group companies located in Spain. It is worth mentioning that some of these companies already logged the times before the entry into force of the law. In 2019 the Corporation gave all its employees one vacation day to take at any time in 2020. Some Group companies have reached agreements with the workers or their representatives to reduce the maximum hours of work per year, to increase the allocation of days off for personal matters, and to make work shifts more flexible. b) Work-life balance measures The last Work Climate Survey and the psychosocial risks questionnaires undertaken in the Corporation and Metro de Sevilla revealed that work-life balance is one of the most important aspects for employees. In this regard, in 2019 some Spanish Group companies received requests from employees to modify their work schedules for work-life balance purposes, based on the Workers' Statute. The companies in question reached individual agreements with the workers to meet their needs. In some Spanish companies the collective bargaining agreement stipulates and governs paid leave for fulltime employees to breastfeed children under the age of nine months, in lieu of an hour’s absence or halfhour reduction per day. In order to meet the needs of its employees, GLOBALVIA has implemented specific actions to foster worklife balance, for both men and women. 83 Action taken by Group companies to promote work-life balance Extension of period to take Permission to take annual vacations after 31 January vacations Flexible working hours to consider the personal needs of Flexible working hours employees regarding start and finish times, as well as operational requirements Shorter continuous working days in certain months of the year, Shorter continuous working day depending on operational needs Ensuring that employees disconnect from work by hiring oncall/reserve staff. These are workers who, while not providing services, must be contactable and available at the request of Disconnecting from work employees at work, in the event of an incident. This ensures that operational personnel, who are not on duty, are able to fully disconnect once their working day ends. Longer paid leave than the periods stipulated by basic labor Extension of paid leave legislation Maternity and paternity allowance Supplement to increase maternity and paternity benefits up to supplement 100% of salary Breastfeeding Breastfeeding hour accumulation agreements Agreements to reduce the working day and specify schedules in Working day reduction the different Group companies to facilitate work-life balance Leaves of absence Leaves of absence to care for children Maternity and paternity leave in 2019 Women Men TOTAL Employees entitled to leave 14 23 37 Employees who took leave 14 19 33 Employees who returned after the 9 19 28 leave ended Employees who continued to work for the Company 12 months after 11 24 35 returning 89% of the employees who were entitled to maternity or paternity leave took it and returned to work after the leave ended; 100% of the women and 83% of the men. These figures do not consider some employees whose maternity/paternity leave started in 2019 and ended in 2020. Moreover, paternity leave in Chile is subject to the mother transferring the leave, as per the law. 84 2.2.6. Training and professional development GLOBALVIA endeavors to have the best workers in its Organization and considers their training and development to be crucial. To this end, the Company has an internal Training and Development procedure and a Development policy. a) Training The primary objective of the Training and Development procedure is to govern GLOBALVIA’s professional training plan, both in-house and external training. Every year, each of the Group companies must define its Training Plan for all employees based on the needs identified for the year. Main types of training • Corporate training: applicable to all employees with the aim of introducing them to the Firm and developing the professional capacities of employees as they advance their careers within the Company. • Language training: GLOBALVIA provides English (the Group's second official language) classes in companies where another language is spoken. • Skills training: for all employees and phased according to their professional level or category, geared towards facilitating the professional development of employees within the Organization, especially in skills that distinguish and define GLOBALVIA employees. • Technical training: specific training aimed at developing the technical knowledge of employees and improving their day-to-day activities. Hours of employee training in 2018 Total hours Average hours/employee Directors 3,286 43 Office personnel 14,856 45 Field personnel 11,613 26 TOTAL 29,755 85 Hours of employee training in 2019 Total hours Average hours/employee Directors 2,965 39 Office personnel 18,846 57 Field personnel 11,224 25 TOTAL 33,056 GLOBALVIA has a training procedure whereby the corporate human resources team analyzes the Organization's training needs and sets out the lines of action to follow during the year. Accordingly, all levels of the Organization receive training during the year, based on the needs of each level, function or Organizational area. The training is provided during working hours to facilitate attendance. The Talent Department has worked on two essential skills in 2019: innovation and communication. Training has been provided in communication skills, agile methodologies, new forms of management, and incremental and transformational innovation. Moreover, the team of office personnel has been bolstered compared to 2018, encompassing middle management and field personnel. In the Corporation, the GLOBALVIA Insights program is particularly noteworthy. By putting into practice the principles of knowledge management, employees in the different areas train their colleagues in the technical skills of their field. Field personnel receive training geared towards, inter alia, the following: • Skills like stress management, customer service and leadership • The latest technical developments in the machinery and equipment they use All employees receive training in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). b) Professional development The purpose of the Training and Development procedure is to govern the career plans of the Organization’s employees, as well as succession plans for the transfer of knowledge should any leave. GLOBALVIA also has a Development policy that establishes the attitudes, skills and technical knowledge necessary for an employee to assume responsibility at the next level in the Organization. In this regard, in 2019 following rigorous analysis of the Succession and Development plan, a Company employee was promoted to replace a departing member of the Corporation’s Steering Committee, thus demonstrating the Group’s commitment to its workers. Through this commitment, GLOBALVIA seeks to provide talented collaborators showing potential for growth with career and development opportunities. 86 Principles of development policy GLOBALVIA's Development Plan includes the detection of needs by different areas and departments of the Organization with the aim of ensuring an effective response to the Company's requirements, as well as aligning human resources policies with the Group's strategy. The Development Plan includes: • Skills: Leadership model approved in 2018 • Training: by functional level and assessment of training effectiveness • Career paths: there are five families / routes for each type of function • Assessment: performance evaluation, skills assessment, ranking, high-potential appraisal • Other development policies: uniformity, approvals and lengths of service New Leadership Model GLOBALVIA's new Leadership Model aims to serve as a guide to inform employees of the skills that the Company seeks in a leader. Specifically, GLOBALVIA has defined eight leadership skills: • Inspirational Leadership (Self): compelling others to act • Networking (Self): expanding your network of internal and external contacts and putting it to work for the Organization • Micro Environment (Team): leveraging the Talent of the Organization • Macro Environment (Team): cooperating with others by adapting to different situations to achieve common goals • People Development (Business): being able to adapt the function and department to the needs of the business • Teamwork (Business): understanding GLOBALVIA's business from a global perspective • Excellence (GLOBALVIA): striving for excellence and quality while respecting the Company’s values • Commitment (GLOBALVIA): prioritizing the Company's goals ahead of your own 87 Percentage of employees receiving regular performance and career development reviews in 2019 Women Men TOTAL Directors 100% 100% 100% Office personnel 81% 79% 80% Field personnel 0% 3% 3% The GLOBALVIA Group has an Evaluation procedure whereby all management personnel 7 must undergo an annual performance evaluation, to which their variable remuneration is tied. This procedure is being rolled out progressively at lower levels in the concession companies. 2.2.7. Remuneration and employee benefits GLOBALVIA has a Performance Evaluation procedure which lays down the methodology for setting and measuring annual targets to determine the professional performance of the Organization's employees. This performance evaluation is performed by hierarchical superiors. a) Remuneration GLOBALVIA’s employees in the Corporation and certain functional levels of the concession companies receive a fixed annual salary and a variable salary. The Board of Directors determines the strategy and objectives of the Company, to which variable remuneration is tied. Variable remuneration is assigned to each manager to ensure that the targets set are fully aligned with the objectives and interests of GLOBALVIA and its shareholders. Variable remuneration is based on three types of objectives, with different weights depending on the level of responsibility and the work to be carried out. Average remuneration by professional category in 2018 (euros) Directors 141,232 Office personnel 35,161 Field personnel 16,681 Average remuneration by professional category in 2019 (euros) Directors 148,862 Office personnel 37,767 Field personnel 25,589 Since 2018 GLOBALVIA Group companies have followed the guidelines laid down by the Corporation regarding salary reviews. Moreover, the Group’s Board of Directors determines the percentage of the total payroll that can be used for paying rises and the Talent Department is tasked with sending out 7 Management personnel comprise: The directors, Corporation and top-level concession company employees. 88 guidelines for such use. In this regard, the concession companies use a talent matrix to categorize employees based on their salary level and performance. Compared to 2018, of the 93 employees who left due to the outsourcing of Costa Arauco's operation and maintenance services, 89 were field personnel whose salaries were amongst the lowest in the entire Group. Field personnel therefore dropped from 533 employees to 450. The 450 people remaining in GLOBALVIA in 2019 have higher salaries than the 533 analyzed in 2018. Excluding the new hires in 2019, the salaries of field personnel are up 12%. Average remuneration by gender in 2018 (euros) Women 27,938 Men 37,165 Average remuneration by gender in 2019 (euros) Women 39,428 Men 42,012 The average remuneration of women in the Group companies was 29% higher in 2019 than 2018. The salaries of 271 women were analyzed in 2018. The Organization has 215 women in 2019. Thus, the population analyzed is down 20%. This 20% had lower salaries than those who remained in GLOBALVIA. The salaries of women who formed part of the Group in 2018 and continued as of 31 December 2019 are up 15%. Average remuneration by age in 2018 (euros) Under 30 14,026 Between 30 and 50 33,787 Over 50 50,967 Average remuneration by age in 2019 (euros) Under 30 22,283 Between 30 and 50 40,721 Over 50 55,143 The average age of men and women is similar at director level, 43 for women and 46 for men. There are currently no female Managing Directors in the Group. GLOBALVIA's Steering Committee is made up of three women and seven men in 2019. Office personnel comprise 150 women and 178 men. The average length of service is 7.09 years for women and 7.34 years for men. All reductions in working hours in this category of employees have been taken by women. In the category of field personnel, it is also only women who have reduced their working day to care for children. The average length of service is 9.6 years for women and 9.2 for men. 89 2018-2019 average pay rise by gender Women 10.26% Men 7.3% TOTAL average 8.14% Note: Pay rises have been calculated only considering employees who were already on the payroll in 2018. 2018-2019 average pay rise by professional category Directors 15.49% Office personnel 11.28% Field personnel 4.66% This year the directors received a long-term bonus, which increased their overall average remuneration. Moreover, the changes in the Organization in 2019 led to a rise in the average remuneration calculated compared to 2018. 2018-2019 average pay rise by age Under 30 14.3% Between 30 and 50 8.6% Over 50 4.1% Pay gap between men and women in Group companies in 2019 Women Men TOTAL average Pay gap Directors € 114,628 € 159,306 € 148,862 28.0% Office personnel € 36,168 € 39,114 € 37,767 7.5% Field personnel € 21,034 € 26,120 € 25,589 19.5% TOTAL average € 39,429 € 41,571 € 41,362 6.1% Note: The following formula was used to calculate the pay gap: (men's average salary women’s average salary) / men's average salary.

The pay gap between men and women in Spain is 6% in favor of women. 90 b) Employee benefits GLOBALVIA offers its Corporation employees a Flexible Remuneration Plan, within the framework of the Company's Flexible Remuneration Plan Regulations. Through this plan, the Company offers its employees several services in order to adapt their salary to their personal needs, taking advantage of the tax relief currently available for the services included in the plan, in accordance with current legislation. The maximum annual amount for each participant is capped at 30% of their fixed gross annual salary. The products offered by GLOBALVIA through this plan include the direct payment of childcare fees. GLOBALVIA is aware that benefits are an effective means of keeping employees satisfied, thus certain Group companies offer the following: • Health insurance: o 50% of health insurance premiums for employees and dependents paid for by the Company. o 50% of health insurance premiums for employees and dependents paid for by the employee, benefiting from prices negotiated for the Group. • Food vouchers (Chilean companies). • Study aid or grants for employees. • Life insurance for employees who opt for this cover. • Promotion of sports activities, from sponsoring races to wellbeing initiatives. The Company pays 50% of wellbeing initiatives as remuneration in kind and the employee bears the remaining 50% of the cost of classes. 2.2.8. Labor relations The purpose of the Internal Labor Relations procedure is to regulate the relationships between employees and the Organization by defining GLOBALVIA's labor policies. These include policies related to the working day, work schedules, annual vacations, disciplinary regimes applicable and occupational health and safety. The Group's collective bargaining agreements include processes applicable to joint committees. As indicated in previous sections, work schedules are organized in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement or other collective contracts in force. Health and safety provisions applicable to the Group companies are included in internal regulations, collective bargaining agreements or collective contracts. These terms are negotiated with workers' representatives in companies where such representation exists. Internal regulations or collective contracts include information and consultation procedures for the Health and Safety Committees (or equivalent bodies in each country). Communications are sent out so that all workers can have a say and consult on health and safety matters, in accordance with current legislation. National and international legislation is applied in collective bargaining, respecting freedom of association and union, and collective bargaining always. 91 Percentage of employees included in collective bargaining agreements by country in 2019 Costa TOTAL Spain Andorra1 Chile Costa Rica1 USA Ireland Mexico Rica Percentage 61.1% 100% 0.0% 11.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 79.3% 1. There is no collective bargaining in Andorra or Costa Rica. 2019 saw the conclusion of collective bargaining in ACEGA, Metro de Sevilla and Tranvía de Parla, each company signing collective bargaining agreements with the respective workers’ representatives. The three bargaining processes were carried out in a cordial atmosphere of good faith between the negotiating parties. 2.2.9. Occupational health and safety a) Occupational health and safety management GLOBALVIA is committed to the health and safety of its employees through the prevention of occupational hazards, thus avoiding work-related accidents and illnesses that may affect workers’ quality of life and cause economic damage to parties. In order to ensure the highest levels of occupational health and safety, GLOBALVIA puts into practice the measures laid down in pertinent Group procedures and policies. These measures are based on risk assessment and prevailing legislation, notwithstanding any additional measures that may be implemented. The Group also endeavors to raise awareness among employees and provide training in order to engage with them in respect of this objective. Occupational health and safety conditions are compliant with prevailing legislation at any given time and are included in the different concession contracts and internal requirements. Furthermore, in companies in Chile and Costa Rica they are governed through internal regulations. 93.3% of Group companies 8 are AENOR-certified in OHSAS 18001 on health and safety. Besides the external audit, in GLOBALVIA an internal audit is carried out by an external entity in order to ensure the independence of the process. These audits verify compliance with prevailing legislation, policies, processes, internal procedures and all requirements laid down in the reference standards (in this case, OHSAS 18001:2007). Annual objectives and targets for occupational health and safety are established in the different companies as part of the Group's Integrated Management System. 8 The Mexico and Ireland branches are not included because their activities and facilities are not material from an occupational health and safety perspective. 92 GLOBALVIA occupational health and safety procedures Heads of health and safety are named and Health and Safety Committees (or equivalent bodies depending on each country) are set up in the GLOBALVIA companies. Responsibilities regarding occupational health and safety management are defined in the applicable procedures, including the Integrated Management System (occupational health and safety section). These responsibilities can also be defined by the head of health and safety in each Group company. In addition, workers may exercise their right to complain and/or make a formal complaint regarding health and safety through the suggestion’s inbox and the whistleblowing channel. GLOBALVIA uses an online platform to handle occupational health and safety regulation, among other matters. It identifies the legal requirements applicable to the Group companies in order to subsequently verify their degree of compliance. GLOBALVIA also has DELFOS, a business intelligence portal providing, inter alia, a scorecard of indicators for the correct management of occupational health and safety. As part of the Integrated Risk Management System, management of each Group company draws up a Review Report at the end of every year. 93 Examples of employee benefits related to health, safety and hygiene in the workplace GLOBALVIA Corporation subsidizes up to 50% of the cost for Health insurance employees and their children who take out voluntary cover. This agreement offers all Spanish company employees an Occupational health and safety and annual medical check-up, in accordance with the established health monitoring agreement protocol. A collaborating institution of the Spanish Social Security (or equivalent body in other countries) manages and protects Management of and protection against work-related illnesses and accidents that may occur in from work-related accidents and the workplace and/or during working hours, providing illnesses emergency medical assistance and handling transport to a hospital if necessary. In the event of an employee's death, whatever the cause, his or her heirs will receive compensation equal to the employee's Life insurance gross annual salary. Also, if an employee is seriously injured and therefore unable to work, the employee will receive the same amount. Established in the general collective bargaining agreement for the construction sector applicable to the Corporation, Accident insurance Concesiones de Madrid and Ruta de los Pantanos. The remaining Group companies may take out an equivalent accident insurance policy. Should employees suffer any problems during business trips, Travel insurance they will receive compensation commensurate to the incident. All GLOBALVIA employees take a course on occupational health Occupational health and safety and safety (OHS). Members of GLOBALVIA Corporation’s training emergency response team receive more specialized OHS training to deal with emergency situations and provide first aid. Implemented in the Corporation to improve the physical, mental and emotional health of employees. This plan offers Wellbeing plan sports classes for groups (pilates, yoga and hypopressive exercises) and individual physical and nutritional therapy sessions, all of which take place onsite at work. A questionnaire geared towards assessing the psychosocial risks that may exist in certain Group companies, with the aim of Psychosocial risk assessment taking measures to address or reduce such risks. The measures questionnaire identified in the 2018 risk assessment questionnaire continued to be implemented and/or monitored in 2019. With the aim of promoting healthy habits within the Company, GLOBALVIA and the AECC signed an agreement to cooperate on Collaboration with the Spanish corporate social responsibility. As a result of this agreement, Association Against Cancer (AECC) GLOBALVIA supports the AECC's Corporate Health and Solidarity to share healthy lifestyle habits Program in order to inform employees about healthy lifestyle habits. 94 In addition to the above benefits, the following specific actions were carried out in 2019: • Increase, in some Group companies, in the supplement paid by the company for work-related accidents or illnesses, vis-à-vis the benefit covered by Social Security. • Increase in the amount of collective life and accident insurance in some Group companies. • Voluntary and cost-free flu vaccination campaign for Corporation employees. • Training in first aid and the use of semiautomatic defibrillators for Corporation employees. • Nutrition program for Corporation employees as an area for improvement resulting from the health monitoring report issued by the external health and safety service, and as part of the Company’s wellbeing plan. • Handing-out of personal protection equipment to Corporation employees who go onsite in working environments where they are exposed to certain physical hazards, mainly when visiting the Group’s concessions. • Adaptation of certain workstations in the Corporation to improve ergonomics, lighting and working environments for employees. • Implementation of safe work analytics in the maintenance department of Ruta 27 (Costa Rica), reducing accidents by up to 50% compared to 2018. • Subscription to the “Standard Company” occupational health and safety management program through a memorandum of understanding in Autopista del Itata (Chile). • “Week of Reflection on Safety” campaign in Costa Arauco (Chile). • PEC recognition for Autopista del Aconcagua (Chile) by the Chilean Safety Association (ACHS) (acknowledging quality in companies). b) Main indicators of occupational health and safety Occupational health and safety indicators in 2019 Costa Spain Andorra Chile Costa Rica USA Ireland Mexico TOTAL Rica Accident rate 1 38.2 26.1 10.4 21.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 9.4 23.6 Accident severity rate 1.7 0.4 0.6 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.1 0.8 2 Work-related illness 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 rate 3 Deaths caused by a work-related accident 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 or illness Absenteeism rate 4 8.9% 10.6% 6.0% 3.7% 0.2% 0.0% 0.0% 4.3% 6.6% Absenteeism hours 64,226 4,088 24,795 9,773 56 0 0 9,992 112,929 1.

It does not include vacations. 95 c) Emergency plans GLOBALVIA Corporation has a procedure for Emergency and Response Plans. This document lays down GLOBALVIA’s systematic routines to identify possible emergency situations, both in terms of occupational health and safety (previously detected in the risk assessments performed in GLOBALVIA) and environmental matters. Accordingly, the Organization endeavors to prevent or reduce the impact of such situations on workers and/or the environment. In 2019 the emergency response team of GLOBALVIA Corporation was expanded and, in addition to the theoretical training on emergencies, they received specific theoretical-practical training on emergencies and fire suppression, simulating real-life situations. 96 2.3. Environment 2.3.1. Environmental management As part of its commitment to the environment, GLOBALVIA promotes responsible and efficient management, identifying the possible environmental impacts of its activity in order to establish measures to eliminate, reduce or mitigate them. 93.3% of GLOBALVIA companies have an ISO 14001:2015 certified Environmental Management System in place 9. Under this standard the companies apply the continuous improvement cycle, known as the Deming Cycle or PDCA Cycle (Plan, Do, Check, Act), in all its activities and facilities. Through its policies and objectives GLOBALVIA embraces the challenge of managing its infrastructure in an environmentally-friendly way. To this end, GLOBALVIA applies the precautionary principle to identify all environmental aspects of the service rendered from a life cycle perspective and determine the risks and opportunities upon which objectives for improvement are defined, in order to control and minimize potential environmental impacts generated by its activity. 1. Considering the companies included in the scope of this Sustainability Report. See the “About this report” section. 97 GLOBALVIA has devised a series of procedures and technical instructions for operational environmental control in order to ensure better performance. Through these, the Organization establishes the necessary guidelines and measures for all processes to be carried out in controlled conditions and in accordance with the requirements laid down by the Organization and environmental legislation in the countries where it operates. Note: the issues highlighted in green are the relevant material issues identified for GLOBALVIA and its stakeholders in 2019. GLOBALVIA also defines the requirements applicable to its supply chain, ensuring that the products and services provided are in keeping with its Integrated Management System policy and the objectives set. GLOBALVIA applies the same environmental policies and commitment to its contractors, subcontractors and suppliers to ensure they handle all environmental aspects correctly and comply with applicable legislation. Environmental impacts can result in sanctions for legal or regulatory violations. However, as in 2018, no significant sanctions 10 were imposed on GLOBALVIA in 2019. To ensure correct environmental management, GLOBALVIA engages all Organization personnel and has a multi-disciplinary team of 15 professionals dedicated to the prevention of environmental risks. These employees are distributed among the Group companies in order to ensure continuous improvement in all the business lines and countries where GLOBALVIA operates. Specialized technical assistance is also on hand, as well as a team of legal experts to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements. Every year the Organization analyzes the need for new resources in order to ensure that all environmental risks are managed properly. Overall, GLOBALVIA has over 25 employees dedicated to environmental management and all Organization personnel are involved in the process. In Costa Rica Ruta 27 had environmental guarantees in excess of Euros 2,000,000 in 2019. GLOBALVIA obtains information on the perception that suppliers and users have of the Organization's environmental commitment through satisfaction campaigns. The results show an upward trend in stakeholder satisfaction. Suppliers in Costa Rica show a maximum level of satisfaction. 10 Significant sanctions are those involving fines of more than USD 10,000 or equivalent local currency, as established in the SAM (part of S&P Global) Corporate Sustainability Assessments (CSA) to determine the threshold for considering an environmental fine as significant. 98 Level of stakeholder satisfaction with environmental performance (1: very low 5: very high) Highway users Suppliers1 2018 2019 2018 2019 Spain 4.3 4.5 4.6 4.6 Portugal 4.5 4.4 4.6 4.7 Costa Rica 4.6 4.6 4.5 5.0 Chile 4.1 4.0 4.5 4.5 Andorra 4.1 4.6 5.0 4.6 USA2 4.5 4.8 1. Railways, Highways (except the Costa Arauco highway in Chile in 2018) and Offices. 2. The first stakeholder satisfaction campaign for Pocahontas Parkway (USA) was launched in 2019. a) GLOBALVIA alliances and participation In line with its environmental commitments, GLOBALVIA promotes and participates in a series of initiatives whereby it not only increases the number of environmental alliances, but also collaborates with stakeholders in different environmental actions and programs. The following initiatives were of note in 2019: Participation in the GRESB 2019 Sustainability Index, obtaining the maximum score in the environment category (100 points) (Global) Awarded the Bandera Azul in Ruta 27 in the climate change category and the country’s Esencial Costa Rica badge of honor (Costa Rica) Sponsor of the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference COP 25 in Madrid, presided over by the Chilean government (Global, Chile and Spain) Participation in and sponsor of the International Environmental Sustainability Conference (CISM per the Spanish acronym) in which Fernando Vallejo (Spain) spoke on sustainable mobility Participation in the “Developers Reborn Finding Value In an Inflated Market” roundtable at the European Infrastructure Finance Summit (EIFS) by Carolina Torres (Spain) Participation in Encuentros Cadena Ser Sustainable Mobility by Fernando Vallejo (Spain). Sustainable Mobility workshop organized by Cadena Ser in Seville, at which Enrique Martínez spoke (Spain) 99 b) Notable actions and good practice All electricity consumption in Spain and Costa Rica, representing 64% of the Group’s total consumption, comes from renewable energy. Installation of electric vehicle charging stations. (Autopista del Aconcagua Chile and Ruta 27 Costa Rica) Recycling of green waste from roadside clearing work.

Initiative to raise awareness about the importance of eliminating single-use plastic, giving out reusable bags, cutlery and glass bottles to all concession personnel. (Ruta 27 Costa Rica) 100 Other initiatives rolled out in 2019, in addition to those launched in 2018, to mitigate the environmental impact: • Replacement of paper business cards with digital cards (Global) • Installation of a rainwater collection tank for treatment and recycling (Ruta 27 Costa Rica) • Awareness campaign for employees and other stakeholders, such as suppliers, contractors and subcontractors (Global) • Hydroseeding and reforestation activities in Autopista Costa Arauco (Chile) • Activities to raise awareness of recycling in all Chilean Group companies (Chile) • Launch of the “1 auto 1 árbol” (1 car 1 tree) campaign (Chile) • Ecological road markings (Chile) • Beach cleaning in Pichicuy (Chile) • Teaching children about recycling with Fundación Real Madrid (Chile) • Proposed studies on the feasibility of reducing water use in workplaces (Chile) • Agreement to generate synthetic turf for soccer pitches using tires found on the roadside (Chile) • Protection of flora and fauna through the recycling and reuse of waste in Ruta 27 (Costa Rica) 2.3.2. Sustainable use and management of resources a) Electricity consumption GLOBALVIA endeavors to use electricity generated from renewable sources and improve the energy efficiency of its activities and facilities in order to fulfil its environmental commitments. To ensure it manages electricity consumption correctly, GLOBALVIA establishes indicators and targets to monitor the Organization's energy performance. Energy performance Difference 2017 2018 2019 2018-2019 Electricity (MJ) 119,214,407 117,680,983 121,802,200 3.50% GLOBALVIA’s energy consumption rose in 2019 mainly driven by the opening of a new section in Chile: Santiago – Lampa highway. This project entails a change in standard to an urban highway for 15 km of Route 5 North with up to four express lanes and three service roads each way. A 1% reduction in electricity consumption year on year has been achieved in railways thanks to the saving measures implemented. 33,833.94 MWh 50.24% 16,998.62 MWh 2019 49.14% 16,627.19 MWh 63.89% Renewable energy imported 0.02% Renewable energy generated 0.62% 208.14 MWh 101 b) Materials GLOBALVIA ensures that the materials consumed in its activities and facilities are managed properly through measures such as: • Optimization of consumption by promoting a rational use of resources. • Purchases of materials in appropriate quantities and reusable containers. • Correct storage of products properly identified and protected from the elements. • Favoring the consumption of non-hazardous materials. Materials consumed 2019 Asphalt agglomerate (kg) 10,359.25 Concrete, cement, sand and other (kg) 172,345.00 Sepiolite (kg) 1,700.00 Paint (roads, structures, etc.) (kg) 1,476.75 Salt (winter road safety campaigns) (kg) 1,036,638.00 c) Waste management In turn, GLOBALVIA has a procedure to ensure the waste generated is managed correctly. This procedure must be applied by Organization personnel and contractors, and it includes the following measures: • Optimization of processes to minimize waste. • Proper separation, labelling and storage of waste. • Guaranteeing the correct treatment and ultimate disposal of waste. • Prioritization of recovery over disposal. • Raising awareness among users. All these measures are geared towards fostering a circular economy and extending the useful life of the resources used. Through these practices GLOBALVIA is looking to move away from the conventional linear model of supply, use and dispose, prioritizing the efficient use of resources and reusing, recycling and recovering materials rather than disposing of them. 102 Considering the activities carried out, GLOBALVIA has identified the possibility of generating, inter alia, the following hazardous and non-hazardous waste: Potential waste Uncontaminated plastics and packaging Used oil Paper and cardboard Spill absorbents Green waste Contaminated empty containers Municipal solid waste Contaminated rags Waste asphalt Air or oil filters Metals (e.g. steel wool) Waste electrical and electronic equipment Construction and demolition waste Fluorescent tubes Tires, rims, etc. (road cleaning) Septic tank sludge and hydrocarbon separators Halogen lamps Organic waste Glass Waste 2018 11 2019 Total waste (t) 14,757.64 21,921.83 Non-hazardous waste 99.42% 99.73% Hazardous waste 0.58% 0.27% Although the total waste generated by the Organization increased in 2019, this was primarily due to the following: • The volume of waste generated in Pocahontas Parkway has been added to the analysis. This data was not available in 2018. • Most non-hazardous waste comes from the resurfacing campaigns or roadworks. These tasks are intrinsic to GLOBALVIA's activity and necessary to improve road safety. • Non-hazardous waste includes that generated by infrastructure users, the volume of which is highly variable and beyond the Company’s control. Municipal waste deposited by passengers at waste collection points in stations and railway stops. Waste left behind by highway users and collected during road cleaning work (e.g. endof-life tires). 21,921.83 t 99.78% 21,874.53 t 2019 0.19% 41.20 t 99.73% Non-hazardous waste 0.27% Hazardous waste 0.03% 6.10 t 11 Pocahontas Parkway (USA) concession company data not available in 2018. 103 d) Fuel consumption Travel forms part of GLOBALVIA companies’ activity, since highway maintenance, conservation and surveillance work involve the constant transfer of personnel in vehicles. The operation of machinery and generators requires additional fuel consumption. GLOBALVIA therefore has a procedure to ensure all fuel consumption in the Organization's activities and facilities is managed correctly, as shown by the 1.4% drop from 2018 to 2019. Fuel consumption Type 2019 Vehicle fleet 1,531,506.05 Generators 9,284.47 Gasoline (MJ) Facilities 128,884.53 Total gasoline 1,669,675.05 Vehicle fleet 23,674,141.24 Generators 638,972.41 Diesel (MJ) Facilities 1,008,059.69 Total diesel 25,321,173.35 Total consumed (MJ) 26,990,848.40 e) Water consumption GLOBALVIA has a procedure to ensure that the water consumed in the course of its activities is managed correctly, especially in railway infrastructure. Some of the measures include: • Fostering the rational use of resources • Preventative maintenance of machinery • Inspections of facilities to prevent losses from dripping, overflow, etc. • Promotion of the use of non-potable recycled water for cleaning or maintenance activities • Actions to reuse rainwater In 2019 78.3% of the water consumed was in the highway’s activity (11 companies), 21.1% in railways (2 companies), and 0.6% in offices (Chile branch). Water consumption 2018 2019 Liters Percentage Liters Percentage Highways 29,581,548 75.5% 33,273,342 78.3% Railways 9,275,333 23.7% 8,953,820 21.1% Offices 313,000 0.8% 267,500 0.6% Total 39,169,882 100% 42,494,662 100% 104 Water consumed by source 2019 Liters Potable water 25,014,130 Groundwater resources 17,171,832 River water 308,700 Total 42,494,662 f) Spill management Although this is not a material issue in the activities of the Organization, GLOBALVIA has identified the following types of potential spills in its activities and facilities: • Spills from the facilities restrooms • Spills from washing vehicles and machinery • Spills in the infrastructure construction phase When managing spills, the Organization considers those generated by the operation of infrastructure (indirect). As these cannot be controlled, GLOBALVIA carries out environmental studies and impact statements, surveillance plans and other activities included in the environmental documentation of each stage of a project at any given time. 2.3.3. Emissions and climate change a) Carbon emissions management Since 2015 GLOBALVIA has calculated the Group's carbon footprint following the GHG Protocol methodology. The emission sources considered are scope 1 (direct emissions) and scope 2 (indirect emissions). Scope 3 emissions were estimated for the first time in 2019, including all the categories contemplated by the GHG Protocol, except those not applicable to GLOBALVIA’s activities. GLOBALVIA’s carbon footprint is calculated for 2019 using the operational control approach and includes 15 companies. 105 GHG emission sources GHG emissions 2018 2019 % variation SCOPE 1 Direct (tCO2 eq) 2,111 2,139 1.3% SCOPE 2 Indirect from energy (tCO2 eq) 4,380 4,352 (0.6%) SCOPE 3 Other indirect emissions (tCO2 eq) 1,588,003 TOTAL Scope 1 + 2 (tCO2 eq) 6,491 6,491 0.00% Scope 1 + 2 + 3 (tCO2 eq) 1,594,494 Scope 1 + 2 emissions (tCO2eq) 7000 6000 5000 Scope 1 4000 Scope 2 3000 2000 1000 0 2017 2018 2019 106 Considering scopes 1 + 2, the main source of emissions is electricity consumption, representing 67% of the total, followed by fuel consumption by the vehicle fleet, accounting for 26.9%. Scope 1+2 emissions by source 1.2% 0.7% Fixed facilities Generators 26.9% Vehicle fleet Fluorinated gases 4.1% 67% Electricity Scope 3 emissions by source 97.3% 2.7% 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Infraestructure use Other categories: Goods and services acquired, business trips, etc. Based on GLOBALVIA’s carbon footprint results, the Organization has proposed the following actions: • Prioritize the reduction of electricity consumption by eliminating unnecessary energy use and installing energy-efficient technology. • Endeavor to use electricity from renewable sources. • Establish medium and long-term emission reduction targets (more than five years ahead) that are sustainable over time. b) Other pollutant emissions In 2019 there were other emissions derived from GLOBALVIA's own vehicles. However, NOx and SO2 emissions were cut by over 1% and 3%, respectively, year on year. Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) 2018 2019 2018-2019 variation NOx (kg) 9,108.48 8,994.47 (1.3%) SO2 (kg) 3.89 3.77 (3.1%) 107 c) Noise management In its environmental management, GLOBALVIA takes into account direct noise generated by the infrastructure operation in the operating phase, as well as noise during the construction phase. Noise management measures taken: • Proper maintenance of equipment, vehicles and machinery. • Planning of activities to minimize the use of machinery at certain times of the day. • If necessary, use of absorbent materials to isolate machinery that generates high levels of vibration. 2.3.4. Protection and conservation of biodiversity GLOBALVIA's activities and facilities could influence legally protected areas or species. Furthermore, during the construction phase the work installations and the movement of machinery could affect and block public thoroughfares. GLOBALVIA makes sure that the impacts on the environment and public thoroughfares are managed properly by means of the following: a) Construction phase Roads, public thoroughfares, access easements to the area, and adjacent livestock trails should be maintained in perfect conditions of use, avoiding deterioration or blockages that hinder their passage. Work will be carried out and delivered in accordance with the competent authority’s regulations. The regulations of competent bodies in relation to protected areas and species must also be complied with, taking special care for vulnerable areas and breeding or nesting periods, as well as compensatory measures always. The pertinent permits will be requested for activities in protected areas. b) Operating phase The requirements of competent bodies must be complied with in the operating phase and annual operating plans covering such action should be on hand, including surveillance and monitoring of the impacts identified. The pertinent permits will be requested for activities in protected areas. 108 2.4. Economic and social development 2.4.1. Commitment to society a) Management of commitment to society GLOBALVIA is aware of the importance of economic and social development at all levels public, private, nonprofit sector and society-. Consequently, it assumes and applies its commitment to contribute to the development of the environment where it carries out its daily activity. It considers this commitment to be a logical consequence of its long-term relationship with the society with which it interacts. For this reason, social commitment is inherent to GLOBALVIA’s DNA and it has a high level of engagement from all its staff. GLOBALVIA’s strategy in this area was outlined in its Strategic Plan for Corporate Social Responsibility in 2012, which serves as a guide for the Company’s activity within the framework of social commitment. GLOBALVIA's commitment to society focuses on the continuous development of the Company and its activity in all possible social issues and aspects. On this basis, GLOBALVIA has defined an operating model to monitor the advancement of the Company's strategy in this area. GLOBALVIA has the following economic and social development objectives: • Develop the social contribution policy with emphasis on vulnerable groups • Make employees aware of and commit to GLOBALVIA's mission with regards to social responsibility and economic development • Align the social commitment strategy with the Company's objectives and capabilities • Evaluate current social contribution initiatives and consolidate efforts on key objectives By achieving these objectives, the Organization aims to make positive contributions to its stakeholders, who are essential for its business. GLOBALVIA focuses on the strategic use of different resources to give back to society what it has received, to develop practices with a positive impact on the environment and support causes that benefit the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. Thus, GLOBALVIA manages its resources and contributes to economic and social development in different ways. On the one hand, it makes financial contributions to different initiatives and nonprofit entities. While on the other, it becomes actively involved with the local communities in the regions where the Company operates, by promoting social initiatives and carrying out corporate voluntary work. All the Company’s operations have programs involving local communities, impact assessments or development programs. b) Financial contributions More than 100 entities benefited from GLOBALVIA’s financial contributions to organizations, foundations and nonprofit entities in 2019, which were in excess of Euros 400,000. Compared to the previous year, contributions earmarked for donations to foundations, NGOs and nonprofit social entities rose notably in 2019 due to new projects and collaborations that reinforce the Company’s commitment to local communities and underprivileged groups or those at risk of social exclusion. 109 Contributions to organizations, foundations and non-profit entities (euros) 2018 2019 Association fees 239,488.47 154,516.63 Sponsorships 77,881.38 85,367.04 Donations to foundations, NGOs and social entities 120,939.21 133,508.48 Other social actions 75,121.75 60,287.02 TOTAL 513,430.81 433,679.17 Distribution of financial contributions c) Distribution of social contributions Association with organizations GLOBALVIA is an active member of various economic and educational associations in Spain to promote bilateral business relations between the Company and other entities in the infrastructure sector as well as between Spain and the Organization’s target countries.

Javier Pérez Fortea, CEO of GLOBALVIA, is a member of the Advisory Board of Cornell University (USA) • Better Business Bureau (USA) • International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association (IBTTA) (USA) GLOBALVIA has joined the #COMPANIES4SDGs campaign to disseminate the 17 Sustainable Development Goals Since November 2017 GLOBALVIA has taken part in the #COMPANIES4SDGs campaign launched by the Global Compact Spanish Network in collaboration with Voluntariado y Estrategia and IMPACT 2030. It is a global communication, dissemination and awareness campaign to help companies rise to the challenge that all of its employees be familiar with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the importance of achieving them. The campaign promotes collective action through changes to habits and offers volunteer activities focused on the different goals. In September 2019, GLOBALVIA joined the third stage of the campaign, and to judge the success of the two previous stages, it launched a small survey among its employees in which it revisited different aspects that revolve around the SDGs. It contemplated basic questions such as the meaning of SDG or the number of goals announced by the UN in the 2030 Agenda to more complicated questions such as Spain’s ranking with regard to fulfilment of these goals or GLOBALVIA’s level of involvement with this global challenge. The results of this survey were very satisfactory. Sponsorships The Company sponsors events (sector-related and others) that boost the economic and social development of the countries where it operates, focusing on communities in the vicinity of the infrastructures it manages. In 2019, GLOBALVIA sponsored a total of 27 events: • Informative Breakfast Meeting with the Director-General for Traffic (Spain) • European Infrastructure Finance Summit (Spain) • International Conference on Environmental Sustainability (Spain) • Cadena Ser (a radio channel) Meetings Sustainable Mobility (Spain) • European Mobility Week, Seville City Council (Spain) • Canada Business Day (Spain) • Official College of Architects of Seville (Spain) • Noche en Blanco (All night cultural event): sevillasemueve -rumboalfuturo (Seville moves towards the future) Seville (Spain) • Performing Arts Festival Sevilla Fest 2019 (Spain) • XXXVIII Jornadas Andaluzas de Derecho del Trabajo y Relaciones Laborales XXXVIII Andalusian Seminars on Labor Law and Labor Relations (Spain) • Month of Dance Festival (Spain) • V Fun Run of Universidad Pablo de Olavide (Spain) • National stage of the Economic Olympics (Spain) • VII Parla Book Fair (Spain) • Read in the train project in conjunction with Asociación GloboSonda (Spain) 111 • Short Stories Book in conjunction with Asociación GloboSonda (Spain) • IV Festival of Stories in Parla (Spain) • Go around the world (Spain) • Inter-Regional Meeting supporting the Regional Cycling Association of Vila Real (Portugal) • MTB Enduro Murça, including the National Enduro Mountain Bike Cup (Portugal) • 2019 Road Safety Campaign of Cap Magellan Segurança Rodoviária (Portugal) • Cultural Association of Beira Interior Projeto Plante um Músico (Portugal) • IPCB Award of Merit (Portugal) • Collaboration with XIII Music Festival of Beira Interior (Portugal) • “Ola Grande” National Surf Tournament (Costa Rica) • Hispanic Day Celebrations of the Spanish Embassy (Costa Rica) • Latin American Infrastructure Forum (Chile) • InfraAmericas US P3 Forum (Inframation Group) (USA) Sponsorship of the Informative Breakfast Meeting with the Director-General for Traffic (DGT) in Spain GLOBALVIA sponsored the informative breakfast meeting with Pere Navarro, Director-General of Spain’s Department of Traffic. This breakfast was organized by Executive Forum in Madrid (Spain), under the title “From road safety to safe, connected, and clean mobility”. The Company’s European Highways Director & USA Concessionaire was tasked with the official presentation of the event. In her presentation she highlighted Pepe Navarro’s work and commitment to road safety and reducing road accidents in Spain. She also indicated that, considering her position in the Company, she adopts the road safety objectives set by the Department of Traffic as those of the Company, an aspect that is embedded in GLOBALVIA’s culture and intimately linked to all facets of its activity. Sponsorship of the International Conference on Environmental Sustainability (CISM) in Spain GLOBALVIA sponsored the CISM organized in Madrid (Spain) by Cambio16, a Spanish digital daily generalinterest newspaper and magazine. Fernando Vallejo, the Company’s Director of Systems, Innovation and Transformation, made a presentation on “Sustainable Mobility” at the conference. In this presentation he reflected that there is a long road ahead in terms of sustainable mobility at domestic and global level. He set out GLOBALVIA’s vision, emphasizing the importance of coordination of all the ecosystem players, of public-private collaboration, of the need for a defined legal framework and of having a citizen-centric approach. Furthermore, he took advantage to showcase some of GLOBALVIA’s success stories in 2019, such as the implementation of electric charging stations in Chile and Costa Rica or the adaptation of the A23 Beira Interior highway and its tunnels for autonomous vehicles. Donations to Foundations, NGOs and social entities GLOBALVIA donates funds to different entities that are present in the areas where the Company has its operations, to help the financing and improvement of social initiatives. The entities that receive GLOBALVIA’s donations focus on promoting initiatives with objectives such as ending poverty and giving everyone access to drinking water, improving the quality of life and health of the disadvantaged, favoring the inclusion of people with disabilities, promoting road safety and sustainable transport through training, actively supporting local art and culture, conserving historical, artistic and natural heritage and promoting sport and nutrition as habits of a healthy life, among others. 112 In 2019, GLOBALVIA made donations to 38 entities: • Fundación A LA PAR (Spain) • Fundación Las Claves de la Felicidad (Spain) • Cáritas (Spain) • Fundación PRODIS (Spain) • Fundación Real Madrid (FRM) and FRM charity run (Spain, Chile and Costa Rica) • Fundación ADECCO (Spain) • DEBRA Association Butterfly skin (Spain) • Fundación Adelias Casa Cuna Nador (Spain) • Ponle Freno charity run (Spain) • Mental Health Awareness charity run (Spain) • Fundación Manolo Maestre Dávila (Spain) • Cooperación Internacional (Spain) • Fundación Real Dreams-Actays (Spain) • Fundación Son Ángeles (Spain) • Fundación Numen (Spain) • Fundación Voces (Spain) • Asociación adEla Madrid (Spain) • Religiosas de las Escuelas Pías Escolapias (Spain) • Asociación Española de Paraparesia Espástica Familiar Internal CSR project Euro Solidario (Spain) • Fundación Mornese Internal CSR project Euro Solidario (Spain) • Fundación El Gancho Internal CSR project Euro Solidario (Spain) • Banco de Alimentos de Sevilla (Seville Food Bank) Internal CSR project Euro Solidario (Spain) • Fundación Mariscal Project Pepo (Spain) • Andorran Red Cross /Andorra) • Escola Básica do Douro Vila Real (Portugal) • Lar-Escola Florinhas da Neve Santa Casa da Misericórdia (Portugal) • Portuguese Red Cross (Portugal) • Aldeias de Crianças SOS (Portugal) • Operation Red Nose (Portugal) • Acegis – Associaçao para a Cidadania Empreendorismos Género e Inovaçao Social (Portugal) • Fundaçao Rui Osório de Castro Xi-Coração (Portugal) • Centro Social de Mateus IPSS (Portugal) • Conservatório de Música de São José da Guarda (Portugal) • Escola Profissional de Artes da Covilhã (Portugal) • Associação Portuguesa de Pais e Amigos do Cidadão Deficiente Mental (APPACDM) (Portugal) • Academia de Música e Dança do Fundão (Portugal) • Asociación Animal Hope (Costa Rica) • Asociación Rescate Animal (Costa Rica) One such project is called “Contigo, 1=2”. (With you, 1=2) This project makes GLOBALVIA’s professionals the protagonists as they could present proposals from possible collaborators and then vote on their favorite entities and projects that will receive contributions for two years. With the same conditions as Fundación Juegaterapia in 2016 and 2017, Fundación Adelias has been the entity selected for 2018 and 2019. 113 Fundación Adelias Social assistance to people from in disadvantaged environments The collaboration between GLOBALVIA and the Adelias Foundation began in February 2018. On this occasion, the Adelias Foundation was the candidate selected in GLOBALVIA’s strategic project called “Contigo, 1=2 ; for the next two years (2018/2019). This strategic project consists of employees putting forward the names of entities with which to collaborate, voting the best fit with their interests and the Company's CSR pillars and deciding the amount of the donation, with GLOBALVIA then giving an equal amount (1=2). On this occasion, GLOBALVIA's contribution is earmarked for the Casa Cuna project in Nador (Morocco). The Adelias Foundation's mission is social assistance, in Spain and abroad, to the most disadvantaged groups at risk of social exclusion, marginalization or in need, especially families and children living in disadvantaged environments. More specifically, the Adelias Foundation works in Spain and Morocco building hospitals, homes for babies awaiting adoption and schools with the intention of promoting progress and development. In these two years of collaboration, GLOBALVIA and its collaborators donated Euros 17,050 to the Adelias Foundation. This amount has enabled the Adelias Foundation to help 120 abandoned babies, boys and girls with food, clothing, hygiene, medicines, vaccines, medical services, and professionals who care for them 24 hours a day. Other social actions In 2019, GLOBALVIA carried out a significant number of social initiatives in addition to those already mentioned. Below are some examples of these, which reflect the range of needs and aspects that they cover: • Promotion of sustainable transport: o Aula Metro an educational program aimed at schools in Seville to raise awareness of the subway and its benefits, thus promoting sustainable transport (Spain) o Visits to schools in the municipality of Parla to raise awareness of the tram and its benefits, thus promoting sustainable transport (Spain) • Fostering road safety: o Road safety education program on the A23 Beira Interior highway (Portugal) o Training for operators of the tunnel control room on the management of fires on the A23 Beira Interior highway (Portugal) o Workshop on road safety, efficient and sustainable driving for employees on the A23 Beira Interior highway (Portugal) o Road Safety program ““A Segurança Rodoviária também depende de ti!” (“Road safety also depends on you!”) in Transmontana (Portugal) o Driving and Road Safety Education program for Transmontana employees (Portugal) o Road Safety Education Program “Soy Responsable” (I´m responsible”) for students at schools near Route 27 (Costa Rica) o Road Safety campaign broadcast on the radio (Costa Rica) o Road Safety Campaign for students from schools near the Itata Highway (Chile) o Road Safety Campaign “Aprende a Manejarte” (Learn to get around) for students from schools near the Costa Arauco Highway (Chile) o Road Safety Campaign “Movámonos con seguridad” (Let’s move safely) for students from schools near the Santiago Lampa dual carriageway and Aconcagua highway (Chile) 114 • Health and wellbeing: o Employee blood donation campaign in collaboration with the Red Cross (Spain) o Wellbeing program for employees comprising group sports classes, a nutrition plan adapted to each profile and access to a physiotherapy service (Spain and Portugal) o Collaboration with a blood donor center in the autonomous region of Madrid and its bone marrow team “#EQUIPOMÉDULA” to help raise awareness of blood diseases and the bone marrow donation process, as well as signing up possible donors (Spain) o Collaboration with the SEUR Foundation to collect plastic caps under the slogan “Tapones para una nueva vida” (Caps for a new life) (Spain) o Organization of a walk through the Serra da Gardunha (Portugal) o Anti-tobacco awareness session (Portugal) o Blood donation campaign of Route 27 employees in collaboration with the National Blood Bank and the Costa Rican Social Security (Costa Rica) o Sports club of GLOBALVIA and Route 27 to promote interpersonal relationships among work colleagues, as well as healthy habits (Spain and Costa Rica) o Participation in charity runs (Spain and Costa Rica) o “Ola Grande” Surf Tournament (Costa Rica) o Training for trainers of the Real Madrid Foundation • Care for the environment o Environment protection talks in schools near the highway (Costa Rica) o Corporate volunteer session among employees to clean beaches and sow tree seeds (Costa Rica and Chile) • Humanitarian aid and local development o Purchase of charity bottles of water from AUARA.

The school in Chile was created in 2009 and thanks to GLOBALVIA’s contribution it was able to increase activities to include more than 300 boys and girls from dysfunctional families or who live in care homes of the Independencia and Estación Central communities in Santiago de Chile. The main objective is to educate them in different values using sport as a tool. The Costa Rican school was created in 2013 and has increased its activity to include 125 children thanks to GLOBALVIA’s contribution. This school, which is located on the Heredia campus of the Universidad Latina de Costa Rica, educates boys and girls in different values through sport. Good academic performance is a prerequisite for entering the school. In addition to protecting, educating and keeping children away from possible risks of violence or the dangerous and harmful aspects of the environments in which they live, these two initiatives cover the daily health and nutritional needs of the children and their families, while involving and inspiring healthy living habits. GLOBALVIA and the Real Madrid Foundation have decided to extend the collaboration agreement in 2020 for a further three years, given the mutual trust between them, to continue to develop the two schools in Chile and Costa Rica. d) Corporate volunteering Corporate volunteer program In 2019 the Adecco Foundation has collaborated with GLOBALVIA to design its Corporate Volunteer Program for that year, after joining the #ConstruyendoUnFuturo (Building a Future) project aimed at employees of the Adecco Foundation. This project is based on practical training and employment guidance for people with intellectual disabilities in fields for which there is demand in the labor market so as to enhance their options to find employment. As part of this project, Foundation Adecco and GLOBALVIA have designed an ad hoc Corporate Volunteer Program with a two-fold objective: to train people with disabilities as technical personnel for renovation and refurbishment work and contribute to the restoration of actual spaces with specific requirements. The Volunteer Program consisted of three sessions, in which volunteers from GLOBALVIA’s workforce have played a fundamental role in guiding and helping the people from Foundation Adecco in refurbishment tasks. Corporate Charity day GLOBALVIA took part for the first time in the Corporate Charity day, an initiative organized by Cooperación Internacional and Atresmedia in Spain. The group of volunteers from GLOBALVIA worked in an organic winter garden located in Miraflores de la Sierra in the province of Madrid. Road Safety Talks: Costa Rica, Chile and Portugal Since 2012 GLOBALVIA has been giving “Road Safety Talks” at schools in the vicinity of its highways. These talks are led by employees and the aim is to foster responsible habits and behavior among future users, preventing accidents when using the road infrastructure. 116 At the same time, the children are encouraged to play a key role in raising awareness among their close family and friends of responsible road behavior based on self-protection and respect for the environment, thus becoming agents of change. The objective is to generate and strengthen relations with the communities around our concessions, establishing new links and reaffirming the Organization's commitment to the quality of life of the local population. Globalvia has been carrying out this program in Costa Rica, Chile and Portugal for several years. In Costa Rica the program is called “Soy responsable” (I´m responsible) and through games the children learn to be responsible pedestrians, cyclists and passengers. In addition to the training, each child receives a high visibility jacket so they can wear it when they are on the road. The program has gone a step further with the creation of road safety brigades so that children can pass the information on to their schoolmates. A total of 360 children have been included in this program from the outset until 2019. In Chile the program is called “Aprende a manejar tu seguridad” (Learn to handle your safety). This program. which has been carried out since 2016, includes educational activities, interactive and playrelated presentations adapted to the different ages of the students, accompanied by talks given by personnel from CONASET, Chile’s National Road Safety Commission, a government agency. Furthermore, an audio-visual competition is carried out on road safety for university students and technicians from Concepción. GLOBALVIA also carries out this type of social program in Portugal, through the two concessions that the Company manages in that country. This initiative has been carried out since 2005 in respect of the A23 Beira Interior highway and has two modules. The first “Safety Project is aimed at children from 6 to 10 years old, while the second “Teaching the car simulator is designed for 12-18-year old. Both modules use games to convey road safety values in a simple, dynamic and fun way. This year Transmontana has started its Road Safety program “A Segurança Rodoviária também depende de ti!” (“Road safety also depends on you!”). This program consists of a visit to the concessionaire’s facilities with activities, demonstrations and presentations. There is also an outdoor circuit where they can use small cars to go around the route and learn and follow the signs, as well as use the emergency telephones. e) Social and Environmental Management Plan in Autopista Costa Arauco (Chile) At the end of 2017, Autopista Costa Arauco, a GLOBALVIA concession company, assumed control of the road concession for the design, improvement, construction, operation and financing in a real toll agreement. Since then, GLOBALVIA has been involved in a process of rapprochement with local authorities and social organizations, accepting the challenge of reconciling the tensions generated during the construction phase with the expectations of social contribution and the resolution of pending road situations. The Company has therefore designed a Social and Environmental Plan in Autopista Costa Arauco based on the Equator Principles. The Equator Principles are a framework for determining, assessing and managing environmental and social risk for the financing of new projects, as well as the refinancing or significant expansion of existing projects. This Social and Environmental Plan includes in addition to the description of the concession and local perception a plan to monitor environmental measures, a plan of initiatives for the human environment, compensation measures and a specific work plan. 117 2.4.2. Supply chain a) Responsible management for a sustainable supply chain GLOBALVIA is fully aware that its responsibility does not end with responsible management of its employees, because the risks for the Company do not end there either. For this reason, the Organization considers it essential that its sustainability culture and its ethical principles and values be extended to its suppliers’ daily work. The main types of GLOBALVIA suppliers are the following: • Advisory and auditing services at corporate level • Operation and maintenance activities at Group companies In the framework of the Integrated Management System GLOBALVIA has annual reports on System Reviews by management. About the supply chain, these reports identify key suppliers, the quality of the service provided, contract indicators, main incidents with suppliers during the year and their annual reevaluation. GLOBALVIA Group companies identify their key suppliers based on the financial value of the contract, the impact on operations and potential risks for the company, among other factors. In 2019, no relevant incidents were detected regarding suppliers. GLOBALVIA has documented procedures that establish the criteria and responsibilities associated with the control of the purchasing and subcontracting processes, as well as the verification of the products or services purchased. Furthermore, all GLOBALVIA employees who are authorized to make purchases know and apply the Code of Conduct in these activities. Also, GLOBALVIA informs suppliers involved in its business activity about its Integrated Management System Policy and Crime Prevention Policy. Supplier evaluation All suppliers who work for GLOBALVIA are approved in accordance with the Purchasing Management procedure. In other words, approved suppliers are used for all purchases and contracts and the list of suppliers is always up to date. In 2019, the Company updated this procedure, to include, among others, criteria for the approval and evaluation of suppliers regarding their compliance with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Each company in the GLOBALVIA Group evaluates and selects suppliers based on their capacity to provide products and services in accordance with the requirements defined by the Organization. In addition to this continuous monitoring, suppliers are re-evaluated annually. The applicable NonConformity Reports are analyzed, as well as other possible causes of direct disqualification (e. g. legal breach in the provision of the service, failure to comply with the ethical principles established by GLOBALVIA, administrative sanctions associated with carrying out their activity, etc.). 118 Supplier evaluation criteria Suppliers are subject to continuous monitoring and evaluation of the following criteria: • Trust: based on whether there have been possible previous disqualifications in any of the Group companies or cases of violation of human rights. • Capacity: whether the supplier has any voluntary quality certification issued by an accredited entity and whether it has recognized prestige and technical solvency in the sector. • Environmental management: whether the supplier has any voluntary environmental management certification issued by an accredited entity or whether it has implemented best environmental practices. • Occupational health and safety: whether the supplier has any voluntary health and safety certification by an accredited entity or whether it has best health and safety practices in place. • Personal data protection: whether the supplier has good data protection practices in terms of the design and operating effectiveness of its processes. • Level of service: GLOBALVIA’s perception of the quality of the service. Supplier audits GLOBALVIA includes the possibility of auditing the services provided by its suppliers and contractors in contracts considered relevant. Furthermore, internal and external audits are performed within the framework of the Integrated Management System that is certified in accordance with ISO 9001:2015, which includes requirements in respect of purchases and suppliers. b) Environmental practices in the supply chain GLOBALVIA informs its suppliers and subcontractors of the need to carry out certain environmental practices when performing activities or services on its behalf. These practices are related to the management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, spill management, noise generated, the loading and unloading of chemical substances and emissions into the atmosphere. It also proposes best practices to its suppliers in the management of non-hazardous waste, water consumption and electricity consumption. In addition, as part of the supplier approval process, environmental criteria are considered such as ISO 14001 certification, EMAS or best practices, among other criteria. 119 c) Health and safety in the supply chain The Company controls and monitors suppliers’ compliance with labor, health and safety regulations if they have employees at the Group companies’ facilities. These suppliers must be able to provide documentary support of compliance with different aspects in this area. In addition, as mentioned above, there is a supplier approval process that considers occupational health and safety criteria (OHSAS 18001 certifications, best practices, etc.). d) Regulatory compliance of the supply chain For GLOBALVIA it is essential that all its suppliers formally declare their compliance with the applicable legislation in relation to the services provided for the Company and in the following areas: Financial Government Labor Tax regulation contracts Data protection Occupational Environmental and privacy Health and Safety A formal declaration is also required from all suppliers that neither the organization nor any of its employees working for GLOBALVIA have been convicted for or are accused of bribery of Spanish or foreign public officials, laundering of assets and/or financing of terrorism either in Spain or abroad. e) Supplier satisfaction GLOBALVIA carries out annual studies of the level of satisfaction of the suppliers that the Company uses. The suppliers selected for this survey are those that have previously been identified as key suppliers. The Corporation's Global Quality Index (GQI) was 4.66 out of 5, while in the Group companies it was 4.61 out of 5. Therefore, in general, suppliers working for the GLOBALVIA Group have shown an optimum degree of satisfaction. 120 2.5 Quality and innovation 2.5.1 Customer and user-centric approach GLOBALVIA’s external stakeholders include customers (public entities) and users of highways and railways. The Integrated Management System policy expresses the Group’s commitment to managing its entities and companies in a responsible manner and satisfying the needs of customers and users. The guiding principles of this policy put customers and users at the very heart of the business. a) User experience GLOBALVIA focuses its efforts on providing its users with the best infrastructure in terms of quality and safety in order to facilitate the mobility of citizens. To ensure optimal service, GLOBALVIA’s Integrated Management System (IMS) is underpinned by standards such as ISO 9001, ISO 14001, OHSAS 18001 and UNE-EN 13816, which set the Company apart in terms of efficiency and uniformity. The IMS is audited and certified externally by the Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification (AENOR). Moreover, every year the service rendered is analyzed with a view to improving accident and incident rates in the Group’s infrastructures. b) User safety Preserving user safety in the infrastructure it manages is paramount to GLOBALVIA. Its Road Safety procedure establishes general guidelines in this regard. The Company monitors accident rates employing the most commonly used international indicators and has Road Safety Committees in the concession companies, which report the measures implemented and their effectiveness to the Board of Directors. The Company seeks to facilitate mobility in existing infrastructure under good, safe and fluid conditions. To this end, it offers roadside assistance for accidents or incidents, urgently repairs damage, and maintains road safety during unfavorable weather conditions, as covered under another internal procedure called “Winter Road Safety”. Fast-response operational teams are on hand for such activities, which are always high priority for GLOBALVIA. The Company’s road surveillance services also draw up accident reports to facilitate road safety management. The main road safety initiatives and accolades in 2019 were as follows: • Concesiones de Madrid improved and renovated different aspects of its infrastructure, completing phase one of the campaign to renew fixed gantry signs and finalizing the final phase of installing road studs, reflective devices to alert, guide and inform users (Spain) • Tranvía de Parla performed its first ever fire drill with a user rescue simulation (Spain) • A23 Beira Interior installed an Automatic Incident Detection system comprising fixed and mobile surveillance cameras to detect incidents in the Garduhna and Alpedrinha tunnels (Portugal) • A23 Beira Interior carried out an accident simulation in the Garduhna tunnel (Portugal) • Pocahontas Parkway implemented GMOM, an application to improve coordination and response times for roadway incidents (United States) • Ruta 27 received the Gold Prize for road safety Costa Rica) 121 Details of the highway hazard and railway service incident rates in 2018 and 2019 are shown below. Highway Hazard Rates1 2018 2019 A23 Beira Interior 7.88 8.3 Autopista Central Gallega 2.15 0.7 Auto-Estradas XXI 7.83 6.9 Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista Costa Arauco 38.78 41.72 Concesiones de Madrid 5.33 3.1 Pocahontas Parkway 0.00 0.0 Ruta 27 11.45 15.23 Ruta de los Pantanos 9.46 6.9 Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista del Aconcagua 19.10 19.08 Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista del Itata 31.55 31.92 Túnel d’Envalira 0.00 0.0 1. Number of accidents with victims in the last 12 months * 10^8 / road length (km) * 365 * ADT (weighted last 12 months) 2. These concessions have been affected by public order events, which significantly reduced traffic in the last quarter of 2019. This is reflected in a higher rate but a similar number of accidents. 3. Although the number of accidents is similar, the rate is higher than in 2018 due to the fall in traffic. In 2019 there was a notable drop in the number of fatalities on GLOBALVIA’s highways, down 17% on 2018, particularly in Latin America. Incidents in railway services1 2018 2019 Metro de Sevilla 24.5 21.5 Tranvía de Parla 19.9 32.52 1. Number of incidents (last 12 months) * 10^5 / km of production (last 12 months) 2. In the last quarter of 2019, there were strikes on various days (lowering production) and a rise in vandalism. Both factors caused an increase in the rate, which until then had shown similar levels to 2018. Road safety indicator associated with the sustainable financing of Ruta de los Pantanos As defined in section 1.2.4, in relation to the sustainability-linked loan extended to Ruta de los Pantanos, the indicator employed by GLOBALVIA is to not exceed 97% of the average baseline KPI for road safety over four years. For 2019 the agreed baseline indicator takes the weighted average number of accidents with victims per vehicle-km between 2016 and 2018, calculated as 4.2. In 2019 it was calculated as 4.0, which is 96.1%, meeting the target. 122 c) Customer and user satisfaction GLOBALVIA measures the level of customer and user satisfaction with its activities. The results enable the Group to understand their perception of the service rendered, identify risks and consider improvements. The Company’s Quality Management procedure lays down the criteria, responsibilities and methodology for obtaining this information. The Non-Conformity Management and Customer Service procedures set forth the main lines of action when opening non-conformity or corrective action. The information is recorded in the 2019 Management System Review Report. Details of the average quality scores given by the Company's customers and users for 2018 and 2019 are shown below. Average quality scores1 (1: very low 5: very high) 2018 2019 Highway management2&3 4.22 4.24 Railway management4 4.31 Highway users5 4.23 4.21 Railway users 4.15 4.31 1. These scores are out of 5. 2. No data is available on SCUTVIAS Autoestradas da Beira Interior (A23 Beira Interior) for 2018 or 2019. 3. No data is available on Pocahontas Parkway for 2018. 4. No data is available on railway management for 2018 or Metro de Sevilla for 2019. 5. No data is available on Pocahontas Parkway for 2018. Surveys and monitoring meetings also show the positive satisfaction of authorities in 2019. Furthermore, for railways the process is outsourced and focuses on the passenger transport sector, including mystery customer campaigns (an observation technique whereby an anonymous passenger evaluates the services offered through unannounced visits). d) Customer and user service GLOBALVIA's concessions manage communication with users independently. GLOBALVIA Corporation acts as a channel for user messages received through the Company's generic account. The Department of Corporate Communications reviews the messages and forwards them to the concession’s counterpart or, in their absence, the asset manager. Each concession company has communication mechanisms in place (websites, telephone numbers, social media and customer service offices). In 2019 the Metro de Sevilla concession company added WhatsApp and bot (Telmo) consultation mechanisms to facilitate and expedite the resolution of user queries. GLOBALVIA’s Non-Conformity Management and Customer Service procedures set forth the lines of action for complaints. An internal analysis is performed annually and documented in the respective Management Review Reports drawn up in each company. e) Complaints or requests received The number of complaints related to access of people with reduced mobility per 1,000 railway users in 2019 was zero. No complaints regarding violations of customer privacy or data leaks were logged in 2019. 123 Complaints per million highway users 2019 Overall average 77.2 A23 Beira Interior 270.73 Autopista Central Gallega 109.59 Auto-Estradas XXI 26.18 Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista Costa Arauco 74.05 Concesiones de Madrid 0.00 Pocahontas Parkway 0.51 Ruta 27 8.98 Ruta de los Pantanos 0.00 Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista del Aconcagua 274.55 Sociedad Concesionaria Autopista del Itata 27.61 Túnel d’Envalira 0.00 Calculation formula: number of complaints per million users / annual traffic Complaints in respect of the Portuguese company A23 Beira Interior primarily stem from toll collection, be it the amount collected or the identification of the vehicle type. To reduce these complaints, the company has commissioned an external entity to implement periodic maintenance and verification routines in the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system. As regards Autopista del Aconcagua (Chile), the number of complaints is attributable to the entry into service of the urban section and disputed charges billed to users with electronic payment devices (TAG). Actions taken to reduce this rate include campaigns to inform users of payment agreements, debt management and digital payments, among others. Some complaints about Autopista Central Gallega (Spain) are because it is not possible to make contactless card payments. The system is being upgraded to incorporate this payment method and resolve this issue. Complaints per 100,000 railway passengers 2019 Overall average 9.5 Metro de Sevilla 8.98 Tranvía de Parla 11.05 Calculation formula: number of complaints per 105 passengers / total annual passengers Railway passenger complaints primarily relate to the functioning of ticket machines. All complaints received are duly managed and answered by the Customer Service Office of each company following internal Organization procedures. 124 f) Initiatives to improve the service Main initiatives in 2019 to improve the service Installation of safety Increased signage in specific areas, installation of items to help measures respect speed limits.

GLOBALVIA sees innovation as a business component through which it can spearhead change and as an engine to transform society. a) Innovation management GLOBALVIA has nine principles of innovation which govern the Company’s action in this area. In order to meet its innovation objectives, GLOBALVIA has an internal innovation management procedure which lays down a series of measures to ensure proper management of innovation. Innovation management measures 126 b) INNGLOVATION: innovation in GLOBALVIA In 2019 GLOBALVIA developed INNGLOVATION with the aim of fostering the creation and implementation of disruptive mobility services through digital infrastructure in collaborative ecosystems, concentrating on three regions: Spain, Portugal and Chile. With this initiative the Company seeks to better understand its users in order to offer digital solutions that improve user experience of the infrastructure, promote mobility in the area, and further its position in the sector as a digital leader. In 2019 GLOBALVIA looked at user experience in the new digital era. As a result, it has identified and rolled out different lines of action with new services geared towards enhancing user mobility and alternative channels of interaction. The Company is also testing new payment services and loyalty programs with users that will soon be available. GLOBALVIA banks on an open innovation model being a facilitator for society, the business and employees. This model aims to foster the identification and definition of ideas, products and services that provide new approaches, new business models and a differentiating value for infrastructures and society. In 2019 the Company continued to develop this innovation strategy, expanding its collaborations in several domains. One example is its agreement with the Railway Innovation Hub, through which GLOBALVIA intends to become an international leader in technology transfer in order to improve its services. Through this agreement collaborative innovation projects will be developed, and the Company will send tech challenges to the hub in search of solutions. Cluster companies can also validate and implement emerging sector innovation in their infrastructure. The Company has developed its Innovation Plan for the coming three years (2019-2021). This plan comprises five strategic lines and five levers to drive the different innovation projects. 2019-2021 Innovation Plan 5 strategic innovation lines 5 levers to accomplish the mission 1.

Although many initiatives and projects are being undertaken in GLOBALVIA, the following projects focused on improving services and expediting internal processes are of note. Projects focused on improving the services rendered Through its alliance with Pedregal, Ruta 27 performed the first test in Asphalt surfacing with the world of this method on a road. The initiative consists of converting recycled polymers the plastic waste collected on the route into a fine aggregate (eco sand) (Costa Rica) for asphalt mixtures. Installation of electric charging stations in service areas of the Route 5 Installation of electric (Chile) concession in collaboration with Enel X Chile, in Ruta 27 (Costa vehicle charging stations Rica) and A23 Beira Interior (Portugal), fostering the use of electric (Chile, Costa Rica and vehicles as they cannot be used without the necessary electrical Portugal) infrastructure to provide energy. Connected and GLOBALVIA has adapted the A23 Beira Interior highway and tunnels for autonomous vehicle connected and, in the future, autonomous vehicles. Work is also solutions underway on these solutions in Portugal with a European consortium. (Portugal) GLOBALVIA is testing different chatbot technologies which could help Virtual assistants – users to report their travel, among other key services. Metro de Sevilla Chatbots has already launched Telmo, an artificial intelligence-powered IT (Spain) application which answers customer queries. Projects focused on expediting internal processes Innovative technology (smart sensors, IoT platform and advanced Monitoring of critical assets analytics) is used to monitor the energy backup systems or (Global) embankments, thus permitting early warnings to be generated. Pioneering implementation A private SAP cloud has been implemented for all Group companies, of S4 HANA Cloud thereby integrating financial business processes and providing (Global) flexibility in the BW reporting and information analysis. Digital business cards GLOBALVIA provides all personnel with digital business cards and the (Global) ability to scan cards they receive via the Knowee app. 128 Launch of OpenVia GLOBALVIA, as an infrastructure operator, forms part of the mobility ecosystem affected by new disruptive forces which are transforming how people and things are transported in the future. The new mobility mix will have an impact on transport operators and present new opportunities, mostly based on the use of data. This is why GLOBALVIA launched OpenVia (https://openvia.io), a collaborative and open space to create mobility of the future. Its specific objectives are to: • Foster development of intrapreneurship and innovative projects created by GLOBALVIA personnel. • Collaborate with start-ups and other sector players in the innovation of mobility solutions, particularly in the digital realm. Digitalization of infrastructure – Smart 45 (Concesiones de Madrid) GLOBALVIA and Concesiones de Madrid officially launched the Smart45 project with the initial installation of 40 smart sensors to detect and classify vehicles, and gather data on their journeys, which is received in real time by the concession company control center. This will enable GLOBALVIA to improve efficiency and be a pioneer in real-time traffic management. Moreover, from a safety perspective, the Concesiones de Madrid control center can make faster decisions in the event of an accident. The sensors change color in critical situations, warning the drivers on the road. In the future it is expected that this technology will allow users to be connected to the infrastructure via an app. In developing this project, GLOBALVIA collaborated with Valerann, an Israeli start-up specializing in IoT and data analytics, which works on tech-based smart transport. The Smart Roads System was recently chosen by the Consumer Technology Association (CES) as “Best product 2020”; this is the first time it has been tested in Spain under real conditions. In the final phase of the project, expected to last two years, GLOBALVIA will collaborate with a Spanish research center to test autonomous vehicles. The objective of this collaboration is twofold: detect weaknesses in autonomous driving not connected to the infrastructure; and measure the extent to which roads can support this technological leap, while testing vehicle-infrastructure communication and analyzing how to improve the driving. 129 2.5.3 Information security and cybersecurity Protecting information and cybersecurity is very important to GLOBALVIA, which understands its growing significance in infrastructure management. a) Principles of information security and cybersecurity GLOBALVIA has defined four general principles for information system security, which have been adopted in the Group companies and govern all activities. General principles of information system security b) Information security management system A significant challenge GLOBALVIA faces is applying a consistent regulatory framework that addresses the business challenges, centralizes policies, processes and procedures, while considering different local legislation. In this context, ISO 27001, the international standard on information security management, provides the most suitable management framework. This standard not only covers the implementation of security mechanisms, but also the management of security. GLOBALVIA has thus developed an Information Security Management System based on this standard, which is coordinated by a Security Committee. Accordingly, GLOBALVIA has an Information Security manual which lays down the Company's security protocols to prevent, detect and respond to information security incidents. This manual demonstrates the Company’s commitment to achieving the necessary level of information security. Likewise, it has a Data Protection manual which safeguards the confidentiality of information and sets forth the lines of action for protecting personal data. In 2019 the Company also developed an Information Security policy which defines the general principles to follow throughout the Organization to properly manage information security. c) Cybersecurity and risks model GLOBALVIA has a mature cybersecurity management framework which is in line with its business needs. Improving the capacity to defend against and recover from potential incidents, ensuring business continuity for all concessions, is a prime objective for the Organization's management. To this end, an important prerequisite has been established: standardize tools, processes and services in the concessions without losing the local approach. 130 To tackle the challenge, GLOBALVIA has opted for a managed security model permitting it to maintain control over strategies, while benefitting from lower risks and operating costs. In this context, the company Ingenia is responsible for management and operation, and helps GLOBALVIA to define cybersecurity strategies that provide value to its business. The managed security model encompasses different projects, one per company, and covers various services: • Control diagnostics: performed at the start of each project and comprising full audits of security, systems and communications. Diagnostics provide information on the degree of maturity of each concession company and enable an action plan to be devised and implemented over the following months. • SOC services: the backbone of security management, the SOC provides GLOBALVIA with a response center for security incidents available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The SOC will carry out all activities geared towards ensuring security in all infrastructures and services, including actions aimed at preventing, detecting and responding to incidents. • Raising awareness: the training of users, middle management and directors has been combined very efficiently with other initiatives such as social engineering exercises and ongoing awareness campaigns that help users to understand the risks they are exposed to on a daily basis. • Unified operation: there is a set of tools designed to improve and preserve the security of infrastructures and systems, both endpoint and cloud-based. These tools are managed and operated centrally by Ingenia, which ensures consistent configurations and levels of implementation in the different concessions. All the projects are managed centrally, which gives GLOBALVIA an overview of the Group’s security status. 131 III. REPORT PREPARATION PROCESS GLOBALVIA has prepared its second Sustainability Report Consolidated Non-Financial Information Statement, in this case for 2019. This report furthers the commitment to transparency and sustainability, which has been reflected in its annual UN Global Compact Progress Reports since 2013.

In other words, the Company starts from the issues identified and prioritized in prior years, adding new inputs and updating those included in prior years, so that its assessment is richer in information and more robust. The assessment of materiality performed periodically by GLOBALVIA consists of the identification of possible relevant issues for the Company and its stakeholders, the prioritization of these based on their relevance and validation of the result by the Company’s Sustainability Committee. Annual cycle of analysis of relevant issues Validation Identifiof relevant cation of issues issues Prioritisation of issues 132 In this last year, a new addition was made to these procedures, namely an analysis of the current status of the environmental, social and governance (ESG) context in the main countries where GLOBALVIA has a presence (Spain, Chile, Costa Rica, United States, Ireland, Mexico and Portugal). For this purpose, at country level 67 specific indicators were identified, from 15 different sources, related to each of the issues identified as possibly material for GLOBALVIA. 3.1.1. Sources consulted as part of the assessment of materiality The identification of the possible relevant issues for GLOBALVIA is based on the indicators required by Law 11/2018 on non-financial information and the assessment of materiality performed in the prior year.

EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD Due to the evolution of COVID-19 that has led to the current pandemic situation (as it has been officially declared by the WHO), GLOBALVIA has activated the measures defined in the Group's Business Continuity Plan related to the potential unavailability of people and key suppliers. These measures are oriented by a Crisis Committee and include the following areas: • Regarding employees, it is recommended to work remotely whenever possible, postponing travels and face-to-face meetings. Likewise, the Group Companies' personnel are always constantly being monitored to take the appropriate measures. • Regarding the relationship with the suppliers, the critical ones will be identified, and communication mechanisms will be established with them to ensure their activity and/or find an alternative if necessary. GLOBALVIA considers that this set of measures adopted -both by the Authorities and by the Group itselfwill avoid a significant impact on people and the environment, however the impact of the pandemic will be monitored as the current uncertainty on its evolution, geographic affectation and extension evolves. 153 At their meeting on 25 March 2020, the Board of Directors of Globalvia Infraestructuras authorized for issue the Sustainability Report Consolidated Non-Financial Statement for 2019 of Global Vía Infraestructuras S.A, which is contained in this document and forms part of the Directors' report of Global Vía Infraestructuras S.A.
