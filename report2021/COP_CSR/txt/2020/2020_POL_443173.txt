As our commitment to sustainable development was growing, we began to look into the next step in making clothes: production. This was particularly important in the case of denim, whose environmental impact is the largest when manufacturing the end-product. That is why, all our clothes are produced in factories that meet our Eco Aware Production standard. They are required to prove that they conserve water and energy, and have reduced their use of chemicals. In 2019 we made ﬁrst attempts to tackle this difficult issue.
