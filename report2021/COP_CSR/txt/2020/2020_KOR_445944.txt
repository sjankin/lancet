Wearing a mask is the most significant action in terms of disease prevention. But in the initial stage of COVID-19, we were in short supply of masks. So, KOLON Industries converted the facility for MB filter for medical use into MB filter for masks, and then donated a total of 2 millions of masks for free of charge. Furthermore, we provided our employees with Onnuri gift certificates worth KRW 1 billion as gifts for the founding anniversary as part of efforts to revitalize the local economy. On top of that, our employees also voluntarily donated to deliver gift certificates worth KRW 120 million to local communities. In recognition of these efforts, President Moon Jae-in visited our plant in Gumi on April 1, 2020 and extended his gratitude for our solidarity and cooperation to rise to the challenge. Protection of the environment of our planet, especially the response to climate change, is an overarching duty and value to corporations. Companies which pollute the environment or do nothing to curb the emission of greenhouse gases have nowhere to go now. KOLON Industries has been involved in Responsive Care (RC), an international social responsible program in the chemical industry since 1999 in recognition of the gravity of the environment. With an aim of breaking the perception that the chemical industry is dangerous, we started RC activities. Through the RC activities, we have prevented any possible safety accidents and secured the health and safety of local residents as well as our employees. By doing so, our voluntary engagement in RC activities plays a huge role in terms of restoring trust and seeking for sustainable development. KOLON Industries is also well cognizant that climate change will pose the biggest threat to the survival of humankind in the long term, and the action is required to be taken immediately to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this regard, KOLON Industries is doing very well, having reduced our GHG emissions in 2019 by 5% or about 30,000 tons compared to the previous year. Constant innovation in technology is essential for corporations to sustainably evolve. The COVID-19 has accelerated the paradigm shift in the industry and economy, which requires corporations to spur innovation. For the past 3 years, KOLON Industries has made every effort to secure future competiveness under the banner of change and innovation. To take the lead in the hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle market, we have CEO MESSAGE developed diverse state-of-the-art materials including Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM), Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA), humidity Dear respected stakeholders, control device (membrane humidifier), aramid fiber which has been in the limelight as a material for the fifth generation optical fiber cables, and Colorless Polyimide (CPI), a core material for foldable or rollable phones. We have also put our focus on the traditional material business such as tire cord, petroleum resin, film or electronic materials. Going forward, KOLON Industries will never stop various forms of innovation so that we can live up to the expectation of our customers.
