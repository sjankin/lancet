Sustainability Report 2019 GRI REPORT Contents CEO Message 1 Cermaq Indicators 5 GRI General Disclosures 32 GRI Economic Indicators 39 GRI Environmental Indicators 46 GRI Social Indicators 61 CEO Message Sustainability is in our nature We must change our diet towards plant-based food and sea food to meet the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C. To do this we must produce more food in the ocean. This shift follows the clear recommendations from the High-Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy and from the EAT-Lancet report, and widely recognized as needed to meet the Sustainable Development Goals. More than 25% of the world’s carbon emissions come from food production. We are proud to report that farmed salmon has one of the lowest carbon-footprints of any farmed protein. Even so, we constantly seek ways to improve our sustainability and lower our carbon footprint in all parts of our operations. Producing seafood is just one part of the global solution, and we know that farmed salmon alone will not feed the world but replacing some of the red meat in our diets with salmon is positive both for the planet and for human health. Knowledge and technology from salmon farming can also be valuable for production of other seafood in other regions. Growing awareness of the impact of the food we eat is essential to planet health and to human health. At Cermaq, we work in partnership with others in our value chain to find sustainable and innovative solutions. All stakeholders who use the ocean must share the goal of preserving and protecting it. As salmon farmers, we are directly impacted by climate changes already taking place in the ocean. Ecosystem integrity and access to marine resources are necessary for us to grow our salmon sustainably, and for our industry to continue providing the world with healthy seafood. 01 We have identified the five following Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where we believe we can truly make a difference, our approach is explained on www.Cermaq.com: • SDG 2 Zero Hunger • SDG 8 Decent work and economic growth • SDG 12 Responsible consumption and production • SDG 13 Climate action • SDG 14 Life below water In the following pages, you will find more details about our commitment to sustainability and our overall performance and operations. In the end, it is all about sustainability and how we together can support the internationally shared goals to cap the rising global temperature at 1.5°C, slow climate change and feed a growing global population with nutritious, healthy and sustainable food. Our complete Report on Sustainability meets the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) requirements for a core report and has been assured by our external auditors.

To monitor fish mortality, 12 months rolling rate was introduced in 2012. The rate measures number of fish mortalities for the last 12 months as a proportion of an estimated number of fish in the sea the last month. The benefit of a 12-month rolling rate is that long term trends are better represented. The indicator is a precise measure and a better steering wheel for management. Reduction of fish mortality is a key target in Cermaq and fish mortality is defined as a Key Performance Indicator. This means that it is followed up closely and reported monthly to the Central Management team and the Board of Directors. The 12 months rolling fish mortality for Atlantic salmon was 8.0 percent at the end of December 2019 for Cermaq Group, compared with 5.5 percent in 2018. Cermaq Chile had an increase of mortalities compared with 2018. Mortalities increased from 4.1 percent in 2018 to 4.5 percent this year. Cermaq Norway had increased mortalities of 9.1 percent this year compared to 6.1 percent in 2018 mainly due to an algal bloom incident in spring 2019. Cermaq Canada’s mortality rate was 12.0 percent, an increase from 6.6 percent in 2018. The increase in mortalities in Canada was largely due to more challenging biological conditions compared to 2018.

At year-end 2018, the 12-month rolling mortality rate for Rainbow Trout increased from 1.3 percent in 2018 to 5.5 percent this year. The rolling mortality rate for Coho increased to 5.4 percent (from 2.8 percent in 2018).

Each country has their own set of rules, including the type of disease to be culled and the time schedule to reduce the possibilities of transmission to other farms and companies. Also, when needed, Cermaq’s Fish Health team can propose culling events in order to maintain the general sanitary condition of an area. During 2019, 12 sanitary cullings were reported in Cermaq Chile, where the fish were removed and transported to final disposal complying with all local regulations. Cermaq Canada had one culling in November 2019 after recommendation by a veterinarian. Cermaq Norway reported one culling in December 2019 after recommendation by a veterinarian. 07 The stocking density is compliant with national regulations, which are for Atlantic salmon 25 kg/m3 in Norway and 17 kg/m3 in Chile. Canada does not have a regulatory limit, however Cermaq Canada’s normal stocking density is 20 kg/m3. CEQ 2 SEA LICE Controlling sea lice levels is a high priority in all regions where Cermaq operates because high levels of sea lice negatively impact the immune systems of the fish and directly affects fish health and welfare. Also, the skin of salmon can be damaged by sea lice and the skin is one of the most important barriers against other diseases. It is additionally a priority to keep lice levels low to ensure they do not negatively impact wild salmon stocks. Lice occur naturally in the marine environment. There are two species of lice that affect farmed salmon: Caligus sp. and Lepeophtheirus salmonis. Infestation by either lice species may result in stress and reduced immune competence, making the fish more susceptible to other diseases and health challenges. Therefore, effective lice management is a very important measure in fish health work, and is a pre-requisite for sustainable aquaculture. The best sea lice management is preventive, reducing the parasitic levels in normal farming practices without handling the fish. Preventive measures are less stressful for the fish and do not involve chemical use. Non-medical treatments including lice skirts, cleaner fish, freshwater treatments, and thermal treatments were used in 2019. Chemical treatments include bath and in-feed treatment. Cermaq works continuously to enhance our sea lice management in all regions, with a focus on preventive measures. Local Action Levels (Mean number of lice per fish) In 2019, average sea lice counts were controlled below the local action levels in Cermaq Norway and Cermaq Chile. The local action levels in 2019 are provided in the table below.

There were lower counts in Q1 2019 compared to Q1 in 2018 (0.80 vs 0.97 lice per fish), with higher counts continuing from April onwards during Chile’s autumn of 1.13 lice per fish versus 1.00 lice per fish in April-June 2018. The average counts then decreased to 0.93 lice per fish, in the period July-September 2019, versus 0.97 lice per fish in the same period in 2018, while sea lice counts in OctoberDecember 2019 fell to the lowest level in the year, 0.67 lice per fish, versus 0.97 lice per fish during the same period in 2018. 09 Average Sea Lice Counts Chile Coho salmon COS Caligus Rogercresseyi Avg number of adult female lice 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 Average Sea Lice Counts Chile Rainbow Trout RBT Caligus Rogercresseyi Avg number of adult female lice 1.00 0.90 0.80 0.70 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.20 0.10 0.00 10 Coho salmon had an average of zero adult female salmon lice during all months of 2019. The average adult female lice count for rainbow trout in all months of 2019 was 0 lice per fish as in 2018. Sea lice counts Cermaq Norway In Norway, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) has introduced ranking of regions according to a traffic light system. The system is based on the average period of time where the sites in the region have had levels above the maximum allowed level of 0.5 adult female lice. Cermaq Norway’s operations are located in regions of Norway ranked as green traffic-lights. Cermaq Norway’s yearly sea lice counts were low, with 0.08 lice per fish in 2019, versus 0.06 lice per fish in 2018, both of which counts are well below regulatory limits. Cermaq Norway continues to use preventive sea lice measures such as sea lice skirts and cleaner fish whenever possible and will have a new mechanical de-licing system in place in 2020.

In 2018, all operations fully respected the fallowing requirements defined in regulations. 12 Fallowing and benthos assessment are necessary to make sure that fish feces and feed pellets won’t build up below or around farm pens, to monitor sea floor status and avoid any longer term or irreversible impacts. We monitor our fish feeding every day with underwater cameras to reduce spill of fish feed and reduce negative impacts of nutrient release, such as Nitrogen and Phosphorus. Also dissolved oxygen is measured on a daily basis at farm level to monitor the environmental condition needed to keep good health and welfare of our fish. Fallow time is measured per week, from the last fish has been harvested and the first fish stocked in the next cycle. Fallow time corresponds with local regulations in Chile and Norway. There is no regulatory limit in Canada, but best management practice is used.

If a deviation is detected, Cermaq reports the non-compliances with environmental regulations under indicator 307-1. In the last years Cermaq has performed trials of alternative fish nets that do not require copper-based antifouling paint. Cermaq Canada has had successful evaluations of Kgrid nets, Chile had EcoNets on 31 farming sites in 2019 and currently Norway continues to transition to using nets made of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene plastic. The main goals include reducing our impact on the environment, reducing handling of net exchange and preventing predator attacks through stronger net alternatives. 13 CEQ 4 MEDICINE USE Cermaq is working systematically with preventive health measures in all countries of operation. Key elements include screening programs for monitoring relevant pathogens from broodstock until harvest size fish, systematic use of vaccines, feeding with functional feeds, monitoring of water quality, mapping stress in our farmed salmon, and a restrictive use of antibiotics. The tools developed over several years and the generation of knowledge has allowed for better forecasting of disease events, lower risk of disease outbreaks, and secure fish health and welfare. Despite preventive measures, sometimes treatment with medicine is necessary, and there are strict procedures in place for the use of medicine such as antibiotics and sea lice treatments. These chemical treatments are used strategically and only when strictly needed to avoid also the generation of resistance. Antibiotics use In Cermaq it is important that antibiotic treatments are held to a minimum, only when strictly needed to restore fish health and welfare. Our policy for the use of antibiotics is to limit the use to cases where: • Animal welfare is threatened by a bacterial disease • A diagnosis of disease exists with a prescription of antibiotic by an authorized person • The antibiotic has a proven therapeutic effect against the disease, and • The antibiotic is approved for use in fish farming Our calculation of antibiotics use is a ratio between the amount of active ingredients used by tons of live weight of fish produced. This ratio is hence affected by seasonal variations and unpredicted mortality events such as algae bloom mortalities. 14 CEQ 4 Antibiotic used Grams Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) per ton live weight (LWE) produced 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 Cermaq Chile Cermaq Canada Cermaq Norway Cermaq Group 2017 2018 2019 In Cermaq Chile, the use of antibiotics per ton production decreased by 1.2% in 2019. The slight decrease was largely a result of a decrease in use of antibiotics and production of fish in Chile, both decreased by 12.7%. Most of antibiotics delivered were to combat SRS (Piscirickettsia salmonis) and BKD (bacterial kidney disease). Finding a solution to the SRS challenge remains a key priority for Cermaq’s R&D team and work is underway to find effective vaccines for both diseases. In Cermaq Canada, mouth rot and SRS were the primary cause of antibiotic use in 2019. At the present there are few alternatives to treat fish for these diseases and our global R&D team is focusing their efforts to provide more tools and knowledge to find sustainable solutions. During 2019, mouth rot and SRS treatments to fish newly entered in the sea were the main antibiotics used, while antibiotic use per ton of fish produced decreased 19% during 2019 compared to 2018. Overall numbers for 2019 were: Q1 2019 55 g/ton live weight equivalent vs 38g in Q1 2018, Q2 2019 75g/ton of live weight equivalent vs 66g in Q2 2018, Q3 2019 692g/ton live weight equivalent to combat SRS and mouth rot vs 517g in 2018, and Q4 163g/ton of live weight equivalent to combat SRS, mouth rot and algal blooms vs 583g in 2018. 15 As in previous years, the main reason for any use of antibiotics in our Norwegian operations in 2019 was mouth rot. The use has however been minimal, with the aim to ensure fish health and welfare, with only two farms receiving treatment during the entire year. The Cermaq R&D team are working to develop more optimal solutions to control mouth rot. The steady performance in Cermaq Chile and Norway, together with improved performance in Cermaq Canada and a constant focus on a responsible use of antibiotics, led to an 14% reduction in antibiotics use at a Group level compared to 2018.

In our quarterly sustainability report we provide the amount of active ingredient of antibiotic used by tonnage harvested, at the moment when the sites are fully harvested (closed cycle). This calculation follows the same measure used worldwide in the protein industry to allow for comparison with other protein producers, and hence differs from the calculation presented here (based on LWE produced per calendar year, instead of ton harvested per closed cycle of about 18 months). Sea lice treatment use Sea lice is a challenge for the industry worldwide and each country has specific set of requirements with thresholds which determines the proper management. Cermaq has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all treatments are conducted in accordance with local regulations and area management plans. More details can be found under the indicator Sea lice counts (CEQ2). 16 CEQ 4 Sea lice treatment used in feed Grams Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) per ton live weight (LWE) produced. 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0 Cermaq Chile Cermaq Canada Cermaq Norway Cermaq Group 2017 2018 2019 In Canada, only in-feed sea lice treatment is approved for use and the amount used decreased in 2019. Oral Emamectin is delivered through the fish feed and remains an effective alternative, but research into alternative strategies such as local cleaner fish and physical removal is ongoing. In 2019, Canada also began using a state-of-the-art nonchemical delicing system, which uses water to remove sea lice from fish. The use of in-feed treatments remained low in Cermaq Chile in 2018 due to good environmental conditions. In Norway, use of in feed treatments was lower than in the previous year. In 2019, the amount of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (grams API) per ton live weight (LWE) used for in-feed treatment was 0.04 for Norway, 0 for Chile and 0.23 for Canada. For Norway and Chile, the use decreased by 30% and 100% respectively, compared with 2018.

Cermaq Norway has continued its strong focus on preventive sea lice management in the past year, with measures such as cleaner fish and skirts used. Also, hydrogen peroxide is used, which requires handling of the fish, but where the active ingredients is broken down into water and oxygen and hence has very limited environmental impacts. Increasing sea lice resistance to chemical treatments is a concern for the industry in Norway and for Cermaq Norway it is a goal to strengthen preventive management and non-chemical alternatives further, while maintaining a strong focus on fish health and welfare, including reducing stress on the fish. Cermaq Norway will also be implementing a new water-based delicing system in 2020 to further focus on non-chemical sea lice treatments.

Preventive measures include broodstock and fish screening for viral and bacterial diseases to reduce transmission, using genetically resistant fish by means of natural breeding techniques (QTL), functional feed and the use of vaccines. The vaccines available in Norway, Canada and Chile are related to the particular needs of each country. The vaccines used, are those assessed as effective for the species and for the disease in each specific region. Examples of diseases we vaccinate against are IPN, Vibriosis, ISA, BKD, Furunculosis, SRS, IHN and Enteric Red Mouth Disease. Vaccination is delivered mostly in the hatcheries by injectable vaccines. The objective is to protect the fish for the challenges faced during sea water farming. After the vaccination the smolts will have time to obtain immunity and thereby be protected against disease at the moment of stocking. 19 The fish can also be vaccinated to prevent disease in the freshwater phase or it can receive a booster. The goal of boosters is to increase the first immune response or the first defenses gained by the very first vaccination, allowing for a faster and stronger response against the disease. Cermaq’s global R&D team has a particular focus on developing effective solutions for SRS and mouth rot/ Tenacibaculum. In Chile, a considerable amount of R&D resources has been used to test both experimental and commercial vaccines for SRS and BKD. The extensive testing of SRS vaccines has provided Cermaq with an optimal vaccination regime for our production. A BKD vaccine is in its late stage of testing in region XII.

CEQ 6 AREA MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS Area based management agreements are of great importance for effective and preventive fish management. Area Management Agreements can be a voluntary measure, such as a best management practice, or it can be a national wide requirement, formalized under a written area management agreement between stakeholders in a defined area. 20 Regardless of the origin of these agreements, the agreements are tailored to the local situation and, typically, may include topics such as fallowing and sea lice management strategies, vaccination programs, containment and contingency plans, recapture management plans and disease control strategies in farmed and wild fisheries. In 2019, all Cermaq sites operated under area-based management agreements or were located in areas fully controlled by Cermaq. CEQ 7 ESCAPES Cermaq has comprehensive procedures for preventing and managing fish escapes. Fish escapes are regarded as serious incidents which receive special attention from Cermaq management and the Board of Directors. Fish escapes may typically occur if nets are damaged, because of weather conditions, after handling of the nets for bath treatments, or as a consequence of predator attacks. An early detection of a fish escape allows to recover the salmon and reduce the impact of the escape event. Measures include fish escape prevention plans in all regions, contingency plans, and monitoring activities. In Cermaq Chile, monitoring is in place for the entire network installation by use of remotely operated vehicle (ROV), to assess the status of nets and detect any holes to prevent escapes. Other measures include regular inspections of infrastructure, reporting to learn from previous escapes, implementation of and training in procedures securing the facility in case of escapes, and recapture of escaped fish. In Norway, Cermaq has an emergency cooperation with farmers in the county of Finnmark in case of an escape. Inspections are performed by the authorities in all regions with regards to escape prevention. Cermaq Canada is currently testing multiple types of nets, including polyester, high-density polyethylene, and KGrid netting, Cermaq Chile has tested and used rigid plastic monofilament Econets for farming and currently Norway is using nets made of plastic (Dyneema Polyethelyne). These stronger nets prevent larger interaction with predators, ruptures, and possible fish escapes. They also do not use copper-based paint to reduce negative impacts on the environment. 21 Number of escaped fish by region YEAR CERMAQ CERMAQ CERMAQ CHILE GRAND TOTAL CANADA NORWAY 2013 0 0 63273 63273 2014 21 0 0 21 2015 2 500 6844 7346 2016 1 425 0 426 2017 0 0 212562 212562 2018 10 5813 27868 33691 2019 37 21 15859 15917 In 2019, there was one fish escape in Cermaq Chile, leading to 15859 fish escaping. One escape was due to a ripped net in December 2019. In Norway, there were three escape events recorded in 2019 where a total of 21 fish escaped. 19 fish escaped in Finnmark due to a pumping error with a wellboat, while a further 1 fish in Finnmark escaped due to an error when sampling and a further 1 escaped fish was found floating outside of a sea site in Nordland. In Canada, 37 fish total escaped in two incidents in 2019 where sea lions chewed a hole in containment nets. In Norway, Cermaq has introduced DNA traceability for its smolt, enabling to determine whether an escaped salmon is farmed by Cermaq or another company. The first smolt of this kind was transferred to sea in 2015. This DNA traceability allowed the identification of two fish that were caught by a local fisherman in Norway in 2018 as Cermaq fish. CEQ 8 RAW MATERIAL INGREDIENTS At a global level, EWOS is the main feed supplier of Cermaq’s farming operations and hence this indicator is based on EWOS data. Forage fishery dependency has been a challenge for a growing fish farming industry. Salmon needs marine ingredients to grow healthy and to keep a good content of omega-3. Since 2010, the use of fish trimmings and byproducts in fish feed has increased from around 20% to over 30%. In 2019, the marine index for EWOS decreased to 22.1 percent from 27.1 percent in 2018. The specific content of marine ingredients in our EWOS feed varies within specified limits depending on price and availability of alternative raw materials. 22 Marine content in salmonid feeds 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Fishmeal Fish Oil Notes: 2011-2019 figures are excl. EWOS Vietnam In the FAO report “The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2018” (SOFIA 2018), it is reported that fish meal and fish oil inclusion rates used in feed for salmon aquaculture has been decreasing overall since 1990. At the same time aquaculture production at a global level has grown but not the capture production from forage fisheries, indicating that the dependency between these two activities are decoupling. Efficient use of marine ingredients, byproducts and replacement with plant ingredients has allowed salmon production to increase while keeping its good quality and the advantages relative to other proteins. Specifically, in the past years EWOS and other feed suppliers have introduced new ingredients and lowered the marine content in its feed. Research into 'marine independence' provides the knowledge for further significant reduction in the future if necessary, for example using insects, yeast, or algae in salmon feed. Under this scenario aquaculture is increasingly decoupled from fishery activities. The marine nutrient dependency ratio (MNDR) is the ratio of each marine-derived nutrient used to feed salmon divided by the amount of each marine nutrient produced as a result of salmon farming (Crampton et al., 2010). Thus, it estimates the amount of marine protein and oil produced in salmon farming relative to the marine protein and oil consumed in the 23 form of forage fish. The marine protein dependency ratio (MPDR) is the calculation made for proteins and the marine oil dependency ratio (MODR) is for oils and fats. Dietary protein sources and oils or lipids from all capture fish, shellfish or zooplankton are classified as marine sources. (Nofima Report 36/2014). Efficient use of marine ingredients is important, and farmed salmon is well known to be very efficient in its feed conversion. For example, in 2019, EWOS estimated a MPDR of 0.56 (compared to 0.76 in 2018 and 0.94 in 2017), which means that the build-up of marine proteins by salmon has been higher than the amounts received through the feed. For marine oil the development is similar. EWOS used less marine oil in the feed (0.67) than the amount produced by the salmon. For comparison EWOS used 0.73 units of oil in 2018 and 0.74 units in 2017. Farmed salmon is now a net producer of marine protein and oils.

EWOS Vietnam 24 The following list shows the countries of origin for many of the fish species used in fishmeal and fish oil purchased by EWOS and used in Cermaq’s production. Country of origin FISH SPECIES COUNTRY Anchovy Chile, Peru Blue whiting Denmark, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, UK Capelin Iceland, Norway Gulf menhaden USA Herring (Araucanian) Chile Herring (Atlantic Denmark, Iceland, Norway Jack mackerel Chile Sand eel Denmark, Norway Sardine Chile, Mauritania, Mexico, Panama Sprat Denmark, Norway Cermaq has strict requirements of its feed suppliers and encourages certified sources of ingredients. As stated on their web page, EWOS prioritizes the use of feed ingredients that are judged to be sustainable based upon sources such as IMARPE and Sernapesca in South America, ICES in Europe, and National Marine Fisheries Service, Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, and Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in the USA. EWOS is a strong supporter of the IFFO Responsible Supply Standards, and in line with Cermaq’s requirements, EWOS does not accept IUU/illegal fishing as sources for the fish oil or fish meal they purchase. In 2019, nearly all of EWOS’ 280 raw material suppliers which produced ingredients for feed used by Cermaq signed their Supplier Code of Conduct, which gives expectations to suppliers with respect to key aspects of environmental and social impacts. EWOS participated in the development of the RTRS and ProTerra standards for responsible soy and also supports the FEFAC guidelines for responsible soy. In 2014, both EWOS and Cermaq signed The New York Declaration on Forests aiming at stopping deforestation and focusing especially on soy and palm oil. EWOS source soy products from Brazil, their main supplier, that are certified to ProTerra, RTRS or equivalent. Use of soy products from other countries can be approved given evidence that they are responsibly sourced or that the suppliers have development programs in place to achieve credible third-party certification. The table below shows the fish species and category of raw material used for salmonid feed primarily, but also raw materials used for other fish species like pangasius and tilapia. In 2019, EWOS’ use of marine ingredients derived from fish trimmings and by-products was 32 percent (an increase from 31 percent in 2018). 25 Overview of fish species used to make fishmeal and fishoil for EWOS group feed 2019 CATEGORY SPECIES CATEGORY % TOTAL % Fish trimmings & byproducts Herring(Atlantic) 37.9 12.1 Mixed Whitefish 32.0 10.3 Atlantic mackerel 3.7 1.2 Capelin 4.6 1.5 Hake 6.0 1.9 Pollock 5.9 1.9 Jack Mackerel 6.0 1.9 Others 4.0 1.3 Fish trimmings & 100 32.1 byproducts Total Forage Fish Blue Whiting 20.9 14.0 Anchovy 20.7 13.9 Gulf menhaden 14.2 9.6 Sardine (South 4.5 3.0 American pilchard) Sardine (Sardinella) 4.4 3.0 Sardine (Indian oil 2.8 1.9 sardine) Sand eel 3.8 2.6 Herring (Atlantic) 4.6 3.1 Herring (Araucanian) 7.6 5.1 Sprat 6.8 4.5 Norway Pout 2.4 1.6 Others 7.3 1.9 Forage Fish Total 100 64.2 Other Marine Ingredients 0 0 Other Marine Ingredients 0 0 Total 100% Notes: Species that individually make up less than 2% of the mix have been grouped together under 'various species'.

CEQ 16 ASC CERTIFICATION The Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) aims to be the world's leading certification and labelling program for responsibly farmed seafood. The ASC's primary role is to manage the global standards for responsible aquaculture, which were developed by the WWF Aquaculture Dialogues. As of December 2019, Cermaq had 50 ASC certified sites. Of these 24 were in Norway, 13 in Canada and 13 in Chile. Cermaq aims to certify its farming sites to the salmon standard for responsibly farmed salmon from the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). Ongoing certifications can also be found on ASC’s website. The table below provides an overview of all ASC certified sites in Cermaq as of 31 December 2019. 28 COUNTRY SITE NAME FISH SPECIES PRODUCTION CAPACITY Norway Anevika ATS 5400 Elvevika ATS 3599 Store Lerresfjord ATS 3480 Gisløy ATS 2340 Hjartøya ATS 5460 Skinnstakkvika ATS 3120 Ytre Koven ATS 3600 Sommarbukt ATS 3480 Rivarbukt ATS 3480 Tuvan ATS 3480 Martnesvika ATS 5400 Storholmen ATS 5600 Olderfjord ATS 4800 Jernelva ATS 2100 Komagnes ATS 5800 Langøyhodvden ATS 1190 Svartfjell ATS 3370 Dypeidet ATS 1840 Ånderbakk ATS 3900 Hamnefjord ATS 3600 Husfjord ATS 7560 Slettnesfjord ATS 7560 Hammer ATS 3600 Hellarvika ATS 3600 Chile Isla Juan RBT 4000 Desembocadure ATS 5236 Gajardo Yelcho COS 5250 Calen 2 COS 4050 Isla Guzman ATS 3500 Canal Bertrand ATS 3584 Linlinao COS 2621 Punta Darsena ATS 4000 Estero Riquelme ATS 7000 Isla Grande ATS 5000 Ensenada Lorca ATS 4216 Surgidero Furia ATS 3750 Aguantao COS 2621 Canada Bare Bluff ATS 2640 Dixon Bay ATS 2650 Mussel Rock ATS 2050 Brent Island ATS 3000 Venture Point ATS 3393 Raza Island ATS 2700 Westside ATS 2460 Maude ATS 2640 Burwood ATS 2640 Sir Edmund Bay ATS 2640 Ross Pass ATS 2450 Millar Channel ATS 2900 Saranac ATS 2640 29 Note: Production capacity is in tons as maximum allowed biomass by farming site during one farming cycle. The production capacity is granted from 2015 until 2022, depending on the issue date of the certification ASC works with aquaculture producers, seafood processors, retail and foodservice companies, scientists, conservation groups and consumers to: • Recognize and reward responsible aquaculture through the ASC aquaculture certification program and seafood label. • Promote best environmental and social choice when buying seafood. • Contribute to transforming seafood markets towards sustainability A certified farming site must comply with several requirements, including 150 sustainability criteria such as wildlife interactions, sea lice counts, fish escapes and unexplained loss among others. Some indicators such as wildlife interactions and sea lice counts must be reported and be publicly available. This information is provided in the Cermaq ASC Dashboard. Advantages of ASC salmon ASC certification can help consumers make positive environmentally and socially responsible choices when buying seafood. It gives at-a-glance reassurance that the seafood comes from a farm which uses responsible farming methods that minimize environmental and social impacts. It lets consumers enjoy seafood with a clear conscience; they know where it has come from and how it has been produced. It ensures transparency, so that seafood products are traceable from farm to fork. 30 CEQ 17 BIRDS AND MAMMALS Cermaq recognizes the potential for fish farming operations to impact biodiversity, either directly or indirectly. We operate in areas with rich biodiversity where several species of plants and animals interacts with our farming activities. Also in Chile salmonids are nonnative fish species where our operations could have an impact on biodiversity. Cermaq does not operate any sites in any protected areas as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) or National legislation. Birds and mammals mortalities are reported by accidental and intentional events and has been calculated as a total number of interactions divided by the total number of active sites from January to December 2019, following the definition set by the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI). ACCIDENTAL INTENTIONAL Birds Mammals Birds Mammals Chile 0 0.02 0 0 Norway 1.27 0 0 0 Canada 0.50 0 0 0 A requirement of the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, wildlife interactions on ASC certified sites are covered by public reporting within 30 days of any death of birds or marine mammals, whether unintentional or intentional. ASC requirements also include a requirement of no mortalities of endangered or red-listed marine mammals or birds as defined by IUCN or national endangered species list. Cermaq will continue to install preventive measures and monitoring to reduce the number of interactions with wildlife. Please consult Cermaq’s ASC dashboard for reports of incidents with wildlife on ASC certified sites in each region. 31 GRI General Disclosures 1.

Climate change impacts may also affect the industry’s feed supply due to a decrease or disruption in agricultural production, changes in forage fisheries, replacement of species or changes in amount of inclusion. Climate change adaptation is hence an increasingly important aspect of Cermaq’s risk management. The industry also sees opportunities related to climate change. The results from scientific studies show that farmed fish has a relatively low carbon footprint compared to other protein sources, such as beef and pork (e.g. FAO 2014: “The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture” and the GSI sustainability report 2017). The world’s population is growing and demands more protein. Farmed salmon represents a solution to the challenge of climate change by providing a low-impact protein source. Below is an overview of key risks and opportunities related to climate change for Cermaq Group, including their implications and management. Physical Risks and Opportunities Changes in weather patterns Increased frequency of extreme weather events may cause storms, mudslides and/or flooding, resulting in damage to hatcheries and fish farm sites with sea water cages. This may have consequences related to the safety of employees, increase the risk of fish escapes and influence insurance costs. In Cermaq’s operations in 2019, extreme weather such as storms and currents continued to be experienced in all regions quite regularly. Norway experienced historically high electricity prices in summer 2018 due to an extended period of drought which left hydroelectric reservoirs unable to produce power. In British Columbia, challenging environmental conditions were experienced in summer 2016 caused by prolonged periods without rain, rising seawater temperatures, algae presence and low dissolved oxygen. In Chile, several algae blooms were reported in February and March 2016 due to high seawater temperatures, higher solar radiation and sea water salinity, which resulted in a significant loss of biomass in the industry. These events occurred during a strong “El Niño” Southern Oscillation event, which has an erratic behavior that affects global weather patterns and which also has been reported to be influenced by climate change. Algal blooms in Chile have been determined by research to be related with higher water temperatures and reduced rainfall. Reuters determined that the total overall losses to all companies in Chile for this algal bloom were at least US$800m, although Cermaq’s losses were relatively minor. 40 Impacts on feed ingredients Climate related challenges could impact the availability and price of raw materials (both marine and terrestrial) for feed produced which means higher feed costs for salmon farmers. Risks related to change in mean (average) temperature Warmer seawater temperatures could affect aquaculture in temperate zones, making it impossible to farm some species. The Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) publishes information about risks connected to warmer water temperatures, such as an increase in disease-causing pathogens. Higher temperatures also may lead to the introduction or displacement of new fish species and the risk of new sanitary challenges. Several fish parasites have shorter live cycles in warmer temperatures, which could increase the loads and which in turn may impact fish health and welfare. Warmer temperatures can also raise salinity, raise the chance of hypoxia to fish and raise production costs. (Source: Impacts of climate change on fisheries and aquaculture: synthesis of current knowledge, adaptation and mitigation options. FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 627 Rome, FAO, 2018: 449-461) Risks related to ocean acidification Ocean acidification due to increased levels of CO2 poses a risk to marine life, and may affect the environmental conditions for salmon production and the availability of marine ingredients in the salmon feed. As pointed out in an analysis made by Kroeker et al (2013), in general heavily calcified organisms, including calcified algae, corals and mollusks are the most negatively impacted, whereas crustaceans, fish, fleshy algae, seagrass and diatoms are less affected or may even benefit from acidification. Some fleshy algae and diatoms may benefit, although marginally, from the same conditions. Algae blooms are known to have negatively impacted salmon farming sites in Canada and Chile and pose a risk to fish health and welfare. (Source: Impacts of ocean acidification on marine organisms: quantifying sensitivities and interaction with warming; Glob Chang Biol. 2013 Jun; 19(6): 1884–1896). Opportunities related to change in mean (average) temperature Increasing sea water temperatures could enhance the growing conditions for salmon farming, allowing for faster growth rates and reduced production costs. A report from MCCIP explains opportunities connected to growth and type of species cultivated. Rising sea water temperatures could increase growth rates for some fish species (e.g. Atlantic Salmon), and new species could be cultivated (e.g. Sea Brass and Bream). Increase in water temperature may lead to the displacement of local species or introduction of new species. 41 Changes in sea water temperatures could allow for new salmonid farming sites located farther north than before. However, a UNFAO report released in 2018 noted that relocation to areas with cooler/deeper water could bring new safety risks. Financial implications of the physical risks and opportunities Financial implications related to physical risks are increased fish mortality, physical destruction of aquaculture facilities, loss of stock, spread of disease, higher cost in disease prevention and increased feed costs. Changes in sea water surface temperatures could impact the conditions for fish farming. In extreme cases, higher sea water temperatures may cause physiological stress to the fish, reduce seawater oxygen levels and cause harmful algae blooms that increase the risk of mortality and fish health issues, which all have negative financial impacts. Increased water temperatures may also lead to increased sea lice load and hence higher treatment costs. Challenges in the feed supply chain due to climate related issues may lead to lower availability of feed and increased costs. Higher temperatures in some regions could mean faster growth, which results in decreased production costs for our fish farming operations. However, because the optimal water temperature for growing salmon is 12 to 14 degrees, if temperatures rise above 15 degrees, growing conditions become suboptimal and can increase risk of diseases, prompt algal blooms and lead to longer production cycles. Additional stress to fish can also lead to lower feed conversion rates. How we manage the physical risks and opportunities Risks connected with extreme weather events are mitigated through applying site-specific risk assessments for elements such as weather patterns and temperatures, and implementing specific protocols and climate change adaptation measures. Changes to sea water surface temperatures are in some ways mitigated by the geographic diversity of Cermaq's operations. Evaluating further expansion potential is a part of the management’s yearly strategic process reviews. Cermaq Norway is developing an in-sea closed containment system, Certus, which can prevent the effects of harmful algae on fish. If successful, the system will be potentially also rolled out in Canada. Regulatory Risks and Opportunities Emission reporting obligations There is a general trend towards regulation related to carbon footprint disclosure at point of sale. This may affect all products marketed in the EU. 42 Carbon taxes CO2 regulations and increased tax on fossil-based fuel and energy represent a risk of higher operational costs. General environmental regulations Changes in environmental regulations may pose a risk, such as emissions regulations for production sites, increased taxation on energy and fuel and increased reporting demand. General environmental regulation opportunities Any new regulations are an opportunity if the organization is well prepared. Immediate compliance can be a competitive advantage. Financial implications of the regulatory risks and opportunities Cermaq expects financial implications on different levels: increased operational costs and resources for reporting and labelling purposes; and possible inability to comply with new legislation. Ultimately this could interfere with the access to international markets for our products. For example, the European Union has is now considering binding climate legislation which would include carbon reduction standards for all products sold within the EU. Investment in time and efforts to comply with new regulations and follow-up and reporting procedures are financial implications of pursuing the opportunities. How we manage the regulatory risks and opportunities Regulatory risks and opportunities are monitored and Cermaq’s sustainability functional team discusses new regulations and initiatives and their impact on our business. Compliance with regulations is followed up in the quarterly sustainability reporting process. 202-2 PROPORTION OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT HIRED FROM LOCAL COMMUNITY Cermaq bases its operations on local recruitment of senior management, and in 2019 the proportion of management hired from local communities averaged 66 percent, unchanged from 66 percent in 2018. Senior management includes the management team reporting directly to a Chief Operating Officer, and people reporting directly to Group Management team. International assignments are seen as positive for personal development in a multinational organization like Cermaq, and employees are encouraged to gain international experience to help share knowledge between our operations and to develop our corporate culture. 43 PROPORTION OF LOCAL CERMAQ CERMAQ CERMAQ CERMAQ CERMAQ HIRES AND FEMALE GROUP NORWAY CHILE CANADA GROUP MANAGERS AS incl.

The Guidelines prohibit any form of corruption. Anti-corruption training is delivered regularly. 44 In 2019, 100 percent of managers and administrative employees in Cermaq Canada received anti-corruption training, in Cermaq Chile 97 percent received training and in Cermaq Norway 89 percent received training. In Cermaq Group AS, 84 percent of managers and administrative employees received anti-corruption training. Anti-corruption expectations to Cermaq’s suppliers were also developed through the establishment of the Cermaq Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014, which is communicated and was updated in January 2017 on Cermaq’s website. 205-3 CONFIRMED INCIDENTS OF CORRUPTION AND ACTIONS TAKEN There were no confirmed incidents of corruption in Cermaq Group in 2019. FP 9 PERCENTAGE AND TOTAL OF ANIMALS RAISED AND/OR PROCESSED, BY SPECIES AND BREED TYPE Gutted weight (GWE) is a measurement of fish production. It is a calculation where the biomass in tons of closing stocks of live fish is added with the biomass in tons harvested, subtracted by the opening stock in tons of live fish for a specific period of time. This biomass determination is corrected by a 1.2 factor in Chile and Canada and a 1.17 factor in Norway in order to determine the live weight of the biomass or LWE. Our key performance indicators on medicine use in our annual reports are ratios of amount of active ingredients by LWE. The salmonid species and tons produced (LWE) are summarized in the table below. FISH PRODUCTION 2019 UNIT Atlantic Salmon Tons(LWE) Cermaq Norway 85,586 Cermaq Chile 73,109 Cermaq Canada 19,744 Total ATS 178,438 Coho Salmon Tons(LWE) Cermaq Chile 27,085 Rainbow Trout Tons(LWE) Cermaq Chile 1,838 Total all species Tons(LWE) 207,362 Fish production is the increase of tons in biomass produced within a year, which also considers the amount in tons of biomass harvested in the same period. Atlantic salmon production (LWE) increased in Norway compared with the 2018 production, to 85,586 tons. Atlantic salmon production in Chile and Canada decreased in 2019 by 10,492 tons and 4,528 tons, respectively. Also, during 2019, there was a decrease of Rainbow Trout 45 production by 838 tons LWE in Chile to 1,838 tons total, while Coho salmon production decreased by 3,558 tons for 27,085 tons total produced during the year. GRI Environmental Indicators 301-1 MATERIALS USED BY WEIGHT OR VOLUME 301-2 RECYCLED INPUT MATERIALS USED The disposal of products and packaging materials is a steadily growing environmental challenge. Establishing effective recycling and reuse systems to close product cycles can contribute significantly to increase material life cycle, resource efficiency and it can decrease costs. All Cermaq operations shall comply with local and national environmental regulations related to effluents and waste handling. The waste handling procedures vary with the local infrastructure in place. Recycling and reuse of packaging materials should always consider that human health is first and for Cermaq it is priority to couple smart use of materials with food safety of our final products. The work to strengthen our reporting in this area will continue going forward. This indicator provides insight into what extent our materials are collected and successfully converted into useful materials for new production processes, as well as to what extent we have designed products and packaging capable of being recycled or reused. In 2019, 94% of the input materials (by tons used) were recycled at a Group level. Input packaging used was 3027 tons of materials at a Group level, while for output packaging it was 4747 tons. Cermaq reported input materials used that were recycled, including plastics and wood pallets (used in the transportation of fish feed), cardboard for final product elaboration and wood pallets for storage in processing plants.

Diesel energy calculation includes both diesel fuel and 95 percent of biodiesel blend. Energy consumption and emissions are calculated by country and is not calculated based on fish species in Chile. Norway and Canada only produce Atlantic salmon. In Chile, Coho salmon typically requires less energy use due to a shorter life cycle and consequently less GHG emissions. Cermaq reports to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and more details can be found in our CDP reports available on our webpage. 302-2 ENERGY CONSUMPTION OUTSIDE THE ORGANISATION Feed is the main input when producing salmon and trout and feed costs constitute approximately 50 percent of the purchasing costs related to fish farming in Cermaq. EWOS continues to be our main feed supplier and below is an overview of the energy consumption for EWOS in 2019. 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 GRI Energy Source Energy Type Indirect Electricity 476,798 450,586 364,783 436,744 474,333 505,043 Direct Biomass(Rice 83,145 119,486 104,290 Husk) Direct Diesel 652 788 2,826 2,186 2,644 1,307 Direct Fuel Oil 4,856 119,284 144,337 146,254 175,309 197,720 Direct Gasoline/Petrol 0 0 0 0 0 0 Direct LPG 156 134 69,069 62,895 100,680 70,925 Direct Natural gas 464,083 336,500 361,125 282,620 295,878 350,957 Direct Propane 1 0 1,262 1,256 1,266 1,111 Direct Biofuel (wood) 0 54,476 36,620 49,374 59,914 41,510 Total 946,546 961,768 980,022 1,064,474 1,229,511 1,272,863 direct + indirect ΔYoY -2% -2% -8% -13% -3% 2% *Biofuel use is reported by EWOS for the first time in 2014 48 302-3 ENERGY INTENSITY The most relevant energy intensity ratio within salmon farming is to express the energy used in terms of tons of fish produced (GJ/ton fish Production LWE). This provides a measure of the energy efficiency within the organization. However, some of the energy use is fixed and does not vary with production (e.g. housing facilities at sea sites and energy used in administrative buildings and processing plants). This means that in years with fewer fish in the sea the energy consumption per ton of production will be influenced in a negative way by the fixed consumption. All energy sources listed in 302-2 are included in the following graph, where the amount of Gigajoules (GJ) used by ton fish production (LWE) at a Group level is shown. Cermaq Group Energy Intensity (GJ per ton LWE) 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2017 2018 2019 At a group level the energy use increased to 6.6 GJ per ton of LWE produced from 6.0 GJ per ton produced LWE in 2018, mainly due to an increase in the diesel fuel used during 2019 combined with a decrease in total fish produced. Our total energy intensity increased by 10% at a Group level. The energy intensity by country shows the same trend with differing magnitudes of increase. Canada increased by 1.3% and Norway by 3.9%, while energy intensity in Chile increased by 24.2%. 49 Energy Intensity by country (GJ per Ton LWE) 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Norway Chile Canada 2017 2018 2019 302-4 REDUCTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION Cermaq has a number of initiatives to reduce energy consumption, with some examples provided in the table below. Canada’s initiatives this year focus mainly on technological improvements, including installing synchronized generators, trialing a hybrid hydrogen technology for diesel generators, changing equipment, and installation of onsite hydroelectricity at one freshwater site. Cermaq Chile has downsized hatcheries, fully integrated sea sites to save generator use, and installed energy-efficient generators In Norway, Cermaq has installed a new power grid connection at a seawater site, operated a hybrid-drive service boat, utilizes to updated energy-saving equipment, and given personnel instructions on how to drive boats at lower speeds to conserve fuel. A sample of initiatives per country are provided in the table below. 50 COUNTRY ENERGY TYPE OF ENERGY SAVING INITIATIVES SAVED INITIATIVE Canada n/a Installation of 1.

mammals and birds entering into the farm site and to prevent attacks that are stressful for the fish. In Chile, farming companies are required to report immediately to The Undersecretary of Fisheries and Aquaculture (Subpesca) the culling of any marine mammal at the farm. Stronger nets have been tested in order to reduce the interaction with wildlife, including stainless steel nets and PET monofilament nets. Both nets are more resistant to strain and to external forces, keeping their shape and reducing the risk of accidental entrapment. Nets for birds are installed at the farm sites to protect the fish, which are constantly assessed to check their structural function. Norway In Norway, several species are included on the IUCN red list. From all species a total of 13 birds, 1 mammal, 9 fish, 4 algae, 2 mollusks, 1 vascular plant and 3 coral species appear on the national conservation list with habitats in our area of operations. Of them the 13 species of birds and 1 Mammal species are considered to interact closely to our farming sites. The 14 species are categorized as critical endangered (CR) with 1 species, 5 endangered (EN), 3 vulnerable (VU) and 5 near threatened (NT). The lists below provide the common name, scientific name and the risk category classification for each species. 56 Birds SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME CLASSIFICATION Uria aalge lomvi CR Rissa tridactyla krykkje EN Uria lomvia polarlomvi EN Alca torda alke EN Sterna hirundo makrellterne EN Fulmarus glacialis havhest EN Cepphus grylle Teist VU Fratercula arctica Lunde VU Gavia adamsii Gulnebblom NT Larus canus Fiskemåke NT Somateria mollissima Ærfugl NT Oceanodroma leucorhoa Stormsvale NT Stercoriarus parasiticus tyvjo NT Mammals SCIENTIFIC NAME COMMON NAME CLASSIFICATION Lutra oter VU Canada In Canada, there are 146 species related to the general geographical location of Canadian operations, the ocean and/or farming operations.

In Canada, farming companies are also required to report immediately to Fisheries & Oceans Canada (DFO) the culling of any marine mammal at the farm. In British Columbia, the industry is not having a negative impact on the populations of marine mammals. Harbor seal, Steller Sea Lion and Californian Sea line populations have increased considerably since they were protected in the 1970s and Humpback whale populations are expanding.

Scope 2 emissions were 22 986 tons of CO₂e in 2019 compared to 21 474 in 2018. Increases in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and led to a total increase in emissions by 4 725 tons of CO₂e. Details on Cermaq’s energy consumption can be found under Energy Consumption (indicators 302-1, 302-2 and 302-3). Our reporting is based on the GHG Protocol, the internationally recognized standard for the accounting and reporting of GHG emissions. We have used the financial control approach to define our organizational boundary and the operational scope for our reporting of scope 1 and 2. Emissions factors for our global operations are based on sources including IEA, IPCC, SSB, EIA, RE-DISS, Green-e and BC Ministry of Environment. Feed is the main input when producing salmon and trout and feed costs constitute approximately 50 percent of the production costs related to farming in Cermaq. EWOS continued to be our main feed supplier in 2019 and Scope 3 emissions consists of EWOS estimated CO₂ emissions in 2019. Please see the EWOS sustainability report for further details. GHG emissions reported below includes CO₂-emissions only and all types of energy sources used.

This is a relevant ratio for our industry. As can be seen below, the CO₂ emissions per ton of fish produced for Scope 1 and Scope 2 increased by 10.9% from 2018 to 2019. 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Intensity: kg of CO2e 478 431 352 360 334 258 per ton of fish produced (LWE) The increase in absolute energy consumption for Cermaq Group was largely driven by environmental conditions with challenging environmental conditions requiring higher energy inputs using generation equipment as well as increased operational demands for diesel fuel, while production decreased compared to 2018 and Scope 2 emissions increased by 7%. Accounting absolute emissions in tons of CO₂ shows that although Cermaq Canada decreased absolute emissions by 2946 tons CO₂, Cermaq Chile emitted 6 261 tons more CO₂ compared to 2018. Cermaq Norway increased the emissions by 1410 tons. At a Group level, a total of 4 725 tons more CO₂ was emitted to the environment during 2018 (Scope 1 + Scope 2). Further details about energy consumption can be found under Energy consumption (indicators 302-1,302-2 and 302-3). 307-1 NON-COMPLIANCES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS Cermaq works actively to ensure that our operations respect and are compliant with local, national and international laws. If any non-compliances occur, we take it seriously and investigate at the appropriate level to correct the issue before measures are taken to mitigate the risk of re-occurrence. In 2019, there was one case of environmental non-compliances closed with a fine in Cermaq Chile.

Cermaq has had a high focus on safety in our operations, with visible results the past few years. Dedicated and competent employees are fundamental; likewise are robust management systems and procedures to manage risk and assessment of all relevant aspects of our operations. Visible leadership on OHS is important in Cermaq, and health and safety are also reflected in our Leadership Principles. The first principle explicitly states that “Health and safety of people are always first”. Measures include sharing of good practice between regions, encouraging a strong safety culture through various activities, the use of adequate safety equipment and adherence to OHS routines. Additionally, Cermaq held its first company-wide Health and Safety Day in April 2019, and also held a company-wide ‘Safety Ideas Contest’, the winners of which will have their ideas implemented throughout the company. In 2019, the Group absence rate was 2.6 percent compared to 2.2 percent in 2018, and it remains low throughout the group. The lost time injury rate was 6 in 2019 which is steady compared to the lost time injury rate of 6 lost time injuries per million working hours in 2018. The injury frequency rate was also steady in 2019 at 8 injuries per million hours worked after it decreased from 18 in 2014 to 10 in 2015 and continued further down to 9 in 2016 and 8 in 2017 and 2018. At the same time, the lost time frequency rate was 138 at a Group level in 2018, which is an increase from the 91 recorded in 2018. There was one tragic fatality in Cermaq Group in 2019. To reduce the number of diving accidents, a high-risk area, several measures have been introduced in Cermaq Chile the past years which show promising results. Initiatives include investment in ROVs to monitor the nets and the testing of new predator nets of stainless steel and PET monofilament to reduce the number of dives required. A training program was started in 2013 and is ongoing, with special attention to technical and practical diving issues and activities. In addition, assessment of diving skills and training is an ongoing activity. During 2019, the absence rate for female employees was 3.5% which is somewhat higher than the male rate, while lost time injury rate and injury frequency rate was significantly lower among female employees. 61 Rates of injury by region NUMBER OF ABSENTEE LOST TIME INJURY LOST TIME OCCUPATIONAL OCCUPATIONAL FATALITIES RATE INJURY FREQUENCY RATE FREQUENCY RATE DISEASE CASES DISEASE RATE (ODR) RATE (H1) (H2) (F-VALUE) Cermaq 0 2.3% 0 0 0 0 0 Group HQ Cermaq 0 3.7% 5 7 47 0 0 Norway Cermaq 0 2.4% 7 8 149 0 0 Chile Cermaq 1 2.9% 2 10 252 0 0 Canada Cermaq 1 2.6% 6 8 138 0 0 Group Incl.

Establishing and maintaining good relationships based on dialogue, transparency and mutual understanding is a priority. All Cermaq operations have local community engagement and development programs in place. Engagement activities include sponsorship of sports teams, clubs, foundations, and schools in regions where Cermaq operates. Cermaq regularly conducts community meetings and engages in dialogue with a wide group of organizations on relevant topics, and openly shares information about its operations to stakeholders. Cermaq Canada Our community engagement aims to find and support shared community value with the communities where we work, aligned to the Cermaq reputational model. We want to be present and a part of our communities – be visible, be a listener and be a provider – and invest in capacity. We work with the community to educate and provide opportunity for youth in particular. At Cermaq, we care about the community and the environment beyond salmon farming. We must engage in a deep sense – to build a greater sense of partnership with the community and most importantly in British Columbia – First Nations communities. In addition to community information sessions and small sponsorships and donations, we also support larger strategic projects; these are linked to SDGs, working closely with First Nations and aiming for transformative impact. In 2019, these include: • Ocean debris cleanup focus on plastics – SDG 14 life below water • Wild salmon enhancement – to recover stocks for food and cultural significance – SDG 2 zero hunger • Ongoing sugar kelp farming projects 63 Our community sponsorships help to build relationships, support initiatives and programs that important to local communities and improve our public visibility. In 2019, we sponsored over 100 community activities, events and associations, including local fundraisers, beach clean-ups, school field trips, kids’ sports teams and venues. Our staff often identify opportunities where Cermaq can add value and support community initiatives through their own community involvement and volunteerism. In 2019, we also focused on building relationships with all levels of government, from local through to federal ad continued to present to councils and attend meetings with provincial and federal governments. This information sharing and dialogue is part of our commitment to transparency. The creation of relationships built on mutual respect and trust with First Nations communities is important for us and is in-line with our values and goals as an organization. We support the Truth and Reconciliation process and have adopted the principles outlines by the United Nations through the United Nations Declaration of Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). We acknowledge that we operate in the traditional territories of several First Nations. Cermaq is committed to respecting Indigenous rights and building close and meaningful relationships over time through ongoing engagement, information sharing. Through protocol agreements, we also ensure that members of the Ahousaht nation are provided with advance notice of upcoming opportunities and we make it a priority to hire First Nations-owned companies as suppliers. Through our sponsorship and community investment, we support traditional cultural activities, such as canoe journeys, community events and youth sports events. In 2019, we provided scholarships for 18 Ahousaht youth in the trades, bachelor’s, and graduate studies levels. The range of study areas included child and youth care, social work, counselling, nursing, education, psychology, business, global studies, leadership, sustainability management. Through our community engagement, we hope to contribute in meaningful ways to the local communities in the regions where Cermaq works, on projects which actively engage community members to promote health, well-being, environmental conservation and protection, opportunities for youth, indigenous rights and culture, and other aspects of a vibrant community life. Cermaq Chile We believe in working jointly with communities, keeping an open doors policy and focused on developing trusting relationships with our neighbors in all our facilities. There are five 64 main lines of work that guide this area: environmental workshops in schools, sports and health lifestyle, skills training programs, preserving traditions (indigenous peoples) and Cermaq Open Doors. This last program consists on inviting our neighbors to visit our facilities so they can get to know how we work. We also participate in beach cleaning activities (both lakes and sea) all through the year and along all regions, from La Araucanía to Magallanes. Cermaq Chile is also part of Social Salmon Initiative, a group of companies focused on developing good practices that allow responsible relationships between salmon industry and local communities. Cermaq Norway Our local operations actively engage with the local communities where we operate to build strong relations, add value to the local communities, and to increase our social license to operate. Establishing and maintaining good relationships based on dialogue, transparency and mutual understanding is a central part of Cermaq Norway’s community engagement. Our employees are an integral part of the local communities where we operate, and our community engagement goes beyond salmon farming. Cermaq Norway wants to be a responsible community partner in our areas of operation, and contributes to local activity and community development with special focus on children and youth. Cermaq Norway’s sponsorships contributes to safeguarding our reputation, as well as creating a supportive political environment regionally. In 2019, Cermaq Norway supported about 70 different events, activities, organizations and initiatives in the regions of Nordland and Finnmark. The list of sponsored projects is long; spanning from theatre groups to support groups for dementia, swimming clubs, students’ associations, youth festivals, hunting and fishing clubs, to sports clubs and –events for children and youth. In the Finnmark region, we often engage in local events and activities in partnerships with the other salmon farmers in the region, increasing our visibility and support to the local communities. In Cermaq, we also invite our local communities to visit one of our sea sites during the summer festival season in Norway. In 2019, we also invited the inhabitants of Hammerfest 65 to visit one of our brand-new barges, as it was stationed in the city for a few days on its way to one of our sea sites in Finnmark. In 2019, Cermaq Norway engaged in activities with different stakeholders from local communities including municipalities, anglers’ associations, suppliers and customers. Cermaq Norway met with local administration and politicians in most of the municipalities where the company has operations to discuss current and planned activities and opportunities for development. A specific topic that Cermaq was engaged in together with other industry players, was the planned reduction of the local schooland education structure. Together with local politicians and local industry, we were able to stop the plans and keep the current schooland education structure locally. This means a lot to sustain vital local communities as well for our future recruitment possibilities. Cermaq Norway also engages with R&D institutions to the benefit of local fjords, waters and rivers. We continued to fund the surveillance of salmon wild stocks in cooperation with Varpa River system, with very encouraging results. In Finnmark county, we are a partner in research projects looking at interbreeding success of escaped salmon in the national wild salmon rivers Altaelva and Repparfjordelva. In 2019 Cermaq Norway continued our engagement in beach cleaning, and took in youth as summer employees to give work experience and to address our common need to keep our beaches clean from plastics and debris. Our operations engaged youths between 15 and 18 years, in various parts of our operations and many of them were dedicated to cleaning the beaches in our two operating regions. Thanks to our summer temps, we were able to remove 30 tons of plastics and debris from our beaches in the regions of Nordland and Finnmark. 416-1 ASSESSMENT OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE CATEGORIES 100 percent of our product categories are assessed for health and safety impact improvements. This is part of the ISO 22000 and IFS standards, which are fully implemented. Cermaq Canada and Cermaq Norway have fully implemented the ISO 22000 standard, while Chile has fully implemented the IFS standard. Further details about Cermaq’s management standards are given in indicator CEQ 13 Management Standards. 66 416-2 INCIDENTS OF NON-COMPLIANCES CONCERNING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Cermaq works actively to ensure that our operations respect and are compliant with local, national and international laws. If any non-compliances occur, we take it seriously and investigate at the appropriate level to correct the issue before measures are taken to mitigate the risk of re-occurrence. Cermaq has comprehensive certifications and management systems in place to ensure that the highest standards are met and complied with. In 2019, there were zero non-compliances with the health and safety requirements of products and services in any operating region.

SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT OF FEED SUPPLIERS All Cermaq’s feed suppliers have been assessed taking into account environmental, labor, human rights and anti-corruption criteria as specified in Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct – Feed suppliers. The main sub-suppliers to Cermaq’s feed suppliers are fish meal and fish oil processing companies and other raw material providers, such as companies supplying e.g. soy proteins, rapeseed oil, wheat and wheat gluten. Cermaq’s main feed supplier EWOS has developed a supplier policy and Code of Conduct based on the UN Global Compact 10 principles, the same principles that are the foundation of Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Raw material suppliers must sign a self-assessment form and EWOS performs regular supplier audits. In addition, EWOS supports and encourages suppliers of marine ingredients to qualify as certified IFFO Responsible Sourcing. This practice is in line with Cermaq’s expectations to feed suppliers laid out in our Supplier Code of Conduct and our Feed Supplier Policy. EWOS continued to be Cermaq’s main supplier of fish feed in 2019 in all Cermaq’s countries of operation. However, Cermaq has entered into agreement with two additional feed suppliers, Skretting and Biomar, which both have comprehensive standards in place. Environmental, social and governance criteria outlined in Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct are evaluated before entering into any new feed agreement. In addition, Cermaq’s Supplier Code of ConductFeed suppliers specifies more detailed sustainability requirements to new and existing feed suppliers. 68 414-1, 308-1, 412-3 SCREENING OF NEW FEED SUPPLIERS All new feed suppliers to Cermaq in 2019 were screened using environmental criteria, human rights and labor practices criteria as well as criteria for impacts on society. Specific requirements assessed can be found in the Cermaq Supplier Code of Conduct and the Cermaq Supplier Code of Conduct – Feed suppliers. 414-2, 308-2 NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND ACTIONS TAKEN Cermaq is constantly working on developing its supply management practices, and acknowledge the complexity of our supply chain. In 2019, no significant actual negative impacts were identified in Cermaq’s supply chain concerning human rights impacts, labor practices or impact on society. Cermaq has been actively in contact with its suppliers regarding claims made relating to labor issues in Brazil during 2019. Additionally, Cermaq has signed the Statement of Support for the Cerrado Manifesto to prevent deforestation in the Cerrado biome in Brazil. Moreover, Cermaq is currently developing tools for traceability for seafood supply chains through its work in Seafood Business for Ocean Stewardship (SeaBOS). Some key environmental issues within feed processing are to ensure that the raw materials used are not overexploited and that the ecological and carbon footprints are minimized. As our main feed supplier, we present EWOS indicators concerning marine and terrestrial raw material use under the indicator CEQ8. More information about EWOS energy use and CO2 emissions can be found in indicator 302-2. More details can also be found in the EWOS Sustainability Report. We will continue our work to identify and mitigate risks in our supply chain. 69 APPENDIX 1 LABOR Employment in Cermaq Our 3 693 employees represent a diverse group both in terms of culture and type of work. Still, a common set of core values unite our international and diversified activities. Cermaq promotes equal work opportunities and just treatment of all its employees. Strict standards for health, safety and environment are set to ensure high level of safety. All employees are expected to contribute to a work environment free of discrimination. LEAN AND OPERATIVE CENTRAL MANAGEMENT All operating companies are represented in Cermaq’s Corporate Management Team. The team visits all of Cermaq’s operating companies each year. This hands-on involvement is important to acknowledge the effort made by all employees and brings in-depth insight about everyday life in our different areas of operation. EMPLOYMENT As of 31 December 2019, Cermaq employed 3 693 people, a decrease of 961 employees since the end of 2019. There are strong seasonal variations in employment in farming, especially related to the harvesting and processing plants. Chile is the largest region in terms of employment and the number of employees reported includes Salmones Humboldt employees. Over 70 percent of all Cermaq employees were located in Chile by year end 2019. Recruiting the right people is essential for the future success of our operations. Our operations are based on local recruitment of management. In 2019 the proportion of management hired from local communities averaged 66 percent (67 percent in 2018). This is in line with Cermaq's philosophy to trust local employees who best know the local conditions and culture. Possibilities for international assignments contribute to personal development as well as developing our corporate culture. 70 102-8 INFORMATION ON EMPLOYEES AND OTHER WORKERS PER 31 DECEMBER 2019 GROUP AS NORWAY CHILE* CANADA TOTAL Total Employees 63 100% 589 100% 2753 100% 288 100% 3693 100% Total Supervised 0 0% 0 0% 4 0% 0 0% 4 0% workers Total – 63 100% 589 100% 2757 100% 288 100% 3697 100% Workforce Total Indefinite 63 100% 523 89% 1835 67% 284 99% 2705 73% or Permanent employees Female 18 29% 125 21% 511 19% 61 21% 715 19% male 45 71% 398 68% 1324 48% 223 77% 1990 54% Total temporary 0 n/a 66 100% 918 100% 4 100% 988 100% or fixed term employees Female 0 n/a 13 20% 383 42% 3 75% 399 40% male 0 n/a 53 80% 535 58% 1 25% 589 60% 71 Total Full time 58 100% 523 100% 2751 100% 287 100% 3619 100% employees Female 13 22% 125 24% 892 32% 62 22% 1092 30% Male 45 78% 398 76% 1859 68% 225 78% 2527 70% Total Part time 5 100% 66 100% 2 100% 1 100% 74 100% employees Female 5 100% 13 20% 2 100% 1 100% 21 28% male 0 0% 53 80% 0 0% 0 0% 53 72% Management 63 100% 19 100% 207 100% 66 100% 355 100% and administration employees Other employees 0 0% 0 0% 0 0% 0 0% 0 0% Female 18 29% 6 32% 28 14% 41 62% 93 26% employees Male employees 45 71% 13 68% 179 86% 25 38% 262 74% *Including Salmones Humboldt Note: During high season (November until February), Chile and Norway typically have a high proportion of temporary workers to assist with processing of harvested fish. 72 DIVERSITY Cermaq promotes equal work for all its employees. Still, gender is a challenge we continue to face. Whereas 30% percent of our employees are female, women have a significantly higher representation amongst the seasonal workers in the processing plants. At year-end 2019 Group management team comprised of six members. One member of Group management is a Canadian citizen, one member is a British citizen and four members are Norwegian. There were no women amongst the Group’s managing directors. In total 26 percent of the Group’s managerial groups are women (including all managers that report to the Managing Directors in the Group’s companies) in 2019, a rise over 15% in 2018. It is an aim to increase the percentage of female managers in Cermaq. One means of achieving this is through in-house talent development. Some of Cermaq’s operations are located in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples. In Canada the protocol agreement with Ahousaht First Nation sets ambitions for employment from Ahousaht, and also provides service opportunities. In Chile and Norway indigenous people are employed in line with employees in general, while Cermaq is aware of a history of discrimination against indigenous people. In Chile most of the indigenous people are Mapuche while in Norway are Sami people.

In Cermaq, we work with key stakeholder groups to share knowledge, information and enhance our performance. Our stakeholders show strong interest in Cermaq's sustainability approach and performance. We remain open to dialogue with stakeholders who are directly involved with or impacted by our industry or who constructively engage in seeking industry improvements. Approach to stakeholder engagement Identification of stakeholders for engagement Cermaq’s approach to stakeholder engagement is to concentrate on entities or individuals that reasonably can be expected to be significantly affected by the organization’s activities, products, and/or services; and whose actions reasonably can be expected to affect the ability of the organization to successfully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives. Stakeholders may have rights under national laws as well as under international conventions. Important international conventions related to indigenous rights are ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Other central conventions include the eight ILO core conventions of the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights, including the right to freedom of association, collective bargaining and human rights. Our approach to stakeholder engagement Cermaq’s main stakeholder groups include our owner, employees and unions, customers, authorities, local communities, suppliers, civil society and NGOs. 75 Dialogue with our owner and Cermaq employees is continuous, through established management structures and practices. Employee relations are comprehensibly regulated by law and agreement in the countries in which Cermaq operates. Cermaq applies one set of standards and values across its operations. The expertise, engagement and efforts of all employees are crucial to the success of Cermaq’s business. Cermaq’s relations with its employees and unions are described in more detail in the sustainability report (sections 102-8 and 102-41). Customers include seafood wholesalers, processors and retailers in the main salmon markets. The sales organization in each local Cermaq company works directly with their customer in export markets,and many of our customers visit our operations. Transparent reporting is a useful instrument in Cermaq’s customer relations. Dialogue with customers is based in Cermaq’s ambition to be a preferred supplier for its customer. Authorities include regulators and politicians at the local, regional and national levels who define the framework conditions for the industry. Cermaq believes transparent dialogue is a prerequisite for arriving at good and balanced decisions and policies. Cermaq reaches out to authorities and is always meeting requests for dialogue or information. The company will continue to prioritize the dialogue with authorities and politicians, in all the countries where Cermaq operates, describing the performance and challenges of the industry. Local communities are important to ensure acceptance for Cermaq’s local operations, support for future growth and recruitment of employees. Cermaq contributes to local activity and employment and wants to be a reliable partner for the local communities in areas of operation. Regular dialogue and community meetings are conducted in all regions. Indigenous peoples are an important stakeholder group to Cermaq and have distinctive rights in some of the areas in which Cermaq operates. The First Nations of British Columbia, Canada, have special titles and rights under Canadian laws and legislation. It is important for the Group to be aware of potential challenges its operations might represent, and Cermaq acknowledges First Nations as important stakeholders. Cermaq has participated in several conferences on First Nation relations. The main priority has been the Ahousaht First Nation with whom Cermaq has a protocol agreement, and also dialogue 76 with other First Nations in the territories in which the company operates. Mutually beneficial agreements with indigenous people in BC, Canada is a strong foundation for Cermaq’s operations in areas where indigenous peoples’ rights are affected by its operations. Feed suppliers constitute a material stakeholder group in Cermaq, since feed constitutes about half of our total purchasing costs. Following the sale of EWOS, Cermaq is building internal competence as a feed purchaser. In 2015, Cermaq launched a Supplier Code of Conduct and a policy for feed suppliers stating detailed sustainability requirements. These documents where updated in January 2017 and are available at our web page. Other main suppliers include suppliers of technical equipment and transport as well as local suppliers of goods and services. The local Cermaq companies maintain contact with their suppliers with frequency adapted to the needs. Civil society and the NGO community is diverse and Cermaq is selectively concentrating on those NGOs that seek constructive improvements in the industry. This includes wide groups of environmental organizations, labor organizations and NGOs dedicated to other relevant topics. Cermaq reaches out to these groups when arranging events seminars, take direct contact for regular updates and when specific events occur. NGOs can provide positive input giving the company a broader perspective and Insight. Cermaq sees industry associations necessary for ensuring the framework conditions for the aquaculture industry. Thus, Cermaq is actively participating in the industry association, normally represented by senior executives in the board of the association. In 2019, Cermaq had representation in the board of Salmon Chile, BCSFA (Canada), CAIA (Canada), Sjømat Norge (Norwegian Seafood Federation), and Cermaq’s CEO was active in the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI). Although Cermaq is 100 percent owned by Mitsubishi Corporation, Cermaq still defines providers of capital a stakeholder group. Financial institutions also approach Cermaq on topics related to specific sustainability concerns, and Cermaq strives to meet the needs for information and clarification. 77 Key topics Stakeholder dialogue takes place in both structured and unstructured ways and plays an important role in our reporting. Some key topics discussed in our stakeholder dialogue in 2019 are presented below.

Communities Working Group on Responsible Since 2017, we are part of the Community Engagement Social Salmon Initiative, a group of companies focused on developing good practices that allow responsible relationships between salmon industry and local communities beyond current regulations. Since then we are working, to implement the Toolkit for a Responsible Engagement with Communities elaborated by “ WWF Chile, Rabobank and Consensus Building Institute” Our activities were mainly a Self Diagnosis to generate a baseline and a guide the group's work and its objectives.

Cermaq Group also engage in the advisory network to the Ocean Panel and in the Cerrado Manifesto, addressing specific sustainability in the Amazon. 83 APPENDIX 3 MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT The concept of materiality is the foundation of Cermaq’s sustainability reporting. We conduct a materiality analysis to prioritize reporting on aspects that are material to us and our stakeholders, and to communicate Cermaq’s sustainability impact and select indicators for more frequent follow-up. Our starting point is to report on topics where we have the largest impact and where stakeholder request for information is high. From 2016, we have aligned our material topics with specific UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that we can significantly impact. Materiality process Determining materiality In defining material interests, Cermaq identifies its economic, social and environmental impacts and identifies the topics that have the greatest influence on stakeholder assessment and decisions. The topics identified as material both to Cermaq and to Cermaq’s stakeholders provide the basis for the selection of indicators that we measure our performance against. A part of the process is furthermore to identify material indicators that should have targets – for measuring and improving performance over time. These form the basis of our sustainability reporting and the results are presented in our annual report. The materiality assessment is subject to an annual review by our global Sustainability Functional Team with representatives from all regions and across disciplines. This is to ensure that we report on material aspects for the organization as a whole and measure our performance against the right indicators. At certain intervals, we perform a thorough stakeholder analysis to inform our materiality assessment process. In 2013, Cermaq invited all its external stakeholders (e.g. shareholders, NGOs, local communities, media, and analysts) to participate in a survey and perform a ranking of 32 sustainability aspects. Cermaq is continuously engaging with stakeholders and 84 Cermaq’s focus areas In 2016, a broader process was conducted to inform and update our materiality analysis from a customer perspective and by integrating the UN SDGs. We reviewed the targets and indicators and identified five specific SDGs for special consideration in our stakeholder assessment, based on our perceived ability to make a significant impact: SDG2 Zero hunger, SDG8 Decent work and economic growth, SDG12 Responsible consumption and production, SDG13 Climate action and SDG14 Life below water. In addition, we conducted a benchmark study to incorporate customers’ sustainability expectations into our analysis. The study was based on publicly available information from sustainability branded food retailers, collected in April-August 2016, with an emphasis on requirements to sustainable salmon farming and aquaculture. This analysis was incorporated into our materiality assessment. Cermaq’s sustainability framework, which incorporate the five focus areas and the materiality analysis, was based on input from all Cermaq regions and across relevant functions, and was reviewed and approved by Cermaq’s central management team and the Board in the Fall of 2016. Our five focus areas provide the structure for a set of 15 material topics with relevant indicators. Cermaq specific indicators are reported internally to Cermaq’s central management team and the Board on a monthly and quarterly basis. Starting in 2016, key figures are also reported publicly on our web page on a quarterly basis. Relevant GRI indicators are reported annually and are available together with the Cermaq specific indicators in our annual sustainability report. 85 It is Cermaq’s ambition that through transparency and open reporting on material topics, we will further strengthen the constructive dialogue between Cermaq and its stakeholders. Follow up of performance The operational responsibility for ensuring sustainable business practice ultimately lies with the Managing Director for each of the operations owned by Cermaq. The Board of Directors holds the overall responsibility to ensure that necessary systems and procedures are in place. Monitoring and follow-up of sustainability performance is conducted at both local and corporate levels. A set of sustainability KPIs are reported and evaluated monthly by the central management team. Each quarter, the local and central management as well as the Board of Directors receive a comprehensive sustainability report and assess the organization’s sustainability performance. For the material indicators, Cermaq has set yearly targets and the performance is evaluated in accordance with established risk management procedures. Corrective actions are taken for indicators which deviate from the set targets. All the material aspects listed above as material are material to the whole organization except for Cermaq Group AS that is not involved in fish farming in an operational way. Material topics and indicators The material topics are listed below and are explained in further detail in the Management Approach. FOCUS AREA MATERIAL TOPIC INDICATORS HEALTHY AND 1.
