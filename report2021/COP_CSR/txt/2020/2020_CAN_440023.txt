Hydro-Québec // Sustainability Report 2019 �   3  Our approach Supplying clean, renewable energy helps ensure quality of life. Meeting people’s electricity needs in a sustainable way is of prime importance. It is also crucial to use resources wisely and preserve the quality of the environment for future generations. Québec long ago opted for hydroelectricity, a clean, renewable energy source with known, wellcontrolled environmental impacts. Today, Québec is actively involved in the fight against climate change in North America. Hydro-Québec has a sustainability vision that goes well beyond the environment. We strive to have stakeholders participate in our decisions. We are also determined to contribute to Québec’s economic vitality.

Hydro-Québec // Sustainability Report 2019 GRI GRI 102-15 �   4  Our priorities Our mission is to deliver reliable electric power and high-quality services. By developing hydraulic resources, we can achieve this while contributing to collective wealth and playing a part in the emergence of a low-carbon economy—that is, an economy with a small carbon footprint. We have taken pride in the clean, renewable nature of our hydropower, which has until now been an energy form without equal. Now the time has come to turn our attention to other renewables, such as wind, solar and clean hydrogen. Climate change, the energy industry, our business environment and our future aspirations all involve major challenges. Seven of these are directly related to sustainability.

Hydro-Québec // Sustainability Report 2019 GRI GRI 102-14, GRI 103-2 �   7  Message from the President and Chief Executive Officer We will remember spring 2020 for a very long time. All over the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed a severe threat to public health, weakened the economy and changed life as we knew it. It will leave behind deep scars but also important lessons. These include the need to cooperate and think outside the box—like never before! Québec has not been spared by the pandemic. Our customers and partners, large and small, have been badly shaken. Hydro-Québec will steadfastly fulfill the economic, social and environmental leadership role that people have come to expect of it. We will be a powerful driver of Québec’s economy and work tirelessly for the good of all Quebecers. Decarbonizing the economy, here and beyond our borders Hydro-Québec remains committed to the global energy transition and to the decarbonization of the economy. Sophie Brochu President and Chief Executive Officer We will act with determination and discernment, taking care to properly prioritize the measures to be deployed at a time when public and private finances will be under intense pressure. We will stay the course and continue to innovate, coupling our vast collective hydropower resources with the human know-how that lies behind smart energy management technologies, which are the subject of intensive research on our part. Whether this means energy storage by our customers, integrating distributed generation into the grid, home automation tools or developing smart grids, our research will find concrete applications, such as the upcoming installation of two distribution microgrids, in Lac Mégantic and Îles-de-la-Madeleine. We will also rely on our abundant hydraulic resources to support the development of clean hydrogen produced through water electrolysis. Among the promising applications of this energy option: rail and road transportation, renewable natural gas, carbon-neutral fuels (synthetic hydrocarbons) and ammonia and methanol production. Just like electricity, hydrogen could form a pillar of the energy transition. We plan to invest in R&D in this area, create innovation hubs in collaboration with partners and join forces with existing hubs. Hydro-Québec // Sustainability Report 2019 GRI GRI 102-14, GRI 103-2 �   8  Outside Québec, we can contribute to the energy transition in two ways. The first is to offer our decarbonized energy to replace energy generated from fossil fuels. Exporting our electricity is both commercially profitable and environmentally desirable. In 2019, our exports enabled our partners in neighboring jurisdictions to avoid the emission of nearly 7 million t CO₂ eq.—equivalent to taking 1.74 million vehicles off the road for a year. Our second contribution involves taking advantage of the large storage capacity of our reservoirs to support the emergence, among our neighbors, of generation using intermittent renewables like wind and solar power, which must be combined with energy storage to maximize their value. We have already made a major commitment to reduce GHG emissions in all our activities. We are now going a step further and aiming for carbon-neutrality by 2030. Taking inspiration from the best world standards We also support the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of human rights, labor standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption. We are determined to advance the UN Global Compact principles by incorporating them into our development strategies, business practices and management processes. Our report on this effort, titled Communication on Progress, can be found on page 95 of this report. We have accomplished great things at Hydro-Québec over the past 75 years. Many exciting challenges and opportunities lie ahead of us. To meet those challenges and seize those opportunities, we are privileged to be able to count on capable, motivated women and men. I wish to pay tribute to them here, and to thank them all.

Optimizing reservoir management through improved Details on anticipated effects evapotranspiration models and solutions considered  To predict the impact of climate change on the hydrological regime, hydrologists rely on hydrometeorological tools. The evapotranspiration formula is a key element of hydrological modeling because it integrates the water cycle’s terrestrial and atmospheric components. It represents the combination of two natural processes by which water moves into the atmosphere: evaporation of water from the earth’s surface, and transpiration from plants. However, the concept of potential evapotranspiration is the weakness of hydrological models, due to its lack of robustness in contrasting climates. Finalized in the fall, a project conducted by Ouranos with Hydro-Québec’s participation led to the development of more physical approaches for calculating evapotranspiration in hydrological models. These approaches will offer increased accuracy in predicting the impacts of climate change on hydrological regimes. By improving the management of water levels in reservoirs, modeling results based on these approaches will optimize power plant generation. In the longer term, these results will be used to analyze the effects of climate change on inflows into reservoirs and adapt the design of future hydraulic structures.

The process is used to review and prioritize issues, and contributes to the content of the Report. The previous Materiality Analysis, conducted in 2017, as well as a responsiveness exercise conducted with stakeholders in 2019, served as a basis for the Sustainability Report 2019. Responsiveness To respond to the concerns of external and internal stakeholders, Hydro-Québec has acquired and strategically deployed various tools and resources. The organization prioritizes responsiveness based on its relevant issues and its sustainability challenges. The stakeholders appear to be well served by these processes, including the annual publication of the Sustainability Report. Impact Hydro-Québec has a history of systematically evaluating the impacts of its strategies, decisions, projects and activities on the environment and on its stakeholders. These evaluations fuel the organization’s dialogue and interactions with the stakeholders. The impacts are documented in the Report and as they relate to the materiality matrix. Conclusion The assurance team considers that, based on the assurance approach used, the information contained in the Sustainability Report 2019 presents a reliable account of Hydro-Quebec’s sustainability performance during the period.
