FINANCIAL INFORMATION Year in brief We are The Food Experience Company. We decided to sell Fazer Food Services in order to focus on our development as a fast-moving consumer goods company. We took a more progressive role in the market and innovated inspiring food experiences. The acquisition of Kaslink, an expert in high-quality oat-based food products, further enhanced Fazer Lifestyle Foods offering of sustainable, plant-based products, supporting the growth of the business area. We started our 50-million-euro investment in the construction of a groundbreaking xylitol factory in Lahti, Finland.

Fazer Group’s net sales in continuing operations were 1,097.0 M€ in 2019, showing a slight increase from the previous year. Fazer Bakery reached net sales of 565.2 M€, Fazer Confectionery of 353.1 M€, Fazer Lifestyle Foods of 158.1 M€ and Fazer Retail of 47.1 M€. The net sales of discontinued operations, Fazer Food Services, were 597.3 M€. 3 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION A company on the move In 2019, Fazer continued executing its strategy and informed about the sale of Fazer Food Services in order to focus on its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and direct-to-consumer businesses. Financially, the year was satisfactory. Net sales for continuing operations increased by 7% and the operating profit was close to the previous year’s level. Trends are heavily shaping the world of food. Consumer lifestyles are changing at an increasingly rapid pace, and disruptive trends challenge companies. Convenience is becoming more important at the same time as companies are required to act sustainably. Consumers expect companies not only to be good at what they do, but also to do good to others to society in general and to the environment. To be able to keep the pace in the race, we need to understand how consumer behaviour is evolving and to take action. Fazer sold Fazer Food Services to Compass Group in January 2020, aiming to focus its efforts and to streamline its business portfolio. I wish all our former Fazer Food Services employees all the best in the future. I am convinced that employees and the business will continue to thrive and develop as part of Compass Group. The funds from the sale of Fazer Food Services will be invested in Fazer Group’s FMCG businesses with the objectives of strengthening our position as the leading FMCG brand in Finland and our position in the Northern 4 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION Europe and beyond.

Sustainability is closely interlinked with foodtech. Foodtech makes the food system more productive, affordable, sustainable and healthy. Developing Fazer’s position in foodtech and our ability to commercialise significant innovations will, in the future, play an even more important role in executing our ambitious growth strategy. We will build on our current strengths in research, development and innovation and on agile collaboration with universities and research networks to innovate, develop and leverage the full potential of new food solutions. In the beginning of 2019, Fazer started the construction of a xylitol manufacturing facility next to its oat mill in Lahti, Finland. This investment, one of Fazer’s most significant investments in years, is a great example of foodtech aligned with our sustainability goals. The facility will use patented state-of-the-art technology to make xylitol from oat hulls that are a side stream of the mill’s production process. Our strategic partnership with the Finnish start-up company Solar Foods is a good example of co-innovation. The aim of the partnership is to jointly research, develop and commercialise a new protein ingredient developed by Solar Foods. To reduce the impacts of food on the climate, we all need to adopt new ways of thinking and operating. This requires fearless creativity. Creativity that we shall not limit to technology but that may take many shapes and forms: giving up single-use plastic utensils, including cutlery, straws and cups, in our cafés and bakery shops, 5 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION In Fazer Bakery, both the Baltic and the Finnish units showed strong development.

During 2019, we have been calculating our emissions based on the GHG protocol, We did not have any incidents causing leakages to the environment in 2019. using the framework for CO2 emission calculations for scope 1, 2 and 3. Our target was to set the baseline for the year 2015, examine where the biggest emissions stem from and find ways to reduce them. The key challenge with this goal is that the calculations especially for scope 3 emissions are difficult and debated. Furthermore, some technologies and solutions to reduce scope 2 emissions from e.g. transport in an economically viable way are still missing. We are, however, confident that further advances in this area will soon be made. Achievements in 2019 We continued with our long-term plan concerning energy, with focus on energy efficiency. We continued to purchase renewable electricity and reached the level of 82 %. Our energy consumption decreased from 0.86 to 0.84 MWh/tonne. Our target for 2020 is to reduce energy consumption per produced tonne 37 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION Going forward Going forward, the biggest share of our emissions comes from scope 3 emissions generated in the value chain. Therefore, our focus will be in reducing these emissions. We shall continue to improve our energy efficiency and use renewable electricity. Reducing waste will also help us reach our Core goal. We are committed to reducing our CO2 emissions throughout the value chain. We still need to improve our understanding on how to reduce scope 3 emissions. We shall also set concrete actions to reduce emissions generated by transport. For example, in Sweden we have committed to the DLF transport initiative for fossilfree transport by 2025. Our new strategic partnership with Finnish foodtech start-up Solar Foods aims to develop a novel carbon-neutral protein ingredient. Solein®, invented by Solar Foods, can be produced completely independently from soil, negative land use impacts, weather and climate. CASE: Xylitol and bio-heating from side streams Fazer is building a xylitol manufacturing plant in Lahti, Finland, using oat hull as raw material for xylitol. The hulls are a side stream of the oat milling process, but with state-of-the-art technology, they can be turned into useful raw material. The 50-million-euro investment testifies to our commitment to explore possibilities offered by circular economy. The oat hull mass left over from the xylitol production process will be used in a new bio-heating facility to generate sustainable energy for the mill, bakery and rye crisp production lines as well as the xylitol factory itself. The heating facility will produce enough energy to serve Fazer’s entire factory area in Lahti. 38 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION Reducing food waste is a joint effort in which both Core goal 2: 50% less food waste food production and consumer behaviour play a significant role. • Approximately one third of the global food production is lost or wasted annually Achievements in 2019 • Food waste creates major negative impacts on the We established a baseline towards measuring progress at our production sites.

Progress in this goal is by no means easy to make or quantify. How to define and measure food waste on a national scale was under development in 2019 in, for example, Finland and Sweden. Food waste can be defined by destination as well as by division into avoidable/non-avoidable and edible/non-edible. However, what is considered avoidable and/or edible can vary from country to country. This is something we need to consider as we have operations in several countries. We must also take into account our direct impact as well as indirect impacts made by educating and influencing suppliers, retailers and consumers. 39 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION Going forward We will continue to closely monitor EU and national food waste definitions, policies and reporting requirements. We shall continue to reduce food waste along Reducing food waste is one of the value chain and help consumers reduce food waste by raising awareness and providing e.g. packaging solutions. the key actions to minimise the environmental impacts of food. We will continue with existing initiatives and initiate new ones to reduce food waste. Our priority is to prevent waste from occurring, but we will also look at how side streams are used now and could be used further. CASE: Reducing bread waste in Swedish retail Fazer shared bread waste data with Borås University and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, which allowed the amount of bread waste along the value chain to be identified. This information has so far not been available to the public. The researchers noted that the business model in Sweden where the supplier takes back unsold bread at no cost is a significant risk factor for the increase in bread waste. We engaged in dialogue with customers on how to remedy the situation. One retailer customer has already earlier challenged the business model by taking the responsibility for unsold bread for itself. During the first month this model was applied, the amount of bread waste generated was halved. The excellent results encourage us to keep examining ways to further reduce bread waste. From 2019 Fazer in Russia has been working with customers according to no returns policy. This has resulted to decline in food waste when the customers have been doing their orders more accurately. 40 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION Core goal 3: We will ensure that our materials are 100% sustainably 100% sustainably sourced sourced across all suppliers and chosen value chains. • Our operations impact societies, people and their livelihoods as well as the environment Achievements in 2019 • 100% sustainably sourced consists of two levels We continued with 100% sustainable cocoa, 100% sustainable palm oil and for us: 100% sustainable soy.

Fazer Grain Vision’s ten principles cover cutting the amount of farm leakage into surrounding waterways significantly. Fazer has also joined the Carbon Action project where the aim is to combine carbon farming methods with sustainable grain farming principles. We are focusing on having the agricultural practices in use, so that we enable soil to store even more carbon than the carbon impacts of grain cultivation causes. Maintaining diversity is supported by ensuring crop rotation and additional winter crops, even secondary crops that remain after the grain harvest. The goal is to take these practices outside of Finland and Sweden and to all flour suppliers, making it a prime example of one of our brand themes – True Relationships, where the value chain is rooted in deep collaboration. 43 YEAR IN BRIEF THIS IS FAZER OUR BUSINESSES SUSTAINABILITY GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL INFORMATION Core goal 4: More plant-based We will increase our plant-based offering to cater to healthy and sustainable tastes. • Fazer looks to respond to the consumers’ quest for more healthy and sustainable lifestyles.
