It was established at the initiative of the Financial Stability Board. Established as a forum in 1999 at the initiative of the G7, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) was institutionalized by the G20 heads of state and government at the 2009 London Summit. Its main purpose is to strengthen the international coordination of financial regulatory reform. To that end, the FSB monitors the implementation of reforms, notably through mutual assessments, by promoting cooperation between authorities and assessing financial sector vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities to climate change.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. To the General Assembly, In our quality as an independent verifier, accredited by the COFRAC under the number 3-1681 (scope of accreditation available on the website www.cofrac.fr), and as a member of the network of one of the statutory auditors of your company (hereafter “entity”), we present our report on the consolidated non-financial statement established for the year ended December 31, 2019 (hereafter referred to as the “Statement”), included in the management report pursuant to the requirements of articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). The entity’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the Statement, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the principal non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators. The Statement has been prepared in accordance with the entity’s procedures (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), the main elements of which are presented in the Statement and available on request at the entity’s headquarters. Independence and quality control 4 Our independence is defined by the requirements of article L. 822-11-3 of the French Commercial Code and the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, the ethical requirements and French professional guidance. Responsibility of the independent third party On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to provide a report expressing a limited assurance conclusion on:  the compliance of the Statement with the requirements of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code;  the fairness of the information provided in accordance with article R. 225-105, 3° and II of the French Commercial Code, i.e., the outcomes, including key performance indicators, and the measures implemented considering the principal risks (hereinafter the “Information”). However, it is not our responsibility to comment on the entity’s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory requirements, in particular the French duty of care law and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation nor on the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations. Nature and scope of the work The work described below was performed in accordance with the provisions of articles A. 225-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, as well as with the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (“CNCC”) applicable to such engagements and with ISAE 3000(1):  we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities’ activities and the description of the principal risks associated;  we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;  we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L. 225-102-1 III as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anti-corruption;  we verified that the Statement provides the information required under article R. 225-105 II of the French Commercial Code, where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code; (1) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information. Valeo Universal Registration Document — 2019 275 4 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Independent third party’s report on the consolidated non-financial information statement  we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of principal risks associated with all the consolidated entities’ activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated with the principal risks;  we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:  assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and  corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1. Concerning certain risks (Safety at work, Talent attraction, Talent retention, Corruption, Responsible purchasing, Accidental pollution (water and soil), Product compliance with environmental regulations (low-carbon technologies)), our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, for the other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities: PTS Amiens (France), PTS Czechowice (Poland), PTS Atsugi ( Japan), CDA Veszprém (Hungary), CDA Rio Bravo (Mexico), THS San Luis Potosi 1 (Mexico), THS San Luis Potosi 5 (Mexico), VIS San Luis Potosi 3 (Mexico);  we verified that the Statement covers the scope of consolidation, i.e. all the consolidated entities in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code;  we obtained an understanding of internal control and risk management procedures the entity has put in place and assessed the data collection process to ensure the completeness and fairness of the Information;  for the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes that we considered to be the most important presented in Appendix 1, we implemented:  analytical procedures to verify the proper consolidation of the data collected and the consistency of any changes in those data,  tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the proper application of the definitions and procedures and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities and covers between 11% and 23% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests (11% of the headcount, 23% of training hours, 20% of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and 17% of recovered waste);  we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities. We believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Means and resources Our verification work mobilized the skills of six people and took place between October 2019 and March 2020 on a total duration of intervention of about eleven weeks. We conducted about ten interviews with the persons responsible for the preparation of the Statement including in particular the Departments of Public Affairs, Ethics and Compliance, Human Resources, Health, Safety and Environment and Purchasing. Conclusion Based on the procedures performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not presented in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects. Comments Without qualifying our conclusion above and in compliance with the provisions of Article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce), we draw your attention to the following points: Improvements still need to be made in the understanding and application of the reporting framework and in the monitoring of key performance indicators relating to waste-related risks.
