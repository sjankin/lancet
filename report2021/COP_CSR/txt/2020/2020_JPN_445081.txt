The global community is currently challenged by two major crises: marine plastic debris and food loss. All of the environmental challenges the world faces, no matter the type, are vital issues for Toppan as a Group that has been engaged in the packaging business since its founding in 1900. Sustainable The Toppan Group has been developing and supplying a great variety of environment-friendly packaging products. Prominent among them are Toppan’s GL BARRIER transparent barrier films and global Cartocan paper-based beverage containers. The Group also produces a 101 ECO SHEET series and various environment other interior décor materials designed in consideration of the environment. Toppan will continue to develop new businesses by leveraging the Group’s advantages in environmentfriendly production and pooling its expertise in the creation of systems and services in areas related to the design of sales promotion strategies. The Toppan Group is committed to the creation of a sustainable global environment to ensure sustainable life on our planet through 2030 and beyond. Many of the challenges facing communities across the world are especially urgent in Japan, a country with a declining birthrate, aging population, and mass migration from rural areas into densely populated Business mega-cities. Building communities that are safe and resilient against disasters is a critical challenge for the future not only for Japan, but for all of the world. Materiality Toppan has long provided a variety of services to improve communities by addressing the diverse issues Creation of they face. The Group’s multilingual speech translation systems, for example, help Japanese-speaking safe, secure, natives communicate with immigrant workers and visitors from other countries. Toppan has also enriched archived historical buildings such as temples, shrines, and castles using virtual reality (VR) technology communities and promoted the application of VR reproductions as a tourism resource. Toppan’s VR technology has also been used for disaster evacuation drills and safety training sessions at plants and construction sites across Japan. Toppan will continue applying the knowledge and expertise the Group has cultivated for the last 120 years to the design of safe, secure, and enriched communities. Societies with declining birthrates and aging populations need to maintain the physical and mental health of their populations to optimize their potential to live longer, higher-quality lives. Empowerment Toppan has spearheaded various educational and childcare businesses and operated health-point and fulfillment programs and other healthcare projects to maintain and enhance the health of community members. of body and Toppan will continue to apply the Group’s unique approach to empower people and give them mind opportunities to enrich their bodies and minds. The Group will offer health-support systems for people working in organizations and companies and use Toppan’s color-related technologies and educational content development capabilities to develop services that support physical and mental wellbeing. In 1992 Toppan established its Declaration on the Global Environment, a basic philosophy for the Company’s environmental conservation activities. In April 2009 the Group updated the declaration by Environmentally issuing The Toppan Group Declaration on the Global Environment, a new basic environmental philosophy for Group-wide activities. This declaration reflects Toppan’s more assertive approach to conserving the friendly & global environment for the creation of a sustainable society where all life can coexist into the future. sustainable Toppan will uphold the Group’s commitment to global environmental conservation as a responsible production member of international society by firmly maintaining the stance stated in the Declaration on the Global Environment: “to realize a sustainable society through forward looking corporate activities with consideration for the conservation of the global environment.” Companywide Materiality Toppan values its employees as precious “human assets.” The Group is convinced that human assets perform to their full potential when they are vigorous, earnest, and driven. To support motivated, vigorous, and earnest work, Toppan established a Health Management Employee Declaration in 2015. Various measures have been taken in line with the declaration with a view to maintaining and enhancing the health of employees. Toppan has also launched various initiatives to health & job pursue diversity management with a focus on the creation of a corporate culture that allows diverse satisfaction human assets to enjoy job satisfaction and perform to their full potential. Towards 2030 and beyond, Toppan is ramping up efforts to promote positive working environments where all employees can work in good health for longer periods, take satisfaction in their jobs, and fulfill their potential. 9 TOPPAN Sustainability Report 2020 Toppan’s Sustainability Initiatives *Every indicator assured by an independent assurance provider is marked with an assurance stamp .

However, Toppan also believes that responding appropriately to such risks can generate business opportunities, and that it is important to allocate investment and resources and take other related measures in a timely and appropriate manner. Strategy In addition to its traditional business model, Toppan is currently driving T-DX (Toppan Digital Transformation), which supports the shift to new business models in a digitalized society. The Company published the TOPPAN SDGs STATEMENT in November 2019 to set out its basic approach to providing solutions to social issues. Under the theme of Environmentally Friendly & Sustainable Production as part of Companywide Materiality, Groupwide targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have been set by the Company and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. Based on these benchmark targets, Toppan is advancing low-carbon business activities. Meanwhile, as part of Business Materiality, under the theme of Sustainable Global Environment, the Company is targeting the creation of new value based on sharing with customers its medium-to-long-term vision for such initiatives as leveraging T-DX to develop supply chains for smart distribution. Toppan aims to be a creator of social value by working towards solutions to climate change and other social issues in collaboration with stakeholders. Toppan recognizes climate change as a vital issue for management and positions the process of Corporate Governance identifying and assessing climate-related risks as an important matter to be addressed by the Structure Sustainability Promotion Committee chaired by the President & Representative Director. The https://www.toppan.com/assets/ Committee has established a Risk Management Working Group (the “Working Group”).

A system is in place to ensure appropriate supervision by directors, whereby the activities of the Committee are presented to the Management Committee and subsequently reported to the Board of Directors. Material financial impacts considered when identifying and assessing climate-related risks are defined as investment and impact on sales due to fluctuations in demand for the current business that arise due to transition risks, expenditure such as the purchase of emission credits or renewable energy, and costs required for the mitigation of physical risks or measures to adapt to them. The medium-and-long-term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets for 2030 (approved by the Medium-and-long-term SBTi) are set at a 30% reduction in Scope 1* and Scope 2* emissions compared to the fiscal 2017 level Greenhouse Gas Emission and a 20% reduction in Scope 3* emissions compared to the fiscal 2017 level.

The Group will continue to adopt renewable energy sources on Toppan positions global warming mitigation as an important a preferential basis and assertively encourage the broad use of element of management. The Group focuses on energy management renewables into the future. and the rational use of energy in implementing activities towards Topic Adopting Renewable Energy Sources In January 2020, Toppan made further headway in the Group’s shift to renewables by introducing solar-power generation equipment at the Sakado Plant in Saitama Prefecture, Japan. The electrical energy generated by the equipment is consumed on the site premises, reducing CO2 emissions from plant operations. Toppan used subsidies from the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) of Japan to install this power generation equipment. The subsidies were granted through the Japan Environment Association under the MOE’s fiscal 2019 indirect aid program to incentivize business investment in equipment for CO2 emission control and other climate security initiatives (as a project to facilitate the selfsustaining adoption of renewables for power and heat). Activities ■ Mitigating Global Warming The Toppan Group has been reducing total emissions of carbon Group, is working with shippers from Toppan Group companies dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) to help to optimize transportation conditions and further improve mitigate global warming. To reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions transportation efficiency. Together they endeavor to reduce the (direct emissions from industrial processes or fuels consumed at energy consumption per unit of transport volume by company the Group), Toppan is systematically replacing long-used utility vehicles and the total volume of CO₂ emissions from transport. facilities with high-efficiency alternatives. The Group is also As a member of the Japan Federation of Printing Industries (JFPI), installing systems to abate high-global-warming-potential (GWP) Toppan has driven industry-wide efforts to spawn global warming gases emitted from semiconductor production processes and mitigation measures, primarily through its involvement in JFPI replacing the high-GWP gases used in those processes with loweractivities to address climate change and promote low carbonization.
