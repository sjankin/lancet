In order to monitor the interaction of the project activities with the biodiversity of the area, we developed a continuous monitoring program which includes: • Determination of the species groups to be affected from agricultural activities • Determination of rare/endangered/endemic/sensitive species in Konya • Determination of the monitoring and inventory methodology • Continuous monitoring of selected species groups, especially those that are rare/ endangered/endemic/sensitive. As a part of the biodiversity monitoring activities in the project, 43 bird species, 18 plant species, 15 butterfly species, and 10 small mammal species has been observed in the direct seeding areas, wind break zones and control areas. The project also develops environmentfriendly solutions to the problems of agricultural production, such as rodent management. As a part of biological pest control scheme, owl and kestrel boxes are placed in farming areas as an alternative to chemical pesticides used to exterminate the rodents in the fields.
