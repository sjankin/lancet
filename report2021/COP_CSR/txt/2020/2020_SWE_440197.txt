As a family-owned company, we own our strategy and invest in long-term goals. At Sigma IT we are 1200 specialists at 20 locations in Sweden and in 8 countries worldwide including Poland, Ukraine and India. We are part of the Sigma Group. STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION Communication with our customers take place in many ways and on many levels. Our assignments are followed up regarding quality by the business manager in charge and in addition a separate customer satisfaction survey is made every second year with our largest customers. Apart from this, there are several seminars and events that Sigma invites to as well as meetings that our customers and partners arrange. We take a great social responsibility and we want to make a difference in society as a whole and during 2019 we have produced a report, Tomorrow report, where we asked the Swedish people what they think about the future, digitalization and also about the environment and UN 17 sustainable development goals. The result is presented in Tomorrow Report and can be found on www.sigmait.se With our employees the communication is frequent through our internal channels and via the union organization. We also perform an anonymous employee survey on a yearly basis. Our most important suppliers are also our partners with whom we cooperate in order to develop first class solutions for our customers. BUSINESS MODEL – MATERIALITY STATEMENT Sigma’s vision is “Expect a better tomorrow” and the vision is included and relevant in the day-to-day business where our goal is to contribute for a better tomorrow for our customers improving their business. The business model is related to our employees and their competence but also to our partners. Sigma IT is the link between companies or organizations that need a specific digital solution, advisory support or expert competence. Often the customer turn to us to provide expert competence that cannot be found on the competence market. The deliveries take place as development work either under the customer’s own leadership or as a defined assignment under our responsibility. It can also be an inhouse project. The business model is based on billable hours where we charge for hours worked or for results accomplished or for a service that can be in a fixed level or based on estimate and adjusted depending on new requirements. There are also combinations of these two principles, always adapted to the choice of the customer. The core business of Sigma IT is to help our customers improve their business efficiency, and one area is improving their sustainability in terms of energy consumption and CO2 emissions, waste, and working environment conditions. We do this by delivering our services in all areas where IT is a driver, e.g. concepts for remote working, Internet of Things, AI, e-health, e-commerce, smart energy solutions etc. All areas of sustainability control are important and relevant to us, and the competence requirements on our employees are very high and therefore there are no risks for child labour or forced labour. We want to contribute to a better tomorrow for both our employees but also for society as a whole and therefore we have a strong commitment in a Social sustainability. Our strategy and initiatives are presented, under Human Rights Principles, Labour and Environmental Principles. HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. ASSESSMENT, POLICY AND GOALS Sigma IT Group AB signed up for UN Global Compact in 2015 since we think it is important to support the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Our business and our staff are all in Sweden, with strong traditions and regulations in the human rights area. Risks are assessed to be low in general in Sweden. The business of Sigma IT requires highly skilled personnel in IT consultancy and management competencies, which make the risks for our business even lower. For our company, the most relevant aspects of human rights are gender and ethnicity. Our management system is certified against ISO 27001, the requirement standard on Information Security Management Systems, which secures our control and improvement work is fulfilling the requirements on safeguarding information both with technical measures and by risk awareness. This is important for our ability to safeguard the personal information about our employees as well as the integrity and confidentiality of our customers’ information. To support and protect human rights our Ethical policy is published on our external website. The policy for Equal treatment and the policy for Working environment are safeguarding equality at work and give directives in the working environment area. We have also produced a Code of Conduct that describes our way of working and our different policies. IMPLEMENTATION Sigma’s vison is Expect a better tomorrow and with this we have an overall initiative for Corporate Social Responsibility that we call Care of tomorrow where we have a strategy why and how we can make a difference for a better tomorrow. To do this we are focusing on three main areas: education, gender balance and diversity and in these areas, we are partners with different organizations and promote inspiration, knowledge sharing and coaching. Our actions in the human rights area are: Gender Balance The IT industry is dominated by men and we take actions to impact the gender balance. Sigma IT is the main sponsor of Pink Programming, a non-profit organization working for women who want to enhance their programming skills but also women who are beginners and want to become programmers. See further: http://www.pinkprogramming.se/en. With this we hope that women can find female role models and encourage them to pursue an education within IT. At the present Sigma IT has 29 % female employees and 35 % female managers. The executive management team has 25% women. Our long-term goal is 35% female employees and 40% female managers. Sigma has identified gender balance is an important factor to have a creative and inspiring working environment and has started a broad gender equality program with defined goals and activities. An important goal was to recruit 200 female colleagues during 2018-2019 and this was achieved as planned. One of the other goals is to always have at least one woman and one man on the short-list when recruiting new managers. However, the decision who shall fill the position shall always be made based on competence criteria only. This is monitored on a regular basis by HR. Further, Sigma launched an extensive educational program including all employees to create awareness around equality and existing structures and norms. For the managers there is extra education and coaching to strengthen them as leaders and be better equipped to manage potential discriminating situations. To do this an external expert was contracted that together with the management was responsible for the managers training that were conducted during 2019. This program continues during 2020. During 2019 an employer survey focusing only on equality was performed. The result from the survey was taken as input to the gender equality training. Sigma IT is the organizer of Smart Women Society, a network for women within the IT/Tech business. We arrange networking events twice a year in eight of the main cities in Sweden. 100-300 women usually attend and listen to inspiring talks from other women in the business community. We also encourage female young talent at university supporting and coaching them in a yearly mentoring program. We was also a part of the initiative “Tech Women Get your voice heard” getyourvoicesheard.com Sigma is a proud sponsor of FC Rosengård, all female football team that several years have won the Swedish national football league. FC Rosengård is one of the most competitive women’s football teams in all of Europe. FC Rosengård is renowned for their focus on social development and helping young people realize their dreams. FC Rosengård is active in two large social development projects, Boost, aimed at helping young people raise their level of competence and competitiveness on the labour market and Football for Life, strengthening the self-esteem and awareness of young women at hundreds of schools in South Africa. So far over 1900 participants have achieved their goal of employment or full-time education through Boost by FC Rosengård. Education and sharing knowledge Every year Sigma IT invites customers to Inspiration days, where experts from our own, as well as partner´s organizations, share knowledge and give talks over an interesting matter, it may be in technical, communication or strategic area. We find it important to secure IT competence and knowledge in the younger generation to make sure that we have a continuous competence growth in the country. One way to do this is to introduce IT and digital creation in early ages and Sigma is one of the main sponsors to Kodcentrum that is a non-profit organization providing education in IT and programming to young learners from age 6 to 13, see further https://www.kodcentrum.se/ During 2019 we arranged several “kodstugor” for young people to learn more about programming. We also participated in The international Science Festival. With hundreds of activities and about 70,000 visits The International Science Festival in Gothenburg is one of Europe’s leading popular science events and the only one of its kind in Sweden. During the autumn school break we arranged a hackathon for children, where the hackathon was on a tram going through the city of Gothenburg. Since many years, Sigma IT is a sponsor of Star for Life, a non-profit organization working for prevention of HIV and AIDS in South Africa, by encouraging school children to work for realizing their dreams and focusing getting an education. Star for life was started in 2005 by Sigma’s founder and owner, Dan Olofsson. See further: http://www.starforlife.org During 2019 Sigma IT did a donation to Star for life where all employees contributed during a “Operation dagsverke”. The donation was to support Mobile Health Clinics for schools in South Africa. Sigma IT is also supporting Motivationslyftet by Star for life where young people in Sweden are getting help to improve the motivation, self-esteem and self-leadership. Diversity Sigma IT has for several years been a partner to Mitt Liv, a social company working with integration of immigrant academics. Via this partnership, Sigma employees become mentors for immigrants for one year. See further: http://www.mittliv.com As a part of Sigma’s commitment to a better tomorrow and making a difference we started “Funkisfonden”. Funkisfonden was launched on New Year's Eve 2018, with the aim of raising the issue of sports for people with intellectual disabilities. People with intellectual disabilities generally have more health problems than others, so it is extremely important that sports and the possibility to exercise become more accessible to them. Many people with intellectual disabilities go through their entire school life without any sports education and most of those who participate or compete in sports today, did not start until they were adults. Sport is not just about movement and exercise; the inclusion factor and the possibility of making new friends is equally important. Getting more people involved in sports and exercising is vital and this is exactly what Funkisfonden aimed to do. Protection of personal information We are compliant with the European Directive GDPR and we have enforced routines and controls in order to protect our employees’ personal information as well as our customers’ and their customer’s or users’ personal information that are continuously monitored and improved. Code of Conduct To ensure correct management in all aspects of human rights, we have, on basis of our ethical policy, implemented a policy for equality of treatment and a recruiting policy in our management system. Information about whistleblowing is published in our employee handbook and Code of Conduct and we have a workflow function in our intranet to gather suggestions for improvement in any aspect from all employees. Our supplier and partner agreement template refer to our published Quality, Ethical, Information Security and Environmental policies, and all suppliers and partners must agree to them all, by control of our management system. The Code of Conduct is available internally on the intranet and externally on our website www.sigmait.se MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES In the employee survey that takes place once a year, measurements are made on experienced treatment in the aspects of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and age. These measurements show that our employees are safe and satisfied with our human rights conditions.
