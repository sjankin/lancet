At Committee, etc., each of the three Committees is clearly that time, it had been over ten years since the Company functioning. Resolutions at these Committees would never transitioned to a Company with Committees in pace with be altered by the Board of Directors, and each Committee Hitachi, Ltd., but the system was not fully functioning. is functioning quite well, ensuring the effectiveness. However, as a result of our efforts to drastically change that Urano: On the premise that the three Committees are for the past six years, I believe it is now effectively functioning well, I believe the core of governance lies with functioning. For example, based on various opinions from the Board of Directors. I’ve been saying at the Board of our stakeholders, the Compensation Committee Directors meetings that “the Company’s growth strategy successfully aligned the compensation plan for officers should aim to satisfy all stakeholders including the capital with the level required by the Corporate Governance Code market.” If we can achieve this, I think we can say, “our Weight inspection system Digital signage Monitor placed in loading dock in FY2020. The Nominating Committee also organized the governance is effective.” Because the Company was a 39 Hitachi Transport System, Ltd. Integrated Report 2020 Hitachi Transport System, Ltd.

But having many outside directors will not of time. Also in the sales division, having the talent with plenty of room for improvement in terms of the Return (TSR), the Board of Directors first discussed the lead to effective discussions if they don’t say anything or experience in logistics sales in a trading company should consideration for the capital market. However, after Hitachi, underlying basis for the decision-making. they mainly ask questions. However, because the Company bring a whole new perspective.

The Board of capital efficiency? questions are asked now. So, I think it is important for Directors feels proud that it has successfully strengthened Izumoto: While the Board of Directors discusses the outside directors to think regularly about “the fields in the In FY2019, the Company engaged a third-party the Company’s initiatives to appeal its growth strategy to “underlying basis” for the enhancement of awareness of Company they can contribute to” using their expertise and assessor for evaluation of the effectiveness of the the capital market under its supervision. capital efficiency, the Audit Committee ensured to give to express their opinions. As for me, since I became outside Board of Directors for the first time in addition to the I think that our growth strategy has three aspects of “M&As,” instructions to incorporate performance indicators such as director, I’ve made use of my insights acquired over the conventional self-assessment. Please tell us about the “development of new products and services,” and ROIC and total asset turnover ratio in their target years to call the Board’s attention to the two points of “how issues pointed out at the evaluation. “productivity improvement.” And what we should focus on whenever it visited the sites for audit. As a result, to cope with the capital market” and “capital efficiency” in Urano: Various issues were pointed out, but the one pointed should be discussed at the Board of Directors meetings employees on sites are starting to become aware of not every discussion. I think each outside director express their out in both the third-party assessment and the selfbased on the stage the Company is in at that time. The only profit and loss items such as revenues and gross profit opinion in consideration of “how and where I can assessment was “whether the discussions by the Board of Company is currently in the middle of the growth stage and but also balance sheet items such as capital efficiency and contribute” based on the stage the Company is currently in. I Directors really consider all stakeholders.” With the expanding has achieved the growth strategy by “M&As” in the past ten asset turnover ratio. I believe we have produced agree with Ms. Izumoto about the attribute of outside movement toward “stakeholder capitalism” in mind, we will years with revenues increasing more than twofold. We also remarkable results in this regard. directors. Considering the current stage of the Company, it deepen discussions to enhance dialogue with stakeholders made solid progress in the “development of new products Urano: While I value the fact that the Company has is preferable if the majority of the outside directors have by taking advantage of each director’s characteristics such and services” based on 3PL with our new business concept changed so much in four years, I also think we need to work management experiences, and I recognize that as one of that some directors will take care of the capital market and of LOGISTEED starting to be developed.
