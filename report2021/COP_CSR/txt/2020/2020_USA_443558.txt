The cover artwork is made up of actual phrases from a diverse set of stakeholders — from healthcare professionals to consumers to employees — describing how Clorox provided support to them through the global pandemic. LIKE NO OTHER. Dear Stakeholder, There are no words to describe 2020. It’s been a year like none other in modern times. We’re in the midst of a global pandemic that has impacted millions of people, cost hundreds of thousands of lives and caused a deep recession. And a racial and cultural awakening about the pain caused by a long history of racial injustice. Amid this landscape, our essential values have never been more important. >>> BENNO DORER CHAIR AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Consistent with our commitment to Good Growth, we’re proud to have delivered strong results for our shareholders, achieved the right way: +8 % +16 % +170BPS 1.5B $ SALES GROWTH (TOTAL COMPANY) DILUTED EPS INCREASE GROSS MARGIN EXPANSION NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS (+56%) I’d like to focus my letter this year on our values consumers, we continued our commitment and how this confluence of challenging conditions to delivering value to all our stakeholders. has provided the impetus for Clorox to live out our values when it counted most.

And in this year, fueled by our IGNITE strategy, which 1) Protecting the health, safety and well-being of enabled us to serve more communities and our employees. We care deeply about the safety >>> THE CLOROX COMPANY 3 2020 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT HOW WE’RE EXECUTING OUR IGNITE STRATEGY PEOPLE AT THE CENTER Putting people at the center of everything we do — a focus of our IGNITE strategy — was key in enabling us to serve our consumers and communities during the pandemic. In order for our teams to address unprecedented demand for our products, we needed to focus on their safety and well-being. We enhanced benefits for all our teammates, including a $1 million Employee Emergency Relief Fund covering incremental child care and medical expenses and an emergency time-off program to help parents navigate school closures and other absences related to COVID-19. At all our facilities worldwide, we rolled out enhanced infection prevention measures and offered increased pay and special incentives to our on-site teams who continued to make and ship our products during shelter-in-place orders. Based on survey results, 88% of employees felt their health and well-being were top priorities for the company. REIMAGINE WORK Well before circumstances forced us to streamline production in order to meet unprecedented demand, we had started working on ways to simplify our portfolio and focus on what consumers really want. During COVID-19, this work accelerated. Our Cleaning Division reduced the total number of SKUs while increasing overall productivity – making 100 million more disinfecting units in FY20 compared to FY19, a 50% increase.1 1 First half of CY20 versus same period in 2019. REIMAGINE WORK Through technology, work that was once done only in person is now being done remotely. We began managing plant trials using augmented reality glasses, which share data directly to laptops and phones, while communicating with counterparts in the Product Supply Organization using FaceTime. We used modeling and simulation to indicate fill heights for vitamin, mineral and supplement products based on packaging die lines without the need to physically run trials as well as to improve operating efficiency, product quality and capacity at other plants. REIMAGINE WORK Brita’s marketing team reduced turnaround time for new marketing content 55% by shrinking work into small, iterative learning cycles and pushing down decision-making to employees closest to the information. Previously, 12to 18-month plans were developed before execution. Today, the team is breaking planning into smaller increments aligned with specific needs and deliverables, reducing time from planning to execution from 16 weeks to seven weeks. Because planning is now done closer to execution, it’s more responsive and relevant.

This innovation gives consumers more disinfecting power per drop and reduces plastic packaging and water usage in manufacturing, contributing to record cost savings for the year, allowing us to reinvest that money back into the business. FUEL GROWTH We reduced the amount of packaging used for certain multipack options of dry Hidden Valley® Ranch dressing and Fresh Step® cat litter through changes in product offerings, packaging design and manufacturing, saving nearly $3 million. FUEL GROWTH To streamline inventory management, our Product Supply Organization implemented a new supply chain planning platform for our U.S. businesses that offers real-time visibility into supply chain operating conditions and global inventory. Using this data, models and forecasts can be created in real time to determine how plant capacity and raw material supply will impact future operations. As a result, the team generated $2.8 million in cost savings and $5 million in sustained inventory reduction for FY20. FUEL GROWTH Our Product Supply Organization transformed the operations and efficiency of our supply chain by moving to a digital transportation management system. The fully automated system tracks thousands of daily transactions and traces the location of freight moving from our plants to distribution centers and customers in real time. Additionally, the team can now automate scheduling appointments of freight pickups, saving valuable time and resources for carriers and shippers. In total, the new system delivered $2.5 million in cost savings for FY20.

This cross-functional effort creates a platform for growth through standardized processes and systems to enhance the supply chain, strengthen forecasting, and offer a more holistic portfolio of products to promote health and wellness. ENHANCE SHOPPING EXPERIENCES Prior to COVID-19, our e-commerce team laid the groundwork for growth by focusing on creating a frictionless online shopping experience for consumers at each stage of the purchase process — from search to delivery. This growth only accelerated as COVID-19 prompted more consumers to purchase our products online, and as a result e-commerce accounted for 12% of total company sales in FY20 compared to 8% in FY19. ENHANCE SHOPPING EXPERIENCES Our Grilling business focused on standardizing promotional pricing across retailers, so people can continue to trust they’re getting great value for Kingsford® products at any time of the year and any day of the week, regardless of where they shop. BUILD PURPOSE-DRIVEN, PERSONALIZED BRANDS During our COVID-19 response, our Clorox brand purpose — “Champion a cleaner world where everyone thrives” — took on new meaning as we responded to public health needs. We helped get our disinfecting products where they were needed most, like front-line healthcare workers and facilities, and educated consumers on how to use our products effectively and safely. And we partnered with Nextdoor on a “Neighbors Helping Neighbors” program, connecting people who wanted to provide care, such as picking up groceries, medications and other essentials, with those who needed some extra help via the Nextdoor Help Map.

THE CLOROX COMPANY 9 2020 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT HOW WE’RE EXECUTING OUR IGNITE STRATEGY BUILD PURPOSE-DRIVEN, PERSONALIZED BRANDS Our Hidden Valley Ranch brand used artificial intelligence to personalize the consumer experience online and show all the ways ranch flavors can be used in recipes. Consumers received AI engine-predicted recipe recommendations based on past behavior and user profiles, leading to a personalized experience on nearly 50% of total website page views and an 11% increase in recipe views. DELIVER BIGGER, STICKIER INNOVATION PLATFORMS In a year when we delivered successful innovation like Kingsford pellets and Clorox fabric sanitizers— even in the midst of a pandemic — innovation platforms like Clorox Scentiva® cleaning and disinfecting products and Fresh Step Clean Paws® cat litter products also continued to deliver strong growth in their third year after launch. EVOLVE PORTFOLIO In Australia and New Zealand, our Glad® brand launched “Glad to be Green,” a range of sustainable food protection and trash bag products including 50% plant-based bags and wraps, compostable trash bags1 and trash bags made from 95% recycled material.2 The food protection range also uses packaging made from 70% recycled material and is 100% recyclable. Each product has a beginning-of-life or end-of-life benefit, making it a more sustainable option for consumers that delivers on the quality promise of Glad — strength in trash bags and freshness in food protection. 1 Certified home compostable to AS5810 and certified industrial compostable to AS4736. 2 Made from 95% pre-consumer recycled material. EVOLVE PORTFOLIO We created a new cross-functional team called Out of Home to help large, global companies improve their daily disinfection protocols for the health and well-being of their employees and consumers as they reopen for business. Partnerships with United Airlines, Uber Technologies and AMC Theatres were announced this year. We also agreed to a formal collaboration with one of the most respected names in healthcare, Cleveland Clinic, to help support public health and help people feel safer in public spaces through educational and other initiatives for businesses and industries. THE CLOROX COMPANY 10 2020 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT HOW WE’RE EXECUTING OUR IGNITE STRATEGY PLANET: CLIMATE STEWARDSHIP We signed a 12-year, 70-megawatt virtual power purchase agreement with Enel Green Power for the purchase of renewable energy beginning in 2021. This VPPA represents about half of our 100% renewable electricity goal for our operations in the U.S. and Canada and is expected to help us accelerate achieving this goal in 2021, four years ahead of our original plan. Photo courtesy of Enel Green Power. PLANET: CLIMATE STEWARDSHIP We’ve committed to setting and achieving science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our operations (Scope 1 and 2) and across our value chain (Scope 3). These reduction targets ensure our plans for carbon reduction are in line with the latest climate science and the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. PLANET: PLASTIC AND OTHER WASTE The company signed the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, which sets a vision of a circular economy for plastic. As part of our signatory status, we pledged aggressive plastic waste reduction and other packaging goals, including a 50% combined reduction in virgin plastic and fiber packaging by 2030. Bleach compaction — a conversion process that went forward despite the pandemic, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability — and a move to 100% recycled fiber cartons in Glad are projected to contribute approximately 15% of our reduction target. PLANET: PLASTIC AND OTHER WASTE More sustainable product options were introduced, including a concentrated Clorox bleach formula offering superior performance with less waste and Clorox compostable cleaning wipes that have passed third-party tests to be composted at commercial facilities or at home while still offering the convenience of a wipe. Concentrated bleach will save more than $3.2 million in annual transportation costs — the equivalent of eliminating 6,200 truckloads per year — and reduce water use in the manufacturing process by 23 million gallons per year while making our product easier for people to use. THE CLOROX COMPANY 11 2020 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT HOW WE’RE EXECUTING OUR IGNITE STRATEGY PLANET: PLASTIC AND OTHER WASTE We continue to pilot refill models of our consumer products. The Glad brand introduced food bags that can be recycled in a reusable steel container and return pouch through TerraCycle’s Loop program, expanding our product offerings on this platform beyond Clorox disinfecting wipes. We also began test marketing a Clorox concentrated spray reusable cleaning system that could minimize the packaging and transportation footprints associated with a reduction in water and a refillable spray bottle. PRODUCT: TRANSPARENCY COMMITMENTS We transitioned ingredient listings for our U.S. cleaning products to the online industry portal SmartLabel, where users will now find ingredient information as well as directions for use and safety data sheets. We also announced a commitment to voluntarily list ingredients on the labels of our household disinfecting products, which goes above and beyond the labeling law requirement that will take effect in 2021. PEOPLE: EMPLOYEES We continued to invest in our No. 1 resource — our people — through wellness initiatives, including enhanced benefits to support our employees’ total well-being and goals that support their physical, social, professional and financial well-being, including employee safety, inclusion and engagement in the workplace, gender and ethnic minority representation, and retirement readiness. PEOPLE: EMPLOYEES We continued to invest in leadership training and development for managers to attract, develop and engage our workforce. The work involved ongoing support for hundreds of Clorox leaders through a global, 100% virtual management development program aimed at building stronger managers and teams. This award-winning program features discussions with senior leaders, virtual practice labs, social learning communities and coaching, with particular emphasis on inclusive leadership and mitigating unconscious bias. PEOPLE: CONSUMERS To enhance consumer well-being, we increased the number of our wellness-related product categories in U.S. homes by 6.5 million compared to fiscal year 2019, leveraging the power of our portfolio of natural personal care; vitamins, minerals and supplements; water filtration and hydration; and cleaning brands to promote health and wellness.

THE CLOROX COMPANY 25 2020 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT CLEAR PRIORITIES FOR A DEFINING MOMENT This is such an important time to be CEO of The Clorox Company. It is the challenge and opportunity of a lifetime. And it is an honor to take over from Benno Dorer and work to fulfill the legacy of great Clorox CEOs. We are facing an incredibly difficult moment in the U.S. and around the world. We know that people are counting on all of our products, and particularly our disinfectants. My No. 1 priority this year is to get more of our disinfecting products into homes and healthcare facilities so we can help people through this health crisis and beyond it. As a health and wellness company, we take this responsibility very seriously. Our IGNITE strategy helped drive our agility during COVID-19 and will set us up for success in the future. I have three priorities moving forward: 1) Maximizing the Supply of Our Disinfecting Products to ensure that all people have access to them. We don’t know what turns this pandemic will take or what lies in the distance, but I have a singular focus on applying all resources necessary to bring our products to people and communities. 2) Living Our Values by continuing to put people at the center of everything we do. We will lean into this through the culture we create with our own employee base. We recognize the importance of building an even more diverse and inclusive workforce. And that diverse thinking will influence our external actions. 3) Accelerating Our Impact in the world as a company. We will be on “100% offense” to make that happen. We recognize the magnitude of the moment and will leverage our brands and corporate resources to help people adjust to the rapidly changing and challenged world around them. That is Good Growth at its core. Our IGNITE strategy will drive innovation by employing superior insights about rising consumer expectations and deploying rapidly advancing technology to earn long-term loyalty among our stakeholders. And our ESG commitments will guide how we show up for people and society. None of this can be accomplished without the remarkable team we have at Clorox. All of us are committed to making a difference for people every day with our brands, support of our communities and mission of Good Growth.

Our report included a paragraph emphasizing that The Clorox Company changed its method of accounting for leases, effective July 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 and for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020 (presented on pages 30 through 34) is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of The Clorox Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated August 13, 2020 (not presented separately herein) expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. San Francisco, CA August 13, 2020 THE CLOROX COMPANY 35 2020 INTEGRATED ANNUAL REPORT Auditor STATEMENT REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON REVIEW OF NONFINANCIAL INFORMATION To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Clorox Company We have reviewed the schedule of selected quantitative performance indicators (the “Subject Matter”) included in Exhibit A and as identified by the “ ” symbol presented in The Clorox Company’s (“Clorox” or “the Company”) Annual Report (the “Report”) for the year ended December 31, 2019 or June 30, 2020, in accordance with the criteria also set forth in Exhibit A (the “Criteria”). We did not review all information included in the Report. We did not review the narrative sections of the Report, except where they incorporated the Subject Matter. The Clorox Company’s management is responsible for the Subject Matter included in Exhibit A and as also presented in the Report, in accordance with the Criteria. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject Matter based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ((AICPA) AT-C section 105, Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements, and AT-C section 210, Review Engagements). Those standards require that we plan and perform our review to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Subject Matter in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria. A review consists principally of applying analytical procedures, making inquiries of persons responsible for the subject matter, obtaining an understanding of the data management systems and processes used to generate, aggregate and report the Subject Matter and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter is in accordance with the Criteria, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. A review also does not provide assurance that we became aware of all significant matters that would be disclosed in an examination. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion. In performing our review, we have also complied with the independence and other ethical requirements set forth in the Code of Professional Conduct and applied the Statements on Quality Control Standards established by the AICPA. As described in Exhibit A, the Subject Matter is subject to measurement uncertainties resulting from limitations inherent in the nature and the methods used for determining such data. The selection of different but acceptable measurement techniques can result in materially different measurements. The precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the selected quantitative performance indicators for the year ended December 31, 2019 or June 30, 2020 in order for it to be in accordance with the Criteria.

The primary risks and opportunities associated with climate opportunities change the company is exposed to and managing include: • Physical risks associated with extreme weather conditions or water stress due to climate change impacting our business operations, disrupting our supply chain, limiting our access to water, or impacting commodity, operational and distribution costs • Transitional risks associated with policy and regulations that increase the pricing on GHG emissions • Transitional risks and opportunities associated with shifts in market preferences as consumers seek products from companies that are proactively working to reduce their climate change-related impacts and offering less carbon intensive product solutions • Transitional opportunity associated with reduced operating and product costs resulting from resource efficiency improvements associated with climate related actions to reduce energy use, water use, waste and material use See CDP Climate Change Report Section C2 See CDP Water Security Report Section W4 Impact of climate risks and Climate risks and opportunities that might impact our business strategy include: opportunities on businesses, • Consumer demand for products with lower environmental footprints growing faster than we have allowed for in our innovation investment planning – this is both an opportunity for our low environmental strategy and financial impact products, and a risk if we cannot meet demand planning • Acceleration of infectious disease and pandemics associated with warmer climates, increasing global demand for disinfecting products and solutions in consumer and business-to-business markets — this is both an opportunity given our leadership in disinfection and a risk if we cannot meet demand or sufficiently innovate to meet particular consumer needs • Low carbon energy sources and material supply chains that cannot keep up with growing industry demand, driving up costs or limiting our ability to meet our environmental commitments or bring sustainable innovation to market • More frequent and extreme weather events causing supply chain disruption and leading to health and sanitation issues due to flooding and property damage. This is both an opportunity and a risk given the potential impact on supply chains but potential increase in demand for our disinfection and other household products. • More severe and geographically dispersed water stress causing supply chain disruption • Faster adoption of climate change regulation that might increase our costs See CDP Climate Change Report Section C3 Risk Process for identifying and Clorox identifies opportunities and potential physical, regulatory, reputational, changing consumer trends/awareness and any other risk factors associated with climate change, GHG emissions, energy consumpManagement managing climate risks tion and water consumption. This is done at the corporate level with the cross-functional ESG & Sustainability team and cascaded to various internal stakeholders, business and functional units as appropriate. The Clorox Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Steering Committee, consisting of senior leaders across the organization, was established to provide a sustainable framework to proactively identify, understand, assess, prioritize, articulate and continuously manage risks, both existing and emerging, across the entire organization, including climate risks. The ERM office reports directly to the company Board of Directors and provides the Board key ERM updates. See CDP Climate Change Report Section C2 Integration of climate risk In order to mitigate the risks associated with climate change, Clorox has identified Climate Stewardship as a key ESG priority integrated into the company’s IGNITE business strategy, building on the progress it has management into company’s achieved in reducing the carbon footprint of its operations and products for more than 10 years. Through IGNITE, the company has committed to taking science-based climate action across its value chain, including overall risk management opportunities in its operations, products and supply chains. Actions include compaction and other material reduction innovations to reduce material, water, and transportation footprints of its products, renewable energy procurement for its operations, and supply chain engagement informed by life cycle analyses to identify and address its material upstream carbon and water footprints, as well as impacts of products during consumer use and at the end of life. Life cycle analyses are also employed to inform new packaging design to ensure sustainability tradeoffs are considered during the development and commercialization of new products. For instance plastic packaging is often lighter weight to ship and requires less energy to produce than glass or metal but has different recyclability and end-of-life considerations. To accelerate progress, we have established a Sustainability Center responsible for defining, driving and tracking progress against Clorox’s environmental sustainability strategy.
