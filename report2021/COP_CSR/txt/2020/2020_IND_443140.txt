Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in certain forms of very early-stage nerve cells, most often found in an embryo or foetus (the term 'neuro' refers to nerves while 'blastoma' refers to a cancer that affects immature or developing cells). This type of cancer occurs most often in infants and young children. It is rare in children older than 10 years (source: American Cancer Society). Actions: As with many rare diseases, there are few treatment options, and left untreated, the prognosis for these young children is poor. In response to the needs of patients, their families and the Neuroblastoma community in its entirety, Jubilant Radiopharma has been consistently and reliably providing therapeutic 131I-mIBG to hundreds of patients, under an Investigational New Drug (IND) program approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and for other select Investigational Clinical Trials since 2007. Future Plans: Typically administered by trained Nuclear Medicine Specialists in institutions equipped to provide this special treatment, 131I-mIBG is actually the combination of two drugs. The mIBG drug concentrates in neuroblastoma cells. The beta emitting isotope 131I-[Iodine] that is tagged to the mIBG delivers targeted radiation to the neuroblastoma cells. This type of radiation is designed to destroy the tumours cells while sparing normal, healthy tissue. Based on the positive outcomes of these initial programs, Jubilant Radiopharma in collaboration with key pediatric Oncologists, the National Institute of Health (NIH), selected Children’s hospitals, academic centers and Neuroblastoma research consortiums (COG and NANT), plans to further advance its therapeutic 131I-mIBG program with the USFDA. Jubilant Radiopharma is committed to improving lives through nuclear medicine and making a positive impact on the lives of patients and families faced with this challenging paediatric cancer. Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities Jubilant prohibits any form of discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, caste, sex, religion or any other ground at workplace. Equal remuneration is provided to the male and female members of the workforce for the similar set of work. Jubilant is a signatory to the CII Code of Conduct on Affirmative Action that reconfirms the Company’s commitment to equal opportunity in employment for all sections of society. Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities The SDGs have talked about making human settlements inclusive and sustainable. The Company through JBF is implementing the projects which are sustainable and inclusive. The company believes in sustainable development, which we interpret as growing our business while meeting the legitimate concerns of our stakeholders. Jubilant takes a proactive role in empowering local communities to improve their quality of life so as to achieve the goal of inclusive growth. The Company’s CSR projects/programmes are designed in such a way where the community is involved from the planning to impact assessment level. The community shares human capital as well as various other resources in terms of land and cost of additional infrastructure development. 33 | P a g e Since the selected community programs are based near our manufacturing locations, our involvement in the community initiatives will be for a long tenure. However, we have a focused approach of developing the projects in self-sustainable model. Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Environment, Occupational Health & Safety (EHS) Policy, Responsible Care Policy, Energy Policy and the Climate Change Mitigation Policy set the overall direction of the Company’s commitment towards achieving environment performance excellence. In addition, the Company has also adopted and communicated Green Supply Chain Policy to its suppliers, expecting them to be sensitive towards environment. The Company submits annual report against Key Performance Indicators (KPI) to Indian Chemical Council (ICC), which is a member of International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA). Our LSI plants and Corporate Office in India has been issued RC Logo by ICC. Our Gajraula & Bharuch site along with corporate office have been certified by DNV-GL for successful implementation of RC 14001:2015 based Responsible Care Management System following the American Chemistry Council (ACC) standards. Plan was also rolled out to implement this across all other Life Science Ingredients (LSI) business plants in India. To remain cost competitive, Jubilant always practices efficient use of quality materials in its processes. The Company utilizes molasses as its key raw material which is biogenic in nature. Other major raw materials are alcohol and process chemicals. Molasses (by-products from sugar industries) and corn cob are renewable in nature and constitute over 42% of the total major raw material consumption. Process chemicals like solvents are recovered and recycled wherever possible. Goal 13: Climate Action Climate Change and its impact is now very much evident and is a global phenomenon and our company is no exception to this. Jubilant understands the damage potential Climate Change can bring to our businesses with respect to natural resources like water and agro-based raw materials like molasses. To be a partner to this global drive for climate action the Company is striving to reduce its carbon footprint in all possible means. Growing cost of energy and its linkage with climate change impact is a major business concern at Jubilant like any other industry. To tackle this issue, Jubilant has decided to focus on improving process energy efficiency, find alternate sources of uninterrupted low cost energy and increasing the percentage of renewable energy in present energy mix. Bio-mass, biogas, bio-diesel and solar energy are the key renewable energy sources in the overall energy mix of the Company. It has invested significantly to generate energy from its distillery effluent in the form of Bio-gas, fired in the process furnaces. The Company is also monitoring and reporting its GHG emission regularly. Jubilant is one of the few companies in India disclosing GHG emissions and taking voluntary reduction initiatives by participating in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), which is holding the largest database of primary corporate climate change information in the world. In the reporting year, our total GHG emissions (Scope 1 & 2) increased by 9.6% with respect to the previous year, (from 966371 tCO2e to 1058993 tCO2e). However, the specific GHG emission of our Life Science Ingredient (LSI) business reduced by 15.1% against set target of 12% by 2020. From FY 2016-17, we have started to capture Scope 3 GHG emission, in absolute term, arising out of our raw material and finished goods transportation. To start with, we have calculated total GHG from complete domestic logistics (Inbound and 34 | P a g e Outbound) of Life Science Ingredient (LSI) business. During FY 2019-20 total Scope 3 GHG emission due to LSI business increased to 17116 tCO2e from 16126 tCO2e during 2018-19, while specific emission (in gm CO2e/ tonne km) improved from 36.43 during last year to 34.87 during reporting year (FY 2019-20). The Company conducted life cycle based carbon footprint studies by a reputed external agency during FY 2011-12. The study was conducted on 15 key products of the Company using the cradle to gate approach. Goal 14: Life below Water Global demand for water will exceed supply by 40% by 2030. Business will be subjected to water shortages, water quality decline and water price volatility. Being a Life Sciences company, we are dependent on water for many of our manufacturing processes. At the same time, we also deeply understand how critical this natural resource is to human life and ecosystems. Jubilant is continuously monitoring, reviewing & optimizing water consumption through process modification and adoption of new technologies. The Company strives to recycle back usable water from the effluents after treatment in order to reduce fresh water consumption. Most of our Indian manufacturing facilities are zero liquid discharge. In addition to process modification, site management has also put in place the best available effluent treatment technologies for better recycling and reuse. Further, the Company has also implemented rainwater harvesting structures at several locations to support to water conservation. Goal 15: Life on Land No species listed in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and National Conservation List was found to exist in or near the manufacturing operations of the Company. Most of our manufacturing facilities are located outside biodiversity sensitive or notified protected areas. Therefore, there is no such case of habitats significantly affected by discharges of water and runoff from Jubilant.
