These are published in the Federal Gazette Bundesanzeiger (www.bundesanzeiger.de). Enter FAI as a search term.

The Executive Board is responsible for all decisions regarding economic, environmental and social impacts. 102-46 Defining report content and topic boundaries In order to define the material aspects and boundaries of the report, we used as a foundation the quick check of the sustainability software 360report. In the first step, we evaluated the data base in the GRI stakeholder survey of the sector air transportation (primarily passenger air transportation), in order to take the size of FAI rent-a-jet AG into account. In the second step, we adapted the materiality matrix using an initial selection of indicators and aspects. This adaption as well as the selection of relevant indicators are based on the contribution of the Executive Assistant to Chairman and were carried out in consultation with Members of the Board. It was done in close collaboration with the staff of Human Resources, Operations, Accounting as well as other staff members. Aspects and indicators, whose materiality was classified as low or very low and were not taken into consideration in this report. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2019 17 102-47 List of essential topics (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 102-48 Restatements of information Our organization has previously reported on sustainability issues. FAI-rent-a-jet AG has published a sustainability report in previous years. As this report becomes more detailed, we comply with this. 102-49 Changes in reporting In comparison to the previous Sustainability Report there have been no changes in the scope of report of material topics and topic boundaries. Please also refer to 102-48 102-50 Reporting period The information shown in the report covers the fiscal year from Jan 1, 2019 to Dec 31, 2019. 102-51 Date of most recent report The last Sustainability Report was published 2019 for 2018. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2019 18 102-52 Reporting cycle Our report is published at periods of one year. 102-54 Claims of reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. 102-56 External assurance The sustainability report has not and will not been externally audited. GRI 200: ECONOMIC GRI 201: Economic Performance (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 201-1 Direct economic value generated and distributed For determining taxable income our Company uses accruals-based accounting method recorded as revenue and expenditures in the income statement. As a result of the internal data management system previously used, the economic business figures required by GRI were not yet available in this format. We will adjust the system to be able to generate these business figures in the near future in the appropriate format. The EVG&D cannot be allocated by national, regional or market level. The reason being that the percentage of local supply options depend on routes flown in the air and therefore fluctuates significantly in order to be able to report fixed percentages. 201-2 Financial implications and other risks and opportunities due to climate change We have not yet verified the risks of natural disasters due to climate change for our business activities. We assume no strong hazard due to our geographical location. FAI rent-a-jet AG does not operate in the classic energy-intensive industries, however, ranks among a growing sector with raising greenhouse gas emissions: Air-transport CO2-regulations apply for all aircraft operators according to European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) for intra-European Economic Area (EEA) flights. Due to the Stopping the Clock-decision for international flights from/to the EEA, the EU-ETS is temporarily suspended until the international Civil Aviation Organization ICAO shall have developed and adopted a global model for the regulation of international aviation emissions. However, we are affected indirectly by climate changes, as we have to pay for higher energy and raw material prices, which in turn result in higher demands on energy management. Nevertheless, we have a CO2 strategy, which is explained in more depth in the environment section of this report. We are unable to provide information on a systematic and database-supported analysis of the financial consequences of climate change. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2019 19 201-3 Defined benefit plan obligations and other retirement plans Our organization does not have an occupational pension provision for employees.

It provides instructions, policies and procedures to combat corruption. 205-3 Confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken During the reporting period there were no incidents of corruption in our organization. GRI 206: Anti-competitive Behaviour (in ref. to GRI Standard 2016) 206-1 Legal actions for anti-competitive behaviour, anti-trust, and monopoly practices In the reporting period, our organization was involved in zero legal actions due to anti-competitive behaviour or violations of antitrust law.

FAI rent-a-jet AG is one of the leading providers of air ambulance and VIP charter services worldwide. The supply of services we offer is surely an exposure for the biodiversity in the nearby protected areas. Although we try our best to minimize the environmental damage, we will not be able to avoid it completely. We can't do much against the turbine exhausts our aircrafts produce, for patients must be brought home and pilots must absolve their training flights. But we do have other methods to save the environment like producing our own electricity, waste separation or investing in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Our headquarters in Nuremberg are carbon neutral. There are no apparent dangers to the biodiversity for the locations listed in Table 25. 304-3 Habitats protected or restored Our organization was not involved in rehabilitation, renaturalization or protection of areas.

The Hamzali Hydroelectric Power Plant climate protection project, which is under the responsibility of the General Directorate of State Hydrolic Works (DSI), is located in Kizilirmak, Turkey's longest river, in Ankara and Kirikkale provinces. As part of the climate protection project, a run-of-river hydropower plant was built which uses the difference in altitude of geography to generate electricity. There are two generators with a capacity of 16.7 megawatts, which generate about 127 gigawatt of electricity per year. This increases the share of hydro energy at the expense of electricity from fossil fuels. Previously projects in Mali and Turkey (Gold Standards as well), were chosen for our contribution from 2013 to 2018. ______________________________________________________________________________________ FAI Sustainability Report 2019 28 305-6 Emissions of ozone-depleting substances (ODS) At FAI rent-a-jet AG we do not produce, import or export ozone-depleting substances. 305-7 Nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx) and other significant air emissions Our organization emits significant air emissions.
