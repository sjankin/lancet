This report concerns the SL Group as a whole. The report also comprises Färdtjänsten (the mobility service), a supplementary service for people who are unable to travel by public transport. People with a mobility allowance travel free of charge with SL’s transport services and with Waxholmsbolaget’s vessels. 11,000 mobility and medical journeys are made every day, and the mobility service comprises approximately 10 per cent of all the CO2 equivalents emitted by vehicles in the county’s general and specialised public transport sector. Since the Public Transport Administration in Stockholm is the organisation behind the brands AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), Waxholmsbolaget (WÅAB), Färdtjänsten and the Stockholm Transport Museum, managing and coordinating the operations conducted under these brands, the organisation name used in the rest of this report is the Public Transport Administration. Since May of 2009, the Public Transport Administration, through AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, is a member of the United Nations Global Compact sustainability initiative, and the administration has thereby committed to following its ten principles within the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The Public Transport Administration has been making active efforts within these areas for several years by setting short and long-term goals within all areas and integrating them in the day-to-day operations. The ten principles also set the direction for the sustainability efforts.

Administration’s sustainability work in 2019. Since May of 2009, the Public Transport Administration, through AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, is a member of the United Nations Global Compact sustainability initiative, and the administration has thereby committed to following its ten principles within the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. The Public Transport Administration has been making active efforts within these areas for several years by setting short and long-term goals within all areas and integrating them in the day-to-day operations. The ten principles also set the direction for the sustainability efforts. As the MD of Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL) and the Head of the Public Transport Administration, I would like to express our continued support for UN Global Compact and its ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. We will also continue to work actively with these areas within our operations and together with our stakeholders. Sara Catoni Acting Head of the Public Transport Administration Stockholm, 11 November 2019 17/03/2020 6(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 2 Mission: To make everyday life easier for everyone using public transport 2.1 Areas of responsibility The Public Transport Administration is the operation behind the brands AB Storstockholms Lokaltrafik (SL), Waxholmsbolaget (WÅAB), Färdtjänsten and the Stockholm Transport Museum. SL is the umbrella brand for all public transport in Greater Stockholm. Waxholmsbolaget operates public transport services at sea and Färdtjänsten (the mobility service) is a supplementary service for people who are unable to travel by public transport. The Stockholm Transport Museum houses the history of public transport, which attracts around 100,000 visitors each year. Since the Public Transport Administration manages transport contracts and is responsible for the operations conducted within these brands, the organisation name used in the rest of this report is the Public Transport Administration, which comprises SL, Waxholmsbolaget, Färdtjänsten and the Stockholm Transport Museum. Figur 1. The Public Transport Administration service brands 2.2 Mission statement Based on Region Stockholm’s requirements and the expectations of its stakeholders, the Public Transport Administration is to propose and implement regional public transport solutions that facilitate commuting to work and makes everyday life easier for residents and visitors in the Stockholm region. 2.3 Vision and values The Public Transport Administration is working from the County Council’s overall vision and values. The vision is an attractive, sustainable and growing Stockholm region, with freedom for residents to shape their own lives and make essential decisions. The values state that the county council’s work shall be 17/03/2020 7(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 characterised by Cooperation, Reliability, Openness and Competence. All departments and companies must define the meaning of these values for their individual operation. 2.4 Political management, funding and control The Public Transport Administration is an administrative organisation under the Transport Committee of Region Stockholm. The members of the Transport Committee are appointed by the Regional Council. The Public Transport Administration has the overall responsibility for the general and special public transport services in Stockholm County – on land and at sea. Region Stockholm’s regional public transport programme sets the goals, visions, direction and scope of public transport services. The regional public transport programme is determined by the Regional Council, which ultimately controls the Public Transport Administration’s operations. The public transport services and the associated construction contracts are carried out by companies following competitive procurement. The procured public transport services and construction projects are partly funded by regional taxes (county council tax), and partly by revenues from ticket sales, advertising space and leasing of premises connected to public transport. Procured transport contractors, suppliers and contracts are regularly inspected and monitored. Read more about contract follow-up on page 19. An international framework for internal audit is implemented to monitor and inspect the Public Transport Administration’s own operations. Internal audit is a process in which the board, management and other staff cooperate and follow up to ensure that the operational goals are attained in regard to: • Appropriate, cost-efficient and safe operations. • Reliable economic as well as financial reporting and information. • Compliance with applicable laws, ordinances and internal regulations. 2.5 The County Council becomes Region Stockholm On 1 January 2019, the country council assumed the responsibility for the regional development from the county administrative board. This gave the county council an extended commission involving issues relating to growth, transports and infrastructure. In conjunction with the extended regional responsibility, Stockholm County Council was reformed as a region, changing its name to Region Stockholm. 17/03/2020 8(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 3 Shared values – the foundation of our work A value-based leadership is one of the region’s four leadership criteria. All of the region’s operations are governed and managed based on the common vision, goals and shared values decided by the city council: Cooperation, Reliability, Openness and Competence. Employees and managers have shown great commitment to describing the importance of each key value for the operations and work of the Public Transport Administration. The result is the Public Transport Administration’s own descriptions of the key values. Description of the key values is a condition for the administration to live and lead according to the values. Table 1. Interpretation of the key values Cooperation Reliability We cooperate and help one another We explain what challenges we face We answer questions We take responsibility for our work We include everyone needed We trust each other We make the best of everyone’s competence We recognise when we are wrong We recognise where we have failed Openness Competence We acknowledge one another with a greeting We exchange knowledge internally and or a smile externally We speak to one another, not about one another We work towards the same goals We listen to one another We are confident in setting a course We are inviting in both operations and dialogue We are well-read and prepared when making We share information decisions 3.1 Value work Our key values describe how the employees of the Public Transport Administration work together and how decisions are made to attain the shared goals. They provide guidance when the Public Transport Administration develops the public transport and traffic solutions of tomorrow, and in our management of infrastructure. Shared values also help to attract new employees. Clear core values and a good working environment are highly valued when choosing an employer, and they also contribute to employees choosing to stay. Continuous efforts are being made to ensure compliance with the key values, so that they permeate our daily behaviours. The key values and their importance to 17/03/2020 9(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 the joint efforts have been brought up at several employee information meetings and management meetings. 4 Collaboration with stakeholders Collaboration with other actors in the county is essential for the Public Transport Administration to reach the goals established in the regional public transport programme, and the year 2019 has been characterised by increased focus on collaboration with several of the main stakeholders. 5 Sustainable public transport in a growing Stockholm 5.1 Sustainable development as a concept The Public Transport Administration, and Region Stockholm as a whole, uses a definition of sustainable development that relates to ensuring good living conditions for all people, now and in the future. People are at the centre, the ecosystem sets the framework, and a healthy economy is a prerequisite and a means to sustainable development. Figure 2. Social sustainability is the goal, the ecosystem sets the framework and the economy is a means and a prerequisite of sustainable development For the Public Transport Administration, this is primarily a matter of ensuring that the residents of the county have access to a functioning and sustainable public transport system. Stockholm is growing fast, which increases the load on all parts of the transport system in the county. The Public Transport Administration is making large investments into public transport to ensure that the work with sustainable travel is a priority and to promote a sustainable development of the Stockholm Region. One of the most important indicators in this regard is that the proportion of residents travelling by public transport increases. 17/03/2020 10(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Table 2. Targets for public transport market share of motorised travel Basline year (2015)* Goal 2020 Goal 2030 Market share 49 % 51.5 % 54 % *Report on travel habits in Stockholm County 2015, travel habits were also surveyed in 2019.

Development of public transport travel over time, number of travellers on a regular winter’s day (thousands). A measurement used to assess the need for public transport and which includes the statistics on average numbers during the spring, autumn and winter. 5.1.1 Social sustainability Human rights are fundamental to a sustainable operation. Several of the United Nations (UN) global sustainable development goals indicate what the concept of social sustainability entails. Social sustainability relates to people’s living conditions in society, including health, security, education, justice and autonomy, as well as their possibilities to improve these aspects. In addition to the individual perspective, the concept also relates to different people’s capacity to affect these living conditions. There are many aspects to social sustainability, which are of varying importance in different contexts. Aspects of social sustainability such as democracy, anti-discrimination, public health, equality, gender equality, diversity, accessibility for people with disabilities, trust and security are of particular importance in social planning, in which the Public Transport Administration plays a major role. In this report, social sustainability is divided into two segments: human rights and employer responsibility. Within the area of human rights, the Public Transport Administration is primarily working with accessibility, security, equality and gender equality. When it comes to the area employer responsibility, 17/03/2020 11(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 the main focus of the Public Transport Administration is to be an attractive employer that takes responsibility for all its employees. This involves working systematically and proactively with work environment issues. 5.1.2 Environmental sustainability Environmental sustainability, which in many contexts is also referred to as ecological sustainability, is usually described to provide the foundation for the two other sustainability components. It relates to the Earth’s ecosystem and how to maintain its essential functions in the long term, such as the production of food and energy, provision of clean water, climate control and recreation. The County Council has determined that the efforts towards environmental and ecological sustainability within public transport are to be based on the environmental objectives set out in the regional public transport programme and in the county council environmental programme. The environmental sustainability of the Public Transport Administration is reported based on the goal of having more people choose public transport. In addition, measures are reported within the areas of fuel consumption, energy consumption, material consumption and noise. 5.1.3 Economic sustainability There are several possible definitions of economic sustainability. A generally accepted definition describes the concept as follows: “An economic development that does not entail any negative impact on ecological or social sustainability. An increase in economic capital must thus not be at the expense of a reduction in natural capital or social capital.” For the Public Transport Administration as a social player, economic sustainability, in brief, is the saving of resources while creating the greatest possible social benefit with the economic means available to the county council, and to ensure that these are distributed fairly. 17/03/2020 12(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 5.2 Goals and policy documents within sustainability Figure 4. Policy documents for sustainability work within the Public Transport Administration Translation: Regional development plan, Regional Public Transport Programme, Strategies, Guidelines 5.2.1 The Regional Development Plan for the Stockholm Region (RUFS) The development plan of the Stockholm Region has been produced in collaboration between a large number of actors in the region, and it is an expression of their shared intentions for the region’s development up until 2050. The vision is to become Europe’s most attractive metropolitan region to live and operate in. As a responsible European capital region, the Stockholm Region also contributes to sustainable development globally. Through its goals, targets and regional priorities, the policy places the residents of the region and the surrounding communities in focus, with the ecosystem and the planetary limits as a framework and the economic development as both a resource and a prerequisite. General goals for RUFS 2050: • An accessible region with a good living environment • An open, equal and inclusive region. • A leading growth and knowledge region • A resource-efficient and resilient region without climate emissions 5.2.2 Regional Public Transport Programme The regional public transport programme is based on the Stockholm Region’s development plan and is the most important regional policy document in regard to public transport development. The most recently established programme came into force in 2017. The aim of the programme is to establish the shared and long-term goals for the public transport up until 2030, which all actors in the county shall strive to achieve. It includes public transport arranged by SL as well as by commercial actors, and concerns all forms of transport, including bus and rail transport as well as the mobility service and public transport on water. The regional public transport programme has three overall goals: • Increased travel on public transport 17/03/2020 13(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 • A smart public transport system • An attractive region Figure 5. Goals and focus areas of the regional public transport programme Translation: From left to right, outside – in: Competitive Safe Accessible Green Secure Resource efficient Reliable Cohesive Growth-generating Increased travel by public transport Smart public transport system Attractive region Based on the UN’s sustainable development goals set out in the 2030 Agenda, a sustainability analysis of the regional public transport programme has been conducted. The analysis considered environmental, economic and social sustainability. The analysis showed that all goals and indicators in the regional public transport programme contribute to the fulfilment of at least one of the UN’s sustainable development goals. This is a confirmation that sustainability is truly integrated and present throughout the programme, which increases its legitimacy. Goals relating to public transport travel tie into the expected population increase in the country (from today’s 2.2 million to 2.9 million in 2030), which requires the public transport system to develop at the same rate. The transport system must also be planned so that public transport travel is promoted over the 17/03/2020 14(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 use of private cars. The public transport sector is to be competitive, secure and accessible. Goals relating to a smart public transport system aim for the public transport system to develop in a manner that economises on societal resources. The public transport system is to be environmentally adapted, safe and resource efficient. Goals regarding an attractive region relate to the public transport system’s role in increasing equality and gender equality in the county by creating access to employment, service and leisure activities based on different needs and occupations. The focus area is a reliable, cohesive and growth-promoting system. 5.2.3 Environmental Programme Region Stockholm’s (Stockholm County Council) Environmental Programme 2017–2021 is the seventh of its kind, illustrating that the political leadership of the county has prioritised a systematic and ambitious environmental effort for several years. The environmental programme includes environmental objectives for the public transport sector up until 2021. The goals of the environmental programme are in harmony with the regional public transport programme, and together, these two documents ensure a uniform environmental policy in the short and long term. 5.2.4 Strategies The Public Transport Administration has six strategies for the regional public transport system in Stockholm County. These strategies express forwardlooking principles for how the development of the public transport system will take the direction of the established goals. The six strategies are: • Transport Strategy • Business Strategy • Infrastructure Strategy • Communication Strategy • Customer Service Strategy • Sustainable Development Strategy The Sustainable Development Strategy describes the overall principles behind the choices that need to be made in the work to develop the public transport system towards the sustainability goals set out in the regional public transport programme and in other policy documents. Principle 2 in the Sustainable Development Strategy implements the precautionary principle expressed in the Environmental Code and UN Global Compact. 17/03/2020 15(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Strategic principles established in the Sustainable Development Strategy: 1. The goals and requirements of the Public Transport Administration in regard to environment, health and social responsibility must be taken into consideration in all steps of the business process. 2. The Public Transport Administration shall prevent and reduce negative impact on human health and the environment. 3. The Public Transport Administration shall prevent and reduce unnecessary resource consumption. 4. The Public Transport Administration’s noise and vibration requirements must be complied with in all decisions regarding infrastructure or transport. Measures regarding noise in the existing environment shall be taken in the department’s established order of priority. 5. The Public Transport Administration shall only use electricity from renewable sources and replace fossil fuels with renewable fuel. Fuels produced from waste shall be prioritised. 6. The Public Transport Administration’s requirements and goals regarding energy efficiency shall be considered and described ahead of all construction, reconstruction and expansion, as well as when purchasing new vehicles and vessels. 7. The Public Transport Administration shall systematically promote social responsibility in accordance with international conventions. 8. The Public Transport Administration shall consider the conditions and needs of various groups in the public transport system, in order to contribute to increased equality and gender equality in the region. 5.2.5 The region’s shared guidelines within the sustainability area In cases where the Public Transport Administration has not established more advanced guidelines of its own within a specific area, the region’s shared guidelines are applied. The shared guidelines listed below constitute the points of departure for the Public Transport Administration’s guidelines. The documents can be downloaded from www.sll.se • Gender equality policy • LGBT policy • Policy for the inclusion of persons with functional disabilities. • Public health policy • Purchasing policy • Code of conduct for Region Stockholm • Code of conduct for suppliers • Action plan regarding national • minorities 17/03/2020 16(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 • Action plan for work with the • Convention on the Rights of the Child • HR policy • Collaboration agreements on working environment and co-determination • Guidelines for anti-corruption and representation • Investment guidelines In 2019, the Regional Management has initiated the development of a sustainability policy. The goal is for the region to have a modern policy to base its actions on. The intention is for the new sustainability policy to replace a number of the policies listed above. 5.2.6 Area-specific guidelines for the Public Transport Administration In order to ensure equal methods based on the established strategies, guidelines have been developed within a number of different areas, including energy (Guidelines on Environment and Energy, Guidelines on Noise and Vibrations) and social sustainability (Guidelines on Social Sustainability, Guidelines on Accessibility for Children, Elderly and People with Disabilities). The guidelines mentioned above define environmental, energy and social requirements set by the Public Transport Administration for all projects and procurements. The guidelines are updated once per year and major revisions are made according to need. In addition to the guidelines, there are several internally developed manuals and other supporting documents that are also used to steer and support the sustainability efforts. These are described in more detail in each section of the report. 5.2.7 Impact assessment and risk management The sustainable development strategy and the guidelines within this field are implemented in the Public Transport Administration’s operations through various activities. A fundamental part of having sustainability permeate the dayto-day work is that the economic, environmental and social consequences are identified, described and documented through inquiries, studies, projects and documentation. A summary description of consequences shall be included in every official statement. Positive and/or negative aspects are to be described (such as impact on travellers with disabilities, elderly and children, local residents, impact on staff groups, working environment, consequences from the perspective of equal opportunities and/or gender equality). Possible deviations from the Public Transport Administration’s guidelines are to be described, giving the reasons for why they were made. A description shall also be provided of whether disability organisations have been consulted, what their essential comments were and how these comments have been implemented. 17/03/2020 17(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Identification, evaluation and management of risks are similarly important to the Public Transport Administration from economic, environmental and social perspectives, as they are part of the effort to achieve continuous improvements. For this reason, a documented risk assessment is a compulsory part of inquiries, projects and documentation in the same way as the impact assessment. 5.3 Procurement and follow-up 5.3.1 Code of conduct for suppliers The Public Transport Administration implements the supplier code of conduct set by Sweden’s regions and county councils. The aim of this code is to promote a sustainable development by having suppliers undertake to respect the code of conduct both within their own organisation and in the supplier chain. Goods and services delivered to Sweden’s regions and county councils must be produced under conditions that comply with: • The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). • The International Labour Organization’s Core Conventions no. 29, 87, 98, 100, 105, 111, 138 and 182. • Article 32 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. • The employee protection and the work environment legislation applicable in the country of manufacture. • The labour law, including minimum wage legislation, and social insurance coverage applicable in the country of manufacture. • The environmental legislation applicable in the country of manufacture. • The United Nations Convention against Corruption. The Public Transport Administration attaches a requirements appendix regarding environment and social sustainability. These appendices set out requirements for suppliers to report, at the minimum, what environmental and social issues they work with and the results of this work. 5.3.2 Follow-up Through structured follow-up of deliveries and service levels throughout the contract period, we ensure that the transactions are made according to the agreement and that the Public Transport Administration receives its orders. As a support in the continuous contract follow-up, there is a general process, method support and checklists. In the event that conditions change, the agreements are adjusted through supplementary agreements to reflect the current conditions. 17/03/2020 18(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 The set requirements are monitored through reports from transport contractors and suppliers, monthly business meetings, inspections, surveys and audits. In previous years, the Administration’s transport section has developed and coordinated methods for environmental follow-up. These methods have then been implemented in 2019. Audits of transport and maintenance contractors are planned based on the perspectives of safety, environment, working environment and quality (SMAK perspectives). In the first four months of 2019, an audit was carried out of the implementation of the documentation for the four remaining audits of 2018 (implementation of SMAK plan – safety, environment, working environment and quality) for 1 contract relating to property maintenance in the Metro, 1 contract relating to property maintenance on Roslagsbanan, and two contracts relating to escalator and lift maintenance). Four audits were planned for 2019, focusing on environmental and accessibility requirements. Out of these, one audit has been completed in the first four months of the year (audit of documentation and implementation of SMAK plan for maintenance contracts relating to fare gates and ticket windows according to the current maintenance agreement (UH2014), one audit has been partially completed (review of compliance with environmental requirements in three commuter train depots) as well as one audit of three bus contracts in the last four months of the year (review of compliance with systematic fire protection in bus depots). Follow-up of project planners and contractors is carried out within each project. This follow-up relates to environmental and work environment rounds to monitor and verify compliance with requirements and legislation. 5.3.3 Social requirements and follow-up The social requirements are included in the regular contract administration process (as described above) and are to be followed up in the continuous monitoring of the contract. The Public Transport Administration has a checklist for follow-up of social sustainability requirements in the transport contracts, and there must be an appendix in all new contracts specifying the requirements for reporting, follow-up and deviation management. There is currently the option to conduct additional audits if the follow-up indicates a large number of ambiguities or deviations. During 2019, the Public Transport Administration has continued the work initiated two years prior with the follow-up of the social requirements. All in all, the follow-up indicates that competence and capacity within the administration and with its suppliers are decisive factors in the successful management of social issues. The follow-up and improvements are conducted continuously. 17/03/2020 19(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 6 A safe and accessible public transport system for all (Social sustainability) The relevant principles of Global Compact in this chapter: • Principle 1: Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights. • Principle 2: Ensure that the company is not complicit in human right abuses. • Principle 4: Eliminate of all forms of forced and compulsory labour. • Principle 5: Abolition of child labour The chapter is linked to the following goals from the 2030 Agenda: Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels The Public Transport Administration contributes to the vision of an attractive, sustainable and growing Stockholm region, with freedom for residents to shape their own lives and make essential decisions. In order to achieve this vision, the Public Transport Administration is working actively and systematically to make public transport accessible, reliable and safe – regardless of gender, age, functional ability or ethnicity. Special consideration is given to the child’s perspective when it comes to security and accessibility. The Public Transport Administration plays an important role in public planning, where social sustainability aspects such as democracy, antidiscrimination, public health, equality, gender equality, diversity, disability access and security are fundamental. The public transport system has two roles in public planning. One is to transport people from point a to point b, and the other is a structuring role – a place that has public transport is an attractive location to build houses and workplaces. 17/03/2020 20(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 6.1 How work is managed The “Social Sustainability Guidelines” and the “Guidelines relating to accessibility for children, elderly and people with disabilities” constitute the Public Transport Administration’s most important policy documents in its work with social issues. The Social Sustainability Guidelines are intended to simplify and clarify the work with social issues. The Social Sustainability Guidelines contain requirements and guidelines within the areas of human rights, antidiscrimination, social responsibility in public procurement, equal opportunities and gender equality, the child’s perspective, security and public health. The Social Sustainability Guidelines also determine when and how the Public Transport Administration’s social impact assessments are to be carried out. The Guidelines relating to accessibility for children, elderly and people with disabilities contain requirements that in many respects go beyond those set out in legislation. The accessibility efforts are focused on the traveller and on fulfilment of various accessibility needs that exist. They also include the child’s perspective and the commitment to considering children’s needs in the public transport system in accordance with the CRC. 6.2 Goals and indicators The goals and indicators for social responsibility linked to the regional public transport programme are presented below. The Public Transport Administration, and the region as a whole, also have the goal of working systematically with social responsibility, and to continuously review major suppliers in this respect. Table 3.

Different measures are also taken to ensure that the goals within social responsibility are achieved in time, see the subsequent sections on security and availability. In procurements, the Public Transport Administration sets requirements for compliance with the regional supplier code of conduct and works actively with follow-up of those requirements, see chapter 5.3. 6.4 Security Security is a focus area to achieve the Public Transport Administration’s primary goal of increased public transport travel. Feeling secure when taking public transport, as well as when going to and from public transport, is essential for people in the county to choose public transport over their own cars. The Public Transport Administration works actively to increase security of all groups. 6.4.1 Developed security organisation Greater challenges and increased focus on security in the regional public transport programme have entailed a need for adaptation of the security organisation. In 2018, work was carried out to clarify roles and responsibilities, and to dedicate strategic resources within the security area in order to fulfil new needs. The development has continued in 2019 in order to increase the level of security through the entire journey, by focusing on collaboration with other actors, such as municipalities, property owners and police. SL’s security central and its resources provides the hub of the day-to-day operational security work. 6.4.2 Security surveys We take regular surveys of travellers’ sense of security in the public transport system. The surveys show that the sense of security is greatest on weekdays in the middle of the day, when there are plenty of people about, but lower during 17/03/2020 22(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 weekend evenings and nights. However, there are clear differences between men and women, where women generally feel less secure. Every other year, the Public Transport Administration carries out special security surveys to find out what factors impact the sense of security. The two main areas impacting the travellers’ sense of security when travelling on, to and from public transport, are their sense of control and their trust in society and other people. The sense of control involves: • Having other people nearby • A good design of the physical environment • Updated traffic information in real time Trust in society and in other people involves: • Good management of the physical environment • Support for travellers subjected to crime in or around the public transport system. What primarily affects the travellers’ sense of security negatively on board vehicles or at stations and stops, is people acting aggressively and who are sometimes under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. Gang formations, lack of staff working to promote security and lacking signage and information can have a negative impact on the sense of security. 6.4.3 Structured security analyses and “Secure Station” inspections Within the municipalities of the region, security analyses are carried out starting from stations in the public transport network and extending 500 metres from the station area. These regular security analyses have been conducted since 2013, and in recent years they have been supplemented with “secure station” inspections. These analyses and security inspections identify security-raising measures that should be considered by the PUblic Transport Administration and other actors in the area, such as municipalities and property owners. The analyses include nine indicators of security in public places and based on a method developed by the Public Transport Administration in collaboration with the organisation Tryggare Sverige. The security analyses include analysis of incident statistics, ocular inspection and interviews with key individuals. The results of the security analyses lead to a prioritisation of improvements within each station and in collaboration with other actors in the areas around the public transport where the Public Transport Administration does not have control. 6.4.4 Security Centre and security number Travellers can call the security number to contact an operator at SL’s Security Centre to help them by directing security resources their way. These resources 17/03/2020 23(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 comprise security hosts, security guards and property guards. The number of incoming calls to the security number has increased gradually as the number has become more known among travellers. In addition to the security resources, the Public Transport Administration has a close collaboration with transport contractors, police, SOS Alarm, municipalities, city districts and volunteer organisations. Together with these actors, the Security Centre forms an operational network for public transport security. During 2019, work was initiated to develop a chat app as a supplement to the security number. The goal of a chat app is for all travellers to have the opportunity to communicate with the Security Centre in a way other than by phone, for example through text messages. The application will be tested in a pilot project at the start of 2020. 6.4.5 Preventive work to reduce vandalisation “Clean and proper” is an important principle in the security work, as it increases both satisfaction and security. Preventive work to reduce vandalisation is therefore an important part of increasing security and economising with tax funding. In 2019, the Public Transport Administration has been taking various initiatives to increase internal knowledge of our own organisation and external knowledge with procuring transport providers in regard to vandalisation and ways to prevent it. The Public Transport Administration has identified procured services within three important areas: analysis, technical solutions and property guards, to prevent and counteract vandalisation in the public transport in the region. These three areas have been developed in 2019 and the initiatives have entailed a slight decrease in vandalisation. The Public Transport Administration also invests in innovation and development in the area of security. One example is the pilot project on development and testing of an automated video analysis system that was initiated in 2018 and continued during 2019. The long-term ambition is to introduce an automated analysis programme. Cameras in the public transport are intended to detect and trigger an alarm in events relating to suicidal behaviour and unauthorised persons on the tracks and in the depots. Table 4. Calls received by the Security Centre Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of 37872 calls 1,921 5,409 6,732 8,590 11,995 21,088 29,866 36,780 17/03/2020 24(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Facts SL’s Security Centre and the security number 020 120 25 25 • Manned 24/7 • 29 operators • On a regular day, there are around 140 security resources in the public transport system. • On evenings and weekends, there are around 170 security resources in the public transport system. • 37,872 calls were made to the security number in 2019 • All security resources receive a two-day training course in working in public environments and relating to laws, ethics, morals and contracts. Since the autumn of 2019, a three-hour supplementary course on people with functional impairments in public transport (referred to as accessibility training) has been added 6.4.6 Investment in collaboration with municipalities In order to give the Public Transport Administration opportunities to attain the security targets in the regional public transport programme, collaboration is required with municipalities and city district administrations at both the strategic and operational level. Based on the survey and review carried out in regard to the collaboration with municipalities and city district administrations, the collaboration has led to clearer delimitations and provided good examples of increased collaboration in vulnerable areas. The goal of the review is to create a clearer model and working methods regarding the security collaboration. The model is applicable to all municipalities and other identified collaboration actors such as property owners and police. The primary aim is to work together with the municipalities to create the physical conditions for a strategic and longterm security work so that security aspects and integration can be considered already in the early planning stages. 6.4.7 Security analysis in Högdalen The security analysis carried out at Högdalen metro station and the surrounding area is an example of successful collaboration. The security analysis and the collaboration with the City of Stockholm resulted in a summer job in conjunction with the youth commission’s work to increase young people’s inclusion in the city’s security initiatives. The goal of the project was to get the perspectives of young people to arrive at ideas for how to increase the sense of security in the area around Högdalen metro station. The group of young people with the City of Stockholm working on the Högdalen project organised a neighbourhood security survey with the aim of identifying 17/03/2020 25(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 factors that create security and insecurity. Examples of insecurity factors include insufficient lighting and vandalisation. With the help of surveys, interviews and the information gathered on site, the commission arrived at the conclusion that insecurity was caused by difficulties navigating the area, lighting and a sense of disorder. In order to increase the sense of security, they created “The Guiding Light of Högdalen”, an innovative concept comprising light, sound and pictures of animals that facilitate navigation and create a more orderly and lighter environment in Högdalen. The efforts to launch and realise the ideas developed by the young people are coordinated by the City of Stockholm, and they have continued in 2019. 6.4.8 The Swedish Public Transport Association The Public Transport Administration is an active member of the Swedish Public Transport Association and the network for public transport security. The Public Transport Administration has shared its experiences concerning working methods within the area of security, presenting the journey we have made from 2013 until today and proposing to introduce a shared definition of security for the industry: “Security in public transport is the traveller’s perception of their own security in and around public transport”. In the Public Transport Administration’s experience, success factors in the security efforts comprise increased collaboration with municipalities and other societal stakeholders, illustration of results, and offering information and training for all those working in the sector. 6.4.9 Participation in We Are Sthlm For the 15th year in a row, the Public Transport Administration participated in We Are Sthlm, a festival for young people aged 13–19 years. The aim of participating in the festival is to build a positive and long-term relationship with the prioritised target group of children and young people, so that they continue to travel by public transport even when they are old enough to drive. During the festival, the Public Transport Administration worked to build awareness of the security number and promote dialogue. The dialogue related both to what the Public Transport Administration can do to increase security in public transport and to what young people can do themselves to increase security. 17/03/2020 26(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 6.4.10 Public transport courage Since the Public Transport Administration cannot have security resources everywhere around the clock, travellers need to help in notifying the Security Centre of insecure situations. A security campaign on the theme of “public transport courage” that was first launched in 2018 received a great deal of positive attention and was therefore repeated again in 2019. The aim of the campaign was to increase the awareness and use of the security number (020-120 25 25). The hope for this campaign too is to achieve a behavioural change, with travellers speaking up if they notice a problem. If travellers trusted their fellow passengers to help them in an insecure situation, their perceived sense of security would improve. All major campaigns are followed-up by a survey. According to the travellers, last year’s campaign was the best since the surveys started in 2015, and the 2019 campaign was also very well received by the travellers. In both 2018 and 2019, the number of calls made to the Security Centre increased noticeably during the campaign period. 6.5 Accessibility Public transport is an important prerequisite for everyone to have equal access to society. Accessibility for children, elderly and travellers with functional impairments is central in public transport. 6.5.1 Goals for accessibility The goal in the regional public transport programme is full accessibility within all modes of transport by 2030 (excluding museum vehicles and ships). It is a very ambitious goal that the Public Transport Administration’s accessibility strategists and disability organisations have developed together. The goal is for the proportion of lines and transit stations with full accessibility to be 100 per cent. This means that the five steps below are possible for all travellers in procured public transport. 1. Plan the journey 2. Purchase and use a ticket 3. Navigate terminals, stations, stops, quays and jetties 4. Receive information 5. Get on board, find a seat and exit the vehicle or vessel These steps are based on statutory requirements and supplementary requirements set out in Guidelines relating to accessibility for children, elderly and people with disabilities. 17/03/2020 27(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 The accessibility database that measures the actual accessibility in rail transport (stations and vehicles), all buses and the 100 main transit points according to set parameters shows that SL’s transports achieved a 77% accessibility in 2019. Through planned measures, accessibility will increase gradually in the coming years. 6.5.2 Escort and luggage service As of 2012, there is an accessibility number that special needs travellers can use. Travellers can use the number to book an escort, help with the accessibility guaranteea and information about accessibility adaptations and travel advice. Since 2009, an escort service is offered for travellers who need assistance navigating the public transport system. In 2019, two pilot projects were carried out: “Bus-to-bus escort” was conducted in the 100 main transit stations and “Luggage service” in conjunction with ordering an escort to and from SL transport at Stockholm Central Station. These accessibility measures have been made permanent and now constitute part of the regular travel services. 6.5.3 Sign language films During 2019, the Public Transport Administration has published 13 sign language films at sl.se. The main focus is information about terms and tickets as well as permanent general information. 6.5.4 Training All employees at the Public Transport Administration and all transport personnel working with customers are trained in accessibility and hospitality. The training is led by a teacher and conducted in collaboration with the county’s disability organisations. During the training, participants get to experience what it can be like for a visually impaired/blind person or a wheelchair user in the public transport system. As part of this work, security guards along with politicians on the regional Accessibility Committee received the same training in 2019. The Public Transport Administration has initiated a training network for educators from all contractors and suppliers where the administration has set contract requirements on training within the area of sustainability/accessibility. The aim of the network is to give the educators an opportunity for skills development and experience exchange. a Read more about the accessibility guarantee at ww.sl.se 17/03/2020 28(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 The Public Transport Administration can provide information about new requirements/new legislation and detect needs for development and support, for example within training materials. UITP conference (Union Internationale des Transports Publics) During the well-attended UITP conference in Stockholm in June 2019, the Public Transport Administration’s accessibility strategist presented the administration’s accessibility initiatives to the delegates. 6.5.5 Accessibility adaptation for marine transport Just like other public transport, the marine transport has the goal of achieving full accessibility by 2030. The accessibility adaptation is gradual, for example in conjunction with renovating vessels. Yxlan, the marine transport service’s new ice class vessel, is our second fully accessible vessel. It is built entirely according to requirements set out in Guidelines relating to accessibility for children, elderly and people with disabilities. Since the winter 2018, Yxlan is in traffic in the north archipelago of Stockholm. In June 2019, Blidösundsbolaget put their newly built and accessibility adapted vessel Lux into traffic on commuter vessel line 89. 6.6 Human rights, equal opportunities, gender equality and the child’s perspective in public transport The Public Transport Administration contributes to the vision of an attractive, sustainable and growing Stockholm region, with freedom for residents to shape their own lives and make essential decisions. Human rights, equal opportunities, gender equality and the child’s perspective in the public transport system are some of the important social issues in our work to allow residents to influence and participate in society on equal terms. 6.6.1 Training Training in social sustainability has been compulsory for all new employees since 2016. The training provides knowledge on human rights and antidiscrimination, equal opportunities and gender equality, the CRC, accessibility, security, public health, and the conditions of various groups of travellers, based on a norm-critical approach. The content of the training programme has been developed together with the Public Transport Administration’s own staff, disability organisations and transport contractors. The programme is teacherled and carried out in collaboration with the training on accessibility and hospitality, which is a related area. Since 2016, there are also requirements for 17/03/2020 29(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 the transport contractors hired by the Public Transport Administration to complete corresponding training. The Public Transport Administration is working actively to exchange experiences and provide further training for educators working for transport contractors within the area of social sustainability. During 2019, several courses on social sustainability have been offered to the Public Transport Administration’s staff. In 2019, a total of 4 such courses have been conducted with 56 participating employees. Table 5. Training in social sustainability for the Public Transport Administration’s staff 2016 2017 2018 2019 Number of hours 53 48 32 32 Number of courses 10 6 4 4 Number of participants 137 73 58 56 17/03/2020 30(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Fact box: The network for gender equality in the transport sector The Public Transport Administration is a member of the network for gender equality in the transport sector (formerly women in the transport sector), which was formed in 2002 to promote the fulfilment of the goals set by the Swedish Riksdag regarding gender equality in the transport policy. The goal of the network is as follows: “The transport system shall be gender equal, i.e. respond equally to the transport needs of both men and women. The working forms, the implementation and the results of the transport policy are to contribute to an equal society”. 6.6.2 The Convention on the Rights of the Child becomes law in 2020 The Swedish Riksdag has decided to incorporate the Convention on the Rights of the Child into Swedish law on 1 January 2020. The Public Transport Administration works from the regional action plan for the implementation of the CRC, which was unilaterally adopted by the sitting county council assembly on 11 October 2005. This means that the Public Transport Administration’s operation shall highlight the child’s perspective and adapt measures to the best interest of the child. The best interests of the child must also set the course in decision-making. In 2019, the Public Transport Administration has followed up with its own analysis on the child’s perspective, compiling a guide for construction projects in public transport and traveller environments. The aim of the guide is to summarise lessons from conducted analyses and ensure equal working methods in the future. The guide also contains a summary knowledge base relating to traffic maturity, security and safety as well as other important points of departure for the development of the child’s perspective in projects and decision bases. 6.6.3 Inclusion and employment in the Roslagsbanan project In October 2019, the Public Transport Administration programme Roslagsbanan built a wildlife hotel at the Vallentuna depot. The wildlife hotel consists of custom made nesting boxes for different species, such as tawny owls, bats and butterflies. This project has also contributed to social sustainability through inclusion and employment for people who have trouble entering the labour market and who are in need of special measures to find employment. A good collaboration with the municipality has been a success factor in this. 17/03/2020 31(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 The wildlife hotel, which consists of 300 nesting boxes and insect hotels, was made with the help of Vallentuna employment coaching, Frösunda care and a carpenter at Resarö. This means that all products are locally made and the project contributes to local inclusion and employment. The project is part of a capacity reinforcement on Roslagsbanan, which also includes the construction of a new rail depot in Vallentuna Municipality. When the detailed development plan for the depot in Vallentuna municipality was created, a nature area was included. In order to manage this nature area in a way that would promote its natural values, the Public Transport Administration has opted to install a total of around 300 nesting boxes for different animals and an insect hotel in this area. 6.6.4 Research and development within social sustainability During 2019, the Public Transport Administration has participated in the reference group in a research project on how public transport can contribute to accessibility and social equality. The result of the project was presented in a seminar in November 2019, to which everyone working in planning and investigation of public transport had been invited. The project aim was to study the mobility strategies of the people living, working or moving around in socially vulnerable areas of Stockholm and Gothenburg. Using focus group interviews, individual interviews, travel diaries and mind maps, researchers in the project has studied how public transport and local environments are perceived and used. The results indicated that when a person is living in individually or socially disadvantageous circumstances, such as poor finances, health or labour market access, public transport is a particularly important resource. The risk of social exclusion may therefore increase if there are no good transport possibilities. The aim of the Public Transport Administration’s participation in the project has been to increase the knowledge of the mobility and public transport needs of socio-economically vulnerable groups. This is part of a constantly ongoing effort to improve planning documentation and contribute to a socially sustainable public transport system. 6.6.5 The Public Transport Administration’s work with social sustainability in building and construction projects. The Public Transport Administration’s building and construction projects work with various activities and measures as part of promoting the long-term work being conducted within social sustainability. In 2019, several of the programmes/projects have been working actively to ensure a systematic 17/03/2020 32(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 approach, implement a supplier code of conduct, taking into consideration and integrated issues of equal opportunities and gender equality, the child’s perspective, accessibility, security and public health. Examples of work relating to social sustainability during the year:  The Kista section of the light rail line Tvärbanan applies a supplier code of conduct in all contract procurements and is working actively to identify and priorities social risks. The programme has carried out audits of contractors and of one subcontractor. These audits have resulted in a newly started internal effort relating to the dissemination of knowledge in terms of risk analysis in the choice of construction material, etc.  The projects Roslagsbanan and Saltsjöbanan are working to highlight the child’s perspective and safeguard the child's interests through impact assessment relating to children in both the operational and construction stages. The programmes have had, or plan to have, dialogues with groups of children to collect children’s opinions and needs when it comes to matters of accessibility, security and public health. In 2019, Roslagsbanan has been working to complete the child impact assessment’s proposed measures in the traffic control device plan for the rerouting of traffic as the result of reconstruction.  Together with the Delegation against Segregation, the project Tvärbanan Kistagrenen has completed a socioeconomic survey for residents of the areas around the light rail line. The survey was intended to increase the understanding of the socioeconomic issues in the programme and also to be used in future activities with a focus on security, solidarity and inclusion.  The Public Transport Administration’s subway vehicle project C30 has continued the work to ensure security in the design of new vehicles. Focus has primarily been placed on three areas: In order to make the layout of the vehicle more open and to reduce the risk of people ending up in vulnerable positions, helpline telephones have been placed in accessible locations so that all traveller groups can use them, and the surveillance cameras have been made more visible for preventative purposes. 6.6.6 Increased equality and gender equality with the help of general impact assessments The Public Transport Administration has an important societal mission. The goal is to ensure that planning and development of public transport contribute to a region of equal opportunities and gender equality by creating access to work, services and recreation for the region’s residents based on their different 17/03/2020 33(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 needs and conditions. In order to promote a more fair distribution of the benefits from investments, the Public Transport Administration analysis section is striving to identify, measure and describe the benefits and effects of various expansion projects. This is done by describing how the project impacts on gender equality, accessibility and public health. The analysis section works with intelligence, customer surveys, transport analysis and economics at the Public Transport Administration and has a unique collective competence. During the year, the Public Transport Administration has completed the development of a new tool for general impact assessments in collaboration with project managers and experts on sustainable development. The result is to provide strategic advice to management and a clear decision basis for policy makers. The following includes a description of how the project contributes to increased accessibility for children, elderly and people with functional impairments, as well as to equal opportunities and gender equality. This refers both to the design of public transport and the influence process. The distribution effects are still described in summary terms, but development is underway to improve this part, among other things by describing how the gains in travel time are distributed between geographical areas. The point of departure for the overall impact assessment has been the goals and focus areas of the regional public transport programme, the goals of Region Stockholm’s development plan and the national goals. The aim is to generally and objectively compare different investments to one another. The result is to provide strategic advice to management and a clear decision basis for policy makers. The assessment of the project is to answer the question of whether the proposed measure contributes to a sustainable transport provision in the long term by describing how the development of the transport system affects ecological, economic and social sustainability. In all studies, an assessment must be made of goal achievement for the proposed measures. In order to ensure that the working method is effective and useful, a collaboration and establishment process has been initiated with analysts, project managers and sustainable development experts. The goal is for the working method to be included in the Public Transport Administration’s study manual, which means that all projects included in the manual must carry out overall impact assessment. 7 An attractive employer takes responsibility The relevant principles of Global Compact in this chapter: 17/03/2020 34(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 • Principle 3: Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. • Principle 6: Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. This chapter is linked to the following goals from the 2030 Agenda: Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Goal 5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls Goal 8. Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries The Public Transport Administration’s work with human resources is based on the ambition to be a responsible and attractive employer. Work tasks, the culture in the workplace and what we represent as an employer are all important components in making this an attractive workplace. 7.1 How work is managed The Public Transport Administration works systematically and preventively to ensure good working conditions for all employees within the Public Transport Administration and for suppliers. The administration has long worked with gender equality in human resources. The most important tools for the extensive efforts consist of Stockholm County Council’s HR policy, public health policy as well as the gender equality and diversity efforts. The Public Transport Administration adheres to the county council’s policy for the inclusion of persons with functional disabilities. As am employer, the Public Transport Administration collaborates and negotiates with representatives of the trade unions (Vision, SACO and Ledarna). The operation is subject to the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions’ collective agreement. At the end of 2019, the Public Transport Administration had 873 employees, distributed as 823 permanent employees and 50 fixed term employees. The number of newly employed external employees (permanent) in 2019 was 123, of whom 58 were women and 65 were men. Table 6.

The Public Transport Administration conducts continuous employee surveys to monitor the employees’ experience of their working situation and their perception of the administration as an employer. In order to ensure a good working environment, the results of the survey is used as the basis of action plans at various levels of the operation. As parts of the operation have grown, the resulting lack of space has had a negative impact on the working environment. An initiative for a more flexible use of the shared office spaces will begin in the autumn. 7.4 Activities in 2019 7.4.1 Employee survey 2019 In this year’s survey, the general results remain at a good level. The general index measuring the motivation and the perception of the Public Transport Administration as an employer (MMI) has dropped significantly from 68 to 64. The index that summarises the operation’s working climate is at 75. The review of managers in the employee survey indicates a good and sustainable leadership, and the TF leadership index has increased from 77 in the previous year to 78 this year. Sustainable employee commitment (HME), a model looking at motivation, leadership and management, is measured for the first time this year. The model has been developed by the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) and is now applied throughout Region Stockholm. The HME index for the Public Transport Administration is 73. In 2019, the employee survey was answered by 91 per cent of all the employees, which indicates a high level of commitment in the employees and provides reliable data to continue working with in action plans at various levels of the operation. The proportion of employees who feel that the work load is reasonable has decreased marginally compared to last year’s survey. The perception that work is conducted based on the administration’s values (collaboration, reliability, transparency and competence) remains at a good level of 75. There has been an increase to 91 per cent stating that they have had a performance review, and 86 per cent have had a salary discussion in the last 12 months. 84 per cent of the employees have an individual development plan, which is a large increase compared to 77 per cent in the previous year. 17/03/2020 37(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 In external indexes conducted by the Institute of Human Resource Indicators (AVI and JÄMIX) the Public Transport Administration is compared with other labour market actors in regard to various HR performance indicators. This year’s index of 135 points (out of 180) shows that the Public Transport Administration is at a good level compared to external service companies used as benchmarks in the selection. TF was named best in the business among all the regions and municipalities included in this year’s survey. 7.4.2 Focus on values One condition for the administration to be able to recruit, keep and develop its staff is clear core values that permeate the entire organisation. One step in the work to create a good culture in the workplace has included the Public Transport Administration’s employees interpreting and implementing the new shared values Collaboration, Transparency, Reliability and Competence. The value work continues in 2019 within the framework of our various operational processes. 7.4.3 Skills supply Skills supply is a priority area of the Public Transport Administration’s operational plan. The Public Transport Administration operates in an industry with tough competition for qualified employees. We compete with both private actors as other public organisations to attract and keep our employees. Delivering high quality in a good working environment requires systematic efforts relating to skills supply. We must also ensure a good leadership and committed employees, for example by working with values and our culture. In 2019, a decision is planned for a first version of a joint skills supply plan for the Public Transport Administration. During the year, 70 employees have changed to a different position internally (57 permanent positions and 13 fixed term positions), which corresponds to one third of all appointments made in the year. This is highly positive from a development perspective, for the employees and the organisation alike. The Public Transport Administration’s staff consists of employees as well as consultants since the volume of investments varies over time. One focus area for the Public Transport Administration is to increase its inhouse staff in relation to the number of consultants. The Public Transport Administration works continuously with consultant exchange. Such consultant exchange has primarily related to leading, supporting and monitoring roles. The aim is to achieve a more appropriate balance between inhouse staff and consultants. 17/03/2020 38(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Another inspirational feature of the operation is the interesting and developing degree projects and other projects being conducted in collaboration with universities and industry. 7.4.4 Leadership development In order for the Public Transport Administration to complete its commission, now and in the future, the right staffing is required with maintained and increased competence. In the past year, the Public Transport Administration has therefore implemented a leadership development programme, partly to meet the competence requirement and partly to fit into the regional structure of leadership development, which includes group supervisory sessions for managers at the same level and in networks for young managers (up to 38 years). All managers in the organisation are offered continuous development initiatives, for example at managerial meetings, managerial conferences and lunch seminars. There is everyday guidance on the intranet, for example in the Manager Handbook. Any new manager at the Public Transport Administration is offered to participate in a programme during their first year, which provides the fundamental knowledge required to handle the manager’s assignment, build networks with other managers as well as with the Public Transport Administration’s management group. The programme lasts for one year and comprises four blocks: 1. Introduction, including the head of administration’s expectations and the operation’s vision and values. This block is to provide an understanding of what is included in the managerial role and which tools and support system are available. 2. Block number two relates to the employer responsibility, for example including policy regulation, working methods and HR responsibility, as well as insights into the laws, guidelines and principles controlling the employer role. 3. During the third block, the participants work on the leadership role, including goal-oriented work, ability to lead yourself and others, communication, feedback and increased ability to lead in accordance with established decisions, organise and develop the operation within a given financial scope and established operational plan, as well as increased insight on their own behaviour and that of others, as a basis for a good leadership and a good employeeship. 17/03/2020 39(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 The last block is to provide increased knowledge of the region’s commission and control, and the regional management’s view of leadership. This full day workshop gives increased opportunities for learning networks, as it involves the entire region. 7.4.5 Health promotion The “Health Track” is an active project to encourage all forms of healthpromoting activities during working hours. Activities included in the Health Track have previously emphasised physical activities, but in later years, the concept has been broadened to include a broader perspective on health. The theme of the year has been Sustainability. Tools to manage work and stress in a more sustainable way, and the possibility to go on art walks or improvisational theatre. In conjunction with the health survey, a pilot test has been conducted to offer employees who are at risk of suffering ill-health an opportunity to start a healthier lifestyle by participating in a group project with a coach and a personal trainer. 7.4.6 Diversity in the workplace As a result of new legislation, HR has changed the administration’s recruitment process in order to increase the accuracy and simultaneously reducing the risk of unintentional discrimination. Recruitment is a complex process with an evident risk of eliminating a competent person without being aware of doing it. The changes concern clearer templates, objective selection tests, interview training and development of structured working methods. Training and workshops for the administration’s managers have also been conducted during the year. 7.4.7 Collocation The Public Transport Administration is subject to the collocation of the central administrations within the region. The aim of the collocation is to create a more cohesive organisation, to enable increased collaboration and skills transference between the administrations. In 2019, the first stage has been completed as part of the operation has been moved to Ulriksborgsgatan. 8 The journey towards the world’s most climate smart public transport The relevant principles of Global Compact in this chapter: • Principle 7: Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. • Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. 17/03/2020 40(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 • Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. This chapter is linked to the following goals from the 2030 Agenda: Goal 3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Goal 6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all Goal 7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Goal 9. Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation Goal 10. Reduce inequality within and among countries Goal 11. Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable Goal 12. Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts Goal 14. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development Goal 15. Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss The Public Transport Administration’s most important contribution to a sustainable environment and a low impact on the climate relates to having as many people as possible choose public transport over private cars as often as possible. However, the Public Transport Administration is working actively for the environment and a sustainable future in many other ways. Stockholm’s public transport is a world leader when it comes to transitioning to renewable energy. All public transport on land uses biofuels or electricity from renewable sources. The Public Transport Administration also works proactively for more efficient energy consumption in both vehicles and properties. Very large investments have been made in recent years to minimise noise along the rail facilities. In addition, measures to reduce the consumption of chemicals that are hazardous to the environment and human health, and to reduce the environmental impact of building and construction projects, constitute important parts in the Public Transport Administration’s environmental work. 8.1 How work is managed The Public Transport Administration works systematically to reduce environmental impact by prevention and streamlining. The Public Transport Administration has a certified environmental management system in accordance with ISO 14001. The most important internal policy documents 17/03/2020 41(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 within the environmental area are Guidelines on Environment and Energy, as well as Guidelines on Noise and Vibrations. Guidelines on Environment and Energy describe how the Public Transport Administration is to work with and set requirements within environment and energy. Guidelines on Noise and Vibrations ensure an equal approach to noise. The guidelines indicate the Public Transport Administration’s interpretations, for example of how noise estimations and measurements are to be carried out. The guidelines ensure an equal approach based on the environmental objectives, Stockholm county council’s policy documents within sustainable development and the strategies, and they ensure proprietary inspections in accordance with the Environmental Code. The guidelines also create a consensus with government agencies and other interested parties regarding these interpretations. 8.2 Goals and indicators The outcome of the goals and indicators within the area of environment and energy in the regional public transport programme and in the environmental programme is presented in the table below. For more detailed information about the outcome of the environmental objectives, the Public Transport Administration compiles an annual environmental report of all environmental objectives, which is submitted to the county council and the Transport Committee. The report is available via www.sll.se/kollektivtrafik 17/03/2020 42(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Table 9.

A new national travel habit survey has been conducted in 2019 by the government agency Transport Analysis, and the results for Region Stockholm in regard to market share of motorised journeys and distribution between transport mode for all journeys will be presented in the spring 2020. b) The figures for energy consumption and proportion of renewable energy in 2017, 2018 and 2019 are based on the percentage change in energy consumption between years. c) A qualified assessment is that the increase is due to a gradually improved reporting from transport operators as well as operational and maintenance supplier from year to year. There is thus probable grounds for assuming that the reporting in the baseline year of 2017 was inadequate and that the total figure for 2017 should have been considerably higher. However, this means that a quality-assured calculation of the goal achievement for environmental objective 10 in the Environmental Programme 2017– 2021 will not be possible with the present figures. The Public Transport Administration will investigate this issue further in 2020, after which a decision can be made on how to assure the quality of the goal achievement. 17/03/2020 43(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 d) The data refers to the assessment of the materials and products that have already been registered by Byggvarubedömningen (BVB). However, work remains to register materials and products in BVB to achieve an overview of the total number of materials and products, which means that the real proportion may be lower than the reported figure. e) These indicators have their intermediate target in 2021 according to the environmental programme. 8.3 Environmental risks The greatest challenges related to the work with environmental objectives are found within the following areas: • Increased travel on public transport • Energy efficiency • Environmental assessment of materials and products used in construction • Reduced noise from metro and commuter trains • Reduced use of chemicals hazardous to the environment and human health (read more in the environmental report). The Public Transport Administration is working actively and carries out communication initiatives to follow up on progress towards the objectives. In addition, various measures are taken to ensure that the environmental objectives are achieved in time. Read more about completed activities and results for 2019 in the following section. 8.4 Increased travel on public transport 8.4.1 Growing city One of the Public Transport Administration’s most important tasks is to plan for future needs in public transport. Stockholm is growing rapidly and public transport has to keep up. In 2030, the number of residents in the region has increased from just over 2.2 million at present to nearly 2.9 million. An increased population means increased pressure on the county’s transport systems. As Stockholm grows, public transport must grow in pace to ensure that green, punctual and accessible journeys can be offered in the future as well. From a sustainability perspective, a well-functioning and expanded public transport system is a condition for development that is both environmentally and socially sustainable. The challenge lies in increasing the attractiveness of public transport in order to maintain the proportion of travellers choosing public transport as the population grows. 8.4.2 Regional formation In 2019, Stockholm County Council was reformed as Region Stockholm, which took over the development responsibilities of the county administrative board. This gave the region an extended commission involving issues relating to growth, transports and infrastructure. To ensure that the Region is perceived as a single party speaking in one voice, it is important that all the administrations 17/03/2020 44(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 of the region collaborate and adopt a common position in the contacts with municipalities. 8.4.3 Collaboration with municipalities The Public Transport Administration’s collaboration with the municipalities is essential for making public transport accessible and attractive to travellers. The municipalities have a planning monopoly and are thus responsible for the physical planning. In order to achieve an efficient public transport solution, the Public Transport Administration needs to be involved in the early stages of the municipal planning process. For this reason, the Public Transport Administration and the municipalities are involved in regular dialogue concerning the municipalities’ planned social development and intended areas of development, with the aim of working towards a sustainable development in which housing, businesses and public transport infrastructure support one another. A high development density entails documentation for a more efficient public transport system compared to a lower development density. As many potential travellers as possible are to be at a walking distance from existing or planned public transport. 8.4.4 Guidelines for planning of public transport in Stockholm County The guidelines for planning of public transport in Stockholm County regulates, among other things, how much housing needs to be built in order to provide an adequate traveller basis for the Public Transport Administration to start trafficking the area. It is important that the public transport network is adapted in time and is available in new city districts, so that new residents choose public transport over their car. In conjunction with establishing new residential areas, the developer and/or municipality can choose to finance the bus service before a sufficient traveller basis has been achieved. 8.4.5 The Accessibility Commission The Public Transport Administration has a commission to investigate and propose measures to increase accessibility, to shorten travel times by bus, and to report the consequences and costs of these measures. In order to take a holistic approach to accessibility by bus, an accessibility commission was set up in 2018 with political and administrative representatives from the Public Transport Administration as well as the City of Stockholm. The commission’s work requires general collaboration with the municipalities. Conditions for bus transport accessibility relate to how routes are planned to ensure that the buses do not encounter any obstacles. This can for example be done through the establishment of bus lanes and priority signals in intersections. 17/03/2020 45(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 8.4.6 Public transport plan and new transport systems During 2019, work has been underway to develop a public transport plan with 2050 as the horizon. The plan is expected to be completed in 2021. The main question to answer in the new public transport plan is how public transport in the region should be planned in order to achieve the goals of the Stockholm Region’s development plan and the regional public transport programme. The Public Transport Plan 2050 is to ensure a systematic view of public transport development and a correlation between objectives and measures. There is also a need for the region to communicate a vision – i.e. how the objectives will be physically and geographically attained – to other regional actors. In 2019, the Public Transport Administration’s planning section worked on a proposal for a new transport system concept. In a growing Stockholm Region, more people will need to travel to work, studies and leisure activities. This creates major challenges for the region’s transport system. We want more people able and willing to travel by sustainable and high-capacity modes of transport, rather than going by car. The Public Transport Administration has an important task in developing an attractive public transport offer. The administration needs to develop and cultivate attractive products that respond to the travellers’ preferences and needs, products which are considered cutting edge and which are viewed as an integrated part of society. The traffic concept, or public transport products with an associated brand, need to be designed based on a system perspective, where each part contributes a piece of the puzzle to meet the region’s overall public transport needs. The concept takes into consideration how travel patterns will change as the regional cores develop. 8.4.7 New commuter boat lines A commuter boat inquiry was conducted in 2018. The budget for 2019 highlights a few new lines to traffic in 2019. The aim of extending the commuter boat lines is both to offer shorter routes and to ease the load on the transport network on land, where other forms of public transport have access issues and high capacity usage at the busiest hours. 8.4.8 Traveller statistics In order to develop the public transport system further and to increase attractiveness, we continuously analyse traveller statistics and travel patterns. Forecasts relating to future travel are based on models, analyses and surveys. Traveller surveys show that time-keeping, service frequency and service disruption information are the most important factors of satisfaction with public transport. The information is collected and weighted in incentive analyses used to evaluate plans and proposed measures. The analysis section 17/03/2020 46(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 collaborates with the transport section and communication section regarding analyses and forecasts for how customers want to travel in the future. The goal is for the Public Transport Administration to be able to conduct more analyses based on the available facts, rather than purchasing the service. Work has been conducted to develop analysis models so that more parameters other than travel time gains and losses can be evaluated and reported in overall impact assessments. The travel habits of the county residents are monitored through travel habit surveys in order to follow up and analyse changes in travel throughout the county. The latest travel habit survey for Stockholm County, RVU 2015, was completed in 2015. In 2019, a new travel habit survey was conducted and the results will be reported in 2020. 8.4.9 Perceived quality in the public transport system Perceived quality is the Public Transport Administration’s monthly on-board survey, which measures traveller satisfaction in all modes of transport. The survey is conducted to ensure continuous follow-up of operations as well as contract regulation for procured transport services. The results of the customer survey give the Public Transport Administration knowledge of customer satisfaction and allow us to monitor the development over time. The survey includes satisfaction with the line and satisfaction with service frequency, timekeeping, service disruption information, cleaning of vehicles and stations, crowding on board the vehicles, staff hospitality and ability to answer questions, as well as the driver’s ability. Satisfaction with SL as a whole is also surveyed. The survey is collected through paper surveys on board vehicles, and a random sample of approximately 13,000 travellers respond every month. The results are reported on a monthly basis, as well as each four months and each year. In order to present the results of compiled survey areas, and especially information for the whole county, the material must be weighted. The number of boarding passengers per contract from the previous year are used to weigh all transport modes. The metro and the bus have the highest number of travellers compared to other modes of transport, representing a total 80 per cent of travel. The level of satisfaction in these modes of transport therefore has the largest impact on the total value for the general public transport on land and commuter boats. 17/03/2020 47(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Figure 6. Proportion of satisfied travellers, as a percentage per transport mode Translation: Bus, Local train, Commuter boat, Commuter train, Metro 8.5 Increased travel by commuter boat The commuter boat service is intended to provide new routes which can shorten travel times, reduce the load on street and road networks and sometimes on other public transport modes. The latest customer survey on the commuter boat service indicates 97 per cent traveller satisfaction. Travellers were least satisfied with the service frequency and crowding. A steady increase in the number of travellers provide an opportunity to increase the service frequency and the length of two of the lines. The increase also applies to journeys combined with cycling. To give an example, the number of travellers who bring their bicycle on board line 80, on the stretch Lidingö-Nacka-Nybrokajen, increased from 20,000 in 2017 to 25,000 in 2018. Most combined journeys take place during rush hour, which means that they also contribute to easing the load on other public transport. Surveys of travel pattern also indicate that line 89, the stretch between Tappström and Stockholm, eases the load on highly trafficked interchange points and car traffic alike through 70 per cent transfer from public transport and a little over 20 per cent from car transport. 8.6 Climate and renewable energy in transport Climate change is one of the most difficult challenges facing humanity. It is therefore of the utmost importance to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. By 2030, the goal set in the regional public transport programme is 100 per cent renewable energy for all public transport, both on land and at sea. 17/03/2020 48(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 8.6.1 Energy strategies Sweden is a world leader in the transition to biofuels, and SL’s bus services represent the largest consumption of biofuels in Swedish public transport. In the transition to renewable fuels, the Public Transport Administration has worked from a fuel strategy that is based on the use of several different fuels. The aim of the strategy is to promote the development of renewable fuels, while it also provides a way to reduce the risks. Biodiesel can either consist of HVOb, which is primarily based on residual products, or RMEc, which is primarily based on agricultural products. HVO is a highly demand fuel since it can be used in all diesel engines without adaptation. The demand is growing at a higher rate than what the fuel companies are capable of producing and delivering, and there is consequently a risk of the price increasing. Another factor in this potential price increase is an expected shortage of raw materials. There is also some concern that legislative changes in regard to the classification and traceability of components could reduce supply of sustainability-certified HVO on the market during a transitory period. There is also a risk that the supply of RME can be limited in the short term by stricter EU legislation regarding land use. 8.6.2 Renewable fuels in public transport Since the start of 2017, all the approx. 2,100 vehicles in the bus fleet are running on renewable fuels. However, it is important to make a distinction between the proportion of buses using renewable fuels and the proportion of renewable energy in the fuels. Certain renewable fuels contain 5 per cent fossil fuel (RME and ethanol). During 2019, one of SL’s transport contractors had some trouble with the delivery of biofuels due to the supplier’s operational problems, which meant that they temporarily had to drive buses with fossil diesel. A transition to renewable fuels at sea has now become the next natural step following the successful results in the bus fleet. The later transition is due partly to the introduction of the HVO fuel on the market, which maritime transport must use, and partly to taxation which makes renewable fuels more expensive in maritime transport. The transition to renewable fuel is an important political decision. Maritime transport is estimated to achieve the set goals in Waxholmsbolaget’s fuel plan. An increase from 20 to 50 % renewable fuel was intended to be effectuated in maritime transport in 2019, but for budgetary reasons, this will instead be implemented in January 2020. b Hydrotreated vegetable oil c Rapeseed methyl ester 17/03/2020 49(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Through collaboration with the city and an effort to achieve a more environmentally adapted maritime transport service, Waxholmsbolaget has set the aim of ensuring that any vessel moored for longer than 15 minutes is to have access to land-based electricity. This would eliminate the need for a combustion engine to generate maintenance electricity. Doing so saves fuel, reduces emissions and lowers noise levels. However, this measure requires the active choice of sustainably produced electricity. When refitting vessels, if the engine needs to be changed, the new engine must meet the strictest emission requirements. On 1 July 2018, a compulsory reduction was introduced, for example of diesel in Sweden. This has the effect that the mobility service can only report the national average of 20 per cent renewable fuel, even if the actual mixture in the tank has a higher level. The electricity used for trains is 100 per cent renewable. It is produced exclusively through hydropower in accordance with the Network Statement. When it comes to electricity supply for stations and depots, there are a number of different property owners and parties, which have their own electricity contracts. In addition to the Public Transport Administration, there are several other station owners within the commuter services, such as the Swedish Transport Administration, Jernhusen and Swedavia. Control of the stations in bordering counties is held by the respective public transport administration. Table 10. Goals for the proportion of renewable fuel within maritime transport Goals in the budget 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Renewable fuels within maritime 20 20 50 50 90 transport, percentage 8.6.3 Renewable energy in properties Stockholm’s public transport is a world leader when it comes to transitioning to renewable energy. In order to contribute to the national goals of an increased proportion of renewable electricity and reduced CO2 load, an investigatory study on property-related renewable energy production has been conducted and reported to the Transport Committee. Based on the recommendations of the study, the Transport Committee made the decision to develop procurement documentation relating to solar energy as a service starting in thirteen depots. The Committee also decided to respond to remaining uncertainties that impact on the appropriateness and schedule for implementation in eight of these 17/03/2020 50(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 depots. A final procurement can be expected in 2021 when the matter has been prioritised in relation to workload and budget. The intended delivery should be scheduled in accordance with other interacting operations in a number of the depots. The study also showed that there is profitability in infrared heating and geothermal heating, but that the CO2 efficiency per invested SEK is the highest for solar power – especially now that solar power from the depot roofs will be purchased. The same investigatory study was also used to make a decision to establish a planning study for energy efficiency, where the output has an impact on renewable energy and CO2 load. The study surveys the prioritised consumption pattern and power output. When the recommended measures have been taken, the assessment in this stage is that SL will contribute more directly and more permanently to CO2 reduction than what is currently the case, as climateneutral electricity and “normal” district heating is purchased annually. The reason is that SL’s operations impact the total output distribution to a lesser extent during times when Sweden’s need for more electricity and district heating is high. In this context, parts of SL’s operations have a consumption pattern with a higher load than other operations (such as bus ramps, ground heating, etc.). Alternatively, climate-neutral district heating has been eliminated based on the above and due to the major district heating distributors having a clear plan to achieve carbon neutrality for their products within a number of years. During the year, renewable alternatives have been developed and proven profitable based on the lifecycle cost of the largest remaining oil fired boiler, which supplies the Mörby depot. 8.7 Energy efficiency 8.7.1 Energy efficiency in properties A challenge to the energy efficiency efforts is the great variance of agreements with transport contractors who are responsible for operation and maintenance. Another challenge is that several suppliers are operating within a depot or transit point with different responsibilities and interests. Ambitions in later agreements aim to give transport contractors incentives to reduce energy consumption throughout the contract period, in transport services and as well as in properties and infrastructure. This is a matter of seeing where benefits and costs are found, in the short and long term, and to place the cost where the greatest benefit can be achieved. Some of the activities completed in 2019 are described below: 17/03/2020 51(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286  Updates in new transport contracts (from E34-E38) are made with requirements for work to be conducted systematically and for energy consumption to attain the established level.  The general requirements for energy efficiency for the majority of existing contracts are clarified through statutory energy surveys and implementation of resulting measures – see section on energy surveys below.  Principles are being developed for how measures in the administration’s properties can be co-financed by transport providers while maintaining profitability. The Public Transport Administration has extensive property holdings with rail depots, bus depots, bus terminals and stations. Normally, the premises used are not originally designed for these types of operation. There is consequently much to be done in the form of adaptations and measures, such as energy optimisation of the premises. In total, the Public Transport Administration manages around 45 depots. Of these, 17 are used in rail operations and 29 are used for maintenance and storage of the roughly 2,100 vehicles used in the bus service. In addition to the depots, the Public Transport Administration manages around 82 bus terminals and 233 stations within the metro and tram services. The commuter train stations are largely owned by the Swedish Transport Administration, which also owns the tracks on which the commuter trains run. A planning instruction with an associated model for verification of energy performance following new construction and major reconstruction of depots was initiated in 2019. The documentation sets requirements for the project, but also provides an opportunity to use experience and good examples of energy savings in depots. 8.7.2 Energy survey Extensive energy surveys in accordance with the legislation on energy surveys for major enterprises has been conducted for several contracts. Even though it has been clarified that the legislation is not fully binding for the Public Transport Administration, the administration has chosen to use these surveys to design energy plans for prioritised parts of the operation. The energy plans define who is in charge of what measures during which periods. The following activities have been completed during the year:  Surveys and energy management plans for the first five transport contracts, which involve approx. 40 per cent of bus transports and 17/03/2020 52(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Roslagsbanan, now provide the basis of energy efficiency requirements in corresponding transport contracts.  MTR and Arriva have also carried out energy surveys as the basis of their upcoming systematic energy management activities relating to transport and property.  In regard to maritime transport, energy management plans and surveys were initiated in 2019 for MS Ballerina, starting with line 82. 8.7.3 Automatic reporting of energy consumption The Public Transport Administration has completed an extensive summary of the contractor’s reporting of energy consumption. Procurement documents have been developed for a new service that, once operational, is intended to gather energy measurement data from energy providers. The service is to provide modern support for the reporting of manual metres and opportunities for relevant energy surveys as of 2020. The monthly statistics transfer will primarily be automated instead of manual, in order to achieve continuous control of the consumption. In the long term, it is desirable to have a higher resolution – energy consumption per hour. The hope is to achieve a more advanced understanding of variations in consumption, for example depending on which installations use heating or energy savings from a certain measure. 8.7.4 Inquiry on electrical buses and bus service contracts There is a large potential to reduce the energy consumption of today’s buses. Since 2016, the Public Transport Administration has conducted an extensive investigation of energy efficiency and electrical buses. The aim is to investigate whether electrical buses are a good alternative for public transport in Stockholm County. The inquiry is based on the electrical solutions that are commercially available, including different charging technologies, such as wire charging, end-station charging or depot-charging. The inquiry presents three scenarios for varying degrees of electrification, as well as which technology and infrastructure are required. The goal is for the inquiry to highlight the important choices and connect them to risks and opportunities of electrified bus transport. It also describes the financial aspects and which energy capacity will be required for the various technologies. At the start of 2019, politicians made a decision to set a direction in accordance with the inquiry proposal. The inquiry is extensive enough to be of interest to other public transport authorities, transport operators and bus manufacturers. The results of the inquiry have provided the basis for the requirements relating to energy 17/03/2020 53(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 efficiency and electrical operation in the Public Transport Administration’s four completed bus procurements in 2019. 8.7.5 Energy efficiency in vehicles The public transport vehicles consume large amounts of energy, not only for their propulsion on rail, water or road, but also to maintain a comfortable temperature and good air quality on board. All completed bus procurements now have requirements for energy efficiency relative to the conditions of each contract area. It is up to the transport operator how they improve energy efficiency. Examples of energy-saving measures are eco-driving, route optimisation, electrical buses, innovative technology and number of passengers on the buses. 8.8 Limitation of noise from public transport For many years, the Public Transport Administration has been working to reduce noise disturbances to the surrounding areas. In addition to people being directly disturbed by noise, it can affect individual performance, learning and sleep. The work to reduce noise is thereby linked to public health. In addition, quiet and comfortable vehicles contribute to increasing the attractiveness of public transport and thereby the proportion of public transport travellers. Surveys of noise levels from SL’s tracks are conducted at five-year intervals as part of its proprietary inspections. The noise survey provides the basis for the Public Transport Administration’s long term plan for prioritisation of noise protection measures. The target figures for noise in the regional public transport programme are the point of departure for noise protection initiatives relating to airborne noise from rail traffic. The Public Transport Administration’s challenge lies in meeting the need for increased public transport while also considering society’s demands for reduced noise levels. An important part of limiting the impact on the surrounding areas is to set requirements in procurements of operation and infrastructure maintenance. 8.8.1 Collaboration within the area of noise The Public Transport Administration participates in several forums and collaboration projects to monitor, disseminate and develop knowledge on noise. An important part of the Public Transport Administration’s ongoing work is to collaborate with municipalities in the planning process. From the perspective of health, it is highly important that the noise issue is included in the early planning stages, so that sufficient space for public transport can be created in 17/03/2020 54(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 conjunction with protective measures for residents. This contributes to laying the foundation for a good urban environment and public health. The Public Transport Administration has regular supervisory meetings with the municipalities affected by SL transports. The Public Transport Administration also participates actively in Stockholm County’s Noise Network, which is a forum for collaboration in noise issues. The goal of the network is to increase the regional competence when it comes to noise and to create the conditions for attaining the environmental objectives relating to noise. The Public Transport Administration supports the Extended Metro Administration within noise, and especially regarding structure-borne sound. In addition, the Public Transport Administration cooperates with national government agencies and universities within railway technology and planning. 8.8.2 Noise protection measures in Roslagsbanan, Saltsjöbanan and Stockholm metro The Public Transport Administration has procured a map-based system called “Project Nav ” to document completed noise protection measures. The system is also used to analyse long-term needs for measures based on noise surveys. Examples of work relating to noise protection measures during the year: • A decision has been made to introduce lubricant equipment in the metro depots to eliminate screeching noises. • Studies completed for noise protection measures along Tvärbanan and Nockebybanan. • The Roslagsbanan and Saltsjöbanan Programme has essentially completed its noise protection work. Local housing measures have been carried out during the year and only a few properties remain. The construction of a noise protection screen by the Neglinge depot has been postponed since the building permit was revoked following an appeal from local residents. 8.8.3 Monitoring systems for the metro Sound and vibration equipment is fitted on vehicles in traffic, measuring actual track status. In the long term, the monitoring is intended to provide quick feedback and thus lead to optimised measures to reduce noise throughout the metro system. 8.9 Other measures 8.9.1 Wake-reducing measures The maritime transport service generates waves, which impacts on the water environment and beaches in the operational area. The regional public transport 17/03/2020 55(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 programme gives the Public Transport Administration the responsibility of striving to minimise the occurrence of wake. The Environmental Guidelines concretise the administration’s preventive work. This issue is largely handled completely through dialogue with interested parties and operators in cases where complaints are received by maritime transport customer services. There are some ten complaints each year concerning the transport impact of wake. Generally, the problem of wake and the measures that can possibly be taken are continuously discussed with the service providers. 8.9.2 Environmental assessment of materials and products The goal of the Public Transport Administration is for at least 50 per cent of materials and products used in building and construction projects to undergo environmental assessments according to the 2021 evaluation system of Byggvarubedömningen. In addition, 90 per cent of the assessed materials and products must fulfil the environmental requirements of “accepted” or “recommended” according to the Byggvarubedömningen criteria. The goal is for all the products used in the operation to be included in the system. Byggvarubedömningen is a member association whose organisation and systematics are under constant development. As of 2019, the Public Transport Administration, the Extended Metro Administration and Locum have a joint membership. Together, we have greater possibilities of influencing the assessment system to fulfil our shared needs. Presently, many of the products used in the operations’ building and construction projects are not included in the system. However, there is a hope that the system will be highly useful when more product categories are included. The development of the association’s assessment is ongoing, and both assessment criteria and evaluation bases are becoming better and clearer. Within the region, work has been initiated to prioritise product categories. The reason is that many products, primarily within building products, are lacking. The development of the assessment system in combination with an adaptation to more facility-specific product categories is necessary for the Public Transport Administration to reach the set objectives regarding the assessment of materials and products. 9 Our work against corruption The relevant principles of Global Compact in this chapter: 17/03/2020 56(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 • Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. This chapter is linked to the following goals from the 2030 Agenda: Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels The public administration is working on behalf of the citizens and shall observe objectivity and impartiality in accordance with the requirements set out in the Instrument of Government. In addition, the administration shall act without arbitrary judgment and cannot discriminate without lawful support. This means that employees and elected officials are to act in such a way that they cannot be suspected of being influenced by irrelevant considerations or interests in their work, for example by receiving inappropriate gifts or benefits from companies or individuals they meet in a professional capacity. Transparency International Sweden defines corruption as using your position to attain an undue advantage for your own or someone else’s gain. Swedish legislation contains no uniform definition of corruption, but the concept is brought up, for example in the provisions of Chapter 10 of the Penal Code (1962:700) regarding the giving and receiving of bribes. According to principle 10 of UN’s Global Compact, which the Public Transport Administration has undertaken to adhere to, businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. The Public Transport Administration not only wants to prevent corruption in the more narrow sense, but also wants to conduct an operation completely free from all types of corruption and behaviour, which can damage public trust. 9.1 How work is managed 9.1.1 Region Stockholm’s guidelines and policy Region Stockholm has guidelines regarding anti-corruption and entertainment as well as an Anti-corruption Policy. The aim of these guidelines is to exemplify and clarify what is considered illegal or inappropriate when being offered benefits and gifts from individuals or companies you encounter in a professional capacity. In addition, they highlight issues relating to bribes and disqualification. The guidelines apply to employees and elected officials in the region’s administrations, companies and foundations in which the region is the manager or appoints the majority of the board. 17/03/2020 57(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 As of June 2019, there is a central whistle-blower function within Region Stockholm. This function is intended for grave improprieties/wrongdoing, such as breaking the law and serious deviations from Region Stockholm’s policy documents. The whistle-blower can be anonymous. 9.1.2 Internal policy documents One important supplementary policy document in the work to combat corruption, in addition to the above, is “Trafikförvaltningens förhållningssätt avseende muta och andra oegentligheter” (the Public Transport Administration’s approach to bribery and other improprieties). The aim is to promote a beneficial culture and counteract improprieties within the Public Transport Administration by providing guidance on what can be acceptable from a perspective of improprieties. The policy underlines the importance of personal accountability and good judgement. The Public Transport Administration’s work is to be conducted with a focus on the client role. There must never be any grounds to question the Public Transport Administration’s professionalism and objectivity. The policy documents apply to all employees and consultants within the Public Transport Administration, SL, Färdtjänsten and Waxholmsbolaget. In preparation of assignments, all consultants must sign a confidentiality agreement confirming that they have read and will comply with the policy document. Central tools in the efforts to counteract corruption, in addition to the policy documents, are training and information to employees, contract requirements, centralised procurement, continuous support from the Public Transport Administration’s legal advisers and internal auditors. 9.2 Goals for anti-corruption The Public Transport Administration is working preventively and continuously to prevent all forms of improprieties linked to the administration’s operations. No improprieties or incidents considered to require further measures have been discovered in 2019. 9.3 Risks entailed in anti-corruption The internal audit function is continuously counteracting corruption within the Public Transport Administration. Risks of corruption and improprieties are a constant priority area in the audit plan, and they are assessed in all audits. In case of suspected improprieties, the internal audit function ensures that these are investigated. 17/03/2020 58(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 Counteracting improprieties is also a central part of procurements at the Public Transport Administration. The Public Transport Administration’s policy documents have a zero-tolerance against any personal gain, regardless of its nature, in procurement and exercise of public authority. Established procedures for procurement and delegation supplement the guidance provided in the policy documents during procurement. All procurement documents and contracts of a contract value exceeding a certain amount shall be reviewed by a legal expert and a controller. 9.4 Activities in 2019 9.4.1 Information for the operation During 2019, the operation has been informed of current affairs via the Public Transport Administration’s intranet. Examples include information that employees need to keep in mind when participating in fairs, information about policy documents and information regarding Christmas and summer cards to suppliers. 9.4.2 Education The course “Administration Studies” is compulsory for all new employees and is also offered to consultants within the Public Transport Administration. It provides basic knowledge, for example on how the Public Transport Administration works to prevent bribery and other corruption. Other internal training initiatives are carried out on a continuous basis. During 2019, like in previous years, anti-corruption issues have been included as part of the management and leadership programme for new managers. 9.4.3 Information to suppliers The Public Transport Administration also informs its suppliers of the approach to bribes and other improprieties. According to law, there are also obligations and opportunities in the procurement process for the client to: • Exclude a supplier if a representative has committed certain crimes. • Set requirements for the supplier to have a policy, code of conduct or equivalent document to prevent corruption. • Cancel/terminate the contract due to corruption. As in previous years, the Public Transport Administration sent letters to all its suppliers for Christmas and the start of summer. In these letters, the head of administration gives a reminder of the approach to bribery and other improprieties, and preventively declines any gifts or invitations to events which do not constitute a natural and beneficial part of the employee’s duties. The work to develop the communication with suppliers is constantly ongoing. 17/03/2020 59(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 17/03/2020 60(62) C.I.N.: 556013-0683 TN 2019-1286 10 Appendix 1 Transport Contractors 2019 10.1 Färdtjänsten Mobility service by taxi: Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi all of 2019 as well as Taxi Stockholm from 1 April 2019.
