The priority sustainable development objectives for our company have been identified as: 1) Decent work and economic growth 2) Responsible consumption and production 3) Fight against climate change 4) Good health and well-being 5) Industry, innovation and infrastructure The CAT has adopted a Sustainable Development Strategy within the framework of an Integrated Management System, Quality, Health and Safety at Work and Environment. The cement industry can grow if it has a dynamic vision of the context in which it operates and if it is able to transform its relationships with the community and nature. CAT has fully invested in the innovation and transformation of these facilities by adopting the most advanced standards for the protection of workers, the environment and populations On the social responsibility front, CAT has set aside important resources for social activities within the factory and in the life of the surrounding community. The CAT manages, with great responsibility, the significant environmental impacts of its activities for sustainable development. Our commitment has been materialized by the signing of a pact, with all Tunisian cement plants, for sustainable development. In order to monitor its performances, within the framework of its social responsibility, the CAT has established several objectives, social and environmental, and indicators to monitor the achievement and effectiveness of the actions implemented. These objectives and indicators are given in the table below Objectives and indicators monitored Total workforce and distribution of employees by sex and age and by geographic area Employment Remuneration and its development Hiring and firing The organization of working time Work organization Absenteeism Health and safety conditions at work OHS (Occupational Health and Safety Committee) achievements Health and security Work accidents (Nbre.), in particular their frequency (TF) and their severity (TG), as well as occupational diseases Atmospheric emissions (dust and gas) Environment Consumption of non-renewable resources Control and recovery of different types of waste The organization of social dialogue Social relations Review of the agreements signed with the base union and the staff representatives The training policies implemented Training The number and effectiveness of training actions Measures taken to promote equality between women and men Measures taken to promote the employment and integration of people with Equal treatment disabilities Anti-discrimination policy Promotion and respect of Respect for freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining national and Elimination of discrimination in matters of employment and occupation international conventions Elimination of forced or compulsory labor and child labor HUMAN RIGHTS: Assesssment, policy and goals CAT-COLACEM still supports with the strongest possible Article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states, “All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law. All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination. We reaffirm our commitment and we will continue to train our leaders and our people to respect human dignity and strive continuously to build a society in which everyone is treated with dignity and respect. We will always continue to act for the respect of human dignity and our suppliers are aware of the importance of respect for human rights within their organization and the importance that the CATCOLACEM gives this factor for the development of its relationships with its suppliers and partners . We will continue to monitor our suppliers' compliance with human rights. Any business partners who do not effectively manage and improve when necessary will be placed on probation. Each time our company has confirmed that one of its suppliers systematically violates the human rights it will be eliminated from the list of approved suppliers. Measurement of outcomes Implementation We check with our subcontractors that they do not work for people without social coverage, and we require all our contractors to sign an undertaking in which they undertake to respect human rights and not to children working. We developed working medicine and have established visits annual medical for each worker Finally, To monitor the health of our employees and to avoid work-related accidents caused by health problems, we conducted respiratory and audiometry tests for all CAT staff. Measurement of outcomes Any contravention of human rights will be documented and the responsible partner will be placed on probation and given a timeframe to address and resolve the issue. Continued non compliance will result in the partner relationship being terminated. Senior management will audit critical suppliers annually without any warning to ensure that they are working within the defined guidelines of human rights. LABOUR: Assesssment, policy and goals In accordance with Tunisian Employment Law employees of our company are free to subscribe to labor unions as well as collective bargaining. Yet as the Employment law specifies, collective bargaining must be engaged in prior to a company strike. Also, CAT-COLACEM acknowledges that when an individual chooses to accept employment at this company it is with his or her own volition and in no way is coerced. Our company policy follows the rules set out by the Tunisian Employment code, which among other right states that Tunisian workers have the right to unionize or join existing labor unions, there is a nominal hours workweek, and the amount of overtime that employers may request is limited. We supersede these laws because CATCOLACEM also provides non-wage benefits such as transportation and meals or compensation for these. Additionally, our company frequently negotiates merger and acquisition deals with foreign companies. Since CATCOLACEM is firmly against the idea of child labor, we require all companies we deal with, to respect the Employment law in compliance with the Tunisian labor legislation. For the control and prevention of workers in our society and all stakeholders on our site, we have established a Corporate Advisory Committee (CAC) and a Health and Safety Committee (HSC) who are responsible for implementing and monitoring programs aimed preserving the health and safety of all employees. Finally, and to improve its performances, the CAT has set up a management system for health and safety at work. This system has been certified according to the OHSAS 18001 standard since 2013 and it is in the process of certification according to the new ISO 45001 standard. Implementation : The manner in which our company ensures the application of the policies in the desired form is by companyprovided sensitivity and diversity education, workshops outlining labor rights, new employee orientation programs that inform the employee at the time of their hire of labor rights. Periodic meetings are held to discuss the problems encountered during the work. These meetings are an opportunity for workers to address their grievances. Awareness sessions and training for employees on labor rights, health and safety are assured. The Occupational Health and Safety Committee, which meets every two months, analyzes and proposes actions to prevent accidents and improve working conditions in the factory Training : The CAT considers that training is the mainstay of the development of its activities and that its human resources are the most important element for the success and durability of the company. For the TAG, training is the driving force of the company's development and contributes to improving the skills of its employees and changing their attitudes to enable them to work in a more rational way In order to improve protection of health and safety of people working in the factory, our company has set up a management system that has been certified OHSAS 18001 and certification was renewed for one year. Measurement of outcomes Monitoring performance on the issue of labor rights is very important to our company because of the relationship between a content workforce and high productivity. The mangers of the company tries to mitigate all issues with a proactive stance. As of the time of application there were no incidents of violations of the Global Compact Labor principals. The managers feel that the lack of an issue is demonstrative of the company’s high regard for labor rights and its continuing attempts to educate company employees about their rights. The table below shows the improvements recorded since 2016 in the number of work-related accidents. 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Indicators goal realized goal realized goal realized goal realized goal realized Number of work 0 6 0 5 0 1 0 3 0 3 accidents Severity rate (TG) ≤ 0,9 2.86 ≤ 0,9 0,13 ≤ 0,9 0.01 ≤ 0,2 0.14 ≤ 0,2 0.19 Frequency Rate (TF) ≤ 20 16.28 ≤ 20 13,68 ≤ 20 2.8 ≤ 10 8.33 ≤ 10 8.34 Frequency Index (If) ≤ 60 33.57 ≤ 60 28.18 ≤ 60 5.66 ≤ 20 16.87 ≤ 20 16.97 Average Duration of Temporary Disability ≤ 29 52.83 ≤ 29 9,80 ≤ 29 3 ≤ 29 17 ≤ 29 22.67 (DMIT) Evolution annuelle du Nombre Des AT avec arrêt 6 6 6 5 Nombre des accidents de Travail avec arrét 3 3 1 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Nombre des accidents de Travail 6 6 6 5 1 3 3 avec arrét Evolution of the number of work accidents (2013 – 2019) ENVIRONMENT: Assessement, policy and goals During the month of November 2019, CAT-COLACEM signed the 2nd sustainable development charter for the Tunisian cement.
