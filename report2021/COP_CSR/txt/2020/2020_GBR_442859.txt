That’s why our smarter energy devices make it simple for consumers to control how much energy they use. One little device at a time, we’re showing customers that they can have a big impact on their energy bills. But we’re not stopping there. Our concept of the Hybrid Home will allow even more savings for consumers. By bringing lots of clever technologies together, the home will be given a huge boost in energy efficiency – this will get bills to an all-time low without compromising on home comfort. Part of the Cambridge high-tech cluster, our products are a hit all over the UK – having sold more than 6 million energy monitors to homes far and wide. When it comes to energy efficiency, it seems everyone wants a piece of the action. And who can blame them? Whilst doing their bit for the environment, consumers can also save more than a few pennies on their energy bills. © Green Energy Options Ltd 2020 5 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 4 Human Rights Assessment, Policy and Goals geo’s goal is to ensure that all our employees and business partners respect the Declaration of Human rights.
