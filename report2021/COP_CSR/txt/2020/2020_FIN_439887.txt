LTIF-rate includes only Finnish personnel. The LTIF-rate is significantly affected by even small changes in the number of incidents: one incident more or less during the reporting year, in comparison to the baseline year, will have a major impact on the LTIF-rate. Particularly for the smaller businesses the fluctuation of the LTIF-rate can partially be explained by the small number of employees. 2 Sick-leave absence ratio is calculated: (sick days/total work days)*100. Sick-leave absence ratio of marine personnel is calculated: (total sick days in the fleet/total days worked onboard)*100. 3 TIR (Total Incident Rate) includes all incidents; the ratio is presented per 1,000,000 working hours. 4 AtoB@C Shipping marine figures included in reporting from 2018. 5 Information on sick leave is not available for AtoB@C Shipping marine personnel for the year 2018. ■ THE USE OF ENERGY AND EMISSIONS ESL Shipping2 2019 20183 2017 Change5, % 1 Purchased energy , Mwh 117.6 105.2 129.7 11.7 Total use of fuel, Mwh 892,250 597,300 347,830 49.4 2 tCO2 237,296 160,988 93,224 47.4 3 g-CO2 per ton mile 15.47 13.10 10.75 18.1 tSOX2 179.3 128.9 95.3 39.1 3 mg-SOX per ton mile 11.69 10.49 10.99 11.4 Leipurin Telko4 2019 2018 2017 Change5, % 2019 2018 2017 Change5, % 1 Purchased energy , Mwh 3,394.8 4,240.6 3,429.0 -19.9 1,093.0 1,059.5 1,118.7 3.2 2 tCO2 1,154.2 1,441.0 1,374.0 -19.9 306.9 337.2 428 -9.0 Kauko Other operations 5 2019 2018 2017 Change , % 2019 2018 2017 Change5, % Purchased energy1, Mwh 146.5 125.0 144.9 17.2 150.3 177.1 210.9 -15.1 tCO22 24.7 23.0 29.5 7.3 23.7 25.6 32.7 -7.4 1 Purchased energy mainly measured, if not possible to measure the figures are estimated. 2 Excluding Raahe depot and certain vessels on voyage charter. 4 Figures corrected retrospectively for 2018 and 2017. 4 The figures cover Telko’s main countries of operation Finland, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Sweden and Denmark. 5 Change 2018–2019.
