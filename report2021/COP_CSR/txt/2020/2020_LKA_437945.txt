The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. The fair value of managed trees was ascertained since the LKAS 41 is only applicable for managed agricultural activities in terms of the ruling issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The valuation was carried by Mr. K. T. D. Tissera, Chartered Valuation Surveyor, using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, physical verification was carried out covering all the estates. 17.3 Consumable Biological Assets Information about Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Non Financial Valuation Unobservable Range of Unobservable Inputs Relationship of Unobservable Asset Technique Inputs (Probability Weighted Average.)

This require an entity to determine how much benefit is attributable to the current and prior periods and to make estimates about demographic variables and financial variables that will influence the cost of the benefit. Actuarial gain on defined benefit plan has been recognised in Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in terms of provisions in LKAS 19. According to the actuarial valuation report issued by the actuarial valuer as at 31 March 2019, the actuarial present value of promised retirement benefits obligation amounted to Rs. 609,709,699/=. If the company had provided for gratuity on the basis of 14 days wages and half months salary for each completed year of service, the liability would have been Rs. 753,854,863/=. Hence, there is a contingent Liability of Rs.144,145,164/= , which would crystallise only if the company ceases to be a going concern. 29.1 Maturity Analysis Repayable Repayable Total within after 1 year less Repayable as at 1 Year than 5 years after 05 years 31.03.2019 Rs.

Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies The Group’s principal financial liabilities comprise loans and borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and shortterm deposits that arrive directly from its operations. Accordingly the Group has exposure to namely Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Currency Risk and Interest Rate Risk from its use of financial instruments. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. Credit Risk This is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivable from customers. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk arises when the Group is unable to meet its financial obligations due to insufficient cash flow situations. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. Currency Risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Group. The currency in which these transactions primarily denominated is in USD. Interest Rate Risk Interest Rate Risk is the potential for losses that may arise due to adverse movement of interest rates, mainly on floating interest rates. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Group has not engaged in any interest rate swap agreements. 182 Elpitiya Plantations PLC Annual Report 2018/19 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31 March 2019 40. Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies (Contd.) 40.1 Financial Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the group’s financial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Group’s financial risk management policies. The Group financial risk management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor financial risks and adherence to limits. Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Audit Committee of the Company oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the financial risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 40.2 Credit risk Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivable from customers and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. 40.2.1 Trade and Other Receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group’s credit policy is monitored at the Board level. The new customers are analysed individually for credit worthiness before Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Group review includes external ratings, when available and in some cases, bank references, purchases limit etc. which also subject to under review on quarterly basis. The past experience of the Management is considered when revisions are made to terms and conditions. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of expected credit losses in respect of trade and other receivables. The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables of the Group at the reporting date is Rs. 84 Mn (2018 – Rs. 59 Mn). The Company has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the Tea and Rubber auction systems. 40.2.2 Investments Credit risks from invested balance with the financial institutions are managed by the Board of Directors. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to them. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty’s failure. The Group does not held short term investments with the financial institutions. 40.2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents The Group held cash and Cash Equivalents of Rs. 33 Mn as at 31st March 2019 (2018 – Rs. 84 Mn) which represents its maximum credit exposure on these assets. Elpitiya Plantations PLC Annual Report 2018/19 183 40.3 Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group does not concentrate on a single financial institution, thereby minimising the exposure to liquidity risk through diversification of funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and Group level by funding the long-term investment with long term financial sources and short term investment with short term financing. Where necessary the Group consults the Treasury Department and Strategic Business Development Unit in Parent Company for scrutinising the funding decisions.
