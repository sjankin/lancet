The effect of IFRS 16 has resulted in the leasehold fees for 2019 being recognised as a financial expense instead of being included in property management costs.

ATRIUM LJUNGBERG ANNUAL REPORT AND SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 4 INTRO • STRATEGIC DIRECTION • SUSTAINABLE ENTERPRISE • MARKET OVERVIEW AND PROPERTY PORTFOLIO • PROJECT INVESTMENTS • OUR PROPERTY AREAS • TL BYGG • GOVERNANCE AND CONTROL CEO’S STATEMENT A DECADE OF CHANGE As the population in major cities goes on growing, innovation and focus on sustainability are two ingredients required to develop urban environments where people can thrive and be happy. During the year, we have reinforced our organisation so that we can meet these requirements and invest SEK 2 billion per year in our own development projects in the long term. Atrium Ljungberg has made some major strategic changes over the last decade. We have sold properties in locations outside Sweden’s four major cities and properties where we perceive no opportunity for long-term development in line with our vision. We have sold retail in favour of office properties, extended our project portfolio from SEK 5.5 billion to SEK 28 billion and refined our urban development strategy. We have also entered into the market for tenant-owned units. We have increased our property value in 10 years, from just under SEK 20 billion to SEK 49 billion: this represents a 161 per cent increase. We have spent the past year focusing closely on setting up our organisation so that we can invest SEK 2 billion a year in our own development projects in the long term. This has involved recruitment of more business developers and project managers, among other things. Our world is changing at a rapid pace, which is particularly clear when we consider human lifestyles and consumption patterns. With this in mind, we also filled a completely new business development position in 2019. This staff member is ­responsible for innovation and new digital services. I am proud of the fact that we venture to focus on new areas, and I am absolutely certain that we need to do this in order to be relevant in the future.

READY TO CREATE THE CITY OF THE FUTURE Development in society has never been as rapid as it is now. With our physical locations as our basic platforms, we are placing great emphasis on the use of digital technology to refine and create new, popular offerings that make our areas even more attractive. “Life between buildings” has always been important to us, and we are now focusing on adding a digital layer to our physical locations. This can be anything from a single property to an area or an entire town. “Servicification” is a key concept where we are seeing greater interaction in the industry, with initiatives and solutions that we all ­devise together. Over the last year, we have prepared ourselves to meet development needs by recruiting new staff for the company, among other things. To continue to be relevant in a world where behaviours and consumption patterns are changing at an ever-increasing pace, we need an understanding of human driving forces and preferences. For example, we know that our customers are increasingly viewing the workplace as an important part of the brand and a powerful recruitment tool. They demand turnkey solutions all the way along the line and are in constant flux, which is driving shorter periods of a­ dvance planning and greater flexibility. The change imposes great demands on us as a property owner to be able to meet the needs of our customers.. But it also creates new business opportunities, and we want to contribute to drive development forward.

The city population has increased rapidly over the last fifty years in Sweden, while populations in sparsely populated municipalities have fallen dramatically. Many people from other parts of the world have also come to Sweden, and they too have usually chosen to settle in the major cities. This rapid growth led to homogeneous cities where roads between home and work were usually given priority over people and where growing population density, rather than distribution, was deemed as a reasonable solution to complex needs. what actually provide o­ pportunities The cities and districts created were frequently difficult for people to have encounters is the truly ­significant aspect different kinds which together reinforce the overall to live in, they limited people instead of giving them space in respect of how people thrive in urban environments. impression.

Quite simply, we share the basic notion of the major importance of physical places to human lives, and we believe that everything starts and ends with life between buildings. Kristian Skovbakke Villadsen, Partner and Director at Gehl, has been involved in work on both Sickla and ­Slakt­husområdet and perceives major potential with both locations. “With Sickla and Slakthusområdet, Atrium Ljungberg has ­created some fantastic examples of sustainable urban planning. Reprogramming and condensing the existing urban structure will support and reinforce the existing infrastructure, public transport and – perhaps most importantly of all – sustainable urban life. Gehl has joined Atrium Ljungberg, Nacka Municipality and the City of Stockholm on their journey over the past year, getting involved in a series of workshops, study visits and master plans in order to explore what is required in order to create an active city district. A number of good residential areas and office and retail areas have been developed in the Stockholm area over the last few years, but there are very few examples of new city districts where apartments, offices and retail all blend together with culture and education, creating a destination in Visualisation, Slakthusplan in Slakthusområdet the form of an active new city district,” says Kristian.

Co-creation has been an important element all the way along the line in the new city district of Nobelberget, which is being developed in Sickla. Early on, discussions revealed a great desire for a community, a digital platform where people could plan running groups, for example, organise dogsitters, share cooking duties and arrange car sharing. The relationships between neighbours build a socially sustainable city district where people feel safer and are proud of “their” Nobelberget. This also gives us the opportunity, as urban developers, to forge closer ties with our customers. This will allow us to identify elements that we could improve in the urban environment, but also to link residents with the city district in general, encouraging contact with our retail, restaurant and service tenants, for example. This would allow people to make the most of everything Sickla has to offer in the form of takeaway food and shopping, for example. “This gives us the opportunity to meet our customers regularly, and in completely different ways to just face-to-face meetings. Customers are in the digital world, and we have to be able to meet them there as well. But we do not want to just chuck in the technology and hope for the best. We start off with face-to-face meetings in order to build relationships and create a sense of trust.

The organisation’s office and a meeting place for foodtech entrepreneurs and start-ups are also based at Söderhallarna at Medborgarplatsen in Stockholm. Atrium Ljungberg’s ambition with the partnership is to transform Söderhallarna into a world-leading food innovation hub, but also to learn about how we can develop the sustainable city districts and meeting places of the future while focusing on food and maintaining sustainability, health and innovation, in combination with tech and data.

The energy statistics do not include the subsidiary TL Bygg or project properties. This is because we report in accordance with EPRA’s guidelines, which only includes the property portfolio. DEVELOPMENTS IN 2019 Energy consumption weighted to an average year has decreased by 5 per cent (3%) since 2018 when comparing like-for-like portfolios (LfL). The actual energy consumption and energy ­intensity also decreased. This is due to changes in the property portfolio, for example, acquisitions and sales, but also new builds, reconstructions and extensions. In 2019 we also installed LED lighting in properties and heat pumps in two properties in order to reduce energy ­consumption. We installed a new energy system in an office property with a data center in Gothenburg, which has halved carbon dioxide emissions. At the start of 2019 the former pellet and oil-fired facility was closed down, which is why it is not included in the statistics for 2019 below. This means that we no longer have any fuel-­ fired facilities in our property portfolio. See pages 28–31 for further information about our work.
