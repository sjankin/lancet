A year on, in January 2020, we marked another milestone by announcing a bold re-organisation of the Company into two distinct and coherent operating groups, each with a vision for profitable growth aligned to two important yet different trends, under the stewardship of Olam International. “This simplification of our diverse portfolio sharpens our focus, enhances performance, and accelerates growth by capitalising on emerging key market trends, and enables us to attract the right talent, while continuing to leverage the benefits of the Olam Group. We will execute this re-organisation in a phased and stage-gated manner leading eventually to carve-out and potential IPO of the two businesses by attracting investors who are aligned with the vision of these two new entities, thus unlocking and maximising long-term value for the Group.” Sunny Verghese, Co-Founder and Group CEO 10 Olam International Limited Annual Report 2019 Sharpening focus, accelerating sustainable growth Living our Purpose to be future-ready Our Goals While this Report is first and foremost a review of our 2019 We aim to achieve four specific goals in this Plan: performance, it is also an opportunity to share our strategy going forward, our overall approach to achieving profitable growth with a view to creating long-term value, and to highlight Return on Equity Free Cash Flow to Equity ≥12% (+) key trends and other external factors impacting our business.

Higher fixed capital on account of increased organic and inorganic growth also contributed to a higher net debt. This resulted in a higher net gearing of 1.38 times as against 1.32 times for 2018. However, without the impact of SFRS(I) 16, our net gearing would have remained at the same level as the previous year at 1.32 times, well below our target of 2.0 times. Adjusting for readily marketable inventories and secured receivables, our net gearing would be 0.29 times, unchanged from last year. Improved returns Above all, we delivered higher returns on capital. Total invested capital grew 5.6% to S$15.6 billion mainly due to a net fixed capital increase of S$913.0 million mostly due to the adoption of the SFRS(I) 16, which had an impact of S$577.6 million. Even as invested capital increased, we improved our EBITDA on average invested capital (EBITDA/IC) to 10.2%, 210 basis points increase from 8.1% in 2018. Our return on beginning-of-period equity also improved from 5.3% in 2018 to 9.1% or 7.9% on an ex-exceptional gains basis in 2019.

Guatemala: With a major customer significantly increasing volume for the 19/20 season, Olam Coffee added state-of-the-art ovens and eight new dryers to the existing eight dryers in its Guatemala dry mill, doubling capacity. They also introduced differentiated specialty processes – Naturals, Honeys and Washed – marketed as Blue Ayarza. California: In October 2019, Olam acquired leading Californian almond processor and ingredient manufacturer Hughson Nut Inc. HNI ranks among the top five almond processors in California. Besides its two primary processing facilities, HNI also manufactures almond ingredients, such as sliced and diced almonds and almond flour in its newly commissioned ingredients processing plant, which also houses steam sterilisation and pasteurisation facilities. Olam’s Managing Director and CEO of Edible Nuts, Ashok Krishen explained: “Our ambition is to grow Olam’s almond business into a vertically integrated Brazil: player with a strong upstream presence in Each year, around 6,400 farmers in the Australia and the USA and direct participation in Chapada Diamantina region of Brazil the primary and ingredient processing space that produce approx. 450,000 bags of can add value to our customers.

It is primarily grown in the Andean mountains of Peru and Bolivia. We source white, red and black varieties from small-scale farmers. Each has a particular flavour and aroma. In 2018, we acquired Inversiones Andinas J&V S.A.C for origination, processing, packaging and marketing of quinoa and chia, adding new adjacent products to our Edible Nuts portfolio. As quinoa is grown by farmers with limited income, there is a need for support. In 2019, the Peru team completed the AtSource Plus baseline data for five farmer groups, each with around 200 small-scale farmers. A key aim for the team is that farmers have access to knowledge, whether about production or accessing the best price. At a dedicated Olam training centre in Puno, Olam agronomists and technicians train farmers on sowing, as well as organic crop maintenance and harvesting. Several tripartite agreements in North Peru with the local authority, municipality and farmer groups are helping farmers to access government grants to invest in organic quinoa production. Other initiatives include provision of dental awareness and frequent check-ups for the farmers’ children, as well as nutritionists educating farming communities about the health benefits of quinoa and chia. In the graphic below are a selection of AtSource Plus ‘metrics that matter’ to ensure these communities can thrive.

Advancing third-party Intellectual Capital to achieve our Purpose A unique mapping approach that will give smallholder farmers a ‘best fit’ for what to grow, where and how, was awarded the 2019 Olam Prize for Innovation in Food Security thanks to its potential to improve productivity in food insecure areas and countries. The approach, called Innovation Mapping for Food Security (IM4FS), is being developed by a team at Wageningen Environmental Research, The Netherlands, and Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia. “As a global food and agri-business, investing in farmers and our own plantations across the world, we are constantly monitoring and assessing the best areas for crops to grow. But with the rate of weather changes and stark warnings on biodiversity loss, air pollution and soil degradation, there is increasing risk that what is planted today might not be suitable for those fields in the future. IM4FS will help inform about this risk with a better understanding of the interactions between land resources, demography, climate change and farming technology and defining the optimal conditions to boost food production. It will equip farmers, as well as local and regional stakeholders with the information they need to solve food security.” Sunny Verghese on awarding the US$75,000 prize in June 2019 The Olam Prize for Innovation in Food Security was launched in 2014 in partnership with Agropolis Fondation. The winner receives an unrestricted US$75,000 grant for the scaling up of proven research.

We want to unleash the power of One Olam to make it easier for customers to work across our businesses and maximise winning practices. A major area of Intellectual Capital creation is through product innovation – this might be in partnership with the customer, working on, say, a particular challenge for a new product; or where we take innovations to them. In Spices last year, for example, we developed new capsicum-based blends to satisfy an edgier consumer palate which is driving interest in turmeric, cinnamon and specialty peppers used in many global cuisines. Now that we are coming together with Cocoa, Coffee, Edible Nuts and Dairy to form OFI we will be better able to maximise synergies and harness collective brainpower.

Other ways in which we grow our Intellectual Capital to service our customers include utilising AtSource to help customers create and convey meaningful messages to their consumers. We are also differentiating in supply chains, like black pepper, to provide unparalleled transparency and expanding organic offerings to meet the needs of growing demand. Market newsletters share our knowledge and educate our customers, while social media channels provide an easy way to stay connected. olamgroup.com 127 Intellectual Capital continued CASE STUDY Creating value for customers through innovation Our Intellectual Capital is created across the business, with innovation in food products and ingredients being a major focus of it. In product development laboratories, food and beverage technologists and scientists develop concepts, test ingredients, and evaluate flavour, aroma, texture and appearance. This is also where the teams work with customers to collaborate on application development, food microbiology, analytical chemistry, quality assurance, technical documentation, and regulatory compliance. In total, Olam has 14 Innovation Centres across the world.

Olam was one of the first companies to recognise this and has been a leader in this space for several years. Linking sustainability and finance, Olam has led the way towards an integrated approach to risk and opportunity and has innovated to operationalise their strategy of ensuring Natural, Social and Human Capital contribute to more informed decision making in their business. By stepping forward this year to partner with other leaders through the Capitals Coalition, Olam will lead the change in the way that all companies make decisions in the future.” Mark Gough, CEO, Capitals Coalition In 2017, in our first Integrated Annual Report, we began reporting against the six non-financial Capitals to help demonstrate how they contribute to the creation of long-term value for Olam as well as create value for our stakeholders. During 2018, the Integrated Reporting <IR> Task Force (a cross functional team) was formed to evaluate our approach to multi capital accounting. With the aim to establish a numerical link to sustainability using multi capital accounting methodologies, the <IR> Task Force, developed the Integrated Impact Statement (IIS). The IIS would help our businesses to manage a broader set of drivers beyond Financial Capital and drive positive impacts in our operations. In 2018, we piloted the initial IIS tool for three of our Business Units – Dairy (Russia), Cocoa (Côte d’Ivoire) and Palm (Gabon), covering Natural, Social and Human Capital. We also had the IIS tool and approach independently validated and shared with subject matter experts, for inputs and further refinement. In 2019, Olam created a dedicated ‘Finance for Sustainability’ (F4S) department to further develop the multi capital accounting methodologies, act as a centre of excellence, and help embed capitals accounting within the organisation. F4S in 2019 developed the Integrated Impact Statement for the Cocoa business. A summary of some insights from Cocoa’s IIS on key aspects of Natural Capital (NC) is presented opposite. olamgroup.com 131 The Olam Integrated Impact Statement continued 1.
