Sincerely yours, Magnus Bergqvist, CEO 4C Strategies Stockholm 04.05.2020 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62 04.05.2020 RESTRICTED 3(5) Description of actions Principle 1 and 2 – Human Rights Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights (P1); and make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses (P2). 4C Strategies fully adheres to legislation in our office locations (Sweden, UK and US) and pays special attention to the Human Rights issue in our Code of Conduct. We actively work towards equality and anti-discrimination. It is encouraged and expected from our employees to act accordingly in both client situations and with colleagues. Our ambition and goal for the year is to maintain our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Human Rights intact. Principle 3, 4, 5 and 6 – Labour • Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining (P3) • The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour (P4); • The effective abolition of child labour (P5); • and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (P6). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to all relevant legislation in our office locations, pertaining to the freedom of association and labor practices and actively and continuously works to promote workplace equality. In 2019 4C Strategies conducted an employee survey in which employees were asked to evaluate their overall working situation as well as assessing any discrimination regarding age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity or disability. From the result, an action plan was developed with special attention to improvement areas. We also initiated salary mapping in our Swedish offices to analyze whether there were any unequitable differences between men and women. Further in 2019, we arranged a mandatory seminar to address the topic of discrimination and victimization for all employees in our Nordic division. In 2020 4C Strategies intend to arrange the same seminar for our Swedish staff on Group level as well as for our international division in the UK. Further, all line managers and members of group management in Sweden and UK are to undergo training in inclusive leadership. Our goal for 2020 is to maintain our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Labor intact and to continue to strive for gender balance among new employees. 4C Strategies will continue to monitor our employees’ work satisfaction and perception of workplace equality through an employee survey and salary mapping. We will also attend to any improvement areas from said measures. 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62 04.05.2020 RESTRICTED 4(5) Principle 7, 8 and 9 – Environment • Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges (P7). • Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility (P8) • and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies (P9). 4C Strategies has a continuously updated Environment Policy and procedures to promote sustainable business practices and reduce our carbon footprint. This includes environmental training for employees around our company policy, recycling initiatives, promoting public transportation and bicycling to work, using energy efficient systems and products in our offices, and reducing consumption of resources (energy, fossil fuels, water, electricity, packaging etc.). As a software provider, 4C Strategies actively contributes to the digitalization of different processes, for example enabling distributed crisis management exercises to our clients. This digital approach reduces travel as neither our consultants nor our clients need transportation to participate. We are currently looking to extend our digital offer to further minimize traveling. Principle 10 – Anti-corruption • Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery (P10). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to all relevant legislation in our office locations regarding corruption. In 2020 we aim to stay the course and not to encounter a single case of doubtful nature.
