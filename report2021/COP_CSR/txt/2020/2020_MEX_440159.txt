WAS CREATED Since it primarily has pine trees, it is considered an area with rich biodiversity. However, the urban sprawl has created much environmental deterioration, with human activity, the sale of food in the park, and the ensuing urban solid wastes. As part of our commitment to the environment and to fostering sustainable practices, in 2016 an environmental and social program was devised: Desierto de los Leones Orgullosamente Limpio (A Proudly Clean Desierto de los Leones). This is a joint initiative with Grupo Salinas’ Fundación Azteca and Grupo Bimbo, whose purpose is to revert the deterioration and foster responsible use of the forest. The third phase of this important project began in March, with the objective of reducing solid wastes with cleanup activities. A priority is awareness and the importance of the environment among those who live in the park’s surrounding areas, which has been made possible through the actions of our environmental leaders during educational activities.

BASIS OF PREPARATION Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards ACCOUNTING EFFECTS OF THE ACQUISITIONS The valuation and recognition of the acquisitions of Ready Roti, Bay Foods, Stonemill and a) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) COPASA was performed in accordance with IFRS 3. and their interpretations, which adoption is mandatory in the current year The following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed In the current year, the Company adopted a series of new and amended IFRS issued by that were recognized as a result of the acquisitions made at the exchange rate prevailing at the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which are effective for annual perithe date of the transaction: ods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. The Company applied IFRS 16 for the first time, which establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases. The nature and effect of the changes as a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard are described below: TRANSITION TO IFRS 16 The Company decided to use the modified retrospective method for the adoption of IFRS 16 and therefore applied the following considerations in the transition: 1. To recognize the cumulative effect of the adoption of the new accounting standard as of January 1, 2019. Consequently, the financial information from prior years was not restated. 2. To use the exemptions proposed by the standard on lease contracts for which the lease terms end within 12 months as of the date of initial application and on lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. Therefore, such leases will be recognized directly in profit or loss. Below is presented a reconciliation between the values of commitments for operating AMENDMENTS TO IAS 28, LONG-TERM INTERESTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES leases as of December 2018 and the effect of adoption as of January 1, 2019: The amendments clarify that an entity applies IFRS 9 to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is not applied but that, in substance, Commitments for operating leases as of December 31, 2018 $ 17,114 form part of the net investment in the associate or joint venture (long-term interests). Plus: This clarification is relevant because it implies that the expected credit loss model in IFRS Effects of initial adoption for expected renewals of contracts 9,368 9 applies to such long-term interests.

In most cases, an independent third-party lender finances the down payment. Both the Company and the financing of independent third parties are guaranteed by the distribution routes, equipment, customer lists, and other assets. The independent third-party lender has 7.

The Company, through BBU, enters into agreements with independent business partners for distribution rights to sell and distribute the Company’s products through direct deliveries to retail stores in certain sales territories. The Company does not hold equity interest in any of the entities controlled by the independent business partners, some of which, finance the purchase of distribution rights through loans from financial institutions with the Company´s support. To maintain the routes operational and ensure the delivery of products to customers, the Company assumes explicit and implicit commitments.
