Management’s Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements The Bank’s Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting standards and instructions issued by the Chile’s Financial Market Commission (ex Chilean Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions). This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error 155 Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conduct our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Chile. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatements An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the entity in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the entity. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by Management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the aforementioned consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with accounting standards and instructions issued by the Chile’s Financial Market Commission (ex Chilean Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions).

Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 1. COMPANY INFORMATION: Banco de Chile is authorized to operate as a commercial bank since September 17, 1996, being, in conformity with the stipulations of article 25 of Law No. 19,396, the legal continuation of Banco de Chile resulting from the merger of the Banco Nacional de Chile, Banco Agrícola and Banco de Valparaiso, which was constituted by public deed dated October 28, 1893, granted before the Notary Public of Santiago, Mr. Eduardo Reyes Lavalle, authorized by Supreme Decree of November 28, 1893. Banco de Chile (or the “Bank”) is a Corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Chile, regulated by the Chilean Commission for the Financial Market (“CMF”), in accordance with the established in the Law 21,130 dated January 12, 2019, which ordered the integration of the Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions (“SBIF”) with the Commission for the Financial Market as of June 1, 2019.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES: (a) Basis of preparation: Legal dispositions Decree Law No. 3,538 of 1980, according to the text replaced by the first article of Law No. 21,000 that “Creates the Commission for the Financial Market”, provides in numeral 6 of its article 5 that the Commission for the Market Financial (“CMF”) may “set the standards for the preparation and presentation of reports, balance sheets, statements of situation and other financial statements of the audited entities and determine the principles under which they must keep their accounting”. In accordance with the current legal framework, banks must use the accounting principles provided by the Commission and in everything that is not dealt with by it or in contravention of its instructions, they must adhere to the generally accepted accounting principles, which correspond to the technical standards issued by the College of Accountants of Chile AG, coinciding with the International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) agreed by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). If there are discrepancies between these accounting principles of general acceptance and the accounting criteria issued by the Commission, the latter shall prevail. (b) Basis of consolidation: The financial statements of Banco de Chile as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 have been consolidated with its Chilean subsidiaries and foreign subsidiary using the global integration method (line-by-line). They include preparation of individual financial statements of the Bank and companies that participate in the consolidation and it include adjustments and reclassifications necessary to homologue accounting policies and valuation criteria applied by the Bank. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using the same accounting policies for similar transactions and other events in equivalent circumstances. Annual Report 2019 Significant intercompany transactions and balances (assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows) originated in operations performed between the Bank and its subsidiaries and between subsidiaries have been eliminated in the consolidation process. The noncontrolling interest corresponding to the participation percentage of third parties in subsidiaries, which the Bank does not own directly or indirectly, has been recognized and is shown separately in the consolidated shareholders’ equity of Banco de Chile. (i) Subsidiaries Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 incorporate financial statements of the Bank and its subsidiaries. According IFRS 10 – “Consolidated Financial Statements”, control requires exposure or rights to variable returns and the ability to affect those returns through power over an investee. Specifically the Bank have power over the investee when has existing rights that give it the ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee. When the Bank has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, but these voting rights are enough to have the ability to direct the relevant activities unilaterally, then conclude the Bank has control. The Bank considers all factors and relevant circumstances to evaluate if their voting rights are enough to obtain the control, which it includes: • The amount of voting rights that the Bank has, related to the amount of voting rights of the others stakeholders; • Potential voting rights maintained by the Bank, other holders of voting rights or other parties; • Rights emanated from other contractual arrangements; • Any additional circumstance that indicate that the Bank have or have not the ability to manage the relevant activities when that 165 decisions need to be taken, including behavior patterns of vote in previous shareholders meetings. The Bank reevaluates if it has or has not the control over an investee when the circumstances indicates that exists changes in one or more elements of control listed above. The entities controlled by the Bank and which form parts of the consolidation are detailed as follows: Interest Owned Functional Rut Subsidiaries Country Currency Direct Indirect Total 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 % % % % % % Banchile Administradora General 96,767,630-6 Chile Ch$ 99.98 99.98 0.02 0.02 100.00 100.00 de Fondos S.A. 96,543,250-7 Banchile Asesoría Financiera S.A.

Significant influence is generally presumed when the Bank holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Other considered factors when determining whether the Bank has significant influence over another entity are the representation on the board of directors and the existence of material intercompany transactions. The existence of these factors could determine the existence of significant influence over an entity even though the Bank had participation less than 20% of the voting rights. Investments in associates where exists significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. In accordance with the equity method, the Bank’s investments are initially recorded at cost, and subsequently increased or decreased to reflect the proportional participation of the Bank in the net income or loss of the associate and other movements recognized in its shareholders’ equity. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of an associate is included in the net book value, net of any accumulated impairment loss. Joint Ventures Joint Ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. According to IFRS 11 “Joint Arrangements”, an entity will determine the type of joint arrangement in which it is involved, and may 166 classify the agreement as a “Joint operation” or a “Joint venture”. For investments defined like “Joint Operation”, their assets, liabilities, income and expenses are recognised by their participation in joint operation. For investments defined like “Joint Venture”, they will be registered according equity method. Investments in other companies that, for their characteristics, are defined like “Joint Ventures” are the following: • Artikos S.A. • Servipag Ltda. (iii) Shares or rights in other companies These are entities in which the Bank does not have significant influence. They are presented at acquisition value (historical cost). (iv) Special purpose entities According to current regulation, the Bank must be analyzing periodically its consolidation area, considering that the principal criteria are the control that the Bank has in an entity and not its percentage of equity participation. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 the Bank does not control and has not created any SPEs. (v) Fund management The Bank and its subsidiaries manage and administer assets held in mutual funds and other investment products on behalf of investors, perceiving a paid according to the service provided and according to market conditions. Managed resources are owned by third parties and therefore not included in the Statement of Financial Position. Annual Report 2019 According to established in IFRS 10, for consolidation purposes is necessary to assess the role of the Bank and its subsidiaries with respect to the funds they manage, must determine whether that role is Agent or Principal. This assessment should consider the following: The scope of their authority to make decisions about the investee. The rights held by third parties. The remuneration to which he is entitled under remuneration arrangements. Exposure, decision maker, the variability of returns from other interests that keeps the investee. The Bank and its subsidiaries manage on behalf and for the benefit of investors, acting in that relationship only as Agent. Under this category, and as provided in the aforementioned rule, do not control these funds when they exercise their authority to make decisions. Therefore, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 act as agent, and therefore do not consolidate any fund, no funds are part of the consolidation. (c) Non-controlling interest: Non-controlling interest represents the share of losses, income and net assets that the Bank does not control, neither directly or indirectly. It is presented as a separate item in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. (d) Use of estimates and judgment: Preparing Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make judgments, estimations and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the valuation of assets, liabilities, income and expenses presented. Real results could differ from 167 these estimated amounts. The estimates made refer to: 1. Provision for loan losses (Note No. 11. No. 12 and No. 32); 2. Useful life of intangible, property and equipment and leased assets and lease liabilities (Notes No.15 and No.16); 3. Income taxes and deferred taxes (Note No. 17); 4. Provisions (Note No. 24); 5. Contingencies and Commitments (Note No. 26); 6. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities (Note No. 39). Estimates and relevant assumptions are regularly reviewed by the management of the Bank, according to quantify certain assets, liabilities, gains, loss and commitments. Estimates reviewed are registered in income in the year that the estimate is reviewed. During the year ended December 31, 2019 there have been no significant changes in the estimates made. (e) Financial asset and liability valuation criteria: Measurement is the process of determining the monetary amounts at which the elements of the financial statements are to be recognized and carried in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and the Consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. This involves selecting the particular basis or method of measurement. In the Consolidated Financial Statements several measuring bases are used with different levels mixed among them. These bases or methods include the following: Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries (i) Initial recognition The Bank and its subsidiaries recognize loans to customers, trading and investment securities, deposits, debt issued and subordinated liabilities and other assets o liabilities on the date of negotiation. Purchases and sales of financial assets performed on a regular basis are recognized as of the trade date on which the Bank committed to purchase or sell the asset. (ii) Classification Assets, liabilities and income accounts have been classified in conformity with standards issued by the CMF. (iii) Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities The Bank and its subsidiaries derecognize a financial asset (or where applicable part of a financial asset) from its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset have expired or when the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset are transferred during a transaction in which all ownership risks and rewards of the financial asset are transferred. Any portion of transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the Bank is recognized as a separate asset or liability. When the Bank transfers a financial asset, it assesses to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. In this case: (a) If substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been transferred, it is derecognized, and any rights or obligations created or retained upon transfer are recognized separately as assets or liabilities. 168 (b) If substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset have been retained, the Bank continues to recognize it. (c) If substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are neither transferred nor retained, the Bank will determine if it has retained control of the financial asset. In this case: (i) If the Bank has not retained control, the financial asset will be derecognized, and any rights or obligations created or retained upon transfer will be recognized separately as assets or liabilities. (ii) If the Bank has retained control, it will continue to recognize the financial asset in the Consolidated Financial Statement by an amount equal to its exposure to changes in value that can experience and recognize a financial liability associated to the transferred financial asset. The Bank derecognizes a financial liability (or a portion thereof) from its Consolidated Statement of Financial Position if, and only if, it has extinguished or, in other words, when the obligation specified in the corresponding contract has been paid or settled or has expired. (iv) Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the Statement of Financial Position if, and only if, the Bank has the legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realize an asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Income and expenses are shown net only if accounting standards allow such treatment, or in the case of gains and losses arising from a group of similar transactions such as the Bank’s trading activities. (v) Valuation at amortized cost Amortized cost is the amount at which a financial asset or liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortization (calculated using the effective interest rate method) of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and minus any reduction for impairment. Annual Report 2019 (vi) Fair value measurements Fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between participants in a main market (or more advantageous) at the measurement date under current market conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. The most objective and common fair value is the price that you would pay on an active, transparent and deep market (“quoted price” or “market price”). When available, the Bank estimates the fair value of an instrument using quoted prices in an active market for that instrument. A market is considered active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. If a market for a financial instrument is not active, the Bank establishes fair value using a valuation technique. These valuation techniques include the use of recent market transactions between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction, if available, as well as references to the fair value of other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flows and options pricing models. The chosen valuation technique use the maximum observable market data, relies as little as possible on estimates performed by the Bank, incorporates factors that market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Inputs into the valuation technique reasonably represent market expectations and include risk and return factors that are inherent in the financial instrument. Periodically, the Bank calibrates the valuation techniques and tests it for validity using prices from observable current market transaction in the same instrument or based on any available observable market data. The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument at initial recognition is the transaction price (i.e. the fair value of the 169 consideration given or received) unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e. without modification or repackaging) or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. However, when transaction price provides the best evidence of fair value at initial recognition, the financial instrument is initially measured at the transaction price and any difference between this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation model is subsequently recognized in incomes. On the other hand, it should be noted that the Bank has financial assets and liabilities offset each other’s market risks, based on which average market prices are used as a basis for determining their fair value. Then, the fair value estimates obtained from models are adjusted for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or model uncertainties; to the extent that the Bank believes that a third-party market participant would take them into account in pricing a transaction. The Bank’s fair value disclosures are included in Note No. 39. (f) Functional currency: The items included in the financial statements of each of the entities of Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries are valued using the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (functional currency). The functional currency of Banco de Chile is the Chilean peso, which is also the currency used to present the entity’s Consolidated Financial Statements, that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Bank operates, as well as obeying to the currency that influences in the costs and income structure. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries (g) Transactions in foreign currency: Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are considered to be in foreign currency and are initially recorded at the exchange rate of the functional currency on the transaction date. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted using the exchange rate of the functional currency as of the date of the Statement of Financial Position. All differences are recorded as a debit or credit to income. As of December 31, 2019, the Bank applied the exchange rate of accounting representation according to the standards issued by the CMF, where assets expressed in dollars are shown to their equivalent value in Chilean pesos calculated using the following exchange rate of Ch$751.88 US$1 (Ch$693.60 to US$1 in 2018). The gain of Ch$30,886 million for net foreign exchange transactions, net (Ch$2,701 million in 2018) shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income, includes recognition of the effects of exchange rate variations on assets and liabilities in foreign currency or indexed to exchange rates, and the result of foreign exchange transactions conducted by the Bank and its subsidiaries. (h) Business Segments: The Bank’s operating segments are determined based on its different business units, considering the following factors: (i) That it conducts business activities from which income is obtained and expenses are incurred (including income and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity). 170 (ii) That its operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity’s highest decision-making authority for operating decisions, to decide about resource allocation for the segment and evaluate its performance; and (iii) That separate financial information is available. (i) Cash and cash equivalents: The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows shows the changes in cash and cash equivalents derived from operating activities, investment activities and financing activities during the year. The indirect method has been used in the preparation of this statement of cash flows. For the preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements of Cash Flow it is considered the following concepts: (i) Cash and cash equivalents correspond to “Cash and Bank Deposits”, plus (minus) the net balance of transactions in the course of collection that are shown in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, plus instruments held-for-trading and available-for-sale that are highly liquid and have an insignificant risk of change in value, maturing in less than three months from the date of acquisition, plus repurchase agreements that are in that situation. Also includes investments in fixed income mutual funds, according to instructions of the CMF, that are presented under “Trading Instruments” in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. (ii) Operating activities: corresponds to normal activities of the Bank, as well as other activities that cannot classify like investing or financing activities. (iii) Investing activities: correspond to the acquisition, sale or disposition other forms, of long-term assets and other investments that not include in cash and cash equivalent. Annual Report 2019 (iv) Financing activities: corresponds to the activities that produce changes in the amount and composition of the equity and the liabilities that are not included in the operating or investing activities. (j) Financial assets held-for-trading: Financial assets held-for-trading consist of securities acquired with the intention of generating profits as a result of short-term prices fluctuation or as a result of brokerage activities, or are part of a portfolio on which a short-term profit-generating pattern exists. Financial assets held-for-trading are stated at their fair value. Accrued interest, gains or losses from their fair value adjustments, as well as gains or losses from trading activities, are included in “Net financial operating income” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. (k) Operations under resale and repurchase agreements: The Bank carries out operations under resale agreements as a form of investment. The securities purchased under these agreements are recognized on the Bank’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under “Investments under resale agreements”, which is valued in accordance with the agreed-upon interest rate, through of method of amortized cost. According to rules, the Bank not register as own portfolio the instruments bought within resale agreements. The Bank also carries out operations under repurchase agreements as a form of financing. The investments that are sold under repurchase obligation and that serve as collateral for borrowings are classified as “Financial Assets held-for-trading” or “Available-for-sale Instruments”. The obligation to repurchase the investment is classified in the liability as “Obligations under repurchase agreements”, which is valued in accordance with the agreed-upon interest rate. 171 As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 it not exist operations corresponding to securities lending. (l) Derivative instruments: The Bank maintains contracts of Derivative financial instruments, for cover the exposition of risk of foreign currency and interest rate. These contracts are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at their cost (included transactions costs) and subsequently measured at fair value. Derivative instruments are reported as an asset when their fair value is positive and as a liability when negative under the item “Derivative Instruments”. Changes in fair value of derivative contracts held for trading purpose are included under “Profit (loss) net of financial operations”, in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In addition, the Bank includes in the valorization of derivatives the “Credit Valuation Adjustment” (CVA), to reflect the counterparty risk in the determination of fair value and the Bank’s own credit risk, known as “Debit valuation adjustment” (DVA). Certain embedded derivatives in other financial instruments are treated as separate derivatives when their risk and characteristics are not closely related to those of the main contract and if the contract in its entirety is not recorded at its fair value with its unrealized gains and losses included in income. At the moment of subscription of a derivative contract must be designated by the Bank as a derivative instrument for trading or hedging purposes. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries If a derivative instrument is classified as a hedging instrument, it can be: (1) A hedge of the fair value of existing assets or liabilities or firm commitments, or; (2) A hedge of cash flows related to existing assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions. A hedge relationship for hedge accounting purposes must comply with all of the following conditions: (a) at its inception, the hedge relationship has been formally documented; (b) it is expected that the hedge will be highly effective; (c) the effectiveness of the hedge can be measured in a reasonable manner; and (d) the hedge is highly effective with respect to the hedged risk on an ongoing basis and throughout the entire hedge relationship. The Bank presents and measures individual hedges (where there is a specific identification of hedged item and hedged instruments) by classification, according to the following criteria: Fair value hedges: changes in the fair value of a hedged instruments derivative, designed like “fair value hedges”, are recognized in income under the line “Net interest income” and/or “Foreign exchange transactions, net”. Hedged item also is presented to fair value, related to the risk to be hedge. Gains or losses from hedged risk are recognized in income under the line “Net interest income” and adjust the book value of item hedged. Cash flow hedge: changes in the fair value of financial instruments derivative designated like “cash flow hedge” are recognised in “Other 172 Comprehensive Income”, to the extent that hedge is effective and hedge is reclassified to income in the item “Net interest income” and/or “Foreign exchange transactions, net”, when hedged item affects the income of the Bank produced for the “interest rate risk” or “foreign exchange risk”, respectively. If the hedge is not effective, changes in fair value are recognised directly in income in the item “Net financial operating income”. If the hedged instruments does not comply with criteria of hedge accounting of cash flow, it expires or is sold, it suspend or executed, this hedge must be discontinued prospectively. Accumulated gains or losses recognised previously in the equity are maintained there until projected transactions occur, in that moment will be registered in Consolidated Statement of Income (in the item “Net interest income” and/or “Foreign exchange transactions, net”, depend of the hedge), lesser than it foresees that the transaction will not execute, in this case it will be registered immediately in Consolidated Statement of Income (in the item “Net interest income” and/or “Foreign exchange transactions, net”, depend of the hedge). (m) Loans to customers: Loans to customers include originated and purchased non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market and which the Bank does not intend to sell immediately or in the short-term. (i) Valuation method Loans are initially measured at cost plus incremental transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method minus any impairment, except when the Bank defined some loans as hedged items, which are measured at fair value, changes are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as described in letter (l) of this note. (ii) Lease contracts Accounts receivable for leasing contracts, included under the caption “Loans to customers” correspond to periodic rent installments of contracts which meet the definition to be classified as financial leases and are presented at their nominal value net of unearned interest as of each year-end. Annual Report 2019 (iii) Factoring transactions They are valued for the amounts disbursed by the Bank in exchange for invoices or other commercial instruments representative of credit, with or without responsibility of the grantor, received in discount. Price differences between the amounts disbursed and the nominal value of the credits are recorded in the result as interest income, through the effective interest method, during the financing period. In those cases where the transfer of these instruments it was made without responsibility of the grantor, it is the Bank who assumes the insolvency risks of those required to pay. (iv) Impairment of loans The impaired loans include the following assets, according to Chapter B-1 of Banking Accounting Standards Compendium of the CMF: a) In case of debtors subject to individual assessment, are considered in impaired portfolio “Non-complying loans” and the categories B3 y B4 of “Substandar loans” defined in letter m) v.i). b) Debtors subject to assessment group evaluation, the impaired portfolio includes all credits of the “Non-complying loans” defined in letter m) v. v). (v) Allowance for loan losses Allowances are required to cover the risk of loan losses have been established in accordance with the instructions issued by the CMF. The loans are presented net of those allowances and, in the case of loans and in the case of contingent loans, they are shown 173 in liabilities under “Provisions”. In accordance with what is stipulated by the CMF, models or methods are used based on an individual and group analysis of debtors, to establish allowance for loan losses. (v.i) Allowance for individual evaluations: An individual analysis of debtors is applied to individuals and companies that are of such significance with respect to size, complexity or level of exposure to the bank, that they must be analyzed in detail. Likewise, the analysis of borrowers should focus on its credit quality related to the ability to payment, to have sufficient and reliable information, and to analyze in regard to guarantees, terms, interest rates, currency and revaluation, etc. For purposes of establish the allowances, the banks must be asses the credit quality, then classify to one of three categories of loans portfolio: Normal, Substandard and Non-complying Loans, it must classify the debtors and their operations related to loans and contingent loans in the categories that apply. v.i.1 Normal Loans and Substandard Loans: Normal loans: correspond to borrowers who are up to date on their payment obligations and show no sign of deterioration in their credit quality. Loans classified in categories A1 through A6. Substandard loans: includes all borrowers with insufficient payment capacity or significant deterioration of payment capacity that may be reasonably expected not to comply with all principal and interest payments obligations set forth in the credit agreement. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries This category also includes all loans that have been non-performing for more than 30 days. Loans classified in this category are B1 through B4. As a result of individual analysis of the debtors, the banks must classify them in the following categories, assigning, subsequently, the percentage of probability of default and loss given default resulting in the following percentage of expected loss: Category Probability Loss given Expected Classification of the debtors of default (%) default (%) loss (%) A1 0.04 90.0 0.03600 A2 0.10 82.5 0.08250 A3 0.25 87.5 0.21875 Normal Loans A4 2.00 87.5 1.75000 A5 4.75 90.0 4.27500 A6 10.00 90.0 9.00000 B1 15.00 92.5 13.87500 B2 22.00 92.5 20.35000 Substandard Loans B3 33.00 97.5 32.17500 B4 45.00 97.5 43.87500 174 Allowances for Normal and Substandard Loans: To determine the amount of allowances to be constitute for normal and substandard portfolio, previously should be estimated the exposure to subject to the allowances, which will be applied to respective expected loss (expressed in decimals), which consist of probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) established for the category in which the debtor and/or guarantor belong, as appropriate. The exposure affects to allowances applicable to loans plus contingent loans minus the amounts to be recovered by way of the foreclosure of financial or real guarantees of the operations. Also, in some cases, the credit risk of direct debtor can be replaced by credit quality from guarantor or surety. Loans mean the book value of credit of the respective debtor, while for contingent loans, the value resulting from to apply the indicated in No.3 of Chapter B-3 of Banking Accounting Standards Compendium. The banks must use the following equation: Provisiondebtor = (ESA-GE) x (PD debtor /100)x(LGD debtor /100)+GE x(PD guarantor/100)x(LGD guarantor/100) Where: ESA = Exposure subject to allowances GE = Guaranteed exposure ESA = (Loans + Contingent Loans) – Financial Guarantees However, the Bank must maintain a minimum provision level of 0.50% over normal portfolio and contingents loans. Annual Report 2019 v.i.2 Non-complying Loans The non-complying portfolio includes the debtors and their credits for which their recovery is considered remote, as they show an impaired or no payment capacity. This category comprises all debtors who have stopped paying their creditors or with visible evidence that they will stop doing so, as well as debtors who are granted a loan to leave as normal debt an operation with more than 60 days overdue in their payment, those in which a forced restructuring of debts is necessary to avoid default and, in addition, any debtor debtors that has 90 days overdue or more in the payment of interest or principal of any credit. This portfolio is composed of the debtors belonging to categories C1 to C6 of the rating scale and all credits, including 100% of the amount of contingent loans, held by those same debtors. For purposes to establish the allowances on the non-complying loans, the Bank disposes the use of percentage of allowances to be applied on the amount of exposure, which corresponds to the amount of loans and contingent loans that maintain the same debtor. To apply that percentage, must be estimated a expected loss rate, less the amount of the exposure the recoveries by way of foreclosure of financial or real guarantees that to support the operation and, if there are available specific background, also must be deducting present value of recoveries obtainable exerting collection actions, net of expenses associated with them. This loss percentage must be categorized in one of the six levels defined by the range of expected actual losses by the Bank for all transactions of the same debtor. These categories, their range of loss as estimated by the Bank and the percentages of allowance that definitive must be applied on the amount of exposures, are listed in the following table: Type of Loan Classification Expected loss Allowance (%) 175 C1 Up to 3 % 2 C2 More than 3% up to 20% 10 C3 More than 20% up to 30% 25 Non-complying loans C4 More than 30 % up to 50% 40 C5 More than 50% up to 80% 65 C6 More than 80% 90 For these loans, the expected loss must be calculated in the following manner: Expected loss = (TE – R) / TE Allowance = TE x (AP/100) Where: TE = total exposure R = recoverable amount based on estimates of collateral value and collection efforts AP = allowance percentage (based on the category in which the expected loss should be classified). All credits of the debtor must be kept in the Default Portfolio until there is a normalization of their ability or payment behavior, without prejudice to punishment of each particular credit that meets the condition indicated in point (vi) of this letter in order to remove a debtor from the Default Portfolio, once the circumstances that lead to classification in this portfolio according to the present rules have been overcome, at least the following copulative conditions must be met: Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries – No obligation of the debtor with the bank with more than 30 calendar days overdue. – No new refinances granted to pay its obligations. – At least one of the payments includes amortization of capital. – If the debtor has a credit with partial payment periods less than six months, has already made two payments. – If the debtor must pay monthly fees for one or more credits, has paid four consecutive dues. – The debtor does not have direct debts unpaid in the CMF recast information, except in the case of insignificant amounts. (v.ii) Allowances for group evaluations Group evaluations are relevant to address a large number of operations whose individual amounts are low or small companies. Such assessments, and the criteria for application, must be consistent with the transaction of give the credit. In the case of consumer loans, collateral are not considered for the purpose of estimating the expected loss. The Bank must discriminate between provisions on the normal portfolio and on the portfolio in default, and those that protect the risks of contingent credits associated with those portfolios. Group evaluations requires the formation of groups of loans with similar characteristics in terms of type of debtors and conditions agreed, to establish technically based estimates by prudential criteria and following both the payment behavior of the group that concerned as recoveries of defaulted loans and consequently provide the necessary provisions to cover the risk of the portfolio. 176 Banks may use two alternative methods for determining provisions for retail loans that are evaluated as a group. Under first method, it will be used the experience to explain the payment behavior of each homogeneous group of debtors and recoveries through collateral and of collection process, when it correspond, with objective of to estimate directly a percentage of expected losses that will be apply to the amount of the loans of respective group. Under second method, the banks will segment to debtors in homogeneous groups, according described above, associating to each group a determined probability of default and a percentage of recovery based in a historic analysis. The amount of provisions to register it will be obtained multiplied the total loans of respective group by the percentages of estimated default and of loss given the default. In both methods, estimated loss must be related with type of portfolio and terms of operations. The Bank to determine its provisions has opted for using second method. (v.iii) Standard method of provisions for Mortgage Loans According to the established by the CMF, the provision factor applicable, represented by expected loss over the mortgage loans, it will depend to the past due of each credit and the relation, at the end of month, between outstanding capital and the value of the mortgage guarantees (CMG), according the following table: Annual Report 2019 Provision factor applicable according past due and CMG Past due days at the end-month Non – Complying CMG Concept 0 1-29 30-59 60-89 Loans PD (%) 1.0916 21.3407 46.0536 75.1614 100.0000 CMG ≤ 40% LGD (%) 0.0225 0.0441 0.0482 0.0482 0.0537 EAD (%) 0.0002 0.0094 0.0222 0.0362 0.0537 PD (%) 1.9158 27.4332 52.0824 78.9511 100.0000 40% < CMG ≤ 80% LGD (%) 2.1955 2.8233 2.9192 2.9192 3.0413 EAD (%) 0.0421 0.7745 1.5204 2.3047 3.0413 PD (%) 2.5150 27.9300 52.5800 79.6952 100.0000 80% < CMG ≤ 90% LGD (%) 21.5527 21.6600 21.9200 22.1331 22.2310 EAD (%) 0.5421 6.0496 11.5255 17.6390 22.2310 PD (%) 2.7400 28.4300 53.0800 80.3677 100.0000 CMG > 90% LGD (%) 27.2000 29.0300 29.5900 30.1558 30.2436 EAD (%) 0.7453 8.2532 15.7064 24.2355 30.2436 177 Where: PD : Probability of default LGD : Loss given default EAD : Exposure at default CMG : Outstanding loan capital Mortgage Guarantee value In the event that a single debtor maintains more than one home mortgage loan with the bank and one of them is 90 days or more behind, all such loans will be assigned to the defaulted portfolio, calculating the provisions for each one of them. They agree with their respective percentages of CMG. (v.iv) Commercial portfolio To determine the allowances of the commercial portfolio, the Bank must consider the standard methods presented below, as applicable to commercial leasing operations or other types of commercial loans. Then, the applicable provision factor will be assigned considering the parameters defined for each method. a) Commercial Leasing Operations The provision factor must be applied to the current value of commercial leasing operations (including the purchase option) and will depend on the default of each operation, the type of leased asset and the relationship between the current value of each operation and the leased asset value (PVB) at each month-end, as indicated in the following tables: Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries Probability of default (PD) applicable according to default and type of asset (%) Days of default of the operation Type of asset at the month-end Real estate Non-real estate 0 0.79 1.61 1-29 7.94 12.02 30-59 28.76 40.88 60-89 58.76 69.38 Portfolio in default 100.00 100.00 Loss given the default (LGD) applicable according to PVB section and type of asset (%) PVB = Current value of the operation / Value of the leased asset PVB section Real estate Non-real estate PVB ≤ 40% 0.05 18.2 40% < PVB ≤ 50% 0.05 57.00 50% < PVB ≤ 80% 5.10 68.40 80% < PVB ≤ 90% 23.20 75.10 PVB > 90% 36.20 78.90 178 The determination of the PVB relationship will be made considering the appraisal value expressed in UF for real estate and in Chilean pesos for non-real estate, recorded at the time of the respective loan granting, taking into account possible situations that may be causing temporary increases in the assets prices at that time. b) Generic commercial placements and factoring In the case of factoring operations and other commercial placements, other than those indicated above, the provision factor, applicable to the amount of the placement and the exposure of the contingent loan risk (as indicated in paragraph 3 of Chapter B-3 ), will depend on the default of each operation and the relationship that exists at the end of each month, between the obligations that the debtor has with the bank and the value of the collateral that protect them (PTVG), as indicated in the following tables: Probability of default (PD) applicable according to default and PTVG section (%) Days of default at With collateral Without collateral the month-end PTVG≤100% PTVG>100% 0 1.86 2.68 4.91 1-29 11.60 13.45 22.93 30-59 25.33 26.92 45.30 60-89 41.31 41.31 61.63 Portfolio in default 100.00 100.00 100.00 Annual Report 2019 Loss given the default (LGD) applicable according to PTVG section (%) Generic commercial operations or factoring without the Factoring with the responsibility Collateral (with / without) PTVG section responsibility of the transferor of the transferor PTVG ≤ 60% 5.0 3.2 60% < PTVG≤ 75% 20.3 12.8 With collateral 75% < PTVG ≤ 90% 32.2 20.3 90% < PTVG 43.0 27.1 Without collateral 56.9 35.9 The collaterals used for the purposes of calculating the PTVG relationship of this method may be specific or general, including those that are simultaneously specific and general. Collateral can only be considered if, according to the respective coverage clauses, it was constituted in the first degree of preference in favor of the bank and only guarantees the debtor’s credits with respect to which it is imputed (not shared with other debtors). For the purposes of calculating the PTVG, the assigned invoices in factoring operations nor the collaterals associated with the mortgage loans will not be considered, regardless of the conditions of its coverage clauses. For the calculation of the PTVG ratio, the following considerations must be taken: 179 i. Transactions with specific collaterals: when the debtor granted specific collateral for generic commercial loans and factoring, the PTVG ratio is calculated independently for each covered transaction, such as the division between the amount of the loans and the contingent loans exposure and the collateral’s value of the covered product. ii. Transactions with general collaterals: when the debtor granted general or general and specific collaterals, the Bank calculates the respective PTVG, jointly for all generic commercial loans and factoring and not contemplated in the preceding paragraph i), as the division between the sum of the amounts of the loans and exposures of contingent loans and the general, or general and specific collateral that, according to the scope of the remaining coverage clauses, safeguard the loans considered in the numerator aforementioned coverage ratio. The amounts of the collaterals used in the PTVG ratio of numbers i) and ii) must be determined according to: – The last valuation of the collateral, be it appraisal or fair value, according to the type of real guarantee in question. For the determination of fair value, the criteria indicated in Chapter 7-12 of the Updated Collection of Standards should be considered. – Possible situations that could be causing temporary increases in the values of the collaterals. – Limitations on the amount of coverage established in their respective clauses. (v.v) Portfolio in default The portfolio in default includes all placements and 100% of the amount of the contingent loans, of the debtors that the closing of a month presents a delay equal to or greater than 90 days in the payment of the interest of the capital of any credit. It will also include debtors who are granted a credit to leave an operation that has more than 60 days of delay in their payment, as well as those debtors who were subject to forced restructuring or partial forgiveness of a debt. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries They may exclude from the portfolio in default: a) mortgage loans for housing, which delinquent less than 90 days, unless the debtor has another loan of the same type with greater delinquency; and, b) credits for financing higher studies of Law No. 20,027, which do not yet present the non-compliance conditions indicated in Circular No. 3,454 of December 10, 2008. All credits of the debtor must be kept in the Default Portfolio until there is a normalization of their ability or payment behavior, without prejudice to punishment of each particular credit that meets the condition indicated in point (vi) of this letter in order to remove a debtor from the Default Portfolio, once the circumstances that lead to classification in this portfolio according to the present rules have been overcome, at least the following copulative conditions must be met: – No obligation of the debtor with the bank with more than 30 calendar days overdue. – No new refinances granted to pay its obligations. – At least one of the payments includes amortization of capital. This condition does not apply in the case of debtors who only have credits for financing higher education in accordance with Law No. 20,027. – If the debtor has a credit with partial payment periods less than six months, has already made two payments. – If the debtor must pay monthly fees for one or more credits, has paid four consecutive dues. – The debtor does not appear with unpaid debts direct according to the information recast by CMF, except for insignificant amounts. (vi) Charge-offs Generally, the charge-offs are produced when the contractual rights on cash flows end. In case of loans, even if the above does not 180 happen, it will proceed to charge-offs the respective asset balances. The charge-off refers to derecognition of the assets in the Statement of Financial Position, related to the respective transaction and, therefore, the part that could not be past-due if a loan is payable in installments, or a lease. The charge-off must be to make using credit risk provisions constituted, whatever the cause for which the charge-off was produced. (vi.i) Charge-offs of loans to customers Charge-off loans to customers, other than leasing operations, shall be made in accordance to the following circumstances occurs: a) The Bank, based on all available information, concludes that will not obtain any cash flow of the credit recorded as an asset. b) When the debt without executive title expires 90 days after it was recorded in asset. c) At the time the term set by the statute of limitations runs out and as result legal actions are precluded in order to request payment through executive trial or upon rejection or abandonment of title execution issued by judicial and non-recourse resolution. d) When past-due term of a transaction complies with the following: Type of Loan Term Consumer loans secured and unsecured 6 months Other transactions unsecured 24 months Commercial loans secured 36 months Residential mortgage loans 48 months Annual Report 2019 The term represents the time elapsed since the date on which payment of all or part of the obligation in default became due. (vi.ii) Charge-offs of lease operations Assets for leasing operations must be charge-offs against the following circumstances, whichever occurs first: a) The bank concludes that there is no possibility of the rent recoveries and the value of the property cannot be considered for purposes of recovery of the contract, either because the lessee have not the asset, for the property’s conditions, for expenses that involve its recovery, transfer and maintenance, due to technological obsolescence or absence of a history of your location and current situation. b) When it complies the prescription term of actions to demand the payment through executory or upon rejection or abandonment of executory by court. c) When past-due term of a transaction complies with the following: Type of Loan Term Consumer leases 6 months Other non-real estate lease transactions 12 months Real estate leases (commercial or residential) 36 months The term represents the time elapsed since the date on which payment of all or part of the obligation in default became due. 181 (vii) Loan loss recoveries Cash recoveries on charge-off loans including loans that were reacquired from the Central Bank of Chile are recorded directly in income in the Consolidated Statement of Income, as a reduction of the “Provisions for Loan Losses” item. In the event that there are recovery in assets, is recognized in income the revenues for the amount they are incorporated in the asset. The same criteria will be followed if the leased assets are recovered after the charge-off of a lease operation, to incorporate those to the asset. (viii) Renegotiations of charge-off transactions Any renegotiation of a credit already written off does not give rise to income, as long as the operation remains to have an impaired quality; the actual payments received must be treated as recoveries of credits written off, as indicated above. Therefore, renegotiated credit can be recorded as an asset only if it has not deteriorated quality; also recognizing revenue from activation must be recorded like recovery of loans. The same criteria should apply in the case that was give credit to pay a charge-off loan. (n) Investment instruments: Investment instruments are classified into two categories: Investments to maturity and Instruments available for sale. The category of Investments to maturity includes only those instruments in which it have the capacity and intention to hold them until their expiration date. The other investment instruments are considered as available-for-sale. Financial assets held-to-maturity are recorded at their cost plus accrued interest and indexations less impairment provisions made when the carrying amount exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries A financial asset classified as available-for-sale is initially recognized at its fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, subsequently measured at their fair value based on market prices or valuation models. Unrealized gains or losses as a result of fair value adjustments are recorded in “Other comprehensive income” within Equity. When these investments are sold, the cumulative fair value adjustment existing within equity is recorded directly in income under “Net financial operating income”. Interest and indexations of financial assets held-to-maturity and available-for-sale are included in the line item “Interest revenue”. Investment securities, which are subject to hedge accounting, are adjusted according to the rules for hedge accounting as described in Note No. 2 (l). As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Bank does not held to maturity instruments. (o) Intangible: Intangible assets are identified as non-monetary assets (separately identifiable from other assets) without physical substance which arise as a result of a legal transaction or are developed internally by the consolidated entities. They are assets whose cost can be estimated reliably and from which the consolidated entities have control and consider it probable that future economic benefits will be generated. Intangible assets are recorded initially at acquisition cost and are subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated amortization or any accumulated impairment losses. 182 Software or computer programs purchased by the Bank and its subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses. The subsequent expense in software assets is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefit for the specific asset. All other expenses are recorded as an expense as incurred. Amortization is recorded in income using the straight-line amortization method based on the estimated useful life of the software, from the date on which it is available for use. The estimated useful life of software is a maximum of 6 years. (p) Property and equipment: Property and equipment includes the amount of land, real estate, furniture, computer equipment and other installations owned by the consolidated entities and which are for own use. These assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation and accumulated impairment. This cost includes expenses than have been directly attributed to the asset’s acquisition. Depreciation is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property and equipment. Estimated useful lives for 2019 and 2018 are as follows: Buildings 50 years Installations 10 years Equipment 5 years Supplies and accessories 5 years Maintenance expenses relating to those assets held for own uses are recorded as expenses in the year in which they are incurred. Annual Report 2019 (q) Deferred taxes and income taxes: The income tax provision of the Bank and its subsidiaries has been determined in conformity with current legal provisions. The Bank and its subsidiaries recognize, when appropriate, deferred tax assets and liabilities for future estimates of tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the book and tax values of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rate expected to be applied, in accordance with current tax law, in the year that deferred tax assets are realized or liabilities are settled. The effects of future changes in tax legislation or tax rates are recognized in deferred taxes starting on the date of publication of the law approving such changes. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is likely that future tax profits will be sufficient to recover deductions for temporary differences. According to instructions from the CMF, deferred taxes are presented in the Statement of Financial Position according to IAS 12 “Income Tax”. (r) Assets received in lieu of payment: Assets received or awarded in lieu of payment of loans and accounts receivable from customers are recorded, in the case of assets received in lieu of payment, at the price agreed by the parties, or otherwise, when the parties do not reach an agreement, at the amount at which the Bank is awarded those assets at a judicial auction. Assets received in lieu of payment are classified under “Other Assets” and they are recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or net realizable value, less charge-off and presented net of a portfolio valuation allowance. The CMF requires regulatory charge-offs if the asset 183 is not sold within a one year of foreclosure. (s) Investment properties: Investments properties are real estate assets held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both, but are not held-for-sale in the ordinary course of business or used for administrative purposes. Investment properties are measured at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment and are presented under “Other Assets”. (t) Debt issued: Financial instruments issued by the Bank are classified in the Statement of Financial Position under “Debt issued” items, where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in the Bank having an obligation either to deliver cash or another financial asset to the holder or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash. Debt issued is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on the issue and costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. (u) Provisions and contingent liabilities: Provisions are liabilities involving uncertainty about their amount or maturity. They are recorded in the Statement of Financial Position when the following requirements are jointly met: i) a present obligation has arisen from a past event and, ii) as of the date of the financial statements it is probable that the Bank or its subsidiaries have to disburse resources to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably measured. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries A contingent asset or liability is any right or obligation arising from past events whose existence will be confirmed by one or more uncertain future events which are not within the control of the Bank. The following are classified as contingent loans in the complementary information: i. Guarantees and sureties: Comprises guarantees, sureties and standby letters of credit. In addition it includes payment guarantees for purchases in factoring transactions. ii. Confirmed foreign letters of credit: Corresponds to letters of credit confirmed by the Bank. iii. Documentary letters of credit: Includes documentary letters of credit issued by the Bank which have not yet been negotiated. iv. Documented guarantee with promissory notes. v. Undrawn credit lines: The unused amount of credit lines that allow customers to draw without prior approval by the Bank (for example, using credit cards or overdrafts in checking accounts). vi. Other credit commitments: Amounts not yet lent under committed loans, which must be disbursed at an agreed future date when events contractually agreed upon with the customer occur, such as in the case of lines of credit linked to the progress of a construction or similar projects. 184 vii. Other contingent loans: Includes any other kind of commitment by the Bank which may exist and give rise to lending when certain future events occur. In general, this includes unusual transactions such as pledges made to secure the payment of loans among third parties or derivative contracts made by third parties that may result in a payment obligation and are not covered by deposits. Exposure to credit risk on contingent loans: In order to calculate provisions on contingent loans, as indicated in Chapter B-3 of the Banking Accounting Standards Compendium of the CMF, the amount of exposure that must be considered shall be equivalent to the percentage of the amounts of contingent loans indicated below: Type of contingent loan Exposure a) Guarantors and pledges 100% b) Confirmed foreign letters of credit 20% c) Documentary letters of credit issued 20% d) Guarantee deposits 50% e) Undrawn credit lines 35% f) Other loan commitments: – College education loans Law No. 20,027 15% – Others 100% g) Other contingent loans 100% Notwithstanding the above, when dealing with transactions performed with customers with overdue loans as indicated in Chapter B-1 of the Accounting Standards Compendium of the CMF, that exposure shall be equivalent to 100% of its contingent loans. Annual Report 2019 (v) Provisions for minimum dividends: According with the Accounting Standards Compendium of the CMF, the Bank records within liabilities the portion of net income for the year that should be distributed to comply with the Corporations Law or its dividend policy. For these purposes, the Bank establishes a provision in a complementary equity account within retained earnings. Distributable net income is considered for the purpose of calculating a minimum dividends provision, which is defined as that which results from reducing or adding to net income the value of price-level restatement for the concept of restatement or adjustment of paid-in capital and reserves for the year. (w) Employee benefits: (i) Staff accrued vacations The annual costs of vacations and staff benefits are recognized on an accrual basis. (ii) Short-term benefits The Bank has a yearly bonus plan for its employees based on their ability to meet objectives and their individual contribution to the company’s results, consisting of a given number or portion of monthly salaries. It is provisioned for based on the estimated amount to be distributed. (iii) Staff severance indemnities 185 Banco de Chile has recorded a liability for long-term severance indemnities in accordance with employment contracts it has with certain employees. The liability, which is payable to specified retiring employees with 30 or 35 years of service, is recorded at the present value of the accrued benefits, which are calculated by applying a real discount rate to the benefit accrued as of year-end over the estimated average remaining service year. Obligations for this defined benefits plan are valued according to the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method, using inputs such as staff turnover rates, expected salary growth in wages and probability that this benefit will be used, discounted at current long-term rates (3.17% as of December 31, 2019 and 4.25% as of December 31, 2018). The discount rate used corresponds to the rate of 10-year Chilean Central Bank Bonds in pesos (BCP). Losses and gains caused by changes in actuarial variables are recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. There are no other additional costs that must be recognized by the Bank. (x) Earnings per share: Basic earnings per share is determined by dividing net income for the year attributable to the Bank by the average weighted number of shares in circulation during that period. Diluted earnings per share are determined similarly to basic earnings, but the weighted average number of outstanding shares is adjusted to take into account the potential dilutive effect of the options on shares, warrants and convertible debt. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 there are no concepts to adjust. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries (y) Interest revenue and expense: Interest income and expenses are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the rate which exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument (or a shorter period) where appropriate, to the carrying amount of the financial asset or financial liability. To calculate the effective interest rate, the Bank determines cash flows by taking into account all contractual conditions of the financial instrument, excluding future credit losses. The effective interest rate calculation includes all fees and other amounts paid or received that form part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the purchase or issuance of a financial asset or liability. For its impaired portfolio and high risk loans and accounts receivables from clients, the Bank has applied a conservative position of discontinuing accrual-basis recognition of interest revenue in the income statement; they are only recorded once received. In accordance with the above, suspension occurs in the following cases: Loans with individual evaluation: • Loans classified in categories C5 and C6: Accrual is suspended by the sole fact of being in the impaired portfolio. • Loans classified in categories C3 and C4: The accrual is suspended after have fulfilled three months in the impaired portfolio. Group evaluation loans: • Any credit, with the exception of those that have real guarantees that reach at least 80%: The accrual is suspended when the credit or one of its installments has reached six months of delay in its payment. 186 Notwithstanding the above, in the case of loans subject to individual evaluation, recognition of income from accrual of interest and readjustments can be maintained for loans that are being paid normally and which correspond to obligations whose cash flows are independent, as can occur in the case of project financing. The suspension of recognition of revenue on an accrual basis means that, while the credits are kept in the impaired portfolio, the related assets included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position will increase with no interest, or fees and adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and income will not be recognized for these items, unless they are actually received. (z) Fees and commissions: Revenue and expenses from fees are recognized in the Consolidated Income Statement using the criteria established in IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers”. Under IFRS 15, revenues are recognized considering the terms of the contract with customers. Revenue is recognized when or as the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the goods or services committed to the customer. Under IFRS 15, revenues are recognized using different criteria depending on their nature. The most significant are: − Those that correspond to a singular act, when the act that originates them takes place. − Those that originate in transactions or services that are extended over time, during the life of such transactions or services. − Commissions on loan commitments and other fees related to credit operations are deferred (together with the incremental costs directly related to the placement) and recognized as an adjustment to the effective interest rate of the placement. In the case of loan commitments, when there is no certainty of the date of effective placement, the commissions are recognized in the period of the commitment that originates it on a linear basis. Annual Report 2019 The fees registered by the Bank correspond mainly to: − Commissions for lines of credit and overdrafts: they are accrued in the period related to the granting of lines of credit and overdrafts in current account. − Commissions for guarantees and letters of credit: they are accrued in the period related to the granting of payment guarantees for real or contingent obligations of third parties. − Commissions for card services: correspond to commissions earned and accrued during the period, related to the use of credit, debit and other cards. − Commissions for account management: includes commissions for the maintenance of current accounts and other deposit accounts. − Commissions for collections, collections and payments: correspond to collection, collection and payments services provided by the Bank. − Commissions for intermediation and management of securities: correspond to income from brokerage service, placements, administration and custody of securities. − Remuneration for insurance commercialization: Income generated by the sale of insurance is included. − Commissions for investments in mutual funds and others: corresponds to commissions originated in the administration of mutual funds. − Other commissions earned: Income generated by currency changes, financial advice, use of distribution channels, use of trademark agreement and placement of financial products and cash transfers and recognition of payments associated with strategic alliances, among others, are included. Fees for commissions include: − Remuneration for card operations: commissions paid for the operation of credit and debit cards are included. − Inter-bank transactions: Corresponds to commissions paid to the automatic clearing house for transactions carried out. 187 − Commissions for operations with securities: commissions for deposit and custody of securities and brokerage of securities are included. − Other commissions: commissions for collection, payments and other online services are included. (aa) Identifying and measuring impairment: Financial assets, different to loans to customers Financial assets are reviewed throughout each year, and especially at each reporting date, to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of a loss event that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and the loss event had an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset that can be reliably calculated. An impairment loss for financial assets (different to loans to customers) recorded at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows, discounted using the effective interest rate original. An impairment loss on a financial asset available-for-sale is calculated based on its fair value. In this case, the objective evidence includes a significant and prolonged decline, under the original investment cost in the fair value of the investment. If there is evidence of impairment, any amount previously recognized in equity, net gains (losses) not recognized in the income statement, are removed from equity and recognized in the income statement for the year, presenting as net gains (losses) related to financial assets available-for-sale. This amount is determined as the difference between the acquisition cost (net of any repayment and amortization) and the current fair value of the asset, less any impairment loss on that investment that has been previously recognized in the income statement. When the fair value of the available-for-sale debt security recovers to, at least, amortized cost, it is no longer considered impaired and subsequent changes in fair value are reported in equity. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries All impairment losses are recognized in the incomes statement. Any cumulative loss related to available-for-sale financial assets recognized previously in equity is transferred to the incomes statement. An impairment loss can only be reversed if it can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. The amount of the reversal is recognized in profit or loss up to the amount previously recognized as impairment. An impairment loss is reversed if, in a subsequent period, the fair value of the debt instrument classified as available-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in profit or loss. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the non-financial assets of the Bank and its subsidiaries, excluding investment properties and deferred tax assets, are reviewed throughout the year and especially at each reporting date, to determine if any indication of impairment exists. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is then estimated. Impairment losses recognized in prior years are assessed at each reporting date in search of any indication that the loss has decreased or disappeared. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimations used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reverted only to the extent that the book value of the asset does not exceed the carrying. The Bank assesses at each reporting date and on an ongoing basis whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, the Bank estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the major value between fair value (less costs to sell) and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their 188 present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. In determining fair value less costs to sell, an appropriate valuation model is used. These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, share prices and other available fair value indicators. Impairment losses related to goodwill cannot be reversed in future years. (ab) Lease transactions: (i) The Bank acting as lessor Assets leased to customers under agreements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, with or without ultimate legal title, are classified as finance leases. When assets held are subject to a finance lease, the leased assets are derecognized and a receivable is recognized which is equal to the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating, and arranging a finance lease are incorporated into the receivable through the discount rate applied to the lease. Finance lease income is recognized over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the finance lease. Assets leased to customers under agreements which do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases. The leased investment properties, under the operating lease modality, are included in the statement of financial position as “Other assets” and depreciation is determined on the book value of these assets, applying a proportion of the value in a systematic way on the economic use of the estimated useful life. Lease income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Annual Report 2019 (ii) The Bank acting as lessee A contract is, or contains a lease, if one party has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for a regular payment. On the start date of a lease, a right-to-use assets leased is determined at cost, which includes the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability plus other disbursements made. The amount of the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments that have not been paid on that date, which are discounted using the Bank’s incremental financing interest rate. The right-of-use asset is measured using the cost model, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated losses due to impairment of value, depreciation of the right-of-use asset, is recognized in the Income Statement based on the linear depreciation method from the start date and until the end of the lease term. In accordance with the establish in the Circular No. 3,649 of the CMF, the monthly variation of the UF for the contracts established in said monetary unit should be treated as a new measurement, therefore the UF readjustment modifies the value of the lease liability, and in parallel, the amount of the right-of-use asset must be adjusted by this effect. After the start date, the lease liability is measured by lowering the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and the modifications to the lease. According to IFRS 16 “Leases” the bank does not apply this rule to contracts whose duration is 12 months or less and those that 189 contain an underlying asset of low value. In these cases, payments are recognized as a lease expense. (ac) Fiduciary activities: The Bank provides trust and other fiduciary services that result in the holding or investing of assets on behalf of the clients. Assets held in a fiduciary capacity are not reported in the financial statements, as they are not the assets of the Bank. Contingencies and commitments arising from this activity are disclosed in Note No. 26 (a). (ad) Customer loyalty program: The Bank maintains a loyalty program to provide incentives to its customers, which allows to acquire goods and/or services, based on the exchange of prize points (“Dolares-Premio”), which are granted based on the purchases made with Bank’s credit cards and the compliance of certain conditions established in said program. The consideration for the prizes is made by a third party. In accordance with IFRS 15, these associated benefit plans have the necessary provisions to meet the delivery of committed future performance obligations. (ae) Additional provisions: In accordance to the CMF regulations, the banks have recorded additional allowances for its individually evaluated loan portfolio, taking into consideration the expected impairment of this portfolio. The calculation of this allowance is performed based on the Bank’s historical experience and considering possible future adverse macroeconomic conditions or circumstances that could affect a specific sector. The provisions made in order to forestall the risk of macroeconomic fluctuations should anticipate situations reversal of expansionary economic cycles in the future, could translate into a worsening in the conditions of the economic environment and thus, function as a countercyclical mechanism accumulation of additional provisions when the scenario is favorable and release or assignment to specific provisions when environmental conditions deteriorate. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries According to the above, additional provisions must always correspond to general provisions on commercial, consumer or mortgage loans, or segments identified, and in no case may be used to offset weaknesses of the models used by the Bank. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 the additional provisions amounted Ch$213,252 million, which are presents in the item “Provisions” of the liability in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. (af) Reclassifications: There have not been significant reclassifications at the end of the year 2019. 3. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS: 3.1 Standards approved and/or modified by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and by the Chilean Commission for the Financial Market (CMF): 3.1.1 Standards and interpretations that have been adopted in these Consolidated Financial Statements. As of the date of issuance of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the new accounting pronouncements issued by both the International Accounting Standards Board and the CMF, which have been adopted by the Bank and its subsidiaries, are detailed below: 190 Accounting standards issued by IASB. IFRS 16 Leases. On January 2016 was issued IFRS 16, this standard replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases – Incentives and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions in the Legal Form of a Lease. The standard establishes the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires that lessor take into account most leases in a single balance model. This new rule does not differ significantly from IAS 17 Leases that precedes it, related to the accounting treatment for the lessor. However, related to the lessee, the new rule requires the recognition of assets and liabilities for most lease contracts. This standard is applicable as of January 1, 2019. The Bank carried out an implementation process during the year 2018, which culminated with the application as of January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method, this means that a the initial application date of the right-of-use asset is equal to the financial liability, and additionally it was decided not to restate the balances of the previous year. (For additional information see notes Accounting Principles and Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures). IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. In June 2017, the IASB published IFRIC 23, which clarifies the application of the recognition and measurement criteria required by IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty about tax treatments. This interpretation is effective for annual periods beginning on January 1, 2019. The Administration has assessed that the implementation of this interpretation had no impact on the Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries. Annual Report 2019 Accounting standards issued by the CMF. Circular No. 3,645. On January 11, 2019, the CMF introduced changes to the Compendium of Accounting Standards in order to apply the criteria defined in IFRS 16. The main changes are for the valuation for the right to use of assets under lease being applied as a measurement after initial recognition, the cost methodology less accumulated depreciation / amortization and accumulated impairment. In the statement of financial position are introduced the items “Leased assets” and “lease liabilities”, which also modify the Notes “Fixed assets” and “Leased assets and lease liabilities”. Additionally, for the purposes of the first application of this standard, banks and their subsidiaries recorded the effect due to the first application of this standard in the equity item “Retained earnings from previous years”. On May 6, 2019, the CMF issued Circular No. 3,649, which defined the treatment of the lease agreements expressed in UF, establishing that the variation in the UF should be treated as a new measurement, and therefore the readjustments resulting in changes in lease payments must be recognized as a modification of the amount of the obligation and in parallel, the amount of the asset must be adjusted for the right to use leased assets for this purpose. The application of these amendments was made jointly with the adoption of IFRS 16. 191 Circular No. 3,638. On July 6, 2018, the CMF published amendments to the standards contained in Chapter B-1 “Provisions for Credit Risk” of the Compendium of Accounting Standards, which incorporates a standard model for the estimation of provisions for credit risk of the commercial portfolio of group analysis. The methods and risk factors considered are the following: – Commercial Leasing Portfolio: considers default, the type of asset in leasing (real estate or non-real estate) and the present value of benefits (PVB) of the asset of the operation. – Student Portfolio: considers the type of loan granted, the enforceability of the payment and the default that it presents, in case the loan is enforceable. – Generic Commercial Portfolio: considers default and the existence of real guarantees that guarantee the placement. In the case of guarantees, the relationship between the placement and the value of the collateral is considered. According to the CMF, the three standardized methods included in the model will constitute a prudential floor for internal methods currently used by the industry. On January 31, 2019, the CMF complemented these instructions with the publication of Circular No. 3,647, with the purpose of recognizing the mitigating effect of the credit risk represented by the transferor’s responsibility in factoring operations, a particular factor is introduced for the component “Loss Given Default” (hereinafter “LGD”) of the standard method for the commercial portfolio of group analysis, for factoring provisions. The adoption of this standard in July 2019 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries 3.1.2 New standards and interpretations that have been issued but its date of application have not yet come into force: The following is a summary of new standards, interpretations and improvements to the International Financial Reporting Standards issued by IASB that are not yet effective as of December 31, 2019, are detailed below: Accounting standards issued by IASB. Conceptual Framework. On March 29, 2018, the IASB issued a “Reviewed” Conceptual Framework. Changes to the Conceptual Framework may affect the application of IFRS when no rule applies to a particular transaction or event. The Conceptual Framework introduces mainly the following improvements: – It incorporates some new concepts of measurement, presentation and disclosure and derecognition of assets and liabilities in the Financial Statements. – Provides updated definitions of assets, liabilities and includes criteria for the recognition of assets and liabilities in the financial statements. – Clarifies some important concepts such as background on form, prudential criteria and measurement of uncertainty. 192 The Conceptual Framework enters into force for periods beginning on January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. Definition of materiality or relative importance. The IASB issued changes to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, and IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, to clarify the definition of materiality and align these standards with the Revised Conceptual Framework issued in March 2018, to facilitate companies to make materiality judgments. Under the old definition omissions or misrepresentations of elements are important if they could, individually or collectively, influence the economic decisions that users make on the basis of financial statements (IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements). The new definition states that information is material if the omission, distortion or concealment of the information can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary users of financial statements of general purpose make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity. The date of application of these amendments is January 1, 2020. Early application is allowed. This amendment has no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. Interest rate benchmark reform. In September 2019, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39, as a result of the IBOR (Interbank Offered Rate) reform, which results in the replacement of existing reference interest rates, by alternative interest rates. Annual Report 2019 The amendments provide temporary application exceptions that allow hedge accounting to continue during the uncertainty period, prior to the replacement of existing reference interest rates. The date of application of these amendments is from January 1, 2020. Early application is allowed. This amendment has no impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries. Accounting Standards issued by the CMF. Circular No. 2,243. On December 20, 2019, the CMF published Circular No. 2,243, which updates the instructions of the Banking Accounting Standards Compendium (“CNCB”) for banks. The changes seek to achieve greater convergence with IFRS, as well as an improvement in the quality of financial information, to contribute to the financial stability and transparency of the banking system. The main changes introduced to the CNCB correspond to: 1) Incorporation of IFRS 9 with the exception of the chapter on impairment of loans classified as “financial assets at amortized cost”. This exception is mainly due to prudential criteria set by the CMF. These criteria have given rise, over time, to the establishment of standard models that the banking institutions must apply to determine the impairment of the loan portfolio. 193 2) Changes in the presentation formats of the Statement of Financial Position and Income Statement, when adopting IFRS 9 in replacement of IAS 39. 3) Incorporation of new presentation formats for the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income and the Statement of Changes in Equity and guidelines on financing and investment activities for the Statement of Cash Flows. 4) Incorporation of a financial report “Management Comments” (according to the IASB Practice Document No. 1), which will complement the information provided by the interim and annual financial statements. 5) Modifications of some notes of the financial statements, among which are: Financial assets at amortized cost and Risk management, in order to better comply with the disclosure criteria contained in the IFRS 7. In addition, disclosures about related parties are aligned according to IAS 24. 6) Changes in the accounting plan of Chapter C-3 of the CNCB, both in the accounts coding as well as in their description. The foregoing corresponds to the detailed information of the formats for the Statement of Financial Position, the Income Statement and the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income. 7) Modification of the criteria for the suspension of the recognition of interest income on an accrual basis, when any credit or one of its payments presents a default greater than 3 months (Chapter B-2 of the CNCB). 8) Adaptation of the limitations and precisions to the use of IFRS contained in Chapter A-2 of the CNCB. The new standards will be applicable from January 1, 2021, with a transition date on January 1, 2020, for the comparative financial statements purposes that must be published as of March 2021. Notwithstanding the above, the change of criteria for the suspension of the recognition of interest income on an accrual basis as provided in Chapter B-2, must be adopted no later than January 1, 2021. The effects of the application of the suspension rule of Interest and readjustments when any credit or one of its payments presents a default greater than 3 months will not have a significant impact on the Bank’s results. The Bank and its subsidiaries have prepared a work plan and allocated the necessary resources to address implementation of the modifications to the CNCB. The foregoing was with the purpose of complying with the new standards required for the preparation and presentation of the Financial Statements. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries 4. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES: The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of this Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those used in the preparation of the annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, except for the adoption of new regulations in force at 1 January 2019. As of January 1, 2019, the Bank first adopted IFRS 16 Leases, for the purposes of the initial application, it was decided to recognize the cumulative effect on the date of initial adoption (January 1, 2019), not restating comparative information, accounting for a right-of-use asset for an amount equal to the lease liability for an amount of Ch$144,497 million (See Note No. 16 letter d)).

Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries 6. BUSINESS SEGMENTS: For management purposes, the Bank is organized into four segments, which are defined based on the types of products and services offered, and the type of client in which focuses as described below: Retail: This segment focuses on individuals and small and medium-sized companies (SMEs) with annual sales up to UF 70,000, where the product offering focuses primarily on consumer loans, commercial loans, checking accounts, credit cards, credit lines and mortgage loans. Wholesale: This segment focused on corporate clients and large companies, whose annual revenue exceed UF 70,000, where the product offering focuses primarily on commercial loans, checking accounts and liquidity management services, debt instruments, foreign trade, derivative contracts and leases. Treasury: This segment includes the associated revenues to the management of the investment portfolio and the business of financial transactions and currency trading. Transactions with customers carried out by the Treasury are reflected in the respective aforementioned segments. These products are highly transaction-focused and include foreign exchange transactions, derivatives and financial instruments in general, among others. 196 Subsidiaries: Corresponds to the businesses generated by the companies controlled by the Bank, which carry out activities complementary to the bank business. The companies that comprise this segment are: Entity – Banchile Administradora General de Fondos S.A. – Banchile Asesoría Financiera S.A. – Banchile Corredores de Seguros Ltda. – Banchile Corredores de Bolsa S.A. – Banchile Securitizadora S.A. – Socofin S.A. Annual Report 2019 The financial information used to measure the performance of the Bank’s business segments is not comparable with similar information from other financial institutions because each institution relies on its own definitions. The accounting policies applied to the segments is the same as those described in the summary of accounting principles. The Bank obtains the majority of the results for: interest, indexation and commissions and financial operations and changes, discounting provisions for credit risk and operating expenses. Management is mainly based on these concepts to evaluate the performance of the segments and make decisions about the goals and allocations of resources of each unit. Although the results of the segments reconcile with those of the Bank at the total level, this is not necessarily the case in terms of the different concepts, given that management is measured and controlled individually and not on a consolidated basis, applying the following criteria: • The net interest margin of loans and deposits is obtained aggregating the net financial margins of each individual operation of credit and uptake made by the bank. For these purposes, the volume of each operation and its contribution margin are considered, which in turn corresponds to the difference between the effective rate of the customer and the internal transfer price established according to the term and currency of each operation. Additionally, the net margin includes the result of interest and indexation from the accounting hedges. • The capital and its financial impacts on outcome have been assigned to each segment based on the risk-weighted assets. • Operational expenses are reflected at the level of the different functional areas of the Bank. The allocation of expenses from functional areas to business segments is done using different allocation criteria, at the level of the different concepts and expense items. Taxes are managed at a corporate level and are not allocated to business segments. 197 For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was no income from transactions with a customer or counterparty that accounted for 10% or more of the Bank’s total revenues.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES: Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries have defined a corporate framework for valuation and control related with the process to the fair value measurement. Within the established framework includes the Product Control Unit, which is independent of the business areas and reports to the Financial 272 Management and Control Division Manager. This function befall to the Financial Control and Treasury Manager, through the Financial Risk Information and Control Section, is responsible for independent verification of price and results of trading (including derivatives) and investment operations and all fair value measurements. To achieve the appropriate measurements and controls, the Bank and its subsidiaries, take into account at least the following aspects: (i) Industry standard valuation. To value financial instruments, Banco de Chile uses industry standard modeling; quota value, share price, discounted cash flows and valuation of options through Black-Scholes-Merton, according to the case. The input parameters for the valuation correspond to rates, prices and levels of volatility for different terms and market factors that are traded in the national and international market and that are provided by the main sources of the market. (ii) Quoted prices in active markets. The fair value for instruments with quoted prices in active markets is determined using daily quotes from electronic systems information (such as Bolsa de Comercio de Santiago, Bloomberg, LVA and Risk America, etc). This quote represents the price at which these instruments are regularly traded in the financial markets. (iii) Valuation techniques. If no specific quotes are available for the instrument to be valued, valuation techniques will be used to determine the fair value. Due to, in general, the valuation models require a set of market parameters as inputs, the aim is to maximize information based on observable or price-related quotations for similar instruments in active markets. To the extent there is no information in direct from the markets, data from external suppliers of information, prices of similar instruments and historical information are used to validate the valuation parameters. Annual Report 2019 (iv) Fair value adjustments. Part of the fair value process considers three adjustments to the market value, calculated based on the market parameters, including; a liquidity adjustment, a Bid/Offer adjustment and an adjustment is made for credit risk of derivatives (CVA and DVA). The calculation of the liquidity adjustment considers the size of the position in each factor, the particular liquidity of each factor, the relative size of Banco de Chile with respect to the market, and the liquidity observed in transactions recently carried out in the market. In turn, the Bid/Offer adjustment, represents the impact on the valuation of an instrument depending on whether the position corresponds to a long (bought) or a short (sold).To calculate this adjustment is used the direct quotes from active markets or indicative prices or derivatives of similar assets depending on the instrument, considering the Bid, Mid and Offer, respectively. Finally, the adjustment made for CVA and DVA for derivatives corresponds to the credit risk recognition of the issuer, either of the counterparty (CVA) or of Banco de Chile (DVA). Liquidity value adjustments are made to trading instruments (including derivatives) only, while Bid / Offer adjustments are made for trading instruments and available for sale. Adjustments for CVA / DVA are carried out only for derivatives. (v) Fair value control. A process of independent verification of prices and rates is executed daily, in order to control that the market parameters used by Banco de Chile in the valuation of the financial instruments relating to the current state of the market and from them the best estimate derived of the fair value. The objective of this process is to control that the official market parameters provided by the respective business area, before being entered into the valuation, are within acceptable ranges of differences when compared to the same set of parameters prepared independently by the Financial Risk Information and Control Section. As a result, value differences are obtained at the level of currency, product and portfolio. In the event significant differences exist, these differences are scaled according to the 273 amount of individual materiality of each market factor and aggregated at the portfolio level, according to the grouping levels within previously defined ranges. These ranges are approved by the Finance, International and Financial Risk Committee. Complementary and in parallel, the Financial Risk Information and Control Section generates and reports on a daily basis Profit and Loss (“P&L”) and Exposure to Market Risks, which allow for proper control and consistency of the parameters used in the valuation. (vi) Judgmental analysis and information to Management. In particular cases, where there are no market quotations for the instrument to be valued and there are no prices for similar transactions instruments or indicative parameters, a specific control and a reasoned analysis must be carried out in order to estimate the fair value of the operation. Within the valuation framework described in the Reasonable Value Policy (and its procedure) approved by the Board of Directors of Banco de Chile, a required level of approval is set in order to carry out transactions where market information is not available or it is not possible to infer prices or rates from it. (a) Hierarchy of instrument valued at Fair value: Banco de Chile and its subsidiaries, classify all the financial instruments among the following levels: Level 1: These are financial instruments whose fair value is calculated at quoted prices (unadjusted) in extracted from liquid and deep markets. For these instruments there are quotes or prices (return internal rates, quote value, price) the observable market, so that assumptions are not required to determine the value. In this level, the following instruments are considered: currency futures, debt instruments issued Chilean Central Bank and Treasury, which belong to benchmarks, mutual fund investments and equity shares. For the instruments of the Central Bank of Chile and the General Treasury of the Republic, all those mnemonics belonging to a Benchmark, in other words corresponding to one of the following categories published by the Santiago Stock Exchange, will Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries be considered as Level 1: Pesos-02, Pesos-03, Pesos-04, Pesos-05, Pesos-07, Pesos-10, UF-02, UF-04, UF-05, UF-07, UF-10, UF-20, UF-30. A Benchmark corresponds to a group of mnemonics that are similar in duration and are traded in an equivalent way, i.e., the price (return internal rates in this case) obtained is the same for all the instruments that make up a Benchmark. This feature defines a greater depth of market, with daily quotations that allow classifying these instruments as Level 1. In the case of debt issued by the Government, the internal rate of return of the market is used to discount all flows to present value. In the case of mutual funds and equity shares, the current market price per share, which multiplied by the number of instruments results in the fair value. The preceding described valuation methodology is equivalent to the one used by the Bolsa de Comercio de Santiago (Santiago Stock Exchange) and correspond to the standard methodology used in the market. Level 2: They are financial instruments whose fair value is calculated based on prices other than in quoted in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, directly (that is, as prices or internal rates of return) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices or internal rates of return from similar instruments). These categories include: a) Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. b) Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. c) Inputs data other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. d) Inputs data corroborated by the market. 274 At this level there are mainly derivatives instruments, debt issued by banks, debt issues of Chilean and foreign companies, issued in Chile or abroad, mortgage claims, financial brokerage instruments and some issuances by the Central Bank of Chile and the General Treasury of the Republic, which do not belong to benchmarks. To value derivatives, depends on whether they are impacted by volatility as a relevant market factor in standard valuation methodologies; for options the Black-Scholes-Merton formula is used; for the rest of the derivatives, forwards and swaps, discounted cash flows method is used. For the remaining instruments at this level, as for debt issues of level 1, the valuation is done through cash flows model by using an internal rate of return that can be derived or estimated from internal rates of return of similar securities as mentioned above. In the event that there is no observable price for an instrument in a specific term, the price will be inferred from the interpolation between periods that have observable quoted price in active markets. These models incorporate various market variables, including the credit quality of counterparties, exchange rates and interest rate curves. Annual Report 2019 Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 2 Instrument: Type of Financial Instrument Valuation Method Description: Inputs and Sources Prices (internal rates of return) are provided by third party price providers that are widely used in the Chilean market.

Cross Currency Swaps, Offshore rates and spreads are obtained from third party price providers Interest Rate Swaps, that are widely used in the Chilean market. FX Forwards, Inflation Forwards Zero Coupon rates are calculated by using the bootstrapping method over swap rates. Prices for volatility surface estimates are obtained from market brokers FX Options Black-Scholes Model that are widely used in the Chilean market. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries Level 3: These are financial instruments whose fair value is determined using non-observable inputs data neither for the assets or liabilities under analysis nor for similar instruments. An adjustment to an input that is significant to the entire measurement can result in a fair value measurement classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, if the adjustment uses significant non-observable data entry. The instruments likely to be classified as level 3 are mainly Corporate Debt by Chilean and foreign companies, issued both in Chile and abroad. Valuation Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Instrument: Type of Financial Instrument Valuation Method Description: Inputs and Sources Since inputs for these types of securities are not observable by the market, we model interest rate of returns for them based on a Base Yield Local Bank and Discounted cash (Central Bank Bonds) and issuer spread. These inputs (base yield and Corporate Bonds flows model issuer spread) are provided on a daily basis by third party price providers that are widely used in the Chilean market. Since inputs for these types of securities are not observable by the market, we model interest rate of returns for them based on a Base Yield Offshore Bank and Corporate Discounted cash (US-Libor) and issuer spread. These inputs (base yield and issuer spread) Bonds flows model are provided on a weekly basis by third party price providers that are 276 widely used in the Chilean market.

In the case of the financial assets listed in the table above, which correspond to Bank Bonds and Corporate Bonds, it was considered that, since there are no current observables prices, the input prices will be based on brokers’ quotes. The prices are usually calculated as a base rate plus a spread. For Local Bonds it was determined to apply a 10% impact on the price, while for the Off Shore Bonds it was determined to apply a 10% impact only on the spread, since the base rate is covered by interest rate swaps instruments in the so-called accounting hedges. The 10% impact is considered a reasonable move taking into account the market performance of these instruments and comparing it against the bid / offer adjustment that is provisioned by these instruments.

This assumption is applied to the following assets and liabilities: Assets: Liabilities: Cash and deposits in banks Current accounts and other demand deposits Transactions in the course of collection Transactions in the course of payments Investments under resale agreements Obligations under repurchase agreements -Loans and advance to domestic banks • Loans to Customers and Advance to foreign banks: Fair value is determined by using the discounted cash flow model and internally generated discount rates, based on internal transfer rates derived from our internal transfer price policy. Once the present value is determined, we deduct the related loan loss allowances in order to incorporate the credit risk associated with each contract or loan. As we use internally generated parameters for valuation purposes, we categorize these instruments in Level 3. • Letters of Credit and Bonds: In order to determine the present value of contractual cash flows, we apply the discounted cash flow model by using market interest rates that are available in the market, either for the instruments under valuation or instruments with similar features that fit valuation needs in terms of currency, maturities and liquidity. The market interest rates are obtained from third party 282 price providers widely used by the market. As a result of the valuation technique and the quality of inputs (observable) used for valuation, we categorize these financial liabilities in Level 2. • Saving Accounts, Time Deposits, Borrowings from Financial Institutions, Subordinated Bonds and Other borrowings financial: The discounted cash flow model is used to obtain the present value of committed cash flows by applying a bucket approach and average adjusted discount rates that derived from both market rates for instruments with similar features and our internal transfer price policy. As we use internally generated parameters and/or apply significant judgmental analysis for valuation purposes, we categorize these financial liabilities in Level 3. Annual Report 2019 (g) Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities: The Bank trades financial derivatives with foreign counterparties using ISDA Master Agreement (International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.), under legal jurisdiction of the City of New York – USA or London – United Kingdom. Legal framework in these jurisdictions, along with documentation mentioned, it allows Banco de Chile the right to anticipate the maturity of the transaction and then, offset the net value of those transactions in case of default of counterparty. Additionally, the Bank has negotiated with these counterparties an additional annex (CSA Credit Support Annex), that includes other credit mitigating, such as entering margins on a certain amount of net value of transactions, early termination (optional or mandatory) of transactions at certain dates in the future, coupon adjustment of transaction in exchange for payment of the debtor counterpart over a certain threshold amount, etc. Below are detail the contracts susceptible to offset: Negative Fair Value Positive Fair Value of contracts with right of contracts with right Fair Value to offset to offset Financial Collateral Net Fair Value 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ MCh$ Derivative financial 2,786,215 1,513,947 (952,762) (582,210) (1,161,208) (424,920) (43,337) (30,036) 628,908 476,781 assets 283 Derivative financial 2,818,121 1,528,357 (952,762) (582,210) (1,161,208) (424,920) (418,988) (233,450) 285,163 287,777 liabilities Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries 40.

Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries (vii) Corporate Risk Governance Structure The bank corporate governance considers the active participation of the Board, who establishes the policies and guidelines regarding the accepted risk levels, the Administration being responsible for the control and compliance with the provisions set forth by the Board, together with the setting of standards and procedures related. Likewise, the Board establishes the guidelines for the development and validation of models, approves the provisions models and pronounced about the sufficiency of provisions. At the administration level, the Retail Credit Risk, Wholesale Credit Risk and Global Risk Control divisions comprise the corporate risk governance structure, which through specialized teams, added to a robust regulatory framework of processes and procedures allow optimal management and effective in the subjects they address. The first two are responsible for the credit risk in the admission, monitoring and recovery phases, in the respective Retail and Wholesale segments. Along with this, in the Retail Credit Risk Division the different methodologies related to regulatory and management aspects are developed. The Wholesale Credit Risk Division, in turn, has a Market Risk Area responsible for measuring, limiting, controlling and reporting said risk along with the valuation standards definition. The Global Risk Control Division through the Operational and Technological Risk Areas, which incorporates Business Continuity, is responsible for controlling those risks, also has an Internal Validation Area of Risk Models. Additionally, the Bank has a Cybersecurity Division, focused on protecting and monitoring the most sensitive assets of the organization, being able to provide security and confidence to customers and collaborators, whose main objective is to have a secure bank, cyberresilient and prepared to face any type of threat that puts the reputation and information of the organization at risk. These divisions have teams with extensive experience and knowledge in each area associated with credit and market risks, ensuring 288 their integral and consolidated management, including the Bank and its subsidiaries. (b) Internal Audit The risk management processes of the entire Bank are permanently audited by the Internal Audit Area, which examines the sufficiency of the procedures and their compliance. Internal Audit discusses the results of all evaluations with the administration and reports its findings and recommendations to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee. (c) Measurement Methodology Regarding to Credit Risk, provision levels and portfolio expenses are the basic measures for determining the credit quality of our portfolio. Banco de Chile permanently evaluates its loan portfolio, timely recognizing the associated level of risk of the loan portfolio. For this comprehensive credit risk assessment, there are policies, standards, procedures, along with models developed in accordance with the instructions issued by the Financial Market Commission (“CMF”) and approved by the Board of Directors. As a result of this evaluation, on both individual and group portfolios, the level of provisions that the bank should constitute is determined, in the event of customers payment default. The individual evaluation mainly applies to the Bank’s portfolio of legal persons that, due to their size, complexity or indebtedness, requires a more detailed level of knowledge and a case-by-case analysis. Each debtor individually assessed is assigned one of the 16 risk categories defined by the CMF, in order to establish the provisions in a timely and appropriate manner. This review of the portfolio risk classifications is carried out permanently considering the financial situation, payment behavior and the environment of each client. The group evaluation mainly applies to the portfolio of natural persons and smaller companies. These assessments are carried out monthly through statistical models that allow estimating the appropriate level of provisions necessary to cover the portfolio risk. The consistency of the models is analyzed through an independent validation of the unit that develops them and, subsequently, through the analysis of retrospective tests that allow to compare the real losses with the expected ones. Annual Report 2019 The Bank annually performs a sufficiency test of provisions for the total portfolio of loans, in order to validate the quality and robustness of the risk assessment processes, verifying that the provisions constituted are sufficient to cover the losses that could be derive from the credit operations granted. The result of this analysis is presented to the Board of Directors, who declares on the sufficiency of the provisions in each year. Banco de Chile constitutes additional provisions with the objective of protecting itself from the risk of unpredictable economic fluctuations that may affect the macroeconomic environment or the situation of a specific economic sector. The amount of additional provisions to be constituted or released is annually proposed to the Portfolio Risk Committee and subsequently to the Board of Directors for approval. The monitoring and control of risks are carried out mainly based on limits established by the Board of Directors. These limits reflect the Bank’s business and market strategy, as well as the level of risk that it is willing to accept, with additional emphasis on the selected industries. The Bank’s General Manager receives on daily basis, and the Finance, International and Financial Risk Committee on a monthly basis, the evolution of the Bank’s price and liquidity risk status, both according to internal metrics and those imposed by the regulators. (2) Credit Risk: Credit risk considers the likelihood that the counterparty in the credit operation will not meet its contractual obligation due to incapacity or financial insolvency, and this leads to a potential credit loss. Credit risk management has a relevant focus on the adequate risk-return relation, is permanent and considers the processes of admission, monitoring and recovery of loans granted. In this management, an adequate balance of the risks assumed is taken into account, ensuring 289 the solvency of the Bank over time. The established credit risk policies and processes recognize the singularities that exist in the different markets and segments, and grant a specialized treatment to each of them. The above results in the following management principles: 1. Rigorous evaluation in the admission process applying the defined credit risk policies, their associated rules and procedures, together with the availability of sufficient and accurate information. This implies analyzing the generation of flows and solvency of the client to meet the payment commitments and, when the characteristics of the operation merit it, must constitute adequate collateral that allow mitigating the risk incurred with the client. 2. Have permanent and robust portfolio tracking processes, through systems that alert both the potential signs of impairment in relation to the conditions of origin, as well as the possible business opportunities with those clients that present a better payments quality and behavior. 3. To develop advanced modeling and data management tools that allow for efficient decision-making at different stages of the credit process. 4. Have a collection structure with agile and efficient processes that allow carrying out procedures according to the different types of defaults presented by the clients. 5. Maintain an efficient administration in work teams organization, tools and availability of information that allow an optimal credit risk management. Credit Risk Divisions continuously manage risk knowledge in order to contribute to the business and anticipate threats that may affect the solvency and quality of the portfolio. Its mission is to establish the Credit Risk management framework for the different segments of the Bank, within the defined regulatory scope and at the risk established by the entity, through a portfolio vision that allows us to manage, resolve and control the process of approval of operations related to the different portfolios of the Bank, in an efficient and proactive manner.. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries a) Retail Segments: Admission management in these segments is mainly carried out through an evaluation that uses scoring tools, accompanied by an adequate model of credit attributions, which are required to approve each operation. These evaluations take into account the level of indebtedness, payment capacity and the maximum acceptable exposure for the client. In these segments, the Bank has segregated functions, distributed in the following areas: − Model Area, has the responsibility of constructing statistical models, establishing the variables and their respective weightings. These models are validated by the Model Validation Area and submitted to the Models Technical Committee before approval in the Portfolio Risk Committee or the Board of Directors, as appropriate. − Area of Integration in Management is responsible for incorporating statistical models in credit evaluation processes, ensuring an adequate linkage of the decision. − Admission Area performs the evaluation of operations and clients, with specialization by regions and segments, which favors their knowledge of clients and socio-economic background. It also maintains a framework of policies and standards that ensure the quality of the portfolio according to the desired risk, defining guidelines for the admission of clients that are released to commercial and risk areas through programs and continuous training. − Model and Portfolio Tracking Area is responsible for evaluating and measuring the performance of the models and the behavior of the portfolios, the latter especially through the monitoring of the main indicators of aggregate portfolio and layers analysis, reported in management reports, generating relevant information for decision making in different defined instances. This Area also ensures proper execution of the strategy, meeting the objectives of risk quality and return. − Collection Area performs a cross-collection management in the Bank and centralizes recovery management in retail segments through Socofin, Bank’s subsidiary company, defining refinancing criteria and payment agreements with customers, along with the incorporation 290 of robust tools for collection management b) Wholesale Segments: Admission management in these segments is based on an individual evaluation of the client and if it belongs to a group of companies, the relationship of the rest of the group with the Bank is also considered. This individual and group evaluation, if applicable, considers, among others, the financial capacity with emphasis on equity solvency, generation capacity, exposure levels, industry variables, evaluation of partners and management and aspects of the operation such as financing, term, products and possible collaterals. This process is supported by a rating model that allows greater homogeneity in the evaluation of the client and his group. Additionally, for the evaluation of clients, there are specialized areas in some segments that, due to their nature, require expert knowledge, such as real estate, construction, agricultural, financial, and international, among others. The permanent monitoring of the portfolio is carried out in a centralized manner, based on information periodically updated by both the client and the industry. Monitoring of compliance with the special conditions established in the admission stage is carried out, such as controls of financial covenants, coverage of certain collaterals and restrictions imposed at the time of approval. Alerts are also generated through monitoring to ensure the correct classification of the individual portfolio. Additionally, within the Admission areas, joint tasks are carried out that allow monitoring the development of operations from their gestation to their recovery, in order to ensure that the portfolio’s risks are well recognized in a timely manner. Upon detection of clients that show signs of impairment or default with any condition, the commercial area to which the client belongs together with the Wholesale Credit Risk Division, establish action plans to regularize said situation. In those cases where they present problems in the recovery of their credits, there is the area of Special Asset Management, belonging to the Wholesale Credit Risk Division, in charge of the collection management, establishing action plans and negotiations based on the particular characteristics of each client. c) Portfolio Concentration: The maximum exposure to credit risk, by client or counterparty, without taking into account guarantees or other credit enhancements as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, does not exceed 10% of the Bank’s effective equity.

To date, the following mitigating tactics are used: • Accelerating transactions and net payment using market values at the date of default of one of the parties. • Option for both parties to terminate early any transactions with a counterparty at a given date, using market values as of the respective date. • Margins established with time deposits by customers that close FX forwards with subsidiary Banchile Corredores de Bolsa S.A. The value of the guarantees that the Bank maintains related to the loans individually classified as impaired as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted Ch$100,133 million and Ch$85,721 million, respectively. The value guarantees related to past due loans but no impaired as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted Ch$344,098 million and Ch$295,634 million respectively. (e) Credit Quality by Asset Class: The Bank determines the credit quality of financial assets using internal credit ratings. The rating process is linked to the Bank’s approval and monitoring processes and is carried out in accordance with risk categories established by current standards. Credit quality is continuously updated based on any favorable or unfavorable developments to customers or their environments, considering aspects such as commercial and payment behavior as well as financial information. The Bank also conducts reviews of companies in certain industry sectors that are affected by macroeconomic or sector-specific variables. Such reviews allow the Bank to timely establish any necessary allowance loan losses that are sufficient to cover losses for potentially 299 uncollectable loans.

All of these assets are managed for sale. (g) Renegotiated Assets: The impaired loans are considered to be renegotiated when the corresponding financial commitments are restructured and the Bank assesses the probability of recovery as sufficiently high. 302 The following table details the book value of loans with renegotiated terms per financial asset class: 2019 2018 Financial Assets MCh$ MCh$ Loans and advances to banks Central Bank of Chile — — Domestic banks — — Foreign banks — — Subtotal — — Loans to customers, net Commercial loans 220,056 192,646 Residential mortgage loans 11,980 14,463 Consumer loans 366,339 362,562 Subtotal 598,375 569,671 Total renegotiated financial assets 598,375 569,671 The Bank evaluates allowances loan losses in two segments: individually assessed allowances loan losses and group assessed allowances loan losses, which are described in Note No. 2 letter (m). Annual Report 2019 (3) Market Risk: Market Risk refers to the loss that the Bank could face due to a liquidity shortage to honor the payments or close financial transactions in a timely manner (Liquidity Risk), or due to adverse movements in the values of market variables (Risk Price). (a) Liquidity Risk: Liquidity Risk Measurement and Limits The Bank manages the Liquidity Risk separately for each sub-category: Trading Liquidity Risk and Funding Liquidity Risk. Trading Liquidity Risk is the inability to close, at current market prices, the financial positions opened mainly from the Trading Book (which is daily valued at market prices and the value differences instantly reflected in the Income Statement). This risk is controlled by establishing limits on the positions amounts of the Trading Book in accordance with what is estimated to be closed in a short time period. Additionally, the Bank incorporates a negative impact on the Income Statement whenever it considers that the size of a certain position in the Trading Book exceeds the reasonable amount, negotiated in the secondary markets, which would allow the exposure to be offset without altering market prices. Funding Liquidity Risk refers to the Bank’s inability to obtain sufficient cash to meet its immediate obligations. This risk is managed by a minimum amount of highly liquid assets called liquidity buffer, and establishing limits and controls of internal metrics, among which the Market Access Report (“MAR”) stands out, which estimates the amount of funding that the Bank would need from wholesale financial counterparties, for the next 30 and 90 days in each of the relevant currencies of the balance sheet, to face a cash need as a result of the operation under business as usual conditions, that is, basically, rollover of the total loans portfolio, the output of a volatile part of the 303 demand deposits accounts and of the retailers term deposits, and the expiration of all the wholesalers term deposits. The use of MAR within year 2019 is illustrated below (LCCY = local currency; FCCY = foreign currency): MAR LCCY + FCCY MAR FCCY MMM$ MMUS$ 1 30 days 1 90 days 1 30 days 1 90 days Maximum 3,352 5,498 1,999 3,254 Minimum 1,705 3,993 1 1,407 Average 2,621 4,841 1,052 2,479 The Bank also monitors the amount of assets denominated in local currency that is funded by liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including all tenors and the cash flows generated by derivatives payments to be made in foreign currency in the future. This metric is referred to as Cross Currency Funding. The Bank oversees and limits this amount in order to take precautions against not only Banco de Chile’s event but also against a systemic adverse environment generated by a country risk event that might trigger lack of foreign currency funding. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries The use of Cross Currency Funding within year 2019 is illustrated below: Cross Currency Funding MMUS$ Maximum 3,339 Minimum 1,742 Average 2,640 Additionally, the Bank establishes thresholds that alert behaviors outside the expected ranges at a normal or prudent level of operation, in order to protect other dimensions of liquidity risk such as, for example, the maturities concentration of fund providers; the diversification of sources of funds either by type of counterparty or type of product, among others. Likewise, the evolution over time of the Bank’s financial ratios that can detect structural changes in its balance sheet characteristics is monitored, such as those presented in the following table and whose relevant use values during the year 2019 are shown below: Liquid Assets/ Liabilities>1 year/ Deposits/ Net Funding <30 days Assets >1 year Loans Maximum 103% 82% 62% 304 Minimum 82% 76% 58% Average 92% 78% 60% Moreover, some market index, prices and monetary decisions taken by the Central Bank of Chile are monitored to detect structural changes in market conditions that can trigger a liquidity shortage or even a financial crisis. The Bank measures and controls the mismatch of cash flows under regulatory standards with the C46 index report, which represents the net cash flows expected over time as a result of the contractual maturity of almost all assets and liabilities. Additionally, the Commission for the Financial Market (hereinafter, “CMF”) authorized Banco de Chile, among others, to report the adjusted C46 index. This allows the Bank to report, in addition to the regular C46 index, outflow behavior assumptions of certain specific elements of the liability, such as demand deposits and time deposits. In addition, the regulator also requires some rollover assumptions for the loan portfolio. Annual Report 2019 The CMF establish the following limits for the C46: Foreign balance sheet items: 1-30 days C46 index < 1 x Tier-1 Capital All Currencies balance sheet items: 1-30 days C46 index < 1 x Tier-1 Capital All Currencies balance sheet items: 1-90 days C46 index < 2 x Tier-1 Capital The use of this index in year 2019 is illustrated below: Adjusted C46 All CCYs Adjusted C46 FCCY as part of Tier-1 Capital as part of Tier-1 Capital 1 30 days 1 90 days 1 30 days Maximum 0.56 0.79 0.42 Minimum 0.32 0.55 0.15 Average 0.49 0.69 0.28 Regulatory Limit 1.0 2.0 1.0 Additionally, the regulatory entities have introduced other metrics that the Bank uses in its management, such as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”) and Net Stable Financing Ratio (“NSFR”), using assumptions similar to those used in the international banking. Only for the first one, a limit implementation calendar has been established and that during the year 2019 was with a minimum level of 60%. The evolution of the LCR and NSFR metrics during the year 2019 are shown below: 305 LCR NSFR Maximum 1.17 1.02 Minimum 0.88 0.97 Average 0.99 0.99 Regulatory Limit 0.6 (*) N/A (*) This is the current minimum value for the year 2019 and that increases 0.1 annually until reaching 1.0 in the year 2023.

In addition, the Bank reports metrics to regulatory entities according to the models defined by them. The bank has established internal limits for the exposures of the Trading Book. In fact, FX positions (FX delta), Equity positions (Equity delta), interest rate sensitivities generated by the derivatives and debt securities portfolios (DV01 or also referred as to rho) and the FX volatility sensitivity (vega) are measured, reported and against their limits. Limits are established on an aggregate basis but also for some specific tenor points. The use of these limits is daily monitored, controlled and reported by independent control functions to the senior management of the bank. The internal governance framework also establishes that these limits must be approved by the board and reviewed at least annually. The Bank measures and controls the risk for the Trading Book portfolios using the Value-at-Risk (VaR). The model uses a 99% confidence level and the most recent one-year observed rates, prices and yields data. The use of VaR within year 2019 is illustrated below: Value-at-Risk 99% one-day confidence level 307 MCh$ Maximum 872 Minimum 176 Average 562 Additionally, the Bank performs measuring, limiting, controlling and reporting interest rate exposures and risks for the Accrual Book using internally developed methodologies based on the differences in the amounts of assets and liabilities considering the interest rate repricing dates. Exposures are measured according to the Interest Rate Exposure or IRE metric and their corresponding risks using to the Earnings-at-Risk or EaR metric. Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries The use of EaR within year 2019 is illustrated below: 12months Earnings-at-Risk 99% confidence level 3 months defeasance period MCh$ Maximum 54,372 Minimum 45,023 Average 47,743 The regulatory risk measurement for the Trading Book (C41 report) is produced by utilizing guidelines provided by the Central Bank of Chile (hereinafter, “BCCh”) and the CMF, which are adopted based on standardized BIS methodologies. The referred methodologies estimate the potential loss that the bank may incur considering standardized fluctuations of the value of market factors such as FX rates, interest rates and volatilities that may adversely impact the value of FX spot positions, interest rate exposures, and volatility exposures, respectively. In addition, correlation factors are included to represent non-parallel changes in the yield curve. The CMF does not set an individual limit for this particular risk, but a global one that includes this risk (also called Market Risk Equivalent or MRE) and the Credit Risk Weighted Assets. The risk measurement for the Banking Book, according to normative guidelines (C40 report), as a result of interest rate fluctuations is carried out through the use of standardized methodologies provided by regulatory entities (BCCh and CMF). The report includes models for reporting interest rate gaps and standardized adverse interest rate fluctuations. In addition to this, the regulatory entity has requested 308 banks to establish internal limits for this regulatory risk measurement. Limits must be established separately for short-term and long-term balance. The short-term risk limit should be expressed as a percentage of the Net Interest Margin or NIM plus the revenue collected from commissions that depend on the level of the interest rate; the long-term risk limit cannot exceed a specific percentage of the amount of effective equity. In addition to the above, the Market Risk Policy of Banco de Chile enforces to perform daily stress tests for the Trading Book and monthly for the Accrual Book. The output of the stress testing process is monitored against corresponding trigger levels: in the case those triggers are breached, the senior management is notified in order to implement further actions, if necessary. In addition, the results during the month for the trading activities are controlled against defined loss levels and in case such levels are exceeded, senior management is also notified.

Annual Report 2019 Price Risk Sensitivity Analysis The Bank uses stress tests as the main sensitivity analysis tool for Price Risk. The analysis is implemented for the Trading Book and the Accrual Book separately. The Bank has adopted this tool as it is considered more useful than fluctuations in business as usual scenario, such as VaR or EaR, given that: (i) The financial crisis show market factors fluctuations that are materially larger than those used in the VaR with 99% of confidence level or EaR with 99% of confidence level. (ii) The financial crisis also show that correlations between these fluctuations are materially different from those used in the VaR computation, since a crisis precisely indicates severe disconnections between the behaviors of market factors fluctuations respect to the patterns observed under normal conditions. (iii) Trading liquidity dramatically diminishes during financial distress and especially in emerging markets. Therefore, the overnight VaR number might not be representative of the loss for trading portfolios in such environment since closing exposures period may exceed one business day. This may also happen when calculating EaR, even considering three months as the closing period. The impacts are determined by mathematical simulations of fluctuations in the values o ​​ f market factors, and also, estimating the changes of the economic and / or accounting value of the financial positions. In order to comply with IFRS 7.40, the following exercise was included illustrating an estimation of the impact of extreme but reasonable fluctuations of interest rates, swaps yields, FX rates and exchange volatility, which are used for valuing Trading and Accrual portfolios. Given that the Bank’s portfolio includes positions denominated in nominal and real interest rates, these fluctuations must be aligned with 311 extreme but realistic Chilean inflation changes forecasts. The exercise is implemented in a simple way: Trading portfolios impacts are estimated by multiplying the sensitivities by the fluctuations obtained as the results of mathematical simulations over a two-week time horizon and using the maximum historical volatility of the last fifteen years in each of the market factors; Accrual portfolios impacts are estimated by multiplying cumulative gaps by forward interest rates fluctuations modeled over a three-month time horizon and using the maximum historical volatility of interest fluctuations but limited by maximum fluctuations and / or levels observed during the last fifteen years. It is relevant to note that the methodology might ignore some portion of the interest rates convexity, since it is not captured properly when large fluctuations are modeled. In any case, given the magnitude of the changes, the methodology may be reasonable enough for the purposes and scope of the analysis. The following table illustrates the fluctuations resulting from the main market factors in the maximum stress test exercise, or more adverse, for the Trading Book. The directions or signs of these fluctuations are those that correspond to those that generate the most adverse impact at the aggregate level. Average Fluctuations of Market Factors for Maximum Stress Scenario Trading Book CLP CLP CLF CLF USD Offshore Libor Spread USD On/Off Derivatives Bonds Derivatives Bonds Derivatives Derivatives (bps) (bps) (bps) (bps) (bps) (bps) Less than 1 year 103 47 163 108 -62 -9 Greater than 1 year 38 69 92 123 -73 -2 bps = basis points Consolidated Financial Statements Banco de Chile and Subsidiaries The worst impact on the Bank’s Trading Book as of December 31, 2019, as a result of the simulation process described above, is as follows: Most Adverse Stress Scenario P&L Impact Trading Book MCh$ CLP Interest Rate (4,968) Derivatives (3,006) Debt instruments (1,962) CLF Interest Rate (8,694) Derivatives (2,600) Debt instruments (6,094) Interest rate USD offshore (1,963) Domestic/offshore interest rate spread USD (50) Total Interest rates (15,675) Total FX (16) Total FX Options 224 Total (15,467) 312 The modeled scenario would generate losses in the Trading Book for approximately MCh$15,500. In any case, such fluctuations would not result in material losses compared to Basic Capital (Tier-1) or to the P&L estimate for the next 12-months. The impact on the Accrual Book for the next 12 months as of December 31, 2019, which does not necessarily mean a net loss / gain but a greater/lower net income from funds generation (resulting net interest rate generation), is illustrated below: Most Adverse Stress Scenario 12-Month Revenue Accrual Book MCh$ Impact by Base Interest Rate shocks (164,322) Impact due to Spreads Shocks (67) Higher / (Lower) Net revenues (164,389) The main negative impact on the Trading Book would occur as a result of a drastic increase in local interest rates. The lowest potential income in the next 12 months in the Accrual Book would occur in a scenario of sharp fall in inflation. In any case, the impacts would be less than the annual budgeted profits of the Bank. Annual Report 2019 (4) Requirements and Capital Management: The main objectives of the Bank’s capital management are to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, maintain a solid credit rating and sound capital ratios. During 2019, the Bank has successfully met the required capital requirements. As part of its Capital Management Policy, the Bank has established capital adequacy alerts, which are stricter than those required by the regulator, which are monitored on a monthly basis. During 2019, none of the internal alerts defined in the Capital Management Policy were activated. The Bank manages capital by making adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. For this purpose, the Bank may modify the amount of dividend payments to its shareholders or issue equity instruments. The capital adequacy of the Bank is monitored using, among other measures, the indexes and rules established by the CMF. Regulatory Capital According to the Chilean General Banking Law, Banks must maintain a minimum ratio of 8%, net of required provisions, as a result of dividing the Equity by the sum of the Consolidated Weighted Assets by Risk. In addition, banks must maintain a minimum ratio of Basic Capital to Total Consolidated Assets of 3%, net of required provisions. As a result of the merger of Banco de Chile with Citibank Chile in 2008, the CMF established that the institution was obliged to maintain the first reason Less than 10%. In this way, the regulatory body ratified the validity of the minimum of 10% that it had already set in December 2001 by authorizing the merger by absorption of Banco Edwards into Banco de Chile. Equity is determined from Capital and Reserves or Basic Capital with the following adjustments: (a) the balance of subordinated bonds 313 issued with a maximum equivalent to 50% of the Basic Capital is added and weighted according to their term at maturity; (b) the additional provisions for loans are added, (c) the balance of the assets corresponding to goodwill or overpaid and investments in companies not included in the consolidation is deducted, and (d) the balance of noncontrolling interest is added. Assets are weighted according to the risk categories, which are assigned a risk percentage that would reflect the amount of capital needed to support each of those assets. There are 5 risk categories (0%, 10%, 20%, 60% and 100%). For example, cash, deposits in other banks and financial instruments issued by the Central Bank of Chile have 0% risk, which means that, according to current standards, no capital is required to back these assets. Properties and equipment have a 100% risk, which means that they must have a minimum capital equivalent to 8% of the amount of these assets and in the case of the Bank of Chile 10%. All derivative instruments traded outside of stock exchanges are considered in the determination of risk assets with a conversion factor over the notional values, thus obtaining the amount of exposure to credit risk (or “credit equivalent”). The contingent credits out of balance are also considered by a “credit equivalent”, for their weighting.
