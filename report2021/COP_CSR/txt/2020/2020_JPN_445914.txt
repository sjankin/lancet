It has been promised that each country will actively work to achieve these goals. Daiwa Securities Group considers the SDGs to be important goals that give direction to the world, and will approach social issues as an important common language when conducting business in Japan and overseas. Our Values and SDGs Materiality Statements February 2018 Established SDGs Promotion Committee In 2018, we established the SDGs Promotion Committee chaired by Seiji Nakata, President and CEO. External committee members always participate to bring in fresh ideas and cutting-edge information from outside the company, and we are making Group-wide e orts to contribute to the SDGs. Structure of SDGs Promotion 2 SDGs report 2020 April 2018 Formulation of Medium-Term Management Plan (FY -FY ) 'Passion for the Best' 2020 In our Medium-term Management Plan Passion for the Best 2020, the basic policy is to provide high value-added solutions through our No. 1 quality consulting capabilities and provide new value as a hybrid comprehensive securities group.

The Group will deepen its e orts to achieve the SDGs based on this declaration. Daiwa Securities Group SDGs Declaration(Passion for SDGs 2018) 3 SDGs report 2020 May 2019 Announcement of SDGs Materiality and SDGs Promotion Action Plan In order to promote the SDGs in the entire Group, we believe that not only top-down promotion but also bottom-up e orts by employees are important, and we solicited a wide range of SDGs-related initiatives and ideas from employees. When soliciting ideas, we incorporated two perspectives: Forecasting that considers what we can do now, and Backcasting that considers what we can do based on the ideal image of the Group in 2030, the deadline for achieving the SDGs As a result, for Forecasting we gathered more than 4,200 ideas not only from the headquarters departments, but also from branch o ces in Japan, Group companies, and overseas bases. In the Backcasting approach, about 120 volunteers gathered through internal recruitment and made a proposal for the realization of the Group's 2030 vision. We identi ed issues from this bottom-up initiative, and summarized them by collating them with the demands from society, which we uncovered through communication with stakeholders and the knowledge of outside experts. Then, after discussions at the SDGs Promotion Committee, we nalized the Daiwa Securities Group's Priority Issues (SDGs Materiality). Furthermore, from this bottom-up initiative, we identi ed the matters that should be focused on to solve the priority issues, and compiled the Passion for SDGs 2019 -Daiwa Securities Group Action Plan-. SDGs Materiality identi cation process Passion for SDGs 2019 -Daiwa Securities Group Action PlanMay 2020 Announcement of SDGs Promotion KPIs for FY We have only 10 years left before 2030, the deadline for achieving the SDGs. Aiming to build a “Daiwa version of an SDG value chain” that generates a sustainable ow of funds, in order to accelerate the initiatives of our SDGs promotion action plan, we have set SDGs promotion KPIs for each action theme for this scal year, and have started trial operation. Based on these KPIs, we will monitor the status of progress and make revisions if necessary, aiming for full-scale operation in the next scal year and beyond. Passion for SDGs -Daiwa Securities Group Action Plan4 SDGs report 2020 Now, and looking to 2030 Moving forward to 2030, we are formulating “2030 Vision” for all executives and employees to share what the Group wants to be and what the Group should be, and to work as one on the creation of shared values. The Daiwa Securities Group will continue to work on initiatives for the resolution of social issues that incorporate the SDGs perspective, and will also make e orts to ensure that e ective initiatives take root in society. SDGs(Sustainable Development Goals） International goals up to 2030 adopted by the United Nations Summit in September 2015. 17 goals and 169 targets were set to realize a sustainable world. The SDGs question the ideal state of not only developing countries but also advanced countries including Japan, and pledge that No one will be left behind in the process of the initiatives. 5 SDGs report 2020 Message from CEO We will ful ll our role as an integrated securities group toward achieving the SDGs We have only 10 years to achieve the SDGs by 2030. In realizing a sustainable society, we must initiate action more proactively. Above all, prompt decision making is now needed in the face of a world of accelerating change due to the COVIDpandemic and frequent natural disasters. Looking ahead to the next 10 years, we will further strengthen collaborative Seiji Nakata relationships with all stakeholders. As top management, I will also endeavor to develop President and CEO mechanisms for the sustainable ow of funds, so that initiatives that are e ective in Daiwa Securities Group Inc. solving issues will not stagnate through shortage of funds. As part of our commitment to SDGs, we created a new post of Head of SDGs from this scal year, appointing a suitable executive, well-versed in overseas developments, who has worked alongside me with even greater enthusiasm in promoting the SDGs. We will continue to develop a system within the Group that enables all business contributing to the SDGs to be implemented speedily. We will continue to work proactively to solve social issues to remain a company that is needed by society in the next 100 years. We appreciate your continued interest in our Group philosophy. Message from the Head of SDGs Realizing a sustainable society has become the standard basis for management worldwide, and initiatives aimed at achieving the SDGs are no longer the exception for businesses. Daiwa Securities Group took the lead in the industry, introducing SDGs as the foundation for its management in 2018, and continues to drive initiatives companywide through the SDGs Promotion Committee. The deadline for achieving the SDGs is just 10 years away.

Through them, we hope to secure a Daiwa Securities Group Inc. breakthrough in these unprecedented circumstances, which we must apply for resolving the various challenges indicated in the 17 Goals. Consequently, from FY 2020, we have set KPIs so that those responsible for SDGs in each headquarters department and Group company can quantitatively monitor their progress for achieving the SDGs. In 2008, we issued the rst “Vaccine Bonds” in Japan, and since then, as a pioneer of SDG bonds, we have strived to resolve social issues through our business.

In FY , we established SDGs managers and the SDGs Advisory Group. The SDGs managers, who are appointed for each organization of the Group (each division and Group company), take charge of the promotion of SDGs business and the establishment and monitoring of the KPIs. The SDGs Advisory Group is an organization composed of personnel engaged in SDGand ESG-related work within the Daiwa Securities Group.

On the other hand, there is a shortage of funds necessary for achieving the SDGs. With this situation in mind, we will actively work to create shared value by capitalizing on the strengths of a comprehensive securities group and building “a Daiwa version of an SDG value chain” that will create a sustainable capital cycle. More speci cally, we aim to Expand the market through education and proliferation of SDGs Expand nancial products that meet the need for investing in SDGs Work on support to industries and companies that contribute to SDGs, through investment and consulting Appropriately evaluate the impact of such investment on society and provide feedback to investors, thereby helping to create more investment opportunities We will work proactively to encourage a favorable cycle of value generated from each of these processes. Initiatives in FY To accelerate the initiatives for our SDGs promotion Action Plan, we have set SDGs promotion KPIs for each action theme for this scal year, and have started trial operation. Based on those KPIs, we will monitor the status of progress and make revisions if necessary, aiming for full-scale operation in the next scal year and beyond. *1. Scope:Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. *2. Scope:Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd. 17 SDGs report 2020 Daiwa Securities Group SDGs Declaration Daiwa Securities Group recognizes Sustainable Development Goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as overarching goals to lead the world. Through our group business, we will work actively for realization of a prosperous society and improved people's life by pursuing both company's economic values and solution of social challenges at the same time. Creation of Shared values As an integrated securities group that provides wide range of services for various customer needs, we will address solutions of social challenges with exible mindset to create company's economic values and social values at the same time. Developing and realizing work styles for diverse human resources With measures like promotion of better work-life balance and success of female and veteran employees to create working environment in which our employees, regardless of their gender and age, would feel satisfying to work and they would demonstrate their potential fully, we will endeavor to develop diverse human capital and work styles. Stakeholders and Partnership By utilizing our group quality of taking a leading role in connecting countries, companies and investors, we aim for contribution to various social business solutions through partnership with each of our stakeholders. Increase recognition and enhance penetration We will try to increase awareness and deeper understanding of SDGs among both our employees and customers through our group business as a main player in nancial and capital market. 18 SDGs report 2020 Role and Social Responsibilities of the Securities Business At Daiwa Securities Group, we believe that our role is not only to maintain and develop a fair and dynamic nancial market, but also to incorporate a social perspective in nance in order to contribute to building a sustainable society. For example, the securities business our core operations plays a key role in society by building a bridge between the needs of investors to manage assets and those of the private and public sectors to raise funds. On investing in securities, we promote methods of investment that take ESG (environment, society, and governance) factors, such as environmental and social initiatives into account together with nancial information. Supporting Sound Financial and Capital Markets-Six Roles of the Daiwa Securities GroupWe support companies that need funds, from listing support to consulting. We will continue to support social infrastructure by creating a ow of funds, contributing to the creation of a soil where innovation is easy to occur, and the creation of a more active and stable nancial market. Role 1 Fund procurement by companies, etc. Companies issue capital by issuing securities (stocks and bonds) and use them to develop new products and provide new services. Financing using these securities will contribute to the growth of the company and the resulting economic growth. Daiwa Securities Group advises companies and others on nancing using securities. 19 SDGs report 2020 Role 2 Support for initial public o erings The emergence and growth of new companies is essential for economic growth. The initial listing will not only contribute to the growth of the company but also provide investment opportunities for various investors. The Group is assisting in the initial listing. Role 3 Assistance in trading of securities Securities such as stocks and bonds are mainly traded on markets such as stock exchanges. Securities companies help you buy and sell securities. It is also important to ensure that the securities traded are delivered correctly. Role 4 Assistance in asset building The Group o ers a wide range of products and services, and o ers proposals tailored to customers to help with life planning and asset formation. Role 5 Analysis and provision of information Many economists, analysts and strategists provide a wide variety of information that combines the latest trends and indepth analysis in an easy-to-understand format. Role 6 Protect market trust The market for securities is an important infrastructure of society and is built on the trust of participants. The Group strictly manages information and monitors transactions to ensure that the market is fair and fair. We are also actively working on dealing with ever-evolving trading methods and new issues. 20 SDGs report 2020 Responsible Action as an Institutional Investor Adoption of Japan's Stewardship Code The Financial Services Agency of Japan published “Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (Japan’s Stewardship Code)” in February 2014. The Code, which has been revised twice, encourages institutional investors to ful ll their responsibilities of enhancing the mediumto long-term investment return for their clients and bene ciaries by improving and fostering the investee companies’ corporate value and sustainable growth through constructive engagement, or purposeful dialogue, based on consideration of mediumto long-term sustainability including ESG factors consistent with their investment management strategies. In our Group, Daiwa Securities and Daiwa Asset Management have announced their adoption of the Code. Adoption of Principles for Responsible Institutional Investors (Japan’s Stewardship Code) Daiwa Securities Daiwa Asset Management System at Daiwa Asset Management Daiwa Asset Management announced its adoption of Japan's Stewardship Code in May 2014 and has been actively working to ful ll its stewardship responsibilities. It has been striving to improve its initiatives, renewing the announcement of its adoption in November 2017 following the revision of the Code in May 2017. In January 2017, Daiwa Asset Management set up the “Stewardship Supervisory Committee” which is designed to manage con icts of interest faced in ful lling its stewardship responsibilities. The Committee supervises the company's overall stewardship activities and is responsible for making reports to the Board of Directors and issuing recommendations to improve stewardship activities as necessary. The Committee is composed of outside directors and the compliance o cer, who takes charge of overseeing the management of con icts of interest. In that way, independence in the stewardship activities from management and business execution is secured. Daiwa Asset Management also established the Stewardship & ESG Section within the Investment Planning Department in October 2018 to help show the company’s speci c ESG initiatives and approach to parties within and outside the company. Moreover, Daiwa Asset Management published its “ESG Investment Policy” in January 2020 to clarify its approach to ESG. As of March 31, 2020, the amount of investment in consideration of ESG accounts for as much as 90.14% of the company’s assets under management. Regarding dialogues with investee companies, based on the Policy to Hold Constructive Dialogues with Investee Companies announced in June 2014, Daiwa Asset Management has conducted engagement activities aimed at accurately understanding the conditions of investees and sharing such assessments. As issues to be discussed with investee companies are changing, it reviewed the Policy in November 2018, re ecting the ndings gained through dialogue and the revision of Japan's Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code. Daiwa Asset Management recognizes that it also has duties regarding engagement for passive investment. Based on this recognition, it has been sending its “Policy on Exercising of Voting Rights” and information on its stewardship activities since 2018 to all of the approximately 2,200 investee companies incorporated in its domestic stock index funds. The company hopes this will help increase understanding of its stewardship activities and serve as the rst step toward dialogue. About Stewardship Activities ESG Investment Policy Voting Policy Voting with consideration of the impact of COVID21 SDGs report 2020 Speci cally, dialogues are led by the following three parties. Analysts in the Research Department: Constructive Dialogues The analysts in the Research Department engage in stewardship activities to contribute to enhancing corporate value and sustainable growth as part of their usual research activities. They held engagements with approximately 300 companies in FY (from January 2019 to December 2019; hereinafter the same). As fundamental tools for dialogues, Daiwa Asset Management has prepared and utilizes (a) the Analyst Handbook, which summarizes the fundamental stance and knowledge that serves as a basis for the analyst activities; (b) the Business Strategy Reference Book that analyzes companies’ management strategies; (c) the Qualitative Evaluation that evaluates companies from a mediumto longterm standpoint; and (d) the Long-term Corporate Value Model that determines the mediumto long-term fair value of companies. 22 SDGs report 2020 The Stewardship & ESG Section of the Investment Planning Department: Governance Meetings Personnel in charge of corporate governance collect information on investee companies required for exercising voting rights. In dialogues with investee companies, they explain their policies on exercising voting rights and what they expect from companies with respect to corporate governance, thereby sharing their knowledge with the investee companies. They conducted engagements with approximately 130 companies in FY . They also disclose how they exercised their voting rights for individual proposals from shareholder meetings held from April 2017 onwards. Engagement Team Comprising Analysts in the Research Department and Fund Managers: Engagement Meetings The engagement team held engagement with approximately 30 companies in FY , focusing on smallto medium-cap issues mainly incorporated in active investment funds for mediumto long-term investment. It continued to engage in constructive dialogue, delivering the “Long-term Vision and Medium-term Management Plan,” which summarizes points on information disclosure from a long-term perspective, and “Introduction of Daiwa Asset Management’s Engagement Policy,” which mainly describes what Daiwa Asset Management expects from investee companies and the issues that it wants to discuss through constructive dialogue. The team also held dialogue speci cally on the environment and social aspects. Daiwa Asset Management also conducts ES meetings—dialogues specializing in environmental impact and social responsibility. It strengthened ES meetings in FY as it believes that the importance of the environment (E) and society (S) will increase further if mediumto long-term corporate value is taken into consideration. Daiwa Asset Management has released a Report on the Status of Stewardship Activities on its website (only available in Japanese). The report includes the status of engagements, such as policy, structure, and the number of engagement times by theme, as well as ESG investment, the status of exercising of voting rights, and measures to improve stewardship activities. Participation in Initiatives Daiwa Securities Group has participated in, signed, and supports a variety of initiatives to contribute to developing a sustainable society through partnerships with various parties, including those in the nancial and business world. Participation in Initiatives 23 SDGs report 2020 Action through Product Development and Distribution For Addressing Social Issues and Contributing to Future Development of Society and Financial and Capital Markets Impact Investment Impact Investment is a type of investment that not only pursues economic bene ts, but also uses funds raised solely to solve social issues, such as poverty and environmental problems. Daiwa Securities Group sells SDG bonds,* which are issued by public organizations, nancial institutions, and other issuers for the purpose of solving social issues, to customers in Japan as a pioneer for Impact Investment bonds in the country. * A generic term for bonds the proceeds of which are used for projects that contribute to SDGs (including conventional Impact Investment bonds) [Japanese] Social Contribution through Investment-Impact InvestmentInitiatives in FY Climate change has become a serious threat to all countries. It is said that developing countries are being impacted rst and with the gravest results. Climate change may destroy the social initiatives for poverty issues that have been steadily carried out over the last several decades, and it is impossible to separate it from poverty issues. In the past few years, initiatives for SDGs have spread worldwide, and along with the expansion of the market for related bonds, customers’ interest in SDGs has been growing. As a pioneer for Impact Investment bonds in Japan, Daiwa 24 SDGs report 2020 Securities provides customers with opportunities to invest in bonds issued by public organizations, nancial institutions, and other issuers for the purpose of solving social issues. In September 2018, we sold MOL Blue Ocean Environmental Bonds, the rst green bonds issued by an operating company in Japan (sold by two securities companies—Daiwa Securities and Nomura Securities). These were green bonds issued in Japan following the Tokyo Green Bonds (foreign currency-denominated) issued by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in FY . Through the underwriting and sale of these bonds, Daiwa Securities aims to help expand trends towards utilizing precious funds from retail investors for environmental measures, and to this end, we continued with our initiatives in FY . Daiwa Securities Group will continue to contribute to solving social issues through its business activities, including the underwriting and sale of Green Bonds and other SDG bonds (Impact Investment bonds).

CDC Habitat owns and manages approximately 495,000 houses for public institutions and government employees in France. It contributes to France’s public policies by providing emergency shelters for people in a socially di cult situation and supporting the country’s social housing policy. DCME has developed a relationship with CDC over a period of many years. The initiative taken this time contributes to achieving SDG Goal 11 “Sustainable cities and communities,” which is aimed at making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. In November 2019, DCME also arranged 1 billion euro benchmark sustainability bonds issued by the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia as a co-lead manager. The proceeds will be used as funds for sustainability-related research, countermeasures against climate change, public health, education, and other projects in the state. Initiatives in FY Initiatives Taken by the Group's Overseas O ces In June 2020, Daiwa Capital Markets America acted as a sole lead manager for a sustainable development bond issued by Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). IDB is an international development nancial institution aiming to contribute to the economic and social development of Latin American and Caribbean member countries. It has announced that it would direct up to $12 billion of lending to support countries in their response to the COVIDpandemic and its consequences. The funds raised through this issuance will be used mainly for helping countries a ected by COVIDto strengthen their public health systems and purchase daily necessities and medical equipment. They will also be used for scal spending by local governments to respond to the COVIDpandemic and various measures for supporting economic recovery, such as job security measures. The issuance of the bond is aimed at achieving SDG Goal 3 “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” SRI Investment Trusts SRI investment trusts are a mixture of stocks and bonds that take into account factors other than nancial performance, such as ethics and social and environmental objectives, in addition to assessments of the sales and pro ts of the investment candidates. We o er eco funds that limit nonnancial assessments to environmental performance, and investment trusts that focus on Impact Investment and select issues from an SDG perspective. By investing in these trusts, through the nancial markets, investors can indirectly support countries and corporations that are proactively involved in ESG and SDG initiatives.

Daiwa Next Bank’s “Support Term Deposits” Support Term Deposits are designed to support hard-working people and organizations. Daiwa Next Bank donates an amount calculated by multiplying the balance of its Support Term Deposits by a certain rate to recipients chosen by customers. At present, it supports more than 10 organizations working on solving issues based on the following four themes: medical support to children; self-reliance support to children; support for sports for disabled people; and environmental preservation. Feedback received from customers includes: “This was a good opportunity to learn about social issues” and “I hope similar initiatives will become more widespread.” In December 2019, these Support Term Deposits received the special award “SDGs Partnership Award” in the third “Japan SDGs Award” in recognition of their remarkable contribution to achievement of SDGs. News from Daiwa Next Bank Initiatives for Solutions Business Many smalland medium-sized companies and small-scale enterprises are now facing the issue of business succession due to the aging of their operators. However, it is said that about half the managers exceeding the age of —the average retirement age—in the next 10 years are yet to decide on their successors. Moreover, even the continuity of their business activities, which support regional economies, has recently been adversely a ected by the unprecedented deterioration of management environment resulting from the COVIDpandemic. Daiwa Securities recognizes that it is its duty, as a nancial institution, to rmly support, in nancial terms, smalland medium-sized companies’ e orts to pass down their valuable business resources, employment, and technologies to the next generations, thereby helping to maintain regional supply chains. It will support the growth of the Japanese economy by encouraging the continuation, development, and growth of smalland medium-sized companies of good standing through providing inheritance, business succession, M&A and other solutions. Initiatives of Fund Wrap Services Daiwa Fund Wrap is a service enabling even those who are busy or have no investment experience to easily start mediumto long-term diversi ed investment. Under a discretionary investment contract, Daiwa Securities invests and manages assets on behalf of our customers. We o er plans that enable each customer to make diversi ed global investments 27 SDGs report 2020 according to their investment policy, as do professional institutional investors such as those managing public pension assets. It has become more important than ever for a large number of investors to manage their assets e ciently and stably through diversi ed global investment, in particular as a measure to address prolonged low interest rates, which have made it di cult to nd attractive investment options. Daiwa Fund Wrap is a service o ered to customers over the medium to long term. We provide thorough explanations before the conclusion of a contract, report investment performance regularly every three months, and hold follow-up seminars whenever necessary. We thus ensure close communication with customers and seek to build a relationship of trust with them. In addition, Daiwa Fund Wrap Premium, launched in October 2016, now o ers a more detailed service, enabling customers to have multiple investment portfolios and design them in a highly customized manner. In particular, the inheritance recipient designation service and the gift service taking advantage of the calendar year taxation system, which became available in July 2018, are services that can satisfy customers with a strong interest in inheritance tax measures. Moreover, Daiwa Fund Wrap Online, launched in January 2017, proposes the most suitable investment style from a minimum investment amount of ¥10,000 by utilizing Robo-Advisor technology. We thus provide a service enabling customers who prefer long-term asset management to easily engage in globally diversi ed investments online. To keep attracting customers over the long term, we will continue our initiatives to implement better structures and systems so as to improve our performance and the quality of our services. Balance of domestic Wrap accounts: ¥8,777.4 billion (As of March 31, 2020) * Source: Data released by the Japan Investment Advisers Association Balance of Wrap accounts at Daiwa Securities: ¥2,087.4 billion (As of March 31, 2020) * Source: Data released by the Japan Investment Advisers Association Initiatives by Daiwa Asset Management For Daiwa Asset Management, one of the pillars of building a stable, superior asset management capability is to take appropriate risks in managing active funds. We have therefore built a support system by collecting information from the research division and other relevant specialist teams. This system enables fund managers to take risks after thorough examination. In particular, we are striving to improve our ability to select companies with good prospects to make this a major source for strong investment performance. We focus especially on ESG information from a long-term perspective. Daiwa Asset Management has placed personnel in charge of ESG within the Fund Management Division to promote ESG investment in an organized manner as a signatory to both the United Nations' Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the Principles for Financial Action for the st Century. Since adopting the Japanese version of the Stewardship Code, we have been working to deepen our dialogue with investee companies by means such as holding dialogue with the theme of integrated reports. In October 2018, we established the Stewardship & ESG Section within the Investment Planning Department to further incorporate an ESG perspective and strengthen monitoring. In addition, Daiwa Asset Management published its “ESG Investment Policy” in January 2020 to clarify its approach to ESG. In principle, the Policy applies to all investment strategies of the company. In February 2020, Daiwa Asset Management established the Cleantech Stock & Green Bond Fund (asset growth-type/ predictable distribution-type), nicknamed “Mirai Earth,” which focuses on “E” (environment) in response to growing interest in ESG investment and SDGs among retail investors and companies handling its products. It is especially important to always grasp current trends and customer needs for the development of products. We are therefore striving to maintain close communication by holding seminars for customers and through operation of our unique call center. We are also building a structure that assists companies marketing our products to support the transition from savings to asset building. 28 SDGs report 2020 Initiatives Using REITs and Other Structures to Solve Social Issues Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management uses investment corporations and fund structures to provide funds through capital markets to real estate, including o ces, rental housing, healthcare facilities, hotels, and logistics facilities, as well as infrastructure assets such as renewable energy power plants. By doing so, the company will contribute to putting in place and developing high-quality properties and creating an environmentally friendly social infrastructure. Investment in Healthcare Facilities Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management managed Nippon Healthcare Investment Corporation, which was Japan's rst REIT focusing on healthcare facilities. On April 1, 2020, that REIT was merged with Japan Rental Housing Investments Inc., a REIT focusing on housing that was also managed by Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management, and they were reborn as Daiwa Securities Living Investment Corporation (“DLI”), the J-REIT with the largest amount of healthcare facility assets under management in Japan. DLI invests in prime healthcare facilities that are likely to see stronger demand from society over the medium to long term as the population continues to age. Through such investment, it will contribute to the “Achievement of Good Health and Longevity,” which is identi ed as a social issue in Japan in the SDGs Implementation Guiding Principles formulated by the government’s SDGs Promotion Headquarters. Total amount of investment in healthcare facilities Approximately ¥86.9 billion (as of May 31, 2020) Investment in Renewable Energy With regard to infrastructure assets, Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management has been managing photovoltaic power stations since FY , and was entrusted in FY with the management of a biomass power generation plant invested in by Daiwa Energy & Infrastructure. It has been continuously expanding the balance of its assets under management while striving to accumulate knowledge of investment and management in the renewable energy eld. Management results of renewable energy power plants Number of deals: 17 (Hokkaido, Tohoku, Hokuriku, Kanto, Chubu, Chugoku, and Shikoku regions) Output: Approximately 120 MW (excluding output from assets on land with leasehold interest) Annual energy output (June 2019 to May 2020)： , MWh (calculated based on an assumed CO2 reduction of 72,872 t-CO2 and an emission factor of 0.000475 t-CO2/kWh) Balance of assets under management: Approximately ¥50.8 billion Group-wide Research on Financial Innovations Daiwa Securities Group launched the Financial Innovation Committee in FY as a platform for Group-wide research activities, and frontline employees at Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Daiwa Securities, Daiwa Institute of Research, Daiwa Asset Management, and other companies are proceeding with research activities on AI and other state-of-the-art technologies. Speci cally, they have achieved results in research on the provision of a stock information service using a stock price prediction model, a real-time stock volume prediction model, shareholder rewards program Robo-Advisor, an AI-based business matching service, an AI-based company analysis tool, and other matters. Moreover, in FY , the Group launched the “Daiwa Securities Group & the University of Tokyo Future Finance Forum” in order to develop its research activities further and expand the basis of the activities. As its advanced form, since FY we have been conducting joint research with a University of Tokyo study group led by Professor Kiyoshi Izumi through a social cooperation program entitled “Next Generation Investment Technology” and have developed a theme issue search system based on associative retrieval. Going forward, Daiwa Securities Group will continue to promote innovations in the nancial industry through its ongoing research activities. 29 SDGs report 2020 Response to FinTech and arti cial intelligence (AI) Since starting Daiwa Online Trade, Japan's rst Internet-based securities brokerage service, in 1996, Daiwa Securities has provided various products and services successively over a period of more than 20 years. Due to the widespread use of portable information devices and the development of information communications technology, the importance of Internet channels has increased even more in recent years, with the number of accounts held under contract for Daiwa Online Trade topping 3.3 million as of the end of March 2019. Of Daiwa Securities' total stock transactions, approximately 80% are carried out via the online trading service, underscoring the fact that Daiwa Online Trade has become an indispensable channel for Daiwa Securities. Since May 2017, we have been providing information through Daiwa Online Trade regarding domestic issues selected using an AI-based stock price prediction model developed by Daiwa Institute of Research, Daiwa Securities Group’s think tank. We select issues whose prices are likely to go up gradually after the announcement of nancial results, using a method of machine learning, which is an AI-related technology. In 2019, we distributed information four times in total when major nancial results were announced. Furthermore, in February 2019, we introduced a login function using a biometric authentication system to Kabu Walk, a smartphone application with a domestic stocks trading function provided on iPhones and Android devices. We believe that by actively using such new technologies, including AI and FinTech—an amalgamation of nance and information technology—we will stimulate interest in securities investment among individuals, especially younger generations, who have not previously been familiar with securities investment, and thereby support a shift from savings to asset building. In that way, we can contribute to Japan’s sound economic development. As the use of various AI-based services is currently spreading and the development of FinTech is accelerating, new nancial services leveraging these technologies are becoming easily available. We will keep track of such trends and endeavor to continue enhancing convenience and providing quality services as a channel chosen by next-generation a uent customers and young customers with particular focus on inbound marketing. Daiwa Online Trade Number of contract accounts: 3,362,505 accounts (As of the end of March 2020) Contribution to Stimulation of Local Economies though AI-based Support for Enhancement of Financial Services Due to its technological progress and higher academic rating, arti cial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly used for business applications. Daiwa Institute of Research Business Innovation, which is entrusted by many nancial institutions with system development, is advancing initiatives for research and application of AI. As part of AI-based support for enhancement of nancial services, the company developed a common data de nition that enables AI to learn the nancial activities and state of mind of retail customers with remarkable accuracy by combining a wealth of experience in developing nancial systems and unique data science expertise. It built a nancial product recommendation AI system based on this data de nition, which has been provided since 2019 to some regional nancial institutions. The system is expected to allow those nancial institutions to predict the nancial needs of their customers more accurately with AI. Daiwa Securities Group will contribute to the social and economic development of communities through initiatives that actively use state-of-the-art technologies. 30 SDGs report 2020 Providing Analysis/Proposals on the Economy, Society, and Investment Information Daiwa Securities Group as an integrated securities group provides, in addition to investment information, a wide range of information on the economy and society. We hope that the measures we propose from a long-term perspective will be helpful to customers, investors and a variety of stakeholders. Easy-to-Understand Communication of Information Daiwa Securities publishes information for a wide range of people from institutional and retail investors to those who are about to start investing. The central role in the provision of information is played by highly specialized analysts and strategists from the Investment Strategy, Equity Research, and Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) Research Departments. They provide information mainly through reports based on their unique analysis. Our information is based on close collection and analysis of data. Even if the same person is providing that information, we tailor the presentation, depending on whether it is for retail investors or institutional investors, who are investment professionals. For example, if information is targeted at retail investors, we implement various measures to make it more visually understandable. To remove the general perception that securities investment or securities companies are complicated, we believe it is one of our missions to work toward communicating our analysis using easy-to-understand language. Initiatives to Provide Information on ESG (Daiwa Securities) Daiwa Securities' Equity Research Department is a group of analysts and strategists. They analyze and evaluate information released by companies, and provide investment information and ideas to institutional investors. International agendas, such as SDGs and the Paris Agreement, have gained much attention in recent years. Against this backdrop, a growing number of investors are using non nancial information in relation to the environment, society, and corporate governance when making medium to long term investment decisions. Therefore, in May 2019, Daiwa Securities established ESG Research Division, which specializes in handling ESG information, within the Equity Research Department, thereby putting in place a system for comprehensively analyzing and evaluating nancial and non nancial information. The ESG Research Section works on writing analysis reports focusing on topics such as climate change, human rights and gender issues, corporate governance systems, and social impact, as well as holding ESG seminars and other activities. ESG information will become more and more important for companies and society as a whole for achieving sustainable growth over the long term. We strive to provide appropriate ESG information in a timely manner so that institutional investors will be able to expand their investment returns in the medium to long term through responsible investment and purposeful dialogue (engagement). Number of SDGs/ESG seminars held & participants 2019: 15 (576 participants) 2018: 15 (310 participants) 2017: 18 (545 participants) 31 SDGs report 2020 Initiatives by Daiwa Institute of Research Comprehensive Provision of Information and Policy Proposal Activities Daiwa Institute of Research (DIR), which assumes the think-tank role of Daiwa Securities Group, provides wide-ranging analysis and information to the public. At DIR, we consider it our mission to engage in comprehensive provision of information and policy proposal activities concerning the nancial and capital markets and the real economy. We have always sought to provide up-to-date and in-depth information and a unique viewpoint that has not been presented by others. In order to provide information that satis es the needs of the public, we also exchange information and hold discussions with businesses, investors, public institutions including governments and municipalities, and various economic groups, as well as overseas think-tanks and media. In this way, we are able to analyze the currents and trends of society and disseminate information. We are also stepping up the release of ESG information, communicating wide-ranging information via our website and DIR Research Quarterly Review (our quarterly journal) regarding community vitalization, environmental problems, women's active participation in society, workstyle reform, corporate governance and other issues. Provision of information by DIR through diverse media Number of reports posted on the website : 531 reports (Results for FY ) Full texts of reports available on the website Number of recent hits on the research division's page : 3.93 million hits (Results for FY ) Strengthening the Provision of Information The Research Division of DIR launched the Policy Research Department in FY . In addition to providing information on the macro economy and nancial and capital markets within and outside Japan, the company is now focusing on making policy proposals based on multifaceted analysis of issues such as measures for maintaining the sustainability of government nances and the social security system, and the directions that society and businesses are required to pursue from an ESG perspective. Moreover, it established the O ce of SDGs Research & Consulting and the O ce of AI Analytic Research in FY , and has contributed to society through dissemination of information aimed at solving various issues, while working on new economic forecasting and analysis methods using AI and other technologies. In FY , the O ce of SDGs Research & Consulting published 81 reports and made 57 visits to nancial and non nancial companies to provide information. It also launched SDGs Workshops for personnel responsible for SDGs in companies to support SDG initiatives in their companies, and actively engaged in other activities. 32 SDGs report 2020 Economic Analysis Initiatives Using AI DIR has been releasing the Daiwa Regional AI (Regional Love) Index, which calculates economic sentiment by region, since July 2017 to contribute to the development of regional society. Japan is faced with the important issue of breaking the vicious cycle of population decline and contraction of regional economies to realize regional revitalization. To promote such regional revitalization, it is necessary to properly understand the current state of regional economies, in addition to executing the policies that suit regional characteristics. The Daiwa Regional AI (Regional Love) Index utilizes a state-of-the-art arti cial intelligence (AI) model and also incorporates economists' knowledge to calculate overall economic sentiment by region. It has the following advantages: 1. demonstrating overall economic sentiment quantitatively and promptly by region; 2. grasping regional economic sentiment in a historical manner; and 3. enabling analysis of which elds (such as consumption and exports ) provide impact and cause changes in overall economic sentiment. DIR also uses AI to analyze business conditions and regional economies. For example, it makes AI-based economic index forecasts and has developed a model enabling regional economies to be quickly understood by using alternative data (electricity volume demand data announced every day on the websites of power companies), which was rarely used for economic analysis in the past. In addition, DIR works on timely dissemination of information utilizing AI. It used Google Trends data and applied a method of machine learning known as clustering to the supply shortage issue caused by the COVIDpandemic. By doing so, it determined whether or not such shortages had occurred due to false rumors, while visualizing by item the degree of people’s concern that they may not be able to purchase groceries and daily necessities. This method is expected to become an e ective tool for policymakers and authorities to take appropriate responses. Moreover, DIR strives to enhance the quality of disseminated information and policy proposals by actively utilizing various sophisticated analysis methods. In its report “The true power of 'the Nadeshiko-like companies' for their pro tability with causal inference” DIR used seven years of data for a total of several thousand listed companies, proving through a statistical method known as cause and e ect reasoning that companies’ nancial performance will improve if they have more female executives and managers. This is a causal relationship that was previously di cult to prove. We believe that, as a basis for promoting SDGs, there are extremely signi cant policy implications in the conclusion that supporting women’s success is e ective also from the perspective of improving corporate earnings. 33 SDGs report 2020 Provision of Information through Diverse Media Lectures and Media Appearances The Research Division of DIR adopts a variety of methods for providing information. These include the writing of reports; contribution to DIR Research Quarterly Review, newspapers and economic magazines; media interviews; TV appearances; lectures, seminars, and presentations at workshops; the publication of books, and participation in government councils as members. We strive to explain in an easy to understand way complex issues related to the economy, society, and policy issues within and outside Japan, while emphasizing the quality of reports. We ensure the reliability of our reports by requiring them to undergo review by a specialized section. As a result, the information we provide has improved in both quality and quantity, and we are communicating with customers on a continuously increasing number of occasions. Issuing of Books and Booklets The Investment Strategy Department of Daiwa Securities issues the periodical Daiwa Investment Monthly and other publications as tools for communicating information to general customers. They are distributed to sales branches of Daiwa Securities and are also available on the Internet. Daiwa Investment Monthly videos can also be viewed with a smartphone. We are further evolving our booklets to make them easier to understand. We also provide information in various ways to general customers, including books available through publishers, desk calendars with information on nancial events, and wall-hanging market charts. Internet-based Initiatives Live Web Seminars Daiwa Securities Group regularly holds live web seminars where popular strategists and analysts of the Group appear as lecturers. Customers can view them over the Internet in real-time and are also allowed to ask lecturers questions directly either in advance or in real-time by typing into the bulletin board function. These strategists and analysts sometimes serve as lecturers at seminars held at Daiwa Securities branches as well, enabling many customers to receive market information and commentaries on individual stocks in live seminars. We will continue our e orts to communicate market conditions and outlook and other information to even more people in a way that is easy to understand through our live web seminars. Live web seminars (Results for FY ) Total of 13 seminars held Annual number of participants: 61,974 participants 34 SDGs report 2020 Daiwa Internet TV In 2000, Daiwa Securities Group began “Daiwa Securities Information TV,” Japan’s only channel dedicated to securities information, on the multichannel pay TV broadcast service “SKY Perfect TV!” Since April 2011, we have been producing “Daiwa Internet TV” at our own studio and distributing it online in an e ort to target a wider range of viewers. We distribute information on the Tokyo market ve times a day in a timely manner, while providing local market information from Hong Kong and New York every day. In addition to these daily programs, we distribute corporate information as well as video reports where analysts and economists at Daiwa Securities and DIR provide commentaries on current issues in an easy-to-understand way. Our Daiwa Internet TV initiative was introduced by the SDG Industry Matrix for Financial Services (issued jointly by the United Nations Global Compact and KPMG International in 2015) as a case for Goal 4 “Quality Education.” The report highlighted Daiwa's timely and free of charge provision of a variety of nancial and investment information. We will continue to make e orts to produce programs that can be viewed by not only investors but also those who are new to investment, and that can support the journey from savings to asset building. Daiwa Internet TV Daiwa Asset Management In June 2019, Daiwa Asset Management released “iFree Touch,” an investment experience app that can be used like a game, hoping that the app would provide the asset building generation with an opportunity to take their rst step toward investment. The company also posts “Tweets by Tsumitate Wa-NISA” on its website as educational content for NISA in an e ort to distribute information in an approachable, easy-to-understand way. It is a collaboration between the iFree Touch character and “Tsumitate Wa-NISA,” the Financial Services Agency’s o cial character of the installment-type NISA. Daiwa Asset Management recognizes that providing information to investors through the Internet will become more important with the spread of COVID, and distributes, as website content, market information videos that focus on the U.S. and REIT markets, in addition to the Fund Letters and Market Letters that have previously been distributed. Daiwa Asset Management website iFree Touch o cial website Tweets by Tsumitate Wa-NISA 35 SDGs report 2020 Providing Quality Service to Customers Daiwa Securities Group understands that customer trust is the foundation of our business. Based on the idea of the Customer First Principle, we always try to provide services that deliver genuine customer satisfaction. We have also adopted the idea of hospitality to enhance our existing concept of customer service. We aim to provide customer service that gives the most satisfaction to customers. Building Deeper, Stronger Trust with Customers Daiwa Securities aims to build customer satisfaction through quality services, built on understanding customer needs quickly and proposing the best solutions for each customer. We consider providing faithful and appropriate explanations to be paramount. A principle of Japan's Financial Instruments and Exchange Act prohibits solicitation that is improper in light of a customer's knowledge, experience, nancial situation and objectives. Daiwa Securities' approach is rooted in this principle. As a part of our hospitality-based service, when promoting our nancial products we strive to provide explanations and post-sale follow-up that exceed the legal requirements. We have also agreed with the purport of the Principles for Customer-Oriented Business Conduct announced by the Financial Services Agency in March 2017 and expressed our adoption of the principles, while drawing up and announcing our Basic Policy on Customerrst Operations. Moreover, to further improve our services and the quality of our response, we are continuing to conduct customer service surveys. We survey customers regarding their degree of satisfaction with our services and response, and solicit their feedback and requests. Based on the survey results, since FY we have been strengthening our initiatives to improve the quality of post-sale follow-up and enhance the convenience of e-mail services. Basic Policy on Customerrst Operations Daiwa Securities Group has agreed with the purport of the Principles for Customer-Oriented Business Conduct announced by the Financial Services Agency on March 30, 2017 and expressed its adoption of the principles. The Group has also drawn up and announced its Basic Policy on Customerrst Operations. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. (Japanese) Daiwa Asset Management Co. Ltd. (Japanese) Daiwa Next Bank, Ltd (Japanese) 36 SDGs report 2020 Thorough Post-Sale Follow-Up and Appropriate Provision of Information A customer's purchase of a product is only the beginning of a securities company's relationship with the customer. Follow-up is the key to maintaining and solidifying the relationship of trust built with the customer. To alleviate customer dissatisfaction or concerns arising after transactions, we o er thorough explanations, appropriate proposals, and information regarding market conditions, products, and services. We have also expanded the use of emails and online meetings, as well as face-to-face meetings, telephone and other conventional methods, thereby developing a system enabling us to provide appropriate follow-up to as many customers as possible. Introduction of NPS®* (Net Promoter Score) Towards Realization of Quality No. 1 In FY , Daiwa Securities introduced NPS® (Net Promoter Score) as an in-house indicator for measuring customer satisfaction. The score measures the degree of customer recommendation and is considered to correlate closely with business performance. We position it as one of our most important management indicators. When introducing NPS®, we implemented sales reforms successively at individual branches to ensure that the aim of the introduction is well understood and established among employees, rather than them merely adopting the score. Thus, it took a year to complete the introduction of the score at all branches. We will further step up our e orts to carry out sales activities from the customer perspective. At the same time, we will build a scheme for implementing a PDCA cycle that incorporates customer feedback and makes improvements, and continuously work to improve NPS®. * NPS® is a registered trademark of Bain & Company, Fred Reichheld and Satmetrix Systems. Improving In-Branch Customer Service Quality Daiwa Securities strives to provide in-branch services that can satisfy any customer. With the aim of creating sales branches enabling elderly customers and customers with disabilities to feel secure, we have placed dementia supporters* and employees with service assistant* certi cations, mostly comprising employees engaged in in-house customer service. Moreover, in order to ensure that our sales branches are accessible to more customers, we implement a range of barrierfree measures, including reduced variations in oor level, the installation of automatic doors and larger counters, and the placement of cane holders at all counters. We have also been stepping up our e orts to enhance safety and convenience for elderly customers and customers with disabilities visiting our sales branches. As part of such e orts, we place and make ready for use writing communication boards, communication sheets, cane holders, hearing assistance devices, and other equipment. *1. Dementia supporter A dementia supporter is a person who properly understands dementia and pays warm attention to people with dementia and their families. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare has been stepping up the training of supporters across the country as part of its Dementia Supporter Caravan project. *2. Service assistant A service assistant is a person certi ed as having acquired hospitality and safe assistant skills for providing tailored support for elderly customers and customers with disabilities. 37 SDGs report 2020 Initiatives for Elderly Customers and Inheritance Daiwa Securities has placed Anshin (peace of mind) Planners—a new type of sales agent—and Inheritance Consultants as an initiative to provide each one of our elderly customers with optimum consulting and solutions. Anshin Planners are mainly responsible for elderly customers, providing comprehensive consulting for customers in their later years. The scope of the Planners’ work is not limited to asset management but includes the provision of information on health, long-term care, etc. and solutions in relation to gifts, inheritance, etc. to next generations. Inheritance Consultants are professional sta members appointed from among employees with CFP® certi cations who have highly specialized knowledge of inheritance and gifts. We work to provide optimum support to every customer we serve by subdividing our services according to the life stage of each customer and making careful proposals. * CFP® is a nancial planner credential certi ed by the Japan Association for Financial Planners. A CFP® holder has specialized knowledge of asset management, taxation, etc. Holding of a Variety of Seminars Daiwa Securities holds a variety of seminars to provide information to customers. Sales branches handle a broad range of topics in their seminars, such as information on Japanese and overseas markets; programs targeting the asset building generation, including the installment-type Nippon Individual Savings Account (NISA) and iDeco, a de ned contribution pension plan for individuals; and inheritance and gifts that alleviate concerns about old age. We also regularly hold live online seminars which customers can participate in wherever they are. In January 2020, we held the “Daiwa New Year’s Special Live Seminars” ve times in total, focusing on real estate and inheritance as topics, as well as the global economy and market information. Going forward, we will work to successively expand our online seminars. Asset Building through Installment-Type NISA Including Workplace NISA Daiwa Securities has been accepting applications for NISA accounts since the initiation of the program. In particular, we actively introduce the program to customers, especially those in the asset building stage, in order to encourage more customers to start making investment in installments. We are also stepping up our initiative to propose the introduction of the workplace installment-type NISA. The program enables individuals to build assets systematically by setting aside a xed amount each month for investment through their workplaces. Information Website for Child Rearing and Money “SODATTE” Daiwa Securities opened “SODATTE,” an information website for child rearing and money, in April 2016 for the childrearing generations. With four years having passed since its opening, it has grown to be a website visited by many fans, with more than 250 columns and more than 600,000 page view per month. The website sets up six categories, including “Money Lessons,” “Family Finances” and “Education Funds,” and disseminates columns that provide tips to child-rearing generations. As part of our initiative for nancial education, we released “A-I-U-E-Okane-no-ehon” on the website in December 2019. It is a digital picture book that helps small children to deepen their interest in and understanding of money while learning hiragana. We will continue to update columns monthly as an information site that provides practical support on child rearing for parents and enables them to learn in an enjoyable way. SODATTE 38 SDGs report 2020 Contact Center Functions The Contact Center has been a key channel for transactions, supporting the company's business model whose cornerstones are Daiwa Consulting and Daiwa Direct transaction courses. The center now handles calls coming in to sales branches, thereby acting as Daiwa Securities' comprehensive remote contact center for customers. To strengthen the functions of the center, we rst expanded the scale of the service points in Tokyo and Osaka in FY and then established a contact center function in Fukuoka in FY as our third service point. We also enlarged the oor area of our service point in Osaka in FY . By further expanding the ability to take calls, we aim to enhance our support functions for sales branches going forward to increase customer convenience. Scale of Contact Center: 820 service points (500 in Tokyo, 210 in Osaka, and 110 in Fukuoka) Winning of Highest Evaluation from External Assessment Body in Inquiry Desk Category Daiwa Securities received a three-star rating, the highest evaluation, in the inquiry desk category of the securities industry in the 2019 HDI Rating Benchmark organized by HDI-Japan. We will continue to further enhance the quality of our services and responses to satisfy customers. Initiative to Get Closer to Customers Since FY , we have been showing pictures of our operators on the website page for telephone inquiries to give customers a sense of security and familiarity with our remote Contact Center. Working to Incorporate Customer Voices At Daiwa Securities, the Contact Center and the Customer Support Center assume the function of utilizing customer feedback. Contact Center Initiatives Employees at the Contact Center, which serves as our comprehensive remote contact point, have direct contact with customers and play an increasingly crucial role not only as a transaction channel but also in customer support and marketing. In order to maintain and improve contact center operations to meet the demand for high-quality service, we provide training and regular level checks for all Telephone Service Representatives (TSR). We thus strive to appropriately respond to customers' true needs. Customer Feedback Sent to Contact Center The Contact Center receives numerous comments and requests on online trading and Daiwa Securities' other products and services. We share such customer feedback information and requests with management and relevant departments and sections of the head o ce and utilize them to enhance our services and customer interaction. (The number of major improvements implemented in FY was 85.) We also show some of the inquiries received from customers on our website as frequently asked questions, while 39 SDGs report 2020 sharing them with sales branches in some cases to speed up our responses. We are thus working to raise customer satisfaction from various perspectives. Number of cases in FY where responses were taken to customer feedback and requests 96 cases (in 48 of which responses were completed) Customer Support Center Initiatives Daiwa Securities' Customer Support Center is a department at the head o ce that handles customer feedback and complaints directly by phone. It is set up within the Compliance Department of Daiwa Securities. The Center promptly gives feedback and complaints from customers to relevant sales branches and departments and sections of the head o ce. It also sorts and analyzes such feedback and complaints, shares them with o cers, sales branches, and head o ce departments and sections, and capitalizes on them as precious information in the aim of customerrst operations and pursuit of best quality. To respond to customers' calls thoroughly, accurately, and promptly, Customer Support Center members study the securities tax code and Daiwa Securities' services together on a daily basis, and work to improve the quality of their customer services. Calls received at the Customer Support Center in FY Number of calls received: 3,846 calls (down 590 calls) Inquiries: 81% Complaints: 19% 40 SDGs report 2020 Support for Creating Our Future Society Daiwa Securities Group begins the social problem solving businesses in various elds, such as FinTech, healthcare, energy infrastructure, and agriculture, utilizing the knowledge of various securities and nancial businesses cultivated by the Group. Business development starting from the SDGs SDGs × Technology Creation of Next Generation Financial Services Fintertech Co. Ltd., which was established in April 2018, works to create next generation nancial services mainly for the digital native generation, using blockchain and other state-of-the-art technologies. Since March 2020, it has been providing digital asset-backed loans. Going forward, the company will develop new nancial services, such as the provision of crowd-tipping systems and crowd-funding business, to satisfy diverse the needs of customers. Fintertech Co. Ltd. Promotion of Investment and Financing for Energy Daiwa Energy & Infrastructure Co. Ltd. (DEI) was launched as the successor to the energy investment division of Daiwa PI Partners, and started operation on October 1, 2018. The company aims to provide new value as a member of an integrated securities group with a hybrid business model, and contribute to SDGs through investment and nancing for renewable energy, infrastructure, and resource elds. Daiwa Energy & Infrastructure Co.Ltd. Renewable Energy Power Generation Projects DEI has been actively working on development of and business investment in renewable energy generation projects, taking advantage of the Daiwa Securities Group's network. Of the 16 solar photovoltaic power plants developed and invested in by the company as of the end of May 2020, the 10 plants which are currently owned and on which construction was completed have all been operating stably. The solar photovoltaic power plants under construction in Minamikyushu City, Kagoshima Prefecture (11 MW), Shiraoi Town, Hokkaido Prefecture (35 MW), and Naka City, Ibaraki Prefecture (35 MW) will be completed by the summer of 2020, the end of 2020, and the end of 2021, respectively. In the biomass power generation eld, DEI has been steadily promoting the development of wood biomass power generation plants that use tree trimmings in Japan as their primary source of fuel. The development is underway with Green Thermal Co. Ltd., with which DEI has formed a capital and business alliance. The commercial operation of a plant in Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture began in January 2018 as the rst alliance project, and a plant in Kamitonda, Wakayama Prefecture as the second project also began in June 2020. Stations developed/ invested in by DEI Photovoltaic power stations Output: Approximately 213 MW in total A breakdown is shown below. 41 SDGs report 2020 Stations in operation: Approximately 132 MW (total for ten stations) Stations under construction: Approximately 81 MW (three stations) Projected amount of electricity generated annually: Equivalent to the amount for approximately 44,000 households Biomass power generation plant Output: Approximately 13 MW in total A breakdown is shown below. Stations in operation: Approximately 13 MW (two station) Projected amount of electricity generated annually: Equivalent to the amount for approximately 20,000 households Initiatives for the Woody Biomass Power Generation Field DEI has formed a capital and business alliance with Green Thermal, a leading company for the development and operation of woody biomass power generation plants, and Biomass Fuel Co., Ltd., a biomass fuel supplier. It has been actively promoting not only the construction of power plants but also the expansion of its value chain in the biomass eld. In collaboration with Biomass Fuel, DEI has been working to expand the procurement of palm kernel shell (PKS) fuel for biomass power generation and develop wood pellet manufacturing plants mainly in Southeast Asia. Construction of a pellet plant is currently underway in Vietnam. Furthermore, in December 2018, DEI invested in Bioendev AB, a Sweden-based torrefaction* technology company, aiming for technological evolution and global expansion of the biomass fuel-related business. The woody biomass power generation business uses carbon-neutral power generation facilities that do not a ect the amount of carbon dioxide. Moreover, since it adds new value as fuel to wood trimmings from forests and PKS that have been left and discarded, it is expected to generate new industries and employment and contribute to local economies in Japan as well as the promotion of industry in developing countries. * Technology that increases the energy density of wood pellets, etc. through the formation of carbide from woody biomass and other substances, thereby enhancing the e ciency of transportation and storage. SDGs× Local Community Expansion of Solutions Provided in the Business Succession Field (Establishment of Daiwa ACA Business Succession Fund) About half of the small and medium-sized companies in Japan do not have successors. If this situation continues, Japan may lose approximately 6.5 million jobs in total and ¥22 trillion worth of GDP in the next 10 years. Business succession is thus a major social issue. Daiwa ACA Business Succession Fund, established in October 2018, helps smalland medium-sized companies to pass on their excellent technologies and services to the next generations. By supporting business succession, the fund also encourages the innovation of technology and services with continuity. Through this fund, Daiwa Securities Group will promote Japan's sustainable economic development. Daiwa ACA Business Succession Fund[PDF: KB] Promotion of Sustainable Agricultural Production Business A new type of agricultural business using ICT and other technologies is attracting attention as a solution to the aging of people engaged in farming and shortages of successors problems faced by Japan's agricultural sector. In November 2018, Daiwa Securities Group established Daiwa Food & Agriculture Co. Ltd (DFA). The new company is aimed at assisting expansion of the scale of business related to agriculture and food and enhancing e ciency by providing risk money to help actively introduce new technologies. In the spring of 2019, Daiwa Food & Agriculture launched an agricultural production business, starting with the acquisition of a 42 SDGs report 2020 production facility for baby leaf vegetables in Kumamoto Prefecture. Moreover, in the spring of 2020, it took a stake in agricultural corporations in Kawanishi Town, Yamagata Prefecture and Kusu Town, Oita Prefecture, which both sell tomatoes cultivated in largescale greenhouses in their respective areas. Taking advantage of cultivation using large-scale horticultural facilities and expertise in operating such facilities, the company itself handles the agricultural production business. Going forward, Daiwa Food & Agriculture will continue to pursue expansion of scale and increase in e ciency of agricultural production to contribute to the invigoration of agriculture, a social issue Japan should look to resolve. The company will thereby put into practice SDG Goal 2 “Zero Hunger” and Goal 9 “Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.” Daiwa Food & Agriculture Co. Ltd SDGs×Life Full-Scale Entry into the Healthcare Field Social challenges are piling up in the healthcare eld, including the rapid expansion of demand for medical and nursing care and the necessity of reducing medical costs. Through Daiwa ACA HealthCare Inc., which has investment and lending expertise in the medical and nursing care business, Daiwa Securities Group aims to solve social issues in the eld by the provision of funds for hospital and nursing care businesses and support for succession and management of medical institutions, in Japan and overseas. Daiwa ACA HealthCare Inc. Provision of High-Quality Nursing Care Services Providing quality nursing care services is a pressing issue in Japan as its elderly population is expected to continue increasing. To date, Good Time Living Co. Ltd. has worked on nursing care that helps residents to live independently and improve their condition, rather than simply providing assistance for their disabilities. The company also adopted ICT equipment and technology ahead of others in the industry. In 2019, it completed introduction of mobile devices to all of its 32 facilities, leading to increased e ciency in operations not including physical assistance. In order to change the current state of nursing care services to address the progressive aging of the population, Daiwa ACA HealthCare Inc. will promote the development of an environment that allows nursing care sta to demonstrate higher levels of expertise, as well as the hiring of overseas personnel. We will thereby contribute to the achievement of SDG Goal 3 “Good Health and Well-being” and Goal 8 “Decent Work and Economic Growth.” Good Time Living Co. Ltd.

Initiatives against COVIDAs an initiative against COVID, Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management donated ¥5 million in collaboration with Daiwa Securities Group Inc. for supporting accommodation fees under “Room Support Plan for Medical Professionals” implemented at hotels operated by JHAT Co., Ltd. In addition, a hotel close to Haneda Airport owned by Daiwa Hotel Private Investment Corporation, which is managed by Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management, has been used as a temporary quarantine facility for people who have returned from overseas. Earthquake Preparation Initiatives Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management has implemented earthquake countermeasures for building users and local residents. For example, the company has placed emergency cabinets in the elevators of o ce properties owned by Daiwa O ce Investment Corporation and installed disaster-responsive vending machines in rental residences owned by Daiwa Securities Living Investment Corporation (DLI) and Daiwa Residential Private Investment Corporation. 44 SDGs report 2020 E orts to Address Aging Employees working at the investment division of Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management visit healthcare facilities owned by DLI nationwide several times each year. They participate in hands-on events, such as family get-together meetings and meetings to show respect to the elderly, while assisting with daily work, including cleaning the periphery of the facilities, pruning plants in the courtyards, and pulling out weeds. They also participate in hands-on training to experience work as facility employees in an e ort to deepen their understanding of frontline work. Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management started these initiatives in order to deepen its understanding of the daily work of facility operators and the services provided to residents. The initiatives are now positioned as local community contribution activities through the core business, and we will continue to work actively on these initiatives. Investment in Drug Development Ventures and Other Businesses by DCI Partners We at DCI Partners have been investing in the biotech eld for more than 20 years, including the period of NIF Ventures (now Daiwa Corporate Investment). We currently manage one of Japan’s largest funds focusing on drug development, making biotech venture capital investment in Japan and Taiwan. Through the fund, DCI Partners strives to help advance development by providing managerial resources and hands-on support from strategy planning to implementation. With COVIDspreading rapidly, biotech startups began working on countermeasures against it. Among the investee companies of the fund, some have started developing drugs and vaccines for the virus, with a view to initiating clinical trials in 2020, while others have submitted applications for marketing approval. Since countermeasures against a pandemic require speed and innovative technological capability, biotech startups are expected to attract more attention and play a larger social role than ever before. DCI Partners will support these companies through its investment activities, work to provide treatment options to patients, and strive to contribute to the health of all people and society. Toward Global Realization of Financial Inclusion Initiation of Services by New Securities Company “CONNECT” Smartphones and other technical innovations are changing the common perception of securities companies as targeting only a uent customers who have an advanced level of nancial knowledge, in other words, companies with a high access threshold. At present, with everyone having a sophisticated digital device at hand, we recognize that in such an era, generating securities services available to all people in consideration of nancial inclusion is an issue facing not only Daiwa Securities Group but also the securities industry as a whole. CONNECT Co. Ltd., which began providing services in July 2020, is a new type of securities company created by Daiwa Securities Group. It chie y handles transactions in units of one share and provides services mainly targeted at people in the digital native generation. The company provides and completes all services—from the opening of an account to securities trading—on smartphones, enabling anyone to use securities services, starting with a small amount of investment, as long as they have a smartphone. Under the concept “Create your future, starting with your rst share,” CONNECT will continue to develop and provide its services so that all people will be able to access better nancial services. CONNECT Co. Ltd. 45 SDGs report 2020 Support for Reconstruction Following the Great East Japan Earthquake The Great East Japan Earthquake SME Reconstruction Support Fund Daiwa Corporate Investment Co., Ltd. operates the Great East Japan Earthquake SME Reconstruction Support Fund, receiving investment from the Organization for Small & Medium Enterprises and Regional Innovation, JAPAN (SME Support, Japan), The Aomori Bank, Ltd., The Bank of Iwate, Ltd., The 77 Bank, Ltd., The Toho Bank, Ltd., and other institutions. Targeting unlisted private companies in the disaster-a ected areas, the fund aims to expeditiously provide risk nance. The goal is to actively support companies in their e orts to secure renewed growth and development by supplying nance for a variety of purposes. These include restoration and reconstruction following the 2011 earthquake disaster, new business development, the shift to a new industry or line of business, business reorganization and succession, and business incubation. The fund thereby aims to contribute to the early restoration and sustainable development of the disaster-a ected areas. Support for the New Tohoku Restoration Business Contest 2019 Since FY , Daiwa Securities Group has been supporting the Restoration Business Contest, which recognizes and supports business plans that lead to the restoration of the areas a ected by the Great East Japan Earthquake. In addition to the grand and excellence awards, the “Daiwa Securities Group Phoenix Award” has been established as a corporate award, and it was granted in FY to Phoenix Corporation (Morioka City, Iwate Prefecture), which aims to develop a safe and secure snowplow system. The daily work of removing heavy snow is an extremely serious issue for the disaster-a ected areas struggling with labor shortages resulting from the declining population and the aging of the society associated with depopulation. This system will enable even the elderly and women to remove snow easily in a safe and secure manner, and the development of the system is expected to help improve the quality of life in winter in the disaster-a ected areas and create jobs. For this reason, Daiwa Securities Group intends to support this initiative. We will continue to actively carry out these activities so as to be able to contribute to the reconstruction of the Tohoku region.

Daiwa Institute of Research (DIR) was entrusted by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry with secretariat work for Sido Next Innovator 2018 jointly with World Innovation Lab (WiL, LLC). Under the theme Thinker to Doer, the program solicits and selects a wide range of people, including those taking up the challenge of generating innovation and those working on challenging new business at major companies. It aims to develop global human resources who will play a major role in next-generation innovation by providing selected applicants with lectures, seminars, workshops, mentoring and interaction with investors and entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley. The program was initiated in FY , and FY marks its fth year. The program runs for a total of 10 months two months of open application and selection and eight months of program implementation. In FY , applications were solicited from May to June 2018, and 126 successful candidates (program recipients) were selected from among 345 applicants based on rigorous evaluation. In the domestic program, which kicked o in July, participants went through lectures, workshops, mentoring (in which skilled workers with a wealth of experience called mentors engage in dialogue with and provide advice to unskilled workers to encourage growth and the brushing up of business plans), pitch contests, and other training to brush up their business plans and enhance presentation skills. Alongside the domestic program, the small-class program Sido Café was provided for those who wished to participate. In the program, participants deepened their knowledge of speci c topics. In a pitch contest carried out on December 15, 2018, 20 participants were selected as delegates to Silicon Valley based on the overall results of screening by application forms and pitch. The 20 participants took part in a two-week Silicon Valley program in which they visited entrepreneurs playing major roles at local start-ups, personnel in charge of new business development at large companies, and venture capitalists. They enhanced the quality of their own business plans through small meetings and mentoring. Moreover, among those who were not selected as delegates to Silicon Valley, 31 applicants participated in a domestic follow-up program in which they continued to brush up their business plans. A nal result reporting event ( Demo Day ) was held on February 15, 2019. Demo Day featured pitches made by a total of 40 participants 20 delegates to Silicon Valley and 20 participants in the domestic follow-up program, along with speeches by guest speakers, exhibition booths set up by alumni and a panel discussion. DIR will continue to participate in programs such as this which will lead to innovation. 47 SDGs report 2020 For the Development of Financial and Capital Markets The securities business, the core business of Daiwa Securities Group, serves as an important social and economic infrastructure. It facilitates the smooth ow of money by matching fundraising needs through the issuance of securities and investment needs of investors via nancial and capital markets. Maintaining and developing this infrastructure is about developing sound nancial and capital markets for the next generation, which we identify in the Group's materiality in Finance. We consider this to be a major mission for the Group toward the realization of SDG Goal 9 Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation. Initiatives for Maintaining Market Functions Role and Importance of Settlement Functions Securities settlement a mainstay of the Group's overall operations is the delivery of stocks, bonds, or other instruments and funds both to and from the buyer and seller of a securities transaction. Settlement functions also serve as a social infrastructure, and therefore security, reliability, and convenience are important. In secure and trusted markets, nancial instruments can be reliably converted into cash when necessary. This is the very reason why such markets attract investment money from all over the world and enable companies and others with funding demand to procure funds. Number of settlement transactions handled Daily 11,000 transactions on average Annually Approximately 2.8 million transactions (mainly by institutional investors within and outside Japan) Responsibility as a Securities Company In March 2020, Daiwa Securities introduced a full-scale teleworking system for all employees ahead of major industry peers. While many companies, including us, have already introduced systems for working from home, Daiwa Securities’ new teleworking system is revolutionary in that it combines the development of an infrastructure by distributing a twoin-one device* to all 10,000 employees. This has enabled all employees, from those at frontline divisions to back o ce divisions, to carry out work almost equivalent to that performed at the o ce no matter where they are. In settlement operations, which should never be suspended, even during the COVIDpandemic, the new system has enabled us to fully demonstrate our capability in achieving a balance between reducing employees’ risk of infection and ful lling our social responsibilities as a securities company. If anything that could stall securities settlement should occur, it would not only a ect us but also damage trust in markets as a whole. It could even have a signi cant impact on the global economy. We consider it vital to settle transactions accurately and promptly as required in order to ensure that markets function as a social infrastructure and become a driver for economic development. We are therefore striving to build a structure enabling the smooth execution of 48 SDGs report 2020 settlement operations. Amid the emergence of investors engaged in frequent trading utilizing computers, we have implemented a reliable system that has high processing capability and can reliably settle a massive number of transactions. We believe, however, that no matter how well operations are systematized, the most important thing for the securities settlement operation is still human resources. Sta members must have a wide range of knowledge to grasp the situation quickly when an irregular event occurs and then respond to it appropriately. For that reason, we are making e orts to visualize and accumulate the experience and expertise acquired through our daily operations, as well as expanding the business knowledge of each individual and the scope of operations they can cover by providing cross-business training and continually rotating tasks. Meanwhile, the securities industry recognizes that, to boost the competitiveness of Japan's nancial and capital markets, it is necessary to further increase convenience and strengthen risk management. With this awareness, the entire industry is currently working on reducing settlement time. Daiwa Securities has played a central role in a working group launched by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, identifying and examining a variety of issues towards the reduction of settlement time. The T+ (trade date plus one day) settlement cycle already started for government bond trading in May 2018, and the T+ settlement cycle for stock trading started in July 2019. Moreover, cross-border foreign exchange transactions entail settlement risk associated with time di erences in settlement for the currencies involved (for example, the risk of being unable to receive dollars in U.S. time even when paying yen in Japan time). Daiwa Securities is the only Japanese securities company that participates directly in Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS) as a settlement member. We will ful ll greater responsibility for the stability of nancial markets by reducing the settlement risk of foreign exchange transactions. We are determined to continue settlement operations no matter what happens. In accordance with such determination, we have drawn up a business continuity plan (BCP) and regularly conduct training in preparation for unforeseen circumstances, such as the spread of new infectious diseases, natural disasters, and terrorism. The reliability of settlement is extremely important for maintaining customer trust. We will continue to meet increasingly sophisticated customer needs and quickly provide solutions by taking advantage of our reliable settlement infrastructure and human resources. * A mobile device that can be used as a desktop PC within the company and as a laptop PC or tablet outside the company 49 SDGs report 2020 Considering Application of Blockchain/ Distributed Ledger Technology to Securities Business Daiwa Securities and Daiwa Institute of Research (DIR) played central roles in carrying out the second phase of a project to consider the application of blockchain/ distributed ledger technology (DLT) to the securities trade matching operations*. The project was conducted jointly with 26 companies, including institutional investors, nancial institutions, and computer system companies. This is a project using an industrial collaborative framework led by Japan Exchange Group. The rst phase of the project was conducted in 2017, con rming the usefulness of the application of DLT to the trade matching operations. Following such con rmation, the second phase of the project was conducted from September 2018 through January 2019. In that phase, discussions were held on data items in the operations, the standardization of the operational process, policy on operating the DLT infrastructure, and other issues. The project participants then drew up a more concrete plan toward the construction of a system. The results of the project were released as a working paper in February 2019. Daiwa Securities Group expects that the initiatives of this project will lead to the reduction of costs in the entire domestic securities industry and the enhancement of convenience, which will ultimately contribute to the bene t of investors. We will continue working to realize the plan in order to provide useful services to customers. * Operations in which a securities company and an institutional investor con rm the trading volume, fee, etc. with each other after the execution of securities trading Initiatives for Development of Market Functions Private Equity Investment in Myanmar In 2016, Daiwa PI Partners started considering private equity investment in Myanmar in earnest following the country's move to revise its laws and regulations, including corporate laws and investment laws, alongside its opening up of the economy and deregulation. The company has so far invested in ve deals. In addition, Daiwa PI Partners established DAIWA Myanmar Growth Fund in 2019. Among the investee companies of the fund, DO Micro nance Company Limited, which engages in the micro nance business, contributes to the development of the economy and improvement of people’s living standards by providing funds for business, including to the poor and women. Frontiir Pte. Ltd., a major Internet service provider, o ers people in Myanmar stable access to the Internet at reasonable prices. Rent 2 Own Holdings Pte.

Royal Golden Owls Co., Ltd., which operates an online e-commerce marketplace focusing on fashion and apparel products, provides a variety of products to a wide range of consumers in Myanmar, thereby helping to improve people’s convenience and living standards. In Myanmar, in which economic development has just begun, there are a large number of start-up companies with growth potential. We believe that, by continuing to provide capital to these companies, we will be able to promote their growth and contribute to enhancing the social infrastructure and living standards of people in Myanmar. 50 SDGs report 2020 Myanmar SME/ Two-Step Loan Project for Agriculture and Rural Development DIR has long been participating in the Republic of the Union of Myanmar Two-Step Loan Project for Agriculture and Rural Development (known as Agriculture-TSL ) and the Project for the Development of Finance for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (known as SME-TSL ) together with Japan Economic Research Institute Inc. and Sanyu Consultants Inc. The participation is part of our e orts to contribute to nancial inclusion, which is listed as an SDG target, and has continued for eight years since 2012. Agriculture-TSL is aimed at promoting agricultural mechanization in Myanmar and designed to assist Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank (MADB) in enhancing its capacity to extend long-term low-interest loans suited to the purchase of large agricultural machines. The project team provides practical training directly to more than 200 MADB branches across the country through on-site visits, while making proposals aimed at improving the business e ciency of MADB and advancing the modernization of its facilities. SME-TSL sets up low-collateral credit lines and credit lines for companies doing business with Japanese companies with the aim of improving smalland medium-sized companies' access to funds for capital investment. Technical assistance has been provided to the overall banking operations of Myanma Economic Bank (MEB), which manages loans extended through seven private-sector banks. By playing central roles in these two projects, DIR has gained deep trust from the Myanmar government and private companies and progressively increased its presence in the country. Both projects contribute to the economic development of Myanmar, and DIR remains committed to working on projects similar to these that will contribute to the realization of SDGs. Support for Stock Market Development in Vietnam In March 2019, DIR started providing technical support aimed at development of the stock market in Vietnam as entrusted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The company will implement a variety of support measures including the provision of training in both Vietnam and Japan to the State Securities Commission of Vietnam (SSC), the supervisory authorities of the capital market, as well as the HoChiMinh Stock Exchange (HOSE) and the Hanoi Stock Exchange (HNX), over a period of three years until February 2022. Speci cally, the support is centered on the following four themes, aiming to enhance the transparency and fairness of the stock market in the country: 1. Reinforcement of the stock market's capacity for monitoring against unfair trading 2. Tightening of regulations on and supervision over securities companies 3. Improvement of listing management and screening procedures 4. Penetration of investor-oriented management approach If this project helps improve the transparency and fairness of the Vietnamese stock market, it is expected to contribute to the Daiwa Securities Group's business related to Vietnamese stocks in the medium to long term. That is because if Vietnamese companies start incorporating a more investor-oriented perspective into their management, investor trust in the stock market will increase, leading to market invigoration. Support for the development of a stock market is aimed at contributing to the economic development of the relevant country, and DIR will continue to actively provide support to other emerging countries as well. Maintenance and Development of Financial and Capital Market Functions 28 51 SDGs report 2020 Corporate Governance Daiwa Securities Group clearly separates the supervisory and executive functions of its management to create a highly transparent and objective corporate governance system. We have adopted a structure in which Corporate Executive O cers of Daiwa Securities Group Inc., as well as employees responsible for head o ce functions, concurrently serve in the securities subsidiary. This re ects our pursuit of a management structure that improves the e ciency of head o ce operations and maximizes synergy of each group company. Corporate Governance Report [PDF: KB] Basic Views on Corporate Governance With group management based on a holding company structure, Daiwa Securities Group aims to achieve a highly transparent and objective governance structure in international terms. The Group has built a uni ed group management system that elicits synergies among group companies with highly e cient and specialized oversight of group companies. The Group has adopted a company with Three Committees System with the objective of supervising management through: a. Better decision-making agility by having the Board of Directors assign signi cant authority to corporate executive o cers while clarifying the division of duties among corporate executive o cers; b. More e ective supervisory functions at the Board of Directors from the appointment of outside directors with highly specialized skills, and better transparency in management from the establishment of the Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee with outside directors a majority of their members and serving as chairpersons; and c. Highly independent and ethical outside directors providing advice from an outside perspective to the Board of Directors and the three committees based on their knowledge and experiences. The Group also proactively engages in CSR activities to gain the trust of stakeholders. CSR encompasses providing excellent products and services to customers with integrity, appropriately returning pro ts and disclosing information to shareholders, creating pleasant work environments and fair personnel evaluation systems for employees, strictly observing regulations and following corporate ethics, managing the environment, and contributing to society. Through these initiatives, the Group aims to further enhance its corporate governance structure in terms of transparency, agility and e ciency, in order to continuously improve corporate value. The corporate governance structure consists of the Board of Directors and the three committees (Nominating Committee, Audit Committee and Compensation Committee) as supervisory functions. Business execution functions are embodied in the Executive Management Committee and its subcommittees comprising the Group Risk Management Committee, the Group Compliance Committee, the Disclosure Committee, the Group IT Strategy Committee, and the Overseas Management Committee, as well as the Group Internal Audit Committee, the internal audit organization that reports directly to the Chief Executive O cer (CEO). To incorporate more diverse perspectives into group management, we have appointed four female directors and corporate executive o cers. On a group-wide basis, nine female o cers serve as directors, corporate executive o cers, and executive o cers. 52 SDGs report 2020 Number of times each committee met (FY ) Nominating Committee 3 times Audit Committee 17 times Compensation Committee 4 times Board of Directors 10 times Rate of attendance at Board of 100％ Directors meetings by outside directors Major Initiatives in Corporate Governance History of Daiwa’s Corporate Governance June 1998 Elected outside auditors April 1999 Became the rst listed Japanese company to adopt a holding company structure Established the Advisory Board Established the Group Management Committee June 2000 Established the Compensation Committee June 2002 Elected outside directors Shortened directors’ terms of o ce from two years to one year July 2003 Established the Internal Control Committee 53 SDGs report 2020 June 2004 Shifted to a Committee system (currently, a company with Three Committees system) October 2015 Complied with the Corporate Governance Code Established the Outside Directors Committee April 2017 Appointed outside directors as chairpersons of all three committees Point Published the Corporate Governance Report detailing our response to the Corporate Governance Code Decided that more than two members and more than one third of the Board of Directors should be independent outside directors Established the Outside Director's Committee in FY for the purpose of increasing communication amongst outside directors Have elected one additional outside director and six out of 14 Board of Directors as outside directors since FY Strengthened management transparency and oversight functions by increasing the ratio of outside directors on the Nominating Committee and the Audit Committee Determined that all of the chairpersons of the three committees would be outside directors from FY while taking steps to further improve the governance system Supervisory Function The Board of Directors consists of 13*1 directors, including 6 outside directors*2 and 3 female directors. The Board of Directors determines key management policy, in addition to overseeing executive duties. In order to perform this supervisory role from multiple viewpoints in accordance with the demands of society, the policy for selecting new board members states that candidates must have a strong sense of ethics and demonstrate initiative and leadership. Additionally, outside directors are experts in management and other elds. In addition, the supervisory function of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. is reinforced by the Audit Committee and the O ce of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee, which consists of a majority of outside directors, plays a pivotal role in the supervision of executive duties. The Audit Committee is assisted by the O ce of the Audit Committee, which is a department independent of execution of business. *1. As of June 30, 2019 *2. Outside directors as de ned by Article 2-15 of Japan’s Companies Act Audit Committee’s Activities Daiwa Securities Group Inc.’s Audit Committee is engaged in auditing activities for duties executed by directors and corporate executive o cers as part of corporate governance. In particular, it focuses on verifying the construction and operational status of the internal control system. For example, in FY , in order to con rm one of the priority issues of the audit policy, E orts to realize and deepen customerrst business operations, the Audit Committee conducted hearings with the Compliance Department, Sales Headquarters, and sales o ces and employee unions. In February 2020, all Audit Committee members, including four outside directors, visited Daiwa Securities’ Compliance Department and head o ce. They received explanations from the Compliance Department regarding monitoring 54 SDGs report 2020 centered on VLS hearings and systems for inspecting sales branches, and from the head o ce regarding the conduct of meetings where opinions are actively presented, self-checks by sales sta , and measures for reviewing check methods by senior sta . The members asked various questions, including about sales sta ’s time allocation methods and motivation. They thus took advantage of the visit as a valuable opportunity to deepen their understanding. The Audit Committee will continue to deepen its understanding of the Group’s operations and proceed with initiatives to strengthen the Group’s corporate governance system. Audit Committee members receiving explanations from the Visit to the o ce oor of the head o ce Compliance Department Preventing Con ict-of-Interest Transactions between Group Companies Con ict-of-interest transactions can occur between Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Group companies in situations such as intra-Group transactions. Daiwa Securities Group applies rules regarding con icts of interest stipulated by Japan’s Companies Act to the Executive Management Committee as well as the Board of Directors. Con icts of interest between Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Group companies are appropriately prevented through a rule prohibiting an executive o cer from voting when he or she concurrently serves as an o cer of an interested Group company and thus has a special interest in a matter to be decided. 55 SDGs report 2020 Executive Compensation that is Closely Linked to Performance Compensation for directors and corporate executive o cers is based on the following fundamental policies. Compensation Committee’s Policy on Determination of Compensation of Directors and Corporate Executive O cers To create e ective incentives, which contribute to the increase of shareholders’ value through sound business development and also lead to the improvement of business performance in the short term as well as the medium and long term. To maintain a remuneration level which is competitive enough to recruit and retain people not only in Japan but also in the world as a global securities company group. To ensure the execution and supervision functions operated e ectively as a company with a nominating committee, etc. Compensation for directors and corporate executive o cers is determined by the Compensation Committee. Executive compensation has three components: basic compensation; performance-based compensation; and share price-linked compensation. The details of each component are as follows: Basic Compensation A xed amount calculated based on his/her position, duties and role. Performance-linked remuneration Determined depending on the level of individual contribution, based on consolidated ROE and consolidated ordinary income, which are settled as Performance KPIs of the Medium-Term Management Plan, while also comprehensively taking into account achievement status of the managerial goals set in the Medium-Term Management Plan, and the like. Does not apply to directors who do not serve as corporate executive o cers. Stock-linked remuneration To increase the link between remuneration and shareholders’ value, granted by the Company as Restricted Stock, etc., the value of which corresponds to a certain percentage of base remuneration. Does not apply to outside directors. Internal Control System and Internal Audit In recognition that management is responsible for maintaining an internal control system to ensure the sound and appropriate execution of business, the Group, under the main initiative of Daiwa Securities Group Inc., has established a system for managing the Group’s major business risks. Through this system, the Group endeavors to ensure business e ectiveness and e ciency, reliable nancial reporting, compliance with laws related to business activities, and asset preservation. Internal auditing departments verify the e cacy of this. The Internal Audit Department veri es the internal control system. This department sits independently from all other departments, reports to a dedicated corporate executive o cer, and ensures internal audits to act as an important function of raising Group value through the creation of a sound and e cient internal control system. It seeks to raise corporate value by e ectively conducting internal audits, and primarily implements risk-based internal audits. 56 SDGs report 2020 The Group’s business activities to which the Internal Audit Department pays special attention The internal control systems at Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. and overseas o ces as a global nancial instruments business operator Internal control systems at Daiwa Next Bank, Ltd. as a bank Status of businesses that involve collaboration between Group companies and with companies outside the Group Status of management of new risks arising from expansion into new business elds Status of control over Group companies by the holding company Authorization of Plans and Reporting of Results The authorization of internal audit plans and reporting of audit results are undertaken by the Group Internal Audit Committee. Internal audit plans are authorized by the Audit Committee or an appointed Audit Committee member who has received the prerequisite authority from the Audit Committee. The results of audits are also reported to the Audit Committee. Reports to the Group Internal Audit Committee are not limited to the audit results conducted at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. , but also include highly important ndings made during audits conducted on Group companies in Japan and overseas. Internal/External Group Cooperation and System Enhancements The Internal Audit Department collaborates with the internal auditing departments of domestic and overseas Group companies through periodic meetings, monitoring, and audit activities. The Internal Audit Department maintains communications with the Audit Committee and accounting auditor, making any necessary adjustments to ensure that audits are performed e ciently, and receives audit requests from the Audit Committee. The degree to which these internal auditing activities satisfy The Institute of Internal Auditors’ “International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing,” the global standard for internal auditing, is routinely evaluated by independent third parties, which helps to constantly improve its system. 57 SDGs report 2020 Structure and Achievements of Whistleblowing System (Corporate Ethics Hotline) Since January 2003, Daiwa Securities Group has been operating a Corporate Ethics Hotline, through which employees can report problems in the workplace directly to a corporate ethics o cer of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. or outside lawyers. The system mainly aims to detect corporate misconduct—which includes violations of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and other laws, regulations and rules that include bribery and corruption—in its early stages and prevent such misconduct from occurring. We declare the protection of callers in our regulations, stipulating that the executives and employees of Daiwa Securities Group may not cause detriment of any kind (dismissal, demotion, pay cuts, cancellation of worker dispatch contracts, replacement, etc.) in relation to reports by callers, may not ask people who have information on callers to disclose such information, and may not seek to identify callers or search for any other information about them in relation to reports. When the hotline is contacted, the corporate ethics o cer, in cooperation with the internal control o cers at each Group company, carries out a fact nding investigation, while taking steps to protect the caller. In FY , 42 reports were received through the whistleblowing system. Number and breakdown of reports to Corporate Ethics Hotline Matter Number Percentage Harassment-related 17 40% Compliance violation-related 10 24% Workplace environment/manners-related 9 21% Expense/cost-related 2 5% Labor management-related 1 2% Other 3 7% The Group is working to ensure that all employees are familiar with the Corporate Ethics Hotline, including sta at a liated companies and temporary workers, in order to ensure that anyone can use it without hesitation. We are also making e orts to respond quickly when calls are received. The Group is taking steps to improve the hotline so that it can work e ectively as a deterrent to prevent problems before they occur, not just as a measure to solve problems. Use of the intranet to increase employee awareness 58 SDGs report 2020 Compliance Daiwa Securities Group has four corporate principles. They are “building trust,” “placing importance on personnel,” “contributing to society,” and “maintaining healthy earnings results.” The Group believes that compliance is a signi cant element for achieving these principles. The goal of the Group’s compliance activities is not merely to “comply with laws and regulations,” but to earn the trust of customers, markets, society, and stakeholders. Compliance System The compliance division of Daiwa Securities Group consists of the Compliance Control Department and the Compliance Department. The former is mainly responsible for overall compliance planning and formulation and also plays a role as a gatekeeper to the market. The latter is tasked with providing support to sales branches and headquarters departments and divisions. The two collaborate to build a compliance system, working concurrently for Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and its subsidiary Daiwa Securities. At Daiwa Securities Group, the compliance system focuses on three key issues: securing the fairness and transparency of the market, eliminating any relations with anti-social forces (including countermeasures against money laundering and funding of terrorism), and maintaining information security. With these issues in mind, it supports Daiwa Securities and other Group companies. At Daiwa Securities, the Compliance Department monitors transactions and solicitation by sales branches, identi es challenges and issues, and visits sales branches to check their business status and provide instructions. The department also regularly conducts onsite inspections. Moreover, it visits the work sites of headquarters departments and divisions directly, identifying issues and providing training support. The Customer Counseling Center, established within the Compliance Department, comprehensively handles customer feedback and complaints and re ects them in the business to improve customer satisfaction. One of Daiwa Securities’ strengths lies in its stationing of full-time internal administrators belonging to the Compliance Department at all sales branches. The internal administrators work on improving the e ectiveness of the PDCA cycle (plan, do, check, act) at each sales branch. They also closely cooperate with the Compliance Department in an e ort to build a solid compliance system. Sta members in the compliance division—the Compliance Control Department, the Compliance Department, and internal administrators at sales branches—total approximately 250 as of April 1, 2020. They are striving to strengthen Daiwa Securities Group’s compliance system. 59 SDGs report 2020 Full Implementation of “Customer-First” Daiwa Securities is taking measures in line with the compliance program to ensure the e ective operation of our internal control system and strict compliance of our sales activities with laws and regulations. For FY , we set up the pillars outlined below, maintaining “Customer-First” as the keyword, as in the previous scal year. 1. Penetration and rm establishment of “Customer-First Operations”—pursuit of the greatest bene t to customers 2. Reinforcement of countermeasures against money laundering/funding of terrorism 3. Exercising of proper functions as a gatekeeper to the market 4. Reinforcement of compliance systems at overseas sites Daiwa Securities markets various nancial products, including investment trusts. When soliciting investment from customers, we ensure compliance with the principles of integrity and fairness, suitability, and self-responsibility, from the perspective of investor protection. We have adopted the practice of systematically providing continuous and thorough after-sale follow-ups, rather than leaving it to individual sales sta , especially when the market is trending downward. We believe that providing thorough, face-to-face explanations to customers and maintaining customer trust and a sense of security at times of market uctuations are part of the practice of Customer-First for Daiwa Securities as a marketer of nancial products. We will continue stepping up such initiatives going forward. Daiwa Securities Group’s Customer Inspection System Daiwa Securities Group recognizes that the nancial and capital markets are an important infrastructure for society. We also believe that sustaining trust in the markets is an important role that we must play. For example, to maintain trust, it is important for nancial institutions, such as Daiwa Securities Group, to eradicate antisocial forces in response to particularly strong social demands in Japan. Internationally, it is also important to prevent the use of the nancial and capital markets by terrorists, organized criminal groups engaged in money laundering and other crimes, as well as organizations and individuals designated by international institutions. For this reason, Daiwa Securities Group has put in place a structure to inspect new and existing clients 1. We undertake the following procedures for all new clients, including customers opening a new account with Daiwa Securities. (1) Compare with our own database constructed using information obtained from news reports, the Internet, and other sources (2) Compare with databases provided by public and other institutions (3) Utilize overseas information provided by Japan Center for International Finance 2. We regularly check for matters of concern related to existing clients and conduct further investigation if necessary. When a problem is identi ed, we promptly terminate or exclude trading. 3. We strive to obtain the latest information in collaboration with the police, the bar association, and other external organizations aimed at eradicating anti-social forces. 4. We conduct training for executives and employees at our Group companies every year. The training is designed to raise their awareness of the importance of eradicating anti-social forces and countermeasures against money laundering and the provision of funds to support terrorism, as well as to share knowledge of the latest laws and regulations, and relevant cases. In particular, the importance of countermeasures against money laundering and the provision of funds to support terrorism has grown worldwide. This has increased the need for implementing an e ective structure based on a riskbased approach to prevent such acts from occurring. We will work on reinforcement of our structure as an important management issue to ensure that Daiwa Securities Group is not used for money laundering or funding terrorism. 60 SDGs report 2020 Securing the Fairness and Transparency of the Market Daiwa Securities Group is working to secure the fairness and transparency of the market from two standpoints. These are how to check and prevent illicit transactions by investors and by Daiwa Securities itself. To prevent illegal transactions by investors, Daiwa Securities checks daily transactions by extracting deals that go beyond certain criteria, such as whether they have an excessive impact on the market. In particular, in order to prevent insider trading from occurring, we ask about customers’ place of employment and positions within their companies before registering their information. This practice allows us to check transactions as soon as trading orders are placed by customers who are in a position to acquire internal information. We also check the past transactions conducted with us retroactively when timely disclosure is made of important information. To prevent illicit transactions within Daiwa Securities Group, we strictly manage not just material facts of listed companies but also broader information related to them in a similar way. We have also introduced a system managing their information, keeping track of people obtaining information and where information has been sent. Through these e orts, we have constructed a structure to prevent illegal transactions. Preventing Con ict-of-Interest Transactions between Group Companies Con ict-of-interest transactions can occur between Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Group companies in situations such as intra-Group transactions. Daiwa Securities Group applies rules regarding con icts of interest stipulated by Japan’s Companies Act to the Executive Management Committee as well as the Board of Directors. Con icts of interest between Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and Group companies are appropriately prevented through a rule prohibiting an executive o cer from voting when he or she concurrently serves as an o cer of an interested Group company and thus has a special interest in a matter to be decided. Initiatives against Bribery and Corruption In line with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact, Daiwa Securities Group works to prevent corruption. Daiwa Securities’ code of ethics and conduct includes prohibitions on employees giving or receiving rewards or entertaining customers. Headquarters departments and o ces have also incorporated the status of observance of management rules on entertainment into self-inspection items since FY . Each department and o ce therefore inspects their practice voluntarily, and the results of inspections are checked by relevant departments and divisions. O cers in charge or relevant departments and divisions also monitor the use status of entertainment expenses at sales branches to con rm that such expenses are appropriately spent. With respect to dealings with government o cials, headquarters departments and o ces and sales branches all manage such dealings separately. They thus keep an especially close eye on those dealings, as entertaining government o cials is prohibited by law. Our management rules on entertainment also prohibit employees from giving bene ts to government o cials of foreign countries. In addition, we provide periodic e-learning training and engage in other awareness-raising activities for employees to ensure that we are not involved in bribery or corruption. We have also built a structure that prevents the fraudulent granting of bene ts at overseas worksites by establishing internal rules that suit local laws and regulations. 61 SDGs report 2020 Information Security We at Daiwa Securities Group have implemented numerous information security measures to protect personal information entrusted to us by customers in a safe and precise manner. In many personal information leakage incidents arising in recent years, leakage has occurred at third parties to which operations have been entrusted. Accordingly, at the time of and after signing an outsourcing contract with a third party, we thoroughly check the information management structure of the party. We also conduct on-site visits before outsourcing to examine the business practices of the potential outsourcing contractor. Following the enforcement of the My Number Act (the Act on the Use of Numbers to Identify a Speci c Individual in Administrative Procedures) in October 2015, we now ask customers to provide us with their Individual Numbers. We have controlled access to information entrusted to us by customers, including Individual Numbers, by isolating such information physically and managing it with extra care. No matter how much information is systematized, there always remains a human element. To ensure that a mistake does not occur, we focus on training for sales personnel to recognize the importance of information management, while keeping the number of employees authorized to access personal information at the minimum level necessary. Daiwa Securities also in principle bans employees from taking personal information out of the company. When it is absolutely necessary to take information out for business purposes, we require employees to obtain prior approval from an internal administrator or other superior and to keep records, thereby strictly managing such information. We also strictly manage the printing of personal information and output to external storage media, while constantly monitoring whether there is any unauthorized use. Moreover, since some of the documents received from customers are paper-based, we prepare special storage les to avoid the risk of losing documents within the company. In addition, we have developed and implemented a reporting ow in the event that an information leakage incident occurs. Based on this ow, the department where the incident occurred immediately shares the incident with the information security administrator and reports to the department with responsibility for information management. The incident is then reported to the management, including the o cer who takes charge of overseeing information security. Fostering Compliance Awareness Daiwa Securities Group considers it extremely important for each employee to always maintain a high level of compliance awareness. We have therefore adopted a compliance-related program in training for new employees and a number of other internal training courses. We also give tests on compliance regularly through e-learning. At Daiwa Securities, we post a “Personal Information Check Test” and “Compliance Digest” every Monday on our intranet and also broadcast compliance-related content about 10 times a year in our internal TV program which is aired every morning. Moreover, at Daiwa Securities’ sales branches, the branch chief and the internal administrator lead an initiative to provide training and instructions suited to each workplace on a daily basis. The branch chief also chairs a compliance meeting in which all branch members participate. We have thus implemented various systems to keep the compliance awareness of all employees at a high level, and continue to foster awareness among employees. Important Issues for FY and Beyond We will continue with our initiatives toward the realization and evolution of “Customer-First Operations.” At the same time, we will continue to reinforce our countermeasures against money laundering and funding of terrorism as a challenge for particular focus in FY . It is imperative that we comply with set rules, but we consider that the goal of our initiatives should not only be to achieve such adherence. Compliance is a common theme that must be addressed by the entire securities industry and it is also a matter of trust in the industry as a whole. We will therefore exchange information with industry peers and proceed with measures while sharing good practices with each other. Daiwa Securities Group will strive to strengthen compliance as a leading company of the industry going forward, and will make e orts to contribute to enhancing trust in the entire securities industry. 62 SDGs report 2020 Risk Management Daiwa Securities Group recognize the importance of identifying and evaluating the various risks associated with our business operations accurately, and controlling them e ectively, while we pursues pro tability and growth. We aim to maintain a sound nancial base and pro t structure by properly balancing risks and returns and appropriately control not only short-term risks but also risks that are likely to appear in the mediumto long-term, such as climate change risk. By doing so, we seek to achieve sustainable improvement in corporate value. Response to the TCFD Risk management system Based on its RAF, the Board of Directors of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. has approved the Rules for Risk Management. The rules de ne basic policies related to risk management, the types of risks that need to be managed, and the responsible executives and departments for each major risk. In order to establish an e ective risk governance system, we have created a Guideline for Three Lines of Defense and maintain a comprehensive structure for risk management. 63 SDGs report 2020 Basic policies as de ned by the Rules for Risk Management Daiwa Securities Group 1. Management's proactive involvement of management in risk management 2. The structure of a risk management system that responds to features of the risks held by the Group 3. Understand overall risk based on integrated risk management, secure strong capital and the soundness of liquidity 4. Clarify the risk management process Each of the Group companies conducts risk management that responds to the risk pro le and size of each business in accordance with the abovementioned basic policies. The Risk Management Department and responsible departments for each risk within Daiwa Securities Group Inc. monitor Group companies, and report the risk exposures and issues concerning the risk management system to the Group Risk Management Committee. This is a sub-committee of the Executive Management Committee of Daiwa Securities Group Inc., and it undertakes discussions and makes decisions about reported issues. In addition, major Group companies regularly hold risk management meetings in order to strengthen their risk management systems. Types of Risks to Be Managed / Managing Major Risks Daiwa Securities Group faces various risks in the course of its business activities. The Group therefore believes that it is important to identify these based on business characteristics and risk pro les, and appropriately evaluate and manage those risks in order to maintain a sound nancial base and earnings structure. Risks that are particularly important for the Group are those that involve our key securities business. Because the Group utilizes its own accounts to temporarily hold product positions for sales purposes and to provide products to customers, the Group is subject to market risk due to market uctuations, foreign currency and other liquidity risk, credit risk related to counterparties and issuers, and risk for which hedges do not function, as well as operational risk that naturally occurs through the execution of business. The Group utilizes stress tests*1 and top risk management*2 to manage risk on an integrated basis, including measuring the impact on capital and liquidity within the Group from a forward-looking perspective. *1. Stress tests are used for the integrated evaluation of impacts on capital, liquidity, and business systems based on probable stress scenarios that may have a major impact on the Group *2. Top risk management is used to select and manage those risk events that stand to have a signi cant impact on the Group, in the event that such risks should emerge, as top risks 64 SDGs report 2020 (1) Market risk management Market risk refers to the risk of incurring losses due to market uctuations, which a ect the value of stock prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. In terms of the Group’s trading business, by providing market liquidity the Group acquires compensation while at the same time taking on market risk through the holding of a certain amount of nancial assets. The Group implements suitable hedges to curtail uctuations in pro ts and losses. However, as hedges may fail to function e ectively in times of stress, the Group sets limits on Value at Risk (VaR)*1 and loss estimates under various types of stress test*2 to ensure that they are within the scope of equity capital after taking into consideration nancial conditions and such factors as the business plans and budgets of subject departments. The Group also sets limits on such facets as position and sensitivity. The departments in charge of the Group’s trading services calculate positions and sensitivity for the purpose of assessing their own market risk, and monitor such. Meanwhile, risk management departments also monitor the status of market risk, con rm whether risk falls within the established limits, and report on such to management on a daily basis. *1. Value at Risk (VaR) represents the maximum possible loss of a given trading portfolio with a given probability over a given time horizon. *2. Stress tests are used to calculate the Group’s maximum losses based on scenarios of the most signi cant market uctuations of the past and due to scenarios based on hypothetical risk events. (2) Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk of losses caused in cases where a counterparty of a trade or the issuer of a nancial product held by the Group su ers a default, or credibility deteriorates. The credit risk of the Group’s trading activities involves counterparty risk and issuer risk. When the Group provides products and engages in asset management and investments, there exists a risk that its exposure to various products and transactions could be concentrated on speci c counterparty groups. If the credit situation at such counterparty groups should worsen, large-scale losses could be generated. For this reason, the Group sets limits on its total exposure to individual counterparty groups and monitors this exposure regularly. Supplier risk The Group sets an upper limit on the amount of credit that can be accepted for a trading partner group and monitors it regularly. Issuer risk We also monitor the amount of credit risk of the issuers of nancial instruments held as a result of our market making activities. 65 SDGs report 2020 Daiwa Securities Group (Consolidated) Value at Risk Range and Assumption of VaR Scope: Trading accounts Con dence level: 99% (one-side test), Holding period: 1 day Adjusted for price correlation between products (Billions of yen) 18/6 18/9 18/12 19/3 19/6 19/9 19/12 20/3 VaR (Month-end) 1.34 1.39 1.76 1.06 1.33 1.42 0.94 1.22 Quarter High 1.80 1.67 1.87 2.29 1.68 1.55 1.61 1.77 Low 1.16 1.15 0.95 0.86 0.74 1.02 0.94 0.87 Average 1.40 1.36 1.34 1.45 1.18 1.27 1.28 1.18 By risk factor (Month-end) Equity 0.65 0.51 0.40 0.29 0.38 0.39 0.34 0.19 Interest 1.21 1.23 1.68 1.06 1.16 1.35 1.21 1.12 Currency 0.16 0.17 0.24 0.18 0.21 0.24 0.20 0.20 Commodities 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Note: Management of market risk and credit risk unrelated to the trading business Besides the trading business, the Group also owns operational investment securities related to the investment business, loans and securities related to the banking business, and investment securities that are held for the purpose of maintaining business relationships. Those assets are also exposed to market and credit risks, and risk management is conducted according to the risks that are unique to each line of business. 66 SDGs report 2020 (3) Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk refers to the risk of su ering losses due to cash management di culties or having to nance at markedly higher costs than usual as a result of a change in market conditions or a deterioration of Group companies' nance. Basic Policy on Fund Procurement The Group conducts securities-related operations using a variety of nancial assets and liabilities, and makes investments and loans that contribute to providing new value as an integrated securities group with a hybrid business model. In order to prevent market uctuations from a ecting the continuation of our business activities, the Group is constantly striving to secure the stability of fund procurement. Additionally, with the anticipation that nancial crises may make it di cult to procure new funds and reacquire existing funds, the Group diversi es repayment periods and fund sources. Liquidity management system using Liquidity Management Indicators Daiwa Securities Group Inc. has established a liquidity management system that utilizes the regulatory consolidated liquidity coverage ratio as well as its own liquidity management indicators. The Group performs daily checks to ascertain that the liquidity portfolios in place are su cient to cover the repayment of unsecured short-term funds due within a certain time period as well as the estimated out ow of funds under stress in an appropriate time frame—here a number of stress scenarios are adopted. These e orts are made to ensure the Group can continue its business operations even when it becomes impossible to procure funds without collateral for a whole year. Contingency Funding Plan The Group recognizes the emergence of liquidity risks can have a direct impact that leads to the business failure of a nancial institution. Accordingly, Daiwa Securities Group has put in place a contingency funding plan that prede nes the required response methods, roles and authorities, and procedures, among others, in order to ensure that the Group responds appropriately as a uni ed entity at the time of a liquidity crisis. This plan states the basic policy concerning the reporting lines depending upon the urgency of stress internally originated, including a credit crunch, and externally originated including an abrupt change in the market environment, and the method of raising capital. The contingency plan enables the Group to prepare a system for securing liquidity through a swift response. 67 SDGs report 2020 (4) Operational risk management Operational risk is the risk of losses that occur when internal processes, people, and systems do not perform adequately or do not function; it can also arise from external events. De nitions of Principal Operational Risks Type De nition Operations Risk The risk of su ering losses due to the neglect of proper operations by employees and executives or due to accidents or impropriety System Risk The risk of su ering losses due to computer systems going down, malfunctioning, or experiencing system inadequacies, and the risk of su ering losses due to the inappropriate use of computers Information Security Risk The risk that a threat to information assets could materialize, preventing information security (con dentiality, completeness, or continued availability) from being assured Compliance Risk The risk of su ering losses due to the failure of employees and executives to comply with corporate ethics or laws and regulations, and the risk of su ering losses due to lawsuits with customers and other parties in Japan Legal Risk The risk of su ering losses due to the inappropriate conclusion of contracts, breaches of contract, or lawsuits with customers or other parties in relation to overseas o ces Human Resources Risk The risk of su ering losses due to problems in labor management or from the standpoint of workplace safety, and the risk of being unable to secure necessary human resources Tangible Fixed Asset Risk The risk of su ering losses due to damage to tangible xed assets as the result of natural disasters or external factors, or to negligence on the part of executives and employees The Group classi es operational risks into the seven categories listed in the above table and monitors them by assigning departments responsible for individual risks. As the Group’s business becomes more sophisticated, diversi ed, and systemized, the accompanying risks become more varied. As a result, the importance of managing operational risk has grown each year. Major Group companies control their operational risks appropriately by measures including risk control self-assessments (RCSAs), in accordance with rules on operational risk management set by Daiwa Securities Group Inc. In addition, the Group has taken other necessary measures, including the implementation of rigid rules concerning authority, the automation of o ce operations for reducing human errors, and the preparation of procedural manuals. Each Group company strives to reduce operational risk according to the nature of its own business. * RCSA (Risk Control Self-Assessment) uses a predetermined assessment sheet to identify and assess operational risks, analyzes risks based on frequency of occurrence and impact, and evaluates and veri es e cacy of risk mitigation e orts. 68 SDGs report 2020 (5) Reputational risk management Reputational risk refers to the possibility of the Group sustaining unforeseen losses and the Group’s counterparties being adversely a ected due to a deterioration of its reliability, reputation, and assessment caused by the spread of rumors or erroneous information. There are no uniform procedures for managing reputational risk because it can emanate from a variety of sources. The Group has established various regulations under its Disclosure Policy, with particular emphasis on the management and provision of information. It has also set up the Disclosure Committee within Daiwa Securities Group Inc. Each Group company is obligated to report information that could turn into reputational risk to the Disclosure Committee. That way, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. can obtain and centrally manage information, and it disseminates accurate information in a prompt manner according to the decisions of the Disclosure Committee. The Group strives to keep abreast of problems and occurrences that may a ect its reputation so that if and when such problems occur, their impact on the Group can be minimized. It also acts to ensure that erroneous and inaccurate information is properly corrected, and that it responds appropriately to libel and other issues. The Group has public relations and investor relations systems in place to prevent and minimize risks regarding its reputation. (6) Accounting and tax risk management Accounting and tax risk is the risk of not conducting appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure in accordance with accounting or taxation standards, laws, and regulations, or of not ling or paying taxes appropriately, as well as the risk of losses arising as a result. The Group strives to reduce accounting risk by operating in accordance with fundamental regulations related to internal controls on nancial reporting, and by establishing, putting into practice, and striving to improve its internal controls on nancial reporting. In addition, by notifying principal Group companies of necessary reporting items related to tax risk management and receiving such items in a timely manner, the Group endeavors to appropriately determine the tax risk management status and risk conditions for the Group as a whole, thereby reducing its tax risk. Tax Policy The Daiwa Securities Group has enacted Daiwa Securities Group Tax Policy in aiming to develop corporate tax governance, and describes our code of conduct and standard of judgements in taxation. Daiwa Securities Group Tax Policy 1. Daiwa Securities Group complies with laws and ordinances, and contributes to sustainable development of society through appropriate tax payments with high ethical standards. 2. Daiwa Securities Group rewards our shareholders by achieving sound pro ts based on proper and fair tax planning. 3. For cross border intra group transactions, Daiwa Securities Group sets an appropriate price, which can achieve adequate accountability under transfer price tax regulations. 69 SDGs report 2020 4. The CFO, executive o cer in charge of Finance, and Head of Finance Department of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. from time to time provide guidance and advice to subsidiaries and other departments within the Group as necessary, so that corporate governance over tax matters can be well shared and implemented throughout Daiwa Securities Group. Business Continuity Plan (BCP) To be prepared for disruptions of social infrastructures, we have drawn up a business continuity plan (BCP). The BCP prioritizes important operations to be restored or continued* in order to keep the nancial markets open and protect customers’ economic activities. Disruptions of social infrastructure might make our head o ce functions, branches and data centers or other important facilities inoperative. They can be caused by events such as earthquakes, res, storms, oods, other extraordinary weather conditions, terrorism, large-scale power failures, and serious outbreaks of infectious diseases. In accordance with the BCP, we will not only ensure the safety of customers and our employees, and protect our assets, but will also strive to continue our vital operations in the nancial markets where our business serves the public interest. For example, we boast Japan’s highest level backup center, and have established a system which enables us to easily switch to the alternate system in case of an emergency at headquarters. We can therefore continue vital operations through a substitute o ce location. Prioritized operations to be restored or continued 1. Carrying out securities transactions traded in the markets and yet to be settled 2. Payment to our customers 3. New orders from customers to sell or cancel the following products and sell securities back to exit a long position in margin trading Domestic listed shares, including closing long positions on margin transactions MRF (money reserve funds) Japanese government bonds for individual investors Ordinary deposits Measures to Address Disaster Risk by Region Daiwa Securities has o ces across Japan. As disaster risk di ers amongst regions, it has formulated a disaster response plan for each sales branch and is preparing disaster relief supplies that re ect the disaster risk for each branch. The hazard maps created by the municipalities of respective regions are sent to branches and made available on our intranet. 70 SDGs report 2020 IT Strategy and Management of Systems Risk Under its Medium-Term Management Plan, “Passion for the Best” 2020, Daiwa Securities Group is promoting the IT strategy (basic IT policy) of establishing an IT platform that provides momentum for the digital transformation. The Group is also working to further strengthen IT governance in order to address the diversi cation of its business portfolios and the evolution of technology. IT governance Structure The Group IT Strategy Committee is established at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. as a sub-committee of the Executive Management Committee, and the IT Strategy Committee is created at Daiwa Securities as a subcommittee of the Management Committee. These committees deliberate and decide mediumand long-term IT investment policies and plans after taking into account business needs and trends in the business environment, such as systems and regulations. Against a backdrop of globally tightening nancial regulations, increasingly serious and sophisticated cyberattacks, greater digitalization enabled by technological evolution, and unbundling of nancial services, the chief information o cer (CIO) has been placed in charge of overseeing all IT-related operations across the Group, including overseas bases and in new business lines based on hybrid strategies, to ensure Group-wide risk management and business innovation. By managing IT resources and further strengthening collaboration within the Group, the CIO is working to enhance the Group’s IT capabilities. Status of IT investment The Group has been investing in IT in order to provide products and services responding to customer needs from the perspective of customer-oriented operations, promote a digital transformation which aims at improving the e ciency of existing business and advance business innovation and business process innovation in order to engage in high value-added business, establish basic infrastructure that is indispensable to the continuation of business, comply with legal requirements, and enhance the risk management system. In FY , the Group established an environment in which employees can focus more on further improvement of customer satisfaction, such as by introducing business terminals and communication tools that are premised on telecommuting in order to enable working e ciently regardless of location, and increase the frequency of contact with customers. In addition, the Group streamlined the business process, such as account opening, etc., by introducing paperless processes and automation, and launched a new accumulation investment service, which allows customers to set and manage funding conditions according to their purpose. The Group also worked on increasing the sophistication of risk management such as by strengthening measures against cyber-attacks and money laundering. Systems risk management Daiwa Securities Group has worked to maintain and enhance the management of systems risk in order to reliably provide high-quality services to customers while protecting information assets from various threats and risks originating from inside or outside the company. In light of the growing threat of cyber-attacks over the past few years, we recognize the importance of cybersecurity as a group management issue, and have accordingly established a cybersecurity management system centered on Group-wide DaiwaCSIRT*. In recent years, new attack methods have been reported, including those that target terminals used for telecommuting and those that in ltrate networks through Group companies, business partners, and contractors. Therefore, the Group continues to collect and analyze the latest information on cyber-attack methods and vulnerability while coordinating with external organizations and companies, and continues to work toward improving its resistance and resilience to cyber-attacks. * Computer Security Incident Response Team: the organization that manages cyber security across departments 71 SDGs report 2020 Human Rights Education and Awareness Daiwa Securities Group states in its corporate principles that “the Group will strive to maintain a high sense of morality and duty, endeavoring to continue contributing to the sustainable growth of the societies in which we operate.” To improve a corporate culture rooted in the basic principles of respect for human rights, we are further strengthening our e orts to educate and enlighten our employees about human rights. We therefore respect the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, ISO 26000, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the Act on the Promotion of Human Rights Education and Human Rights Awareness-Raising. We have also joined the UN Global Compact. Basic Policy for Initiatives Addressing Human Rights and Social Integration Issues 1. Daiwa Securities Group supports and complies with the protection of human rights as advocated internationally and does not infringe on human rights within the boundaries of its in uence. 2. The Daiwa Securities Group educates and instructs Group employees with accurate information on human rights and social integration issues. 3. At the same time, the Group views human rights and social integration issues as our own problem, not somebody else’s problem, and fosters a sensitivity that enables empathy with the su ering of others. 4. We provide an equitable working environment that values people and is free of discrimination or human rights violations based on race, nationality, biological sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. 5. Each employee is a member of society unburdened by prejudice. Speci c E orts 1. We highly value the human rights of every stakeholder and our sta will always address clients, local communities and their members with great awareness of human rights. 2. We work to ensure that our hiring and recruiting, personnel evaluations and labor management practices are always fair. 3. The Group is continually improving internal human rights education and awareness programs, including regular training and feedback and response loops. Human Rights Awareness Promotion Committee Revised on August 12, 2016 Human Rights Education and Awareness System In 1984, Daiwa Securities Group set up the Human Rights Awareness Promotion Committee. The committee aimed at promoting activities and training for raising human rights awareness, thereby encouraging better understanding and 72 SDGs report 2020 appreciation of social integration and other human rights issues. We have been working to achieve its objectives. Besides the committee, all Group managers at the head o ce or branch level act in a promotional role, engaging in education and awareness activities to ensure that employees correctly understand and acknowledge human rights and social integration issues. Daiwa Securities Group has been a member of the Industrial Federation for Human Rights, Tokyo, since 1998. The Federation is composed of 123 companies mostly headquartered in Tokyo with a combined total of 1.5 million employees (as of April 2020). Federation members work together to further improve their employees’ awareness of human rights issues through research and communication. Initiatives in FY In FY , we provided human rights education as part of training for the Group’s new employees conducted immediately after their induction ceremony. It is also included in training for young employees (annex education) and for those newly becoming general managers, managers, and associate managers. The chief of the Human Rights Awareness Promotion Committee Secretariat has taken charge of all of these training courses. We have also been providing training on LGBT issues since FY . It has been conducted for those in the Group’s compliance and human resources divisions. The issues are also taken up in training for new employees every year. LGBT issues are also included in training for promoted employees as an opportunity to deepen their understanding. The cumulative number of employees participating in training on LGBT issues is now 4,835. The Group held a Human Rights Awareness Workshop for all executives and employees to consider human rights from multiple viewpoints. Discussions between participants were held after watching “Introduction to Diversity,” an educational video with the theme of the importance of respecting diversity. We also called for human rights awareness slogans between October and November 2019 in a contest designed to promote a broader and deeper understanding of human rights issues. Contest participation was open not just to employees but also to their families. The winning entries were presented in our in-house magazine. Human rights education for employees for FY Training 545 new employees participants Objective To acquire basic knowledge concerning human rights and to understand and raise awareness of the Group’s fundamental principles concerning respect for human rights Training 1,201 promoted employees participants Objective To acquire knowledge and raise awareness concerning human rights required for their respective positions 73 SDGs report 2020 Supply Chain Management Supply Chain Management and ESG Due Diligence including Human Rights Daiwa Securities Group regularly checks documents disclosed by major business partners, including providers of IT equipment and services, as well as news reports about these companies and their reputation on the Internet in order to address issues in the Group's supply chain, including those related to the environment, society, human rights, information and cyber security. If any issues are found, we take steps such as urging the business partners to make improvements. We also collect information provided by public institutions within and outside Japan and exchange information with external parties to be aware of human rights issues existing in the countries and regions where the Group conducts business operations. We then consider taking appropriate measures for important issues. We carry out due diligence in deals underwritten, considering not only business performance and nancial aspects, but also ESG issues. When we nd issues regarding the business model of an issuer or its planned use of proceeds, we conduct more thorough due diligence through such means as eld work and meetings, and sometimes make proposals for improvement to the issuer. If major concerns remain even after taking such measures, we report them to Chief Risk O cer (CRO). Similarly, we also carry out due diligence in self-investment deals Daiwa Securities Group's Response to Issues in its Supply Chain Subject Speci c initiatives Frequency Major business partners including providers of Check documents disclosed by partner Regularly IT equipment and services companies and external information Countries where the Group conducts business Collect information on human rights issues As needed operations Deals underwritten Due diligence in consideration of ESG As needed Self-investment deals Due diligence As needed Response to the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 74 SDGs report 2020 Engagement with Shareholders and Investors Daiwa Securities Group works hard to promote communication with shareholders and other investors.

Breakdown of Shareholders Capital Policy Daiwa Securities Group, aiming to achieve sustainable growth by earning healthy pro ts, will implement a capital policy that takes all stakeholders into consideration by striving to balance investment in growth, improve capital e ciency, maintaining nancial health, and enhancing shareholder returns. Dividend Policy Daiwa Securities Group Inc. strives to continuously enhance shareholder value, including pro t distribution. In principle, dividends are paid semiannually (interim and year-end dividends) at a payout ratio of 50% or more based on consolidated nancial performance. However, after taking stability into account, when we can secure a su cient amount of internal reserves required for future business development, we intend to increase returns to our shareholders, including share buybacks. Shareholder Returns We raised the target payout ratio to at least 50% from FY . When we can secure a su cient amount of the internal reserves required for future business development, we intend to increase returns to our shareholders, including share buybacks. The full year dividend payout ratio was 51.1% in FY , with the total return ratio standing at 92.5%. 75 SDGs report 2020 Share buyback Buyback period From August 28, 2019 to December 3, 2019 Total number of shares repurchased 50 million shares (Percentage of total number of issued shares excluding treasury stock: 3.19%) Total amount of shares repurchased ¥25,081 million Fair Disclosure The Group has formulated a Disclosure Policy, which outlines the Group’s basic approach to information disclosure, and strives to provide information that is fair, timely, and appropriate. As a company engaged in the securities business, we are committed to fair information disclosure in accordance with the Fair Disclosure Rules so that we will be a role model for other listed companies. We will strengthen disclosure not only of nancial information, but also non nancial information with social and environmental aspects that are not apparent in the nancial gures in the short term. Disclosure Policy We will observe fair and timely disclosure of important nancial, social and environmental information ( ManagementRelated Information ) regarding the Daiwa Securities Group so that our stakeholders, (including shareholders, investors and the communities we operate in) may understand and maintain realistic expectations of the Daiwa Securities Group. We will comply with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and other laws and ordinances related to securities transactions and the various rules of the nancial Instruments exchanges where on which our stock is listed. We will endeavor to achieve fair disclosure both in terms of content and timing. We will utilize various communication channels including presentations, telephone conferences, the Internet and printed materials to disclose information in an easy to comprehend manner for investors. We will consciously act as a leader of the securities markets in terms of disclosure and set the standards for other listed corporations. To realize the above policies we will establish Disclosure Regulations* and set up a Disclosure Committee to lay down procedures for disclosing information. 76 SDGs report 2020 Communication with Shareholders and Other Investors Every year, many shareholders attend our general meeting of shareholders, which is an opportunity for us to interact directly with everyone. To increase communication opportunities, we also carry out various IR activities. These include telephone conferences on the days of earnings announcements, brie ngs about the company for individual investors, management strategy brie ng sessions, one-on-one meetings with institutional investors and analysts in Japan and overseas, and participation in Daiwa Investment Conferences held within and outside Japan. From February 2020, we started refraining from holding brie ngs at venues and one-on-one meetings from the viewpoint of preventing the spread of COVID. However, we have been actively engaging in dialogue using alternative methods such as websites and telephone to continue to communicate with our shareholders. In addition, we are further developing information disclosure on our IR websites and publishing integrated reports and business reports for shareholders. We will continue working to make our communications even more precise and easy to understand for shareholders. Feedback and questions received from shareholders are reported to the CEO and other management personnel on a weekly basis, as well as at Board of Directors meetings. Questionnaire for Shareholders We distribute a questionnaire to shareholders coinciding with the distribution of rewards under our shareholder rewards program at the end of September, to gather and incorporate their views into management and IR activities.

We are trying to appeal more to women’s individual interests by introducing thriving female employees as role models in internal publications in order to increase the number of women in managerial positions. A career consultation service has been set up on the Group’s internal WLB promotion website. Female executives as well as heads of each department, o ce, and branch give advice on the concerns and inquiries of female employees. In 2015, the current Chairman of the Board of Daiwa Securities Group Inc. showed his support for the “Declaration on Action” by a group of male leaders who will create “A Society in which Women Shine” spearheaded by Japan’s Gender Equality Bureau Cabinet O ce. See also Work-Life Balance for more information on promoting women's activities. Targets Related to Initiatives for Empowering Women Daiwa Securities Group has a proven track record of implementing a wide range of initiatives that help female employees reach their full potential. At Daiwa Securities, we have set speci c targets for the years through FY . In this manner, positive steps are being taken to provide an environment in which employees with diverse values can maximize their capabilities. Targets for Years through FY (Daiwa Securities) Ratio of women in managerial positions: At least 15%, a more than vefold increase from the FY level Ratio of women in new graduates recruited: 50% (stable) Ratio of women among participants in training: 50% Rate of taking annual leave: At least 70% Rate of taking childcare leave for male employees: 100% Support for Female Employees’ Career Advancement By increasing the number of role models, we are making it easier for the Group’s female sta to envision their career path. In this context, there has been a sharp increase in female employees aspiring to advance their careers by switching to career-track and regional career-track positions in recent years. To date, more than 1,400 female employees have converted to career-track positions. An increasing number of employees have also taken advantage of our Professional Return Plan, a system for re-hiring employees who left work to raise children or care for family members, starting them at the same level of compensation as when they left. The scope of this system was expanded in FY . This has helped us to secure talented personnel who support business operations. The number of female employees right before being promoted to managerial positions is 2,225 at the end of June 2020, substantially increasing from 1,093 in 2005. We also launched a career support training initiative for female employees (Daiwa Woman’s Forum) in FY , and a program for women in managerial positions (Daiwa Woman’s Management Forum) in 2018. These programs have contributed to building networks among women. 85 SDGs report 2020 Appointment of Female Executives and Women in Managerial Positions Daiwa Securities Group has a total of nine women in top managerial positions who work as directors, corporate executive o cers, and executive o cers. They include three female executives serving as directors and corporate executive o cers at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. The number of women in managerial positions is increasing year by year, with the Group’s total number standing at 666 as of the end of June 2020. The ratio of women in managerial positions has risen from 2.2% at the end of FY to 13.2% on a group-wide basis (up from 2.3% to 15.9% at Daiwa Securities). Becoming a Member of 30% Club Japan Daiwa Securities Group Inc. supports activities undertaken by the 30% Club Japan, with its Chairman of the Board and President and CEO participating as members. The organization, launched in Japan in May 2019, aims to increase the ratio of women in top management of Japanese companies. It has set the goal of raising the ratio of women in the Boards of Directors at the TOPIX 100 companies to 30% by 2030. Chairman of the Board of Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Takashi Hibino, participates as a steering committee member. We will accelerate our initiatives to produce female leaders who will lead Japan’s nancial industry. Support for the Success of Veteran Employees Daiwa Securities Group has in place a Senior Advisor System that enables veteran employees with a wealth of experience to play an active role in the workplace. Senior advisors are dispatched to locations of their choice and engage in community-based consulting and sales from a long-term perspective. Highly-motivated and talented employees can continue working after retirement under our Daiwa Master System. In FY , we started allowing senior advisors to continue working regardless of their age. A total of 110 employees used this system in FY . In accordance with the e ectuation of revisions to the Act on Stabilization of Employment of Elderly Persons in 2013, and as the careers of employees are lengthening, we associate our sustainable growth as a company with the employment of older people who wish to keep learning and working in a meaningful way as a part of the organization. Daiwa Securities is greatly expanding its training 86 SDGs report 2020 programs for employees aged 45 and older, and has introduced the License Certi cation System that provides incentives to employees who have improved their skills and polished their acumen as professionals. Over the four years since these programs were introduced, approximately 1,800 employees, 60% of employees aged 45 and older, have participated in the more than 20,000 seminars o ered by these programs. In addition, we introduced a Superior Managing Director System as the highest employee position and enhanced the personnel system for veteran employees with outstanding expertise and knowledge who have made remarkable achievements. We support both work and caregiving, and are creating an environment in which employees can move forward enthusiastically without concerns over their future lifestyle. We have also introduced long service leave for employees in their th year and th year at the Group. The leave is designed with gratitude to provide employees who have contributed greatly to the Group’s development with an opportunity to refresh themselves and spend time with their parents, spouse, and other people around them who always support them. Employment of People with Disabilities As of FY , Daiwa Securities Group had more than 200 employees with disabilities handling a wide range of responsibilities in our head o ce, sales branches and contact centers. We started recruiting new graduates with disabilities as regular employees (general o ce sta ) in FY , and in FY broadened the scheme to career-track employees, regional career-track employees, and customer service employees. Once people with disabilities are hired, we provide support for their career advancement by, for example, creating opportunities for them to enter the career-track and regional career-track employment opportunities. To further strengthen our support to employees, we also introduced the Daiwa LEAP Plan in 2018. This provides comprehensive support including a leave program for outpatient treatment, subsidies for expenses incurred to start work, and the introduction of support tools according to the type of disability. The Plan is a measure for bringing out employees’ talents while taking their respective circumstances into consideration, and developing a pleasant working environment. We have vigorously increased recruitment opportunities by holding brie ngs about the company for new graduates, participating in career expos, and implementing job placement support programs for university students with disabilities. Moreover, Daiwa Securities Group participates in the Accessibility Consortium of Enterprises (ACE), a general incorporated association, as a member. ACE was founded for the purpose of establishing a model for people with disabilities that contributes to corporate growth, and communicating information to society concerning human resources sought by businesses. As of October 2020, ACE has 37 corporate members, mostly large companies. Through the holding of seminars and workshops for human resources personnel and employees with disabilities, as well as issuance of educational brochures, ACE carries out awareness-raising activities for parties concerned, creates role models, and makes proposals to management and society. Our Group's Daiwa LEAP Plan initiative received a Special Award in the Environment Creation Category of the 2020 ACE Awards. Employment Rate for Persons with Disabilities FY FY FY 2.10％ 2.33％ 2.57％ Promoting Increased Understanding toward the LGBT Community and Related Issues As an opportunity to deepen understanding of LGBT issues, LGBT themes are taken up in training for new and young employees, as well as in training for those who have been promoted. A cumulative total of approximately 5,000 have participated in this training to date. In addition, every year we hold a Human Rights Awareness Workshop for all employees in each department and o ce, which includes video training and discussion to promote understanding of LGBT issues. In addition, the Group’s Compliance and Human Resources departments receive training from the NPO Nijiiro Diversity to deepen their understanding of the fundamentals and case studies of other companies in order to create a comfortable work environment. Our Human Resources Department supports employees who are undergoing gender transition by allowing them to take time o . E orts are also made to promote increased understanding among surrounding employees. 87 SDGs report 2020 Human Resource Development and Skill Enhancement Employee Training Approaches and Trends The source of Daiwa Securities Group’s competitiveness lies in the capabilities of its employees. The Group focuses on the development of human resources who can provide high value-added solutions through the use of our “Quality No. 1” integrity and specialized skills. In particular, we o er extensive training programs to newly hired employees, as we believe that this is a critical period for their training. Seeking to achieve the “Quality No. 1” in the industry, we adopt a system that allows employees to re ne their knowledge, techniques, and mindsets through a variety of programs in the curriculum. It enables us to nurture human resources with professional skills at an early stage. We believe that our employees must have a rm understanding of corporate ethics and compliance to ensure the development of sound nancial and capital markets. Accordingly, we provide all employees with regular training on information security and compliance. We also believe that not only having a strong commitment to compliance but also maintaining a high sense of morality and making decisions in light of general social norms is important for living up to the trust of customers and society. Based on this belief, we hold monthly discussions, using a case study approach, for young employees within the rst ve years of employment, with the participation of senior employees. Education and Training System Daiwa Securities Group seeks to be a group of true professionals who love their jobs and keep aiming high. Our employees not only acquire skills necessary for their current work assignments but also make consistent e orts toward achieving their career visions. We have adopted an educational system comprising mandatory programs clearly positioned as duties that must be worked on, and a variety of optional programs that can be chosen according to the needs of each employee for their career advancement. In this way, we support the autonomous career formation of each employee. We also aim to foster a sense of solidarity among Group employees across divisions while o ering training opportunities at group meetings. Daiwa Securities Group’s Education System 88 SDGs report 2020 Training Records in FY Number of times skill training 29 training courses held 57 times was held in FY : Number of participants 4,126 people Cumulative number of 17,853 people participants (FY -FY ) Cost for the Group’s educational ¥2.2 billion investment: Cost per employee ¥160,000 Training for Young Employees Daiwa Securities Group views the rst two years of an employee's career as a period for their basic training for becoming a professional. Accordingly, we implement the Daiwa Basic Program that covers this period of training. The program sets the items and levels that should be acquired, and organically combines group training, OJT, e-learning, and support for the acquisition of quali cations. Moreover, since FY , we have been providing an educational program called “QRoad” for employees in their third to fth year of employment. This program helps to improve their knowledge, techniques, and mindsets to achieve “Quality No. ” in the industry. It presents high-level goals to further promote employees’ growth. Skill Training We provide twice-a-year skills training aimed at enhancing the skills and techniques that employees themselves want to improve as an opportunity for them to acquire various skills and special knowledge. We enhanced our e-learning program from FY , while introducing two-way online training this scal year. We have thus developed a training system that can better satisfy employees’ motivation for self-development. For example, in the inheritance and business succession master course, which is provided by a practicing tax accountant, employees learn basic knowledge of laws and systems and then generate output through case studies to acquire practical skills. The course helps the participants to acquire skills and special knowledge for conducting a high-quality solutions business, as many of them state that it was useful for understanding customers’ issues and needs and providing solutions to address them. In addition, a wide range of training programs on coaching, PC skills and other topics have been made available so that employees can choose programs according to the career they aim for, regardless of their a liated department and duties. Training for Veteran Employees We have been providing the Advanced Skill-building Program, a training program for employees aged 45 and older that is designed to continuously improve skills. We have also introduced a license certi cation system that provides incentives to employees who continue to work to improve their skills. Since its introduction, approximately 1,800 employees, accounting for more than 60% of personnel aged 45 and older, have undertaken over 20,000 training programs. 89 SDGs report 2020 Supporting Employees Trying to Earn Credentials Daiwa Securities sees Financial Planner (AFP and CFP®) and Securities Analyst quali cations as core requirements, and encourages employees to acquire these certi cations. As a result, the number of employees with CFP® certi cations has exceeded 1,000 for the rst time for a company/organization in Japan, making it the highest level in the industry. CFP® is a high-level credential certifying knowledge and skills in the tax system, inheritance, and real estate elds needed for providing nancial planning services. Moreover, as a result of the introduction of the Daiwa Basic Program, an educational training program covering the rst two years of employment, nearly all employees in their second year of employment acquire AFP, while 70% have passed the Certi ed Member Analyst of the Securities Analysts Association of Japan (CMA) examination (Level 1). We have also introduced an Inheritance Planner Certi cation® as an in-house quali cation system. The certi cation is granted to employees who have completed practical training, based on extensive knowledge obtained through the acquisition of CFP® certi cation, and can be used for business worksites. In addition, the company provides generous support by, for example, subsidizing certi cation costs so that employees can enhance their specialized skills and become professionals. Number of Persons Earning Major Credentials (as of March 31, 2020) Number of persons earning CFP® 1,020 people certi cations: Number of Certi ed Member Analyst of the 1,470 people Securities Analysts Association of Japan (CMA)®: Intra-Group Job Postings and the Career Track Change System We have instituted a Career Track Change System that enables non-career-track employees to transfer to career-track and regional career-track positions. Under the system, more than 1,300 employees have moved to other positions. We have also instituted a system of intragroup job postings to help employees with skills and the desire to realize their potential to open new career paths. Evaluation System To ensure that all employees can continue working with a high level of motivation, it is important to have a fair and convincing evaluation system. For this reason, Daiwa Securities Group has implemented a multifaceted evaluation system for managers whereby subordinates conduct evaluation. This involves subordinates assessing each manager’s job performance in carrying out daily duties and the results being fed back to the manager. The scheme aims to help managers to identify their challenges and improve their managerial skills through training programs and other means, thereby improving our overall productivity. The multifaceted evaluation system covers all managers, including executives, the heads of departments, o ces, and sales branches, and section chiefs. We also evaluate employees comprehensively by taking their compliance-related performance into account. In addition, we endeavor to create a personnel evaluation system that motivates all employees, regardless of years they are with us, whether they are young, middle of career, or experienced veterans, to take on the challenges of the next stage of their careers and to work in positions with greater responsibilities. Even while on childcare leave, employees are still eligible for promotions as we properly evaluate their contributions to date. 90 SDGs report 2020 Work-Life Balance Support for women's advancement and work-life balance Daiwa Securities Group is working to create an environment in which all employees, men and women, from young to experienced, can continue to work with a high level of motivation. One of the Group's Corporate Principles is placing importance on personnel and the corresponding text is The source of the Group's competitiveness lies in the capabilities of its employees. The Group will promote the creativity of employees by o ering them a challenging and self-directed working environment that encourages their abilities and appropriately rewards their contributions. We believe that maximizing the motivation of each and every employee will lead to higher customer satisfaction and ultimately higher shareholder value. We are implementing various measures with the aim of becoming a Group in which employees feel that their work is rewarding, and feel even more proud to be a member of the Group, extending to their families and related parties. In 2020, we formulated the No. 1 in Job Satisfaction Plan 2020. We are working to establish an environment that enables all employees to work e ciently in the limited time available and to demonstrate their full potential. * WLB: Abbreviation for work-life balance. Daiwa Securities Group's approach to supporting women's advancement One of the Daiwa Securities Group's Corporate Principles is Placing importance on personnel, and its management strategy states, The Daiwa Securities Group is working to create an environment in which all employees, men and women, from young to experienced, can continue to work with a high level of motivation. Regarding support for women's advancement, in order to produce female leaders who will drive the Japanese nancial world, we will actively promote female employees and create an environment where they can continue to work actively even after life events such as marriage and childbirth. We will support the e orts of companies by publicizing the status of support for women's advancement in the Group. 91 SDGs report 2020 In 2009, four female directors were appointed concurrently. To incorporate more diverse perspectives into our Group management, we have appointed three female directors at Daiwa Securities Group Inc. and nine female directors, o cers, and executive o cers throughout the Group. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. has endorsed the 30% Club Japan activity launched in Japan in May 2019, in which Chairman of the Board and the President/CEO participate as members. 30% Club Japan aims to increase the percentage of women on the board of directors of TOPIX 100 to 30% by 2030, and aims to increase the percentage of women in the top ranks of Japanese companies. There are about 20% of branch managers and two overseas base managers (as of June 2020), demonstrating increasing advancement of women. As the number of role models increases, it becomes easier for women to plan their careers, and in recent years, the number of female employees who are aiming to improve their careers through a shift to career-track and regional career-track positions has signi cantly increased. Furthermore, we support various systems and measures that exceed legal requirements so that employees can continue to work actively even after undergoing life events such as marriage and childbirth. We are striving to create the ideal work environment where each employee feels that their work is rewarding and a source of joy, and can challenge themselves to maximize their potential. Going forward, we will continue to improve the work environment for all employees, both men and women, young and experienced, so that they can fully demonstrate their abilities and feel even more rewarded by their work.

Furthermore, the Group conducts training on its work-life balance support system for balancing work with child care and nursing care responsibilities based on the idea that it is important to deepen mutual understanding not only for employees who use the system, but also for the employees who work alongside them. In addition, once a year, we conduct a survey for all employees about work-life balance and balancing work with child care and nursing 93 SDGs report 2020 care responsibilities. We survey the recognition, degree of use, and issues of our systems, while soliciting opinions and requests from employees, to promote further understanding and enhance penetration of the systems. Based on employee feedback, we also review the design and operation of these systems. Various measures Supporting career advancement among female employees To help female employees move closer to their ideal future image while going through various life events, the Group implements a career support training initiative for female employees named Daiwa Woman’s Forum. The initiative provides an opportunity to make it easier for female employees to picture their future work style and career image. Every year, 100 to 200 female employees who are one step before a managerial position participate across divisions and departments. In addition to career plan training and skill training, the curriculum incorporates interaction with role models such as female directors and female managers. The program thus contributes to building networks among women. In addition, based on the experience to date, the Group holds a training event for female managers, Daiwa Woman's Management Forum, to further improve the future image that each person envisions. Against the backdrop of extended working lives amid the shift toward people living to 100 years old, in FY , we expanded the range of career choices to include “regional career-track” (positions that do not involve relocations). We have also established a new “broad regional career-track” system that allows employees to be relocated within a certain area, seeking to enable sta to continue to play active roles and remain strongly motivated. Various skill training For the purpose of fostering true professionals, the Group provides various skill training sessions that are opportunities for employees to acquire various skills and specialized knowledge. We are making e orts with the goal of setting the ratio of female participants to 50% by FY (46% in FY ). Job shift system With regard to job shifts, up to now more than 1,400 people have shifted to career-track or broad area career-track that can be relocated within a certain period of time or area career-track that does not involve relocation, and the number of female employees active in a wide range of jobs has increased signi cantly.

Sta from various positions and departments, from executives and managers to young employees, participate as advisors to discuss and verify the status of various measures, including e orts to achieve goals for the promotion of women's activities, support for balancing work with childcare and nursing care, leaving work before 19:00, planned annual leave taking, and male employees taking childcare leave. Women's Advancement Promotion Team Regular Meetings Meetings of the Women's Advancement Promotion Team are held regularly. The meetings provide an opportunity for interaction as female employees and executives such as female directors and female department managers exchange opinions about careers. Round-table discussions Round-table discussions are held among female employees, and group discussions are conducted covering concerns and issues regarding their continuing work. The participants present the contents of the discussions to management and express their opinions and ideas. System Usage Calendar The Group introduced a System Usage Calendar that allows all employees in the department to share their plans for using annual leave, continuous leave, and the systems for balancing work with child care (short working hours system, etc.). It is extremely e ective in promoting annual leave for all employees, and has become a system that allows each workplace to use the leave systems smoothly. Distribution of Career Design Books To support the career design of each and every employee, the Group posts “Career Design Books” on the internal portal site, making them available to all employees. These books compile information on a variety of career paths and positions, various personnel systems and education/training programs, and welfare and other systems. Return to work guideline The Group has established guidelines for department managers so that employees can take child care leave and return to work smoothly. These guidelines encourage appropriate consideration to make it easy for employees to use the system according to their physical condition and individual circumstances. They also promote understanding among other employees, and describe how to distribute work according to the situation and how to provide training as a role model. They go on to describe how to give fair and impartial evaluations and feedback to employees with various circumstances, such as those who will use the system and those who have returned to work. Through training and other measures managers can remain informed and educated. In addition, the Group has distributed a list of the various work-life balance systems to managers as Work-life balance systems for balancing work and child care/nursing care that managers need to know about. 95 SDGs report 2020 Education for managers Top management continually communicates about the Group's work-life balance e orts including women's advancement and their purpose at meetings where all executives and all department managers gather, and the Group is promoting training for managers including all line section managers. By deepening their understanding of the initiatives for promoting the careers of women, their purpose, and the work-life balance support systems, managers themselves are working to create an environment in which all employees can continue to work actively. Furthermore, for the purpose of improving management ability and the productivity of the entire Group, subordinate employees and related departments evaluate the work and behavior of managers in their daily work, and the results are fed back to the individual. In this way, a -degree evaluation is conducted for all management including executives, department managers, and section managers. As part of these evaluations, the status of diversity e orts is also evaluated, and the results are incorporated into the manager's evaluation. Self-reporting system The Group has implemented a self-reporting system as an opportunity for managers to think about their future goals and career development. Managers share their hopes and goals with their superiors and interviews are held to support their career advancement as managers. Career Consulting Salon The Group set up a Career Consulting Salon on the work-life balance promotion site (inside the Daiwa WLB station) for employees only, and female executives and female department managers act as career advisors to discuss career paths and work-life balance with junior employees across divisions and departments. Expanded support for balancing work and nursing care The Group is helping employees balance their work and nursing care in various ways. To further improve the environment in which employees with abundant experience and a high degree of specialization can continue to work actively without feeling anxious about future nursing care, the Group established a nursing care leave system that exceeds the legal requirements (up to 1095 days, can be acquired in four periods) and introduced a work-from-home system for all departments including sales departments. Further, following consultations with employees who are providing nursing care and their families, the Group introduced a Nursing Care Concierge Service that can provide various solutions. Moreover, in conjunction with Nursing Care Day on November th, the Group held study sessions at all branches entitled Responding to an Aging Society and Balancing Work and Family Care, to raise employee awareness and foster a corporate culture that makes it easy to use the systems. Trend in Number of women in managerial positions Since the establishment of the Women's Advancement Promotion Team in 2005, the Group has continued to make various e orts with the aim of supporting women's advancement and realizing work-life balance for employees, while establishing various support systems for work-life balance that exceed legal requirements. As a result of our e orts so far, the number of female managers has vefold compared to before the introduction of the measures. The Group operates a fair treatment and evaluation system that encourages all employees, from young people, mid-level employees, and experienced employees, regardless of their years of employment, to work hard at a higher stage and in a position of greater responsibility. Also, based on the belief that promoting appointments based on fair evaluations and creating an environment in which diverse human resources can maximize their abilities will lead to an increase in corporate value, even during child care leave, 96 SDGs report 2020 employees are evaluated correctly based on their achievements up to that point and are eligible for promotion. The Group has created an environment in which employees can aim for career advancement even as they experience life events. As a result of various e orts, the number of role models has increased, and the number of female employees in positions just below management positions has doubled since 2005. Furthermore, the Group is appointing future candidates for executives regardless of gender at an early stage, and is working to develop candidates for management executive positions through selective management training.

Since the number of obese people tends to increase with age, it is necessary to raise awareness of health from a young age. Especially for young people, there is a problem with lifestyle habits, such as an increase in the percentage of both men and women who do not eat breakfast. In addition to measures against obesity, it is necessary to take measures that will lead to awareness about establishing a healthy lifestyle from the start of employment. In addition, the number of both men and women with blood pressure for which medical examination is recommended is increasing. Furthermore, a high percentage of employees with this level of blood pressure remain at the same level the next year and the year after. Therefore, it is necessary to take prompt measures to support employees who are at or above the blood pressure level for which medical examination is recommended. Goals for improvement initiative Focus on obesity control and hypertension control, continue to provide thorough counseling guidance to each risk group, and encourage them to participate in the KA-RA-DA iki-iki Project to make them aware of their lifestyle habits. In order to ensure that young people have awareness of health from an early stage, implement new health events using ICT to increase the participation rate. Provide counseling guidance to employees who are obese and enhance opportunities to obtain knowledge and information on health. Goals Reduce obesity rate at age 35 by 30% by 2024 [Target] Obesity rate for -year-olds in FY Male: 20%, Female: 8% 112 SDGs report 2020 Communication with Employees We believe that good communication with employees is vital for a better workplace environment. We have thus implemented a semiannual self-assessment system whereby employees can communicate their career plans to their superiors and the Human Resources Department. Under the system, employees can also communicate to the Human Resources Department not only their career visions but also their thoughts on the duties they assume, personnel and training systems, the workplace environment, and other matters. Daiwa Securities Group uses such feedback to develop an environment that enables employees to work with a high level of motivation. To give feedback on assessment results, we conduct interviews with department and sales branch heads twice a year, thereby sharing future goals and career development with them and providing appropriate guidance and advice to each employee. We also regularly conduct surveys on work-life balance for all employees. We incorporate employees’ feedback, and have introduced the Nursing Care Concierge Service to remove employees’ concerns about nursing care. We have also introduced a support desk for employees looking for nursery schools to ensure that those on leave can have a smooth return to work, while expanding a program for subsidizing expenses for day care and after-school child care for employees with children up to the third grade in elementary school. Moreover, we conduct interviews with employees returning from childcare leave after a certain time has passed in an e ort to resolve any worries they may have. These inputs from employees help us to identify areas for improvement in our systems and initiatives and to create a better workplace environment. Work Motivation Survey In August 2018, we introduced a Work Motivation Survey as a monitoring indicator. It is designed to raise employees’ motivation to work through challenges for higher value-added operations and contribute to customers and society, thereby achieving a virtuous cycle of improved employee and customer satisfaction. Based on assessed results, we identify factors leading to increases in employees’ motivation and use such factors for various measures. Communication among Employees In October 2007, Daiwa Securities introduced a program for supporting club activities. This program was created to help employees enjoy their time o and deepen their friendships with colleagues, building more opportunities for sharing a sense of camaraderie and solidarity. It is also intended to support work-life balance and facilitate a fuller social life for employees. The program was expanded and enhanced in FY . Under this program, employee groups that meet certain conditions are recognized as Daiwa Clubs or Daiwa Circles, which receive subsidies to cover some of their activity costs. As of March 2020, 20 clubs and ve circles were active across the Group. 113 SDGs report 2020 Relationship with Employee Unions Under various labor agreements signed with employee unions, we regularly hold labor-management negotiations on bonuses and other compensation and the working environment, thereby building a sound labor-management relationship. We also increase opportunities for learning the opinions of our employees and improve communication through surveys conducted by employee unions, direct dialogue between management and union members, and other activities. Initiatives for Families We work to ensure that members of employees’ families share their pride in being part of the Group. Since FY , we welcome employees’ families to the workplace on Family Visit Day to give family members a better understanding of our company and the employees’ jobs. Other initiatives for supporting our employees’ families include the new creation of Kid’s Ceremony Leave, Family Day Leave, and Parents’ Longevity Celebration Leave, as well as the extension of mental health support to employees’ families. Active Use of In-House Magazine Daiwa Securities Group issues an in-house magazine, Fuji, whose history dates back to 1925, when one of the company's predecessors, Fujimoto Bill Broker Bank, commenced its publication. The content covers a broad scope from the basic management policy, a message from top management, speci c SDGs initiatives (includes ESG and improvement of environmental awareness), information from Group companies, introduction of awardees through our awards system, introduction of family day, explanation of our welfare and human resources system, human rights issues, to our internal whistle-blowing system (framework and status of usage). By including information that traverses the Group, our intention in producing the magazine is not only to engender communication among company employees but also to further the Group culture, the sense of connectedness and exchange of knowledge. At present, 20,000 copies of the bi-monthly magazine are distributed among Group executives, employees and retirees. In addition, the magazine is also posted on the work-life balance promotion website for employees, making it viewable to company employees who are currently involved in child rearing, nursing family members or are on leave from work. 114 SDGs report 2020 Activities to support Communities through Our Foundations Daiwa Securities Group proactively works on social contribution activities through public interest incorporated foundations and funds to realize a prosperous society.

Outline of the Project As part of its Smiles to Children Project, Daiwa Securities Group has created Daiwa Securities Group Child Support Fund for Bright Future in collaboration with the Public Resources Foundation, a public interest incorporated foundation. And we have donated gifts to children through the Santa Charity Program , a fund-raising activity by executives and employees and volunteers of OBs and OGs to help children to create fun memories of Christmas. Why do we support the future of children The nancial and capital markets are a symbol of capitalism, and its bene t securities companies have been receiving. Meanwhile, capitalism can generate a disparity, becoming a cause for child poverty, which is a distortion of society. For this reason, we recognize the need to contribute to solving the poverty issue by using sound pro ts that we have gained from our core businesses. Progressively declining birthrates and an aging population resulting in a decreased number of children shouldering Japan’s future will signi cantly a ect the sustainable growth of the country. Child poverty generates many side e ects, such as inadequate education, possibly leading to a situation where the children shouldering the future of Japan cannot acquire enough qualities as members of society. Eradicating child poverty is an extremely challenging goal that cannot be achieved overnight. However, we must now work to improve the environment surrounding children and break the chains of poverty. View details 119 SDGs report 2020 Daiwa Securities Group Future Support Bonds Child Support Group Sustainable Fund Daiwa Securities Group decided to donate \102.5 million of the total amount raised through the issuance of bonds (nicknamed “Daiwa Securities Group Future Support Bonds”) in June 2020 to the “Daiwa Securities Group Future Support Bonds Child Support Group Sustainable Fund,” which is to be established in collaboration with the Public Resources Foundation. Daiwa Securities Group Child Support Fund for Bright Future Daiwa Securities Group has created “Daiwa Securities Group Child Support Fund for a Bright Future” in collaboration with Public Resources Foundation, a public interest incorporated foundation. The Fund is designed to improve the environment for children and break the chains of poverty. It assists groups supporting children’s future. Daiwa Securities Group intends to contribute a total of around ¥100 million in the initial ve years and will select grant recipients after soliciting applicants. Total amount of grants Total amount of grants Total amount of grants for FY (the rst for FY (the second for FY (the third call) call) call) Santa Charity Program Since 2017, we have been implementing a Santa Charity Program—an initiative in which executives, employees, and former members of Daiwa Securities Group donate Christmas presents to children. Contributions collected under the Program are used to purchase assorted snacks and toys and donated to children’s homes, livelihood support facilities for fatherless families, and NPOs supporting children across Japan. The donations are made through the Public Resources Foundation , a public interest incorporated foundation. 120 SDGs report 2020 Why Daiwa Securities Group is Working to Support Children The nancial and capital markets are a symbol of capitalism, and securities companies have bene ted from them. On the other hand, capitalism can cause disparities and contribute to the poverty of children, which is also a strain on society. That is why we believe that we should use the sound pro ts we earn from our core business to help solve the problem of poverty. The declining birthrate and aging population are advancing in Japan, and the reduced number of children who will carry the future of the country will also have a major impact on Japan's sustainable growth. The problem of child poverty has many side e ects, such as the inability to receive necessary education, and it also leads to the situation in which the children who will carry the future of Japan cannot gain the quali cations they will require as adults. Eliminating child poverty is an extremely high goal that cannot be achieved overnight. However, it is now necessary to improve the environment surrounding children and stop the chain of poverty. Message Our desire to support children In the past, I have personally donated items such as toys to children's homes. That was because there was a facility next to the kindergarten where my daughter used to go. I am deeply concerned by the growing problem of child poverty in recent years. The future of children is connected to the future of Japan, so if the problem of child poverty is left unresolved, it will have a great adverse e ect on the economy. As bene ciaries of the market economy, securities companies should face up to this problem. In the rst open call for participants to the Daiwa Securities Group Child Support Fund for Bright Futures , more than 100 organizations from all over Japan applied. Going forward, we would like to continue to support organizations that are engaged in activities in their respective regions that help solve the problem of child poverty. In addition to the company's support activities, we started the Santa Charity Program last year, in which Group o cers and employees and ex-employees can participate voluntarily, and we received more donations than expected. It is important that these e orts have the support of each and every person involved and are continuously carried out. In the future, I hope that they will become part of voluntary e orts to tackle various social issues. 121 SDGs report 2020 Action with NPOs The Daiwa Securities Group plans various programs such as disaster relief programs and programs to donate part of the trust fees of investment trusts.

We consider that this, in turn, has a good in uence on both their work and their lives. Through our intranet, we provide information on volunteer opportunities for projects planned by ourselves, other businesses and NPOs/ NGOs as well as events that help educate employees and raise their awareness. We also strive to create an environment that makes it easy for employees to volunteer by setting up a recognition program, the Volunteer Award, and other incentives. In FY , we also introduced Volunteer Leave. In the rst scal year, a total of 11 employees used this system and participated in volunteer activities (for 11 days). Initiatives to Promote Volunteer Activities President's Awards program Daiwa Securities has the President's Awards program to recognize outstanding achievements by employees. As part of the program, we introduced the Volunteer Award in FY , which is given twice a year to employees and groups involved in volunteer initiatives and activities that provide ongoing support to communities.

This is an initiative aimed at correcting food imbalances between developing and developed countries by donating a portion of revenue from the purchase of food and drink by Group o cers and employees to pay for school lunches in developing countries. We introduced the TFT menu at the cafeteria in the head o ce building and the sta cafeteria in Daiwa Institute of Research and Daiwa Facilities Co., Ltd. started donating ¥1 per drink sold through the beverage vending machines installed within the Group. Moreover, points earned through the “KA-RA-DA iki-iki Project,” which is aimed at strengthening employees’ health, can now be redeemed for contributions to the TFT Program. We have thus expanded the platforms for participating in the TFT activities. The contributions made through the TFT Program during the period of January to December 2019 were equivalent to around 151,688 school lunches in developing countries (calculated on the assumption that one meal costs ¥20).

Environmentally Friendly O ce DCME’s Facilities Department always keeps in mind reducing carbon dioxide emissions in the o ce and environmental impact in light of SDG Goal 12 “Responsible Consumption and Production” and Goal 13 “Climate Action.” When formulating an environmental plan for 2019, it focused on the energy consumption, waste, and sustainability of DCME and its supply chain as a whole. In 2019, DCME replaced the boiler of its heating system to improve the system’s energy e ciency while replacing all lights in its building with LED lighting. These measures, along with improvements to the building management system, have enabled the company to reduce its electricity consumption by 42% and gas consumption by 30% since 2014. DCME has also changed its power company so that a large part of the power supplied to its o ce would be from clean and renewable sources.

Activities at the Group's South Korea Operational Base Participation in “Love Kimchi Fair” Following on from 2018, Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Korea (“Daiwa Korea”) participated as a social contribution activity in the “Ninth Love Kimchi Fair” on November 20, 2019. The event was organized jointly by securities industryrelated bodies, including the Korea Financial Investment Association and the Korea Exchange. Kimchi is essential to Koreans’ diet as it is said that no other side dishes are needed if kimchi is there. In the country, people follow gimjang, a traditional practice of making a large quantity of kimchi in advance around the end of November each year to prepare for a long, cold winter. The 36,000 kg of kimchi made on the day of the “Ninth Love Kimchi Fair” was sent to welfare facilities supported by the Green Umbrella Children’s Foundation, an NGO, and the Korea Financial Investment Association to help the socially disadvantaged. In addition to this, Daiwa Korea makes a donation every month to Korea Food for the Hungry International, an NGO providing support to starving children within and outside South Korea, to further contribute to society. In South Korea, the central government has recently been strongly promoting e orts to achieve work-life balance, and local companies have been actively implementing measures in line with the government’s policy. Amid such trends, Daiwa Korea is working on the following: (1) encouraging proactive participation in social service activities (introducing social contribution activity programs and providing compensatory leave to employees who participate in weekend activities); (2) creating comfortable work environments for women (improvement of welfare programs at each stage of pregnancy, childbirth, and child rearing, allowing adjustment of working hours and providing time to visit doctors for pregnant employees, setting up a nursing room and providing time for nursing at the discretion of the department head); and (3) 133 SDGs report 2020 encouraging employees to leave the o ce on time and take their annual paid leave (employees are required to submit their annual paid leave plan through to the end of period to management) to achieve work-life balance, and enhancing the welfare bene t system (supporting employees' self-development expenses, such as for studying languages, and expenses for promoting and maintaining health).

In addition to these daily programs, we distribute corporate information as well as video reports where analysts and economists at Daiwa Securities and DIR provide commentaries on current issues in an easy-to-understand way. Our Daiwa Internet TV initiative was introduced by the SDG Industry Matrix for Financial Services (issued jointly by the United Nations Global Compact and KPMG International in 2015) as a case for Goal 4 Quality Education. The report highlighted Daiwa's timely and free of charge provision of a variety of nancial and investment information. We will continue to make e orts to produce programs that can be viewed by not only investors but also those who are new to investment, and that can support the journey from savings to asset building. Daiwa Internet TV 139 SDGs report 2020 Support for KidZania Daiwa Securities Group is a supporter of KidZania, a theme park designed to o er work experiences to children, and has been providing support to the facilities in Tokyo and Koshien (Hyogo Prefecture) since they opened. KidZania provides children from the age of three to 15 with programs that enable them to learn the mechanisms of society in a fun way. In the Daiwa Securities pavilions, children act as consultants at a securities company, giving advice to clients, going to nearby pavilions, and checking their levels of tra c and popular products. Based on the results of those checks, they then make KidZania investment recommendations for their clients. Finance Park Daiwa Securities Group cooperates with Finance Parks operated by Junior Achievement Japan, a public interest incorporated foundation. This program provides opportunities for junior high school students to learn economic and nancial mechanisms that will be necessary for them in their adult life. Finance Parks have been operating in Shinagawa (Tokyo), Kyoto, Iwaki (Fukushima Prefecture), and Sendai (Miyagi Prefecture). We have set up pseudo-branches of Daiwa Securities in these parks. (on an application basis; surveyed by Junior Achievement Japan) Number of participants in Finance Parks for FY 21,102 people Breakdown Shinagawa: 1,854 Kyoto: 7,804 Iwaki: 3,183 Sendai: 8,261 Student Company Program (Company Management Experience Program) Daiwa Securities Group cooperates with the Student Company Program provided by Junior Achievement Japan.

Through our business activities, Daiwa Securities Group contributes to the resolution of environmental issues by developing products that reduce the environmental burden, and also by assisting nancing for the development of environmental technologies and infrastructure. At the same time, we are working to establish a system that e ciently collects data on the Group's environmental load. We are also focusing on raising employees' environmental awareness to empower them to reduce the environmental burden in daily business operations. In our FY management strategy brie ng, we listed the volume of CO2 emissions as one of our FY KPIs for promoting achievement of SDGs. Thus, working on reducing the environmental burden of society as a whole has become part of our management strategy. Environmental Vision The Group is dedicated to protecting the precious global environment and preserving it for future generations by leveraging nancial capabilities. Environmental Principles The Group recognizes the importance of environmental principles such as the e ort to combat global warming, recycling and reuse of raw materials, and preserving biodiversity, in order to create a sustainable society for the st century. The Group pledges to contribute to solving environmental issues through its business as a nancial services company and, to constantly seek new ways to reduce its environmental impact as a responsible corporate citizen. Basic Environmental Policies 1. Make positive environmental contributions through our core business activities We shall seek to develop and provide nancial products and services that promote a low-carbon, recycling-oriented, and symbiotic society. 2. Implement an environmental management system We shall implement an environmental management system and constantly seek new ways to improve environmental activities. In addition, we shall support environmental education and publicity e orts, while promoting environmental protection e orts by employees. 3. Take steps to save natural resources, reduce energy consumption, and promote biodiversity system We shall continue to progress in our e orts to reduce the use of natural resources and energy, and seek ways to improve materials and energy e ciency (including e orts to improve business e ciency). We shall also take steps to reduce water use and reduce, reuse, and recycle other materials to contribute to a more environmentally friendly society. Furthermore, considering the importance of biodiversity, we shall seek a symbiotic relationship with the environment and use safe, clean methods of materials procurement. 4. Promote environmental communication Working in concert with business partners, the local community, NGOs and NPOs, we shall actively disseminate information about environmental issues, and communicate our concern for the environment to customers and society at large. 5. Strictly observe environmental regulations We shall always endeavor in environmental preservation, observing environmental laws and regulations in addition to the Group's environmental policies. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (May 22, 2012) 142 SDGs report 2020 Targets for FY Reduce CO2 emissions by at least 20% from the FY level Targets for FY Initiatives for the reduction of CO2 emissions Continue to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 1% compared with the previous scal year. * On a Domestic consolidated basis Initiatives for the reduction of electricity consumption Achieve a reduction of at least 10% from the FY level (as of FY ) Achieve a reduction of at least 20% from the FY level (as of FY ) * On a per unit area basis for both targets Improve the accumulation of environment-related data hone analytical skills Continue to introduce eco-cars Purchase products certi ed under the Japan's Top Runner Program standards Initiatives to Reduce the Environmental Impact of Business Activities Introduction of Environmental Accounting As part of our e orts to reduce environmental loads, Daiwa Securities Group prepares and discloses environmental accounting. It is expected to help us to track the costs and e ects of environmental preservation more accurately and reduce environmental loads more e ectively. Refer to SDGs Related Data for details Initiatives at Group Companies When installing new equipment at head and branch o ces, Daiwa Securities requires that the equipment be certi ed under Japan’s Top Runner Program standards. In FY , we investigated the impact of postponing the replacement of multifunction copiers and other equipment at the head o ce as well as the elimination of paper associated with the introduction of tablet devices. As a result, we have decided to replace equipment within the head o ce in FY with products satisfying Top Runner Program standards, while planning to reduce environmental loads through reduction of surplus equipment. We are aiming for a 10% reduction in multifunction copiers. We have also been successively replacing our company cars since FY with eco-cars and hybrid vehicles that have signi cantly improved fuel e ciency. With the completion of the planned replacement, CO emissions will be reduced by an amount equivalent to the CO absorption of more than 40,000 Japanese cedar trees annually (an estimate by Daiwa Securities using fuel e ciency data disclosed by automakers). The introduction of LED lighting into the head o ce of Daiwa Institute of Research was completed in the summer of 2017. In addition, Daiwa Securities Group strives to choose environmentally friendly products in its central purchasing. 143 SDGs report 2020 Company cars in Japan (Daiwa Securities) 1,065 vehicles including 837 eco-cars 157 hybrid cars (As of March 31, 2020) Introduction results for FY 409 eco-cars 11 hybrid cars Introduction plan for FY 76 eco-cars 28 hybrid cars Cases of soil and groundwater pollution found within o ce sites FY 0 Investment in energy-saving air conditioning systems for FY ¥47 million (including installation costs) Initiatives to Raise Environmental Awareness Daiwa Securities Group is striving to raise the environmental awareness of each employee through various initiatives. For example, our in-house magazine, Fuji, has a column entitled Eco-Initiatives in the O ce. The column mainly shares the status of the Group's environmental initiatives and introduces environmental measures that can be implemented by employees, depending on their individual awareness. We also participated in a campaign led by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government's Bureau of Environment to promote e orts to reduce plastic shopping bags at convenience stores within o ces. The initiative is still being implemented even after the end of the campaign. When printing documents, we recommend using aggregate printing and double-sided printing. We also encourage the reduction of paper usage by showing operational guidance and the rate of reduction in paper usage for every three months in the areas within o ces where multifunction copiers are installed. We reduced paper consumption by 6.4% year on year in FY , within the same scope as FY . 144 SDGs report 2020 O ering Environmentally Friendly Services Daiwa Securities provides an “e-Member” online service allowing customers to receive various reports, including prospectuses and reports on the details of transactions and transaction balances, in electronic format on the Internet, instead of written noti cations (hardcopy reports and prospectuses). Reports and prospectuses received in electronic format can, in principle, be accessed and checked online as and when required, saved to personal computers and other devices, and printed for ve years after initial receipt. As of March 31, 2020, about half of Daiwa Securities’ customers use this “e-Member” online service. We will continue recommending the service to increase the number of customers using it. Daiwa Securities also uses LIMEX in part of its promotional items such as ballpoint pens and seminar bags. We are considering expanding its use going forward. * LIMEX is a composite material made from limestone that is expected to reduce environmental impacts. It is a registered trademark of TBM Co., Ltd. CO2 Emissions In comparison with the previous scal year, CO2 emissions in FY fell by approximately 0.7% for Daiwa Securities Group's domestic o ces, as a result of a positive initiative to conserve energy. Refer to SDGs Data Edition 2020 for details Initiative to Reduce CO2 Emissions We have set up the goal of reducing CO2 emissions, while complying with the Act on the Rational Use of Energy and Tokyo's environmental protection ordinances in a continuous and systematic way. We continue to take energy saving initiatives, including implementing the Cool Biz program again in FY , carrying out energy savings measures through onand o -peak periods. Initiatives Regarding Impacts of Climate Change In recent years, concerns have been raised about the possibility of large-scale ood damage due to the signi cant increase in sea level resulting from global warming and the occurrence of super typhoons. Some major o ces of Daiwa Securities Group are located not far from the coast and rivers and may be a ected if large-scale ood damage occurs. The Group will continue with our e orts to minimize the impact of such damage on its operations not only by making general preparations for ood damage but also by decentralizing important facilities and buildings into multiple locations and moving equipment to upper stories. We aim to minimize the physical risk of climate change on our business activities. 145 SDGs report 2020 Initiatives in Real Estate Management (Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management Co. Ltd.) Daiwa Real Estate Asset Management launched a Sustainability Committee in FY with a view to systematically addressing a variety of ESG related challenges. The company formulated the Rules on the Sustainability Promotion System in FY . These rules clarify the promotion system and policy on disclosure of information related to sustainability activities of each investment corporation. Initiatives at Shinjuku Maynds Tower At the Shinjuku Maynds Tower building, which is owned by Daiwa O ce Investment Corporation (DOI), we have continued to install LED lighting systems since 2012, replacing lights in common-use space, such as the underground parking lot, rst basement level, and entrance on the rst oor. As a result, we have already achieved our initial target of installing LED lighting in approximately 80% of common-use space. We have also adopted the green lease scheme since 2014 to promote the use of LED lighting in tenant-owned spaces. The installation has proceeded gradually under the scheme, with both tenants and landlords enjoying its bene ts. We expect LED lighting to be introduced into approximately 95.9% of the area of tenant-occupied spaces by the period ending November 2020. The property was certi ed by the Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) as a “building with exceptionally high environmental and social awareness (Four Stars)” in February 2019. CO2 emissions reduction by adopting LED lighting (in comparison with the levels prior to the introduction of LED lighting) Approximately 648.0 t-CO2 a year (Shinjuku Maynds Tower in 2019) * Green lease scheme: A method enabling the landlord and the tenant of a rental building or other type of rental property to cooperate and reduce the environmental load in a scheme bene ting both sides. Such methods include an arrangement where part of the tenant’s savings attributable to the landlord’s investment in energy-saving facilities, such as a decrease in electricity charges, is returned to the landlord as a green lease payment. * Scoring model of DBJ Green Building Certi cation: A comprehensive scoring model uniquely developed by the Development Bank of Japan Inc. (DBJ). The DBJ grants certi cation to real estate properties that are highly environmentally and socially friendly (“Green Building”), based on a ve-level ranking system. Initiatives at Daiwa River Gate At Daiwa River Gate, which is owned by DOI, we installed solar wind powered street lights in 2018, taking advantage of the property’s environment of strong winds and abundant sunlight, as it adjoins a river. The installation has enabled us to use renewable energy to increase the intensity of illumination. As a result, the intensity of illumination has increased to the extent that the steps in the stairs areas can be seen clearly, and this has also contributed to improving the environment surrounding the building from crime prevention and other perspectives. We plan to consider introduction of such facilities into other properties as well, depending on the situation, and install them successively going forward. 146 SDGs report 2020 Initiatives at Rental Residences Daiwa Securities Living Investment Corporation has been advancing initiatives for environmental conservation. For example, it is introducing LED lighting, energy-saving air conditioners, and eco-friendly wallpaper into the rental residences it owns. It also posts notices in the residences, encouraging residents to save electricity, water, and other resources. Status of FY initiatives Installation of LED lighting: 829 units Installation of energy-saving air conditioners: 639 units Replacement with eco-friendly wallpaper: approximately 100,000 m² (reductions of CO2 emissions: approximately 18,980 kg-CO2) Toward Achieving a Hydrogen Society: Entrusted with Global Trends Survey by NEDO Daiwa Institute of Research (DIR) has been commissioned to undertake survey and research work by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) toward the realization of a hydrogen society. The commissioned work encompasses the collection and analysis of information on the latest trends across the world (the United States, Canada, EU countries, China, and South Korea) concerning hydrogen fuel cells, as well as identi cation of issues for development strategies in hydrogen fuel cell technology in Japan. The survey and research work is aimed at timely collection and analyzing of a wide range of the latest information on hydrogen fuel cells, and sharing it with relevant parties in Japan, toward the realization of a hydrogen society, taking safety and the environment into consideration. The information includes policies and markets for hydrogen fuel cells and research and development trends across the world, including in the U.S., Canada, EU countries, China, and South Korea. As part of these activities, DIR visits international institutions and attends international meetings. Japan, the U.S., and Germany took the lead in the fuel cell eld, but various countries, such as China, South Korea, Australia, and the Netherlands, have recently been searching for uses of hydrogen suited to their energy situation. The work is also aimed at identifying issues for Japan’s strategy for developing hydrogen fuel cell technology going forward by accurately understanding, assessing, and analyzing developments in other countries. In this way, DIR will be proactively engaged in business related to development of new energy sources that are environmentally friendly. 147 SDGs report 2020 Response to the TCFD Expression of Support for the TCFD Taking the opportunity presented by the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, e orts that include the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are under way around the world to transition to a lower-carbon society. In the nance industry, there are concerns that climate change will a ect the business activities of investee/borrower companies, resulting in instability in the nancial market. In December 2015, the Financial Stability Board (FSB*1) established the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD*2) to consider climate-related information disclosure and nancial institutions’ responses at the request of G Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. Subsequently, in June 2017, the TCFD announced its nal report which recommends that nancial and non nancial companies disclose the nancial impacts of climate change. Under these circumstances, Daiwa Securities Group Inc. announced its support for the TCFD in April 2018 to further promote environmental initiatives, including climate change initiatives such as on climate change. In May 2019, the Company participated in the TCFD Consortium, which is a platform for dialogue among companies and nancial institutions that support the TCFD and in which the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Financial Services Agency, and the Ministry of the Environment of Japan also participate as observers. *1. FSB: Financial Stability Board *2. TCFD: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures TCFD o cial website Impact on Daiwa Securities Group in the Course of a Transition to a Lower-Carbon Economy Based on the TCFD Recommendations, Daiwa Securities Group is disclosing information on climate change initiatives for each of the four core elemnts of disclosure, as shown in the table below.,. At the present time, the Group is currently undertaking analysis based on multiple climate-related scenarios, identifying risks and opportunities related to climate change for the Group while proceeding with quantitative evaluations of the major businesses that may be a ected by climate change and expected nancial impacts. Going forward, the plan is to enhance the disclosure of the analysis results and the Group’s countermeasures based on them. In addition to working to further enhance information disclosure and to strengthen communication with stakeholders, the Company will continue to position climate-related risks and opportunities as one of its most important management issues while advancing the building of a sustainable business structure. 148 SDGs report 2020 Disclosures in Accordance with the TCFD Recommendations Governance The organization's governance around Monitor climate-related risks and Environmental climate-related risks and opportunities Initiatives opportunities (1) Formulation of Environmental Vision, Structure of SDGs a) Oversight by the Board of Directors Environmental Principles, and Basic Promotion b) Management's role Environmental Policies (2) Chaired by the president and CEO, the SDGs Promotion Committee considers various social issues, including those related to climate changes, when examining and discussing materiality and business plans ,as well as when setting KPIs.
