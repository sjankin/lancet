At its heart are the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are an urgent call for action by all countries developed and developing in a global partnership. They recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests. Source: UN Sustainable development website In alignment with its commitment to UN Global Compact principles and its ambitions for greater engagement, Nordic Semiconductor in 2019 started a program to support, identify and address the UN SDGs. Contribution to the goals is defined within three areas: products, business operations and community engagements. With support from the Company Management, engagement with key customers and subcontractors, the company is developing a Green Electricity program as a high-priority initiative for Nordic’s operations. The progress towards manufacturing products with renewable energy will be communicated in next ESG reports starting from year 2020. More details on our sustainability work within our operations are described in chapter 4 to 6.

Product compliance is a prerequisite for selling Nordic Semiconductor’s products worldwide, meeting international legislation as well as customer-­specific requirements to product design and production. At the same time, we see customers, markets and the society becoming more aware of, and concerned with, carbon footprints and energy usage. Nordic Semiconductor’s business strategy is to design and develop ultralow power products, enabling energy efficient end products for the consumer. Furthermore, the company is targeting reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically from own operations, while also engaging with our suppliers to manage and reduce our environmental impact. Nordic Semiconductor’s Environmental Policy Being a preferred partner to environmentally conscious stakeholders, Nordic Semiconductor shall incur no loss of business or profitability due to incidents or issues related to disturbance to health or environment. Nordic Semiconductor is committed to: comply to applicable legal requirements, and regulations, and protect the environment through sound management practices and decisions protect the natural environment by minimizing waste generation, pollution and GHG emissions, resourceand water consumption, and the use of hazardous materials in our products, as well as develop and use environmentally friendly technologies promote environmental responsibility and ensure that our suppliers live up to Nordic Semiconductor’s environmental standards establish and evaluate achievable environmental performance goals to ensure continuous improvement of our environmental management system regularly monitor and report on environmental performance, and to consult with relevant stakeholders on environmental issues 18 NORDIC SEMICONDUCTOR | ESG REPORT 2019 | ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVES Nordic Semiconductor has implemented guidelines and Change questionnaire (www.cdp.net), detailing how procedures into its management system to supplement climate change risk and opportunities related to climate legal requirements and integrate them in daily working change are managed, as well as GHG accounting routines.

The annual reporting to CDP takes place in Q2 each year and includes performance data on previous year. 3 CDP evaluates organizations’ engagement with their suppliers on climate change. Purchasing organizations have the potential to incentivize significant environmental changes through engagement with their suppliers.

We aim to secure a diverse environ­ment and ensure equal employment opportunities across all operations. Fair recruitment and non-discrimination are important to attract and retain qualified, competent and loyal personnel. At the same time, the organization is determined to foster an inclusive, safe and motivating working environment for existing and hired employees. It is important for Nordic Semiconductor to ensure that we are not in any way complicit to human rights or labor rights violations. Unfortunately, the electronics industry sees incidences of trafficked and/or forced (bonded) labor or child labor in its supply chain, particularly in Asia and via means of debt bondage and document seizure. Based on our risk assessment, the issues of Conflict Minerals and forced labor in the value chain have been specifically identified as relevant topics pertaining to the Human Rights andLabor principles, due to their severity. Human rights and labor rights manufacturing. Working hours and wages shall comply Nordic Semiconductor is committed to with applicable local laws or RBA Code of Conduct respect and support Human Rights and paragraphs (whichever is stricter). Workers’ rights, as reflected in our CSR policy, the support for UN Global Compact Collective bargaining and the right to organize in labor Principles and the RBA Code of Conduct. Nordic unions are protected by law in most countries where Semiconductor shall uphold and protect internationally Nordic Semiconductor operates. Company policies proclaimed human rights and workers’ rights and treat allowing employees to exercise these rights apply to workers with dignity and respect as understood by the all Nordic Semiconductor employees and locations. international community. It is our goal that no form of Collective bargaining and the right to organize is also human rights abuses or labor issues shall occur at any required from our suppliers through their required stage of our operation, including the manufacturing of commitment to RBA Code of Conduct.

Nordic Semiconductor requires all tier 1 shall be free to leave their employment with reasonable subcontractors to follow the RBA Code of Conduct, and notice. Child labor must not be used at any stage of that they should require the same from their suppliers. 23 NORDIC SEMICONDUCTOR | ESG REPORT 2019 | SOCIAL PERSPECTIVES As of today, all our direct suppliers have their own Nordic Semiconductor is distanced from the minerals’ documented corporate social responsibility policy smelters/refiners in the value chain, and has no direct including adherence to RBA Code of Conduct, with contact with smelters or providers of material. All such commitment to communicate this to next tier suppliers. contact is handled through our subcontractors’ supply Currently 5 of our main subcontractors have their own chain, and as such, Nordic Semiconductor needs to rely memberships in RBA. In addition, several of Nordic on 3rd party auditing such as RMI’s audit program. Semiconductor’s main suppliers are certified to SA 8000 or similar social responsibility certification. TSMC, which is Since 2015 Nordic Semiconductor has required suppliers the primary wafer foundry used in Nordic Semiconductor to source from conflict-free smelters only, i.e. smelters chip production, is ranked as one of the most sustainable that are verified as RMI compliant by RMI’s audit scheme. companies in Asia and has received several certifications Our target is to have 100% conflict-free smelters at all and other awards/achievements. times, and we report on due diligence at the smelter/ refinery level to customers and other stakeholder at a Supplier audits are used to review implementation of the weekly basis by use of RMI’s Conflict Minerals Reporting RBA Code of Conduct, such as tracing of information Template.

Anti-modern slavery Responisible sourcing of minerals Forced labor takes different forms, including debt Nordic Semiconductor has worked with the issue of Conflict bondage, trafficking, and other forms of modern slavery. Minerals since 2010 and engages regularly with our The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of suppliers to provide accurate and transparent information 2010 and The UK Modern Slavery Act of 2015 are two on the origin of minerals to concerned stakeholders.

Nordic has a commitment Nordic Semiconductor does not tolerate forced labor to source minerals only from RMI conflict free smelters, practices to be used in any of our operations, as stated in also within the DRC and covered countries. our CSR policy. The RBA Code of Conduct explicitly bans trafficked and forced labor, as well as any form of child Identification of smelters, and assessment of country labor.

Retaliation against any employee who has reported misconduct, is prohibited. There shall be no unfavorable treatment to any whistle blowers 2019 saw a higher employee turnover rate than in previous from all around the world. Onboarding and integration years, mainly due to individual employees’ personal are important, especially for our foreign employees in reasons, such as relocation, family reasons or seeking other each country.
