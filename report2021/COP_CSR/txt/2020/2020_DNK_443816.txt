The management of Kluntz A/S is very committed to sustainability and to optimize the internal processes in the company. Therefore, Kluntz A/S have chosen to be ISO9001 and ISO14001 certified. These certifications have helped to establish processes and procedures that ensures good management systems. The management system incorporated to meet these certifications helps us in managing sustainability as well. Kluntz A/S is mainly focusing on contributing to the Sustainable Development Goal no. 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Our membership of Amfori and The Danish Ethical Trading Initiative gives us the tools and knowledge to accomplish this. 1 HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1 Business should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights Principle 2 Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Kluntz´ A/S commitment to the principles Kluntz A/S supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles on Human Rights. And through our membership of Amfori/BSCI we focus on implementing these principles. How Kluntz A/S have implemented the principles of Human Rights Kluntz is a member of Amfori in order to manage our social and environmental impacts and to implement the principles of Human Rights in our supply chain. Amfori is widely known as BSCI, but it changed its name to Amfori from January 1st 2018. Amfori is a leading supply chain management system that supports companies to drive social compliance and improvements within the factories in their global supply chains. The principles are based on ILO conventions, the UNGP on Business and Human Rights as well as the OECD Guidelines. Amfori companies take active part in developing and implementing a system for improved working conditions in the global supply chain. Amfori offers a single implementation system and one Code of Conduct. This creates a unique opportunity to gain leverage at the supplier level and move forward on the sustainability agenda. Amfori audits the following Performance Areas: 1. Management system and cascade effect 2. Workers involvement and protection 3. Freedom of association and collective bargaining 4. No discrimination 5. Fair remuneration 6. Decent working hours 7. Occupational health and safety 8. Child Labour 9. Young workers 10. No precarious employment 11. No bonded labour 2 12. Protection of the environment 13. Ethical business behavior Kluntz A/S is working with factories mainly based out of China and a few in Bangladesh. Managing Human Rights in these countries are a challenge as they are both currently rated as high-risk countries. Through our membership of Amfori and the Danish Ethical Trading Initiative, we support initiatives who focus on the vulnerable workers in our supply chain and help them to seek better working conditions. In Bangladesh, we work with factories who are also part of “The Accord on Building and fire safety”, hereinafter The Accord. This means that they undergo extra audits by engineering companies who´s expertise are within building safety, electrical safety and fire safety. Through these audits and the establishment of Safety Committees at these Bangladesh factories, the Accord is improving the working conditions. In China, the main issue is still fair remuneration and working hours, which is normally the result of both poor purchasing practices and poor production planning. In 2019, we developed a Child Labor Policy, that we will need our suppliers to sign. The Child Labor Policy defines what will happen if we find that any of our suppliers use Child Labor. So instead of just getting rid of the child and the supplier, then Kluntz and our suppliers will take joint responsibility for the future of the child to ensure, that the child does not end up worse of, than he/she was. The measurement of outcomes in 2019 regarding Human Rights/ plans for 2020 We have made a Human Rights Policy, which is a good backup for our continuous focus on Human Rights in our Supply Chain. We will however focus on Amfori for the implementation, as this is where we can get leverage at the supplier level. The challenge for Kluntz A/S, is that we have many different product groups and therefore a long list of suppliers, that needs to be managed. However, many of our suppliers are established brands who already have good and well-defined compliance programs, that we can trust. The suppliers, that we will instead focus on are the ones where we are dealing with them directly through our close partners in Hong Kong. Naturally the Covid-19 pandemic have had an effect on the factories that we are working with and many audits have been stalled during this time. We currently have 12 factories in total in the Amfori system. 3 Status of these factories are as such: Factory Previous Rating Current rating Factory 1 C C Factory 2 C C Factory 3 C C Factory 4 C C Factory 5 C C Factory 6 C B Factory 7 C C Factory 8 C C Factory 9 C C Factory 10 C C Factory 11 A B Factory 12 A A Factory 13 A A Overall ratings last year Overall rating this year D = 0% D = 0% C = 77% C = 66% B = 0% B = 17% A = 23% A = 17% Unrated = 0% Unrated = 0% (Factory 5 – not working with anymore) There has been mainly good improvement in the ratings of the factories that we have listed for Amfori audits. The majority of the factories are rated with. C, the main reason for this being because of their management system. However, on the factory “hardware”, it seems that we have good and compliant factories, which are safe for the workers. During 2020 we were going to increase our collaboration with our Hong Kong partners, which started off really well, with a positive meeting in March, but then Covid-19 hit and everything got cancelled and postponed. We are hoping to soon re-establish that good connection and start working closer together. The aim of our increased cooperation would be to increase the number of factories we have in the Amfori database. LABOUR Principle 3 Business should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labour Principle 6 The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation 4 Kluntz´ A/S commitment to the principles Kluntz A/S supports and adhere to the fundamental Labor principles and International Labor Rights. We also respect and adhere to the principles of freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, both locally and in our supply chain. How Kluntz A/S have implemented the principles Kluntz A/S follows the Danish Labor Law, and we are being audited against it by the Danish Working Environment Authority on a regular basis.

ENVIRONMENT Principles 7 Business should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges Principles 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Principles 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Kluntz´ A/S commitment to the principles At Kluntz A/S, we fully acknowledge our responsibility in protecting the Environment and minimizing our environmental footprint throughout the entire supply chain. We set demands both for ourselves and for our suppliers. How Kluntz A/S have implemented the principles Kluntz A/S have always had a focus on environmental issues in-house, by using energy saving light bulbs, being cautious when printing and building a low energy consuming office and warehouse. Kluntz is ISO14001 certified. This certification works as a framework for better management control which then results in reducing our environmental impacts. It gives us a management tool to reap the benefits of environmental management. Through the Amfori Code of Conduct there is a focus on environmental issues and when auditing the factories, the overall rating also reflects the positive or negative impact on the environment. 7 The measurement of outcomes in 2018 regarding Environmental Protection/plans for 2019 Our ISO14001 certification has helped us and given us tools to identify and react on any negative impact on the environment that our business may have. For our supply chain, we will focus on the Amfori audits we are currently doing and help them with remediation. We see very few issues in our supply chain related to environment. The main issues we find are regarding their management systems on environmental protection. However, if we look at our supply chain, basically no matter the product we are making, then the biggest environmental impact that we have, is identified further out in our supply chain than we have currently mapped. ANTI CORRUPTION Principle 10 Business should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery Kluntz´ A/S commitment to the principles It is part of our requirements that suppliers must strive to avoid corruption in their supply chain. Under no circumstance must they be involved directly in any cases involving taking or offering bribes. If we experience a supplier offering us a bribe, it will be reported immediately and our business relationship will be terminated. How Kluntz´ A/S have implemented the principles It is a clear policy for all our employees in the office in Denmark, that if offered a bribe, they should refuse this and report the incident to the management instantly. They are also aware, that they are not to offer a bribe to any of our stakeholders at any time; this will be reason for termination of employment contract. Once we embark on a new business relationship, we explain the principles of the Amfori Code of Conduct to them and what we mean when we say that we are against any form of corruption. The measurement of outcomes in 2018 regarding anti-corruption/ plans for 2019 8 There have been no incidents reported during the last year and since we operate from one of the least corrupt countries and buy mostly from other EU countries, we have limited risk of experiencing corruption in our business relationships. However, the production countries where we are operating in can have issues around anticorruption why we have developed an Anti-corruption Policy for both our internal staff and suppliers. We were planning the implementation of this during 2020, but got sidetracked by the Covid-19 situation. We are planning to take it up again during 20/21. How to communicate this COP to our stakeholders It is always important for Kluntz A/S to make our stakeholders aware of the work that we are doing within sustainability. We strive to always be transparent about our actions, both in the head office, but also how we do business in the global supply chain. We are members of the Danish Trading Initiative to communicate the issues we experience in our supply chain and engage in dialogues to solve many of these issues. Our homepage contains information about the work that we are doing and the fact that we are a proud member of Amfori, The Danish Ethical Trading Initiative and The UN Global Compact 9
