ABOUT COMSA CORPORACIÓN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMSA Corporación was born as a result of the integration, in 2009, of two family business groups. Both groups had historically maintained a close collaborative relationship that allowed them to offer clients comprehensive solutions for their projects. This vision has allowed COMSA Corporación to become a reference in the infrastructure and industrial engineering sector. In the integration process, COMSA Corporación has maintained one of the most significant characteristics of both groups, namely the fact that it is still owned by the Miarnau family, with a 70% stake, and the Sumarroca family, with a 30% shareholding, in addition to being one of the leading unlisted Spanish companies in the sector in terms of turnover. This condition of family business determines, to a large extent, the model of operation and corporate governance, as well as the decision-making process. Managing bodies and structures of COMSA Corporación: »» Board of Directors. »» Executive Committee. »» Operating and Operations Committees. BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMSA Corporación’s highest governing body is the Board of Directors, appointed by the General Shareholders’ Meeting and consisting entirely of proprietary directors, who are elected by the General Meeting from among the shareholders for their knowledge of the business, management experience and expertise.

Thus in 2019 the electric and LPG fleet has increased to a total of 25 vehicles, compared to 12 in 2018. »» Use of drones in some phases of the projects, thus optimising the movement of the technicians and reducing the associated emissions, while increasing productivity. »» In works, the group applies geothermal systems that allow taking advantage of the temperature of the subsoil in the cooling systems. An example of application of this technology is the one carried out in the new Warehouse of the Perelada Group (Spain). In this way, the building is more energy efficient in its operating phase, which means significant energy savings. COMSA Corporación offers within its service portfolio solutions for the improvement of energy efficiency of its clients, thus promoting a more efficient use of energy. In addition to the hand of the Renewable Energy Business Area, it contributes to the development of the renewable sector, both in the design and construction phases, as well as in the management of various energy infrastructures, thus helping to guarantee universal access to sustainable energy.

ENVIRONMENTAL SPHERE ENVIRONMENTAL CONTRIBUTION APPLICATION OF SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS COMSA Corporación also contributes to mitigating the effects of greenhouse gas emissions by implementing policies related to the application of sustainable construction standards. In 2019, 12 projects were implemented with energy efficiency certifications: LEED and BREEAM. These certifications provide a complete framework for evaluating water, energy and material selection efficiency, which ensures better indoor air quality, as well as more comfortable and safe lighting and noise levels for users. As a result, these buildings use fewer resources, have lower maintenance costs, show a greater commitment to sustainability and offer safer environments. Some of the highlights in this area are: »» In 2019, 12 energy-certified projects were executed, including the Barcelona Office Building Project in Barcelona’s Barrio 22@, which achieved the highest LEED certification score in the world. »» 75% of the corporate centres have ISO 50.001 or BREEAM energy certification. 75% of corporate centres have energy certification.
