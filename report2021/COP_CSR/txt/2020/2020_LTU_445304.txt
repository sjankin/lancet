After brand consolidation, in September we became an international energy company Ignitis Group. The new name marks the beginning of a new phase in the Group’s readiness to meet its 2030 goals and focus on sustainable and environmentally friendly development in the international marketplace, ensuring high quality customer service and operating efficiency. We feel being responsible in a world facing the challenges of climate change and understand that the energy of the future is inseparable from decarbonisation. We demonstrated this not just by making statements but by taking real actions. 472 million Eur, our of the 600 million Eur raised through the issue of green bonds, were invested to Green Generation projects. These Investments create not only economic value but also environmental benefits for Lithuania. In addition, in December 2019 we became the first company from the Baltic States and Poland to join the “Business Ambition for 1.5°C” initiative of the United Nations and other international organisations. In this way, we committed by 2050 to reduce net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to zero. In the previous year, we continued to set for ourselves ambitious goals to increase our income outside Lithuania and expand our services abroad. The results of 2019 revealed that these goals are gradually becoming a reality: Group’s sales from abroad grew more than 25%. This is evidence that the Group became a serious market player on the international scale. However, further Investments are needed to preserve current and further expansion. With the aim to invest approx. EUR 6bn over the next decade, long-term financing alternatives is being assessed. One of which – Ignitis Group initial public offering (IPO). The first steps towards this ambition have already been taken: delisting process of Ignitis Gamyba and ESO has been initiated, Ministry of Finance assigned the company to be prepared for the IPO by autumn, 2020. Had it not been for the highest standards of governance and transparency, which are an integral part of the Group’s activities, the set goals would not have been achieved. We are excited to have them appraised in 2019 by the Governance Coordination Centre, where Ignitis Group was raked as number one in the Good Corporate Governance Index published by this centre. The beginning of 2020 started with challenges related to COVID-19 epidemic and quarantine which affected everyone. The Group had to react instantly to make sure that health of the employees and business continuation would be ensured. During this current period, more than half of the Group’s employees are working from home whereas other employees’ health is ensured at maximum. At the same time, we are already thinking what steps must be taken to cope with the crisis and how we can help to our financially affected customers. The dedicated team is already working on this and I personally believe that the situation will be managed well. The most important thing is to stay healthy and continue to create value for Lithuania. While focusing on the Energy Smart world, our aim is to create value for Lithuania, we are committed to continuously working towards a more transparent and effective outcome.

In the field of reliable electricity generation, the year of 2020 will Since the Astravyets nuclear power plant (NPP) has been a also be exceptional to Lithuania. After a longer break. Vilnius constant topic of discussion, next year we will probably focus on and Kaunas co-generation power plants, which are expected to catching electrons potentially trying to get to Lithuania from start the operation in 2020, will bring a new reliably accessible unsafe third-country nuclear power plants. Following the launch of electricity generation capacity in Lithuania to a more significant the Astravyets NPP, we will have to agree with Latvia and Estonia level (116 MW). It is also expected that, once the necessary on a trade with third countries and regarding isolated work test of legislative changes and the final concept have been decided, the electrical systems in the Baltic States, which is a prerequisite auctions of Capacity Mechanisms should take place at the end for synchronization with continental Europe. of next year to ensure the adequacy of the Lithuanian energy system after synchronisation with continental Europe in 2025. While household consumers are waiting for smart electricity For this reason, and the potential impact of these mechanisms meters, we will also have to properly prepare for the planned on the final consumer electricity bill, this matter will potentially be market liberalisation, because the draft laws provide that the first one of the main topics in the country’s energy heaven next year. part of the country’s largest household electricity consumers will have to choose their new electricity supplier on 1 January 2021. In the light of all these pending tasks, it is to be hoped that the Accordingly, to make this process for consumers as smooth as potentially changing political winds will not prevent everyone possible, awareness raising initiative is expected to start from from marching forward and consolidating on what has been mid-2020: consumers will learn about the planned stages of achieved so far. liberalization, the benefits and the opportunities they can embrace from this process.

The main reasons causing Revenue changes were as follows: 1. Higher Revenue of the Networks segment (+EUR 32.6 million). The increase was mainly 10.9 driven by higher distribution Revenue (EUR 21.1 million) and transmission Revenue (EUR 79.7 Customers and Solutions 13.4 million) due to increase of tariffs. 83.3 2. Higher Revenue of the Flexible Generation segment (+EUR 11.7 million). The segment’s Revenue grew mainly because of EUR 9.3 million compensation from the Ministry of Finance Networks of the Republic of Lithuania for the indemnification of potentially inflicted damage by Alstom EUR 1,090.6 502.9 Power Ltd during the implementation of the project of Lietuvos Elektrinė in 2005–2009. Sales million were also boosted by sales of fuel oil stocks that were no longer in use. Green Generation 3. Higher Revenue from the Green Generation segment (+EUR 4,9 million). Revenue growth was driven by two major reasons: the increased portfolio of wind farms (+EUR 6.8 413.8 Flexible Generation million) and favourable wind conditions (+EUR 2.6 million). The above reasons outweighed lower Revenue of Kaunas HPP and Kruonis PSHP. Revenue of Kaunas HPP decreased due lower generation volumes because of the hydrological drought. Other 4. Lower Revenue from the Customers and Solutions segment (-EUR 22.4 million). The decline was mainly driven by lower gas sales to B2B customers (-EUR 54.3 million) and lower Revenue from derivative instruments (-EUR 36.1 million).

A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit. Subsequent measurement of right-of-use assets 2.10 Investment property Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company/Group measures the right-of-use asset using the cost model. Under the cost model, the Company/Group measures a right-of-use asset at cost: less any Investment property, which consists of the Group’s buildings and structures, is held to earn rentals or depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease for capital appreciation. Investment property is recognised initially at acquisition cost, and is liability. subsequently carried at fair value, which is determined by independent property valuers.

If any such indication exists, the recoverable when, it becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The purchase or sale of amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where financial assets is recognised using trade date accounting. it is impossible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs is estimated. Where a reasonable and consistent Financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value basis of allocation can be identified, assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a financial otherwise they are allocated to the smallest groups of cash-generating units for which a reasonable asset. and consistent allocation basis can be identified.

The Company and the Group classify their financial assets into the following three new categories: The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. (i) financial assets subsequently measured at amortised cost; In assessing value in use, the expected future cash flows are discounted to their present value using (ii) financial assets subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income; and the discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks (iii) financial assets subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets are classified into the afore-mentioned categories If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying based on the business model the Company/Group applies when managing its financial assets and amount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. characteristics of cash flows from these assets. The business model applied to the group of financial An impairment loss is recognised immediately in loss. assets is determined at a level that reflects how all groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective of the Company/Group.

The Company/Group may apply more than one business model to manage its The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash inflows through the financial assets. In view of the business model applied for managing the group of financial assets, the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset that shows the accounting for financial assets, except for financial assets subsequently measured at fair value through amortised cost of the financial asset, before adjusting for any loss allowance. When calculating the other comprehensive income as the Group and the Company does not have this kind of assets, is as effective interest rate, the Company/Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the follows: contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points Financial assets measured at amortised cost paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. There is a presumption that the cash flows and Loans granted by the Company/Group, amounts receivable, and cash and cash equivalents are the expected life of a group of similar financial instruments can be estimated reliably. However, when accounted for under the business model the purpose of which is to hold financial assets in order to it is not possible to reliably estimate the cash flows or the expected life of a financial instrument (or collect contractual cash flows that can contain cash flows related to the payment of the principal group of financial instruments), the Company/Group uses the contractual cash flows over the full amount and interest inflows. These assets are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest contractual term of the financial instrument (or group of financial instruments). method. Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial instrument was recognised at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus accrued interest, and, for financial assets, minus any Impairment of financial assets – expected credit losses write-down for expected credit losses. Effective interest rate method is a method applied to allocate interest income over the relevant period so as to achieve a constant periodic rate of interest (effective The Group and the Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit loss associated interest) on the carrying amount. The effective interest rate exactly discounts estimated future cash with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost regardless of whether there are any impairment inflows or outflows (excluding future expected credit losses) to gross carrying amount of the financial indicators. instrument over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, if necessary. Credit losses incurred by the Company/Group are calculated as the difference between all contractual Financial assets are recognised as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after cash flows that are due to the Company/Group in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows the date of the preparation of the statement of financial position, in which case they are classified as that the Company/Group expects to receive (i.e. all cash shortfalls), discounted at the original effective non-current assets. interest rate. The Company/Group estimates cash flows by considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument through the expected life of that financial instrument, including cash flows from the Assets held in order to collect contractual cash flows that represent solely payments of principal and sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms. interest (SPPI) are carried at amortised cost. Interest income calculated on these financial assets is recognised as finance income and amortised using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss Expected credit losses are measured in a way that reflects an unbiased and probability-weighted arising from the write-off of assets is recognised in the statement of profit or loss and other amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes; the time value of money; and comprehensive income. Impairment losses are accounted for as impairment and write-off expenses in reasonable and supportable information about past events and current conditions, and reasonable and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. supportable forecasts of future events and economic conditions at the reporting date. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Lifetime expected credit losses are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the period from the date of initial recognition of a financial asset to the subsequent date Debt instruments that do not meet the criteria of financial assets to be measured at amortised cost or of settlement of the financial asset or ultimate write-off of the financial asset. financial assets to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are stated as financial assets to be measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). The Company/Group seeks for lifetime expected credit losses to be recognised before a financial instrument becomes past due. Typically, credit risk increases significantly before a financial instrument To this category, the Company/Group attributes amounts receivable from disposal of business or becomes past due or other lagging borrower-specific factors (for example, a modification or equity instruments that do not meet the SPPI conditions. The Company/Group attributes financial restructuring) are observed. Consequently, when reasonable and supportable information that is more assets to assets measured at fair value through profit or loss, if this eliminates or significantly reduces forward-looking than past due information is available without undue cost or effort, it is used to assess a measurement or recognition inconsistency (sometimes referred to as ‘an accounting mismatch’) that changes in credit risk. Expected credit losses are recognised by taking into consideration individually would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liabilities or recognising gains or losses thereof on or collectively assessed credit risk of loans granted and trade receivables. Credit risk is assessed different bases. A gain or loss on fair value measurement of debt investment is recognised in profit or based on all reasonable information, including future-oriented information. loss in the period in which it arises. For short-term trade receivables without a significant financing component the Company/Group Effective interest method applies a simplified approach required by IFRS 9 and measures the loss allowance at expected lifetime credit losses from initial recognition of the receivables. The effective interest method is used in the calculation of the amortised cost of a financial asset and in the allocation of the interest revenue in profit or loss over the relevant period. The Company/Group assesses impairment of amounts receivable individually or collectively.

better comparable to its peers within the industry. This change in accounting treatment is accounted for retrospectively and In preparing these financial statements, the Group has adopted changes in accounting methods comparative information is restated (see the table below). Connection fees Public Service Obligations On 1 January 2018, the Group adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and its PSO fee is an integral part of electricity tariff to the customer. Final electricity tariff to end customers amendments for the first time and they had a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. comprise of the following components: The Group accounted for the impact of the first-time adoption of IFRS 15 starting from 1 January 2018 (a) Electricity price itself (import or price of manufactured) using the modified retrospective approach. (b) Electricity supply services’ price Upon initial application of IFRS 15 with respect to revenue from new customer connection the Group (c) Electricity transfer services’ price, which include two components: transmission over high voltage assessed the existence of separate performance obligation through the legal point of view, i.e. if the grid and distribution over medium and low voltage grid Group had a new connection contract with the customer and the distribution as a service was provided (d) PSO fee to the end customer through the customer’s contract for supply services, the new connection contract was treated as separate performance obligation, accordingly revenue received from the customer was The Group acting as an electricity supplier collects PSO fees from business customers and private recognized as income, when the connection service was provided. In case the Group signed two individuals, connected to electricity distribution grid, and transfer them to the operator of energy separate agreements with the customer – one for connection service, another one for distribution exchange Baltpool UAB, which also acts as the administrator of PSO services and is engaged in the service, these two were treated as a single performance obligation, accordingly the connection fees collection of PSO fees, payments and administration of PSO funds. PSO funds are used to support paid by the customers were recognized as revenue through the useful life of new infrastructure and promote local production from renewable energy sources, to secure reserves of the electricity created. system at designated power plants, which is necessary for ensuring the state's energy security and to ensure other services related to public interest. The list of services supported by PSO is determined Following this judgment starting from year 2018 the connection fees in gas segment were recognized by the Government of the Republic of Lithuania. when connection service was provided. In electricity segment from 1 January 2018 to 1 October 2018 connection fees were deferred over the period of estimated customer relationship, which is determined In 2018 PSO fee as integral part of distribution service tariff was not identified as a separate based on the useful life of the related newly created property, plant and the equipment (the connection performance obligation. The distribution service as a whole, including transmission, distribution and infrastructure). PSO fee was treated as one performance obligation (PSO fee cannot be separated). PSO fee generally is treated as a tax collected from customers, however this tax cannot be treated as sales During the implementation of the project initiated by the Company, the purpose of which is to optimise tax, or value-added tax (VAT), since: (1) PSO fee is charged based on production or distributed energy the activities of the Group and concentrate the function of energy supply to a single company, the unit, rather than sales amount, as is applied in VAT case; (2) the Group cannot claim a refund of PSO activity of public electricity supply was unbundled from the Group company Energijos skirstymo fees in the event the related the customer fails to pay for the services being sold; (3) the Group is operatorius AB and transferred to another Group company Ignitis UAB, which was a supplier of natural exposed to price risk in case of illegal consumption, the Group’s settlement amount as PSO fee to gas to household and business customers. Following the transfer of electricity public supply activities Baltpool UAB will be determined based on current period’s prices, however, the customer will be as of 1 October 2018, new customer connection in electricity segment was reconsidered as a separate charged based on historical prices. Following the above, the Management treated the Group as performance obligation under IFRS 15, accordingly related revenue from 1 October 2018 was Principal in relation to PSO fee in 2018. recognized when connection service was fully provided. During the year 2019 the Group changed the method of accounting for PSO fee by treating the Group Management of the Group has extensively analysed IFRS 15 accounting policies, which were also as an Agent in relation to the PSO fee. Such decision has been taken after extensive analysis of reviewed by the Bank of Lithuania as an oversight body of listed entities, also auditors were involved relevant industry practice and taking into consideration the facts, that the Group is not responsible for in the discussions. The accounting policies applied upon initial adoption of IFRS 15 were assessed as PSO projects / initiatives, accordingly not responsible that collected PSO fees are used for their appropriate after evaluating management judgement made in a number of areas. However, one year intended purpose. The Group is not exposed to any inventory risk, as well as the Group has no legal after mandatory implementation of the new standard, the Group observed the development of relevant power to establish pricing of this component. industry practice, referred to the developing authoritative guidance on IFRS 15 application, analysed “implied contract” concept (as The changed accounting methods allows the Group to be better comparable to its peers within the per IFRS 15 requirements), and consulted with its auditors, and as a result the Group has reconsidered electricity industry (especially, where such PSO fee is excluded from the final electricity tariff). This its accounting treatment. change in accounting treatment is applied retrospectively with corrections in comparative information presented in the tables below.

The The Group acts (i) as a natural gas supplier which collects LNGT security component from the users change in accounting treatment is applied retrospectively with correction of comparative information and (ii) as a designated liquefied natural gas supplier, which ensures the operation of LNGT. In relation shown in the tables below. to provision of designated supplier’s function the Group’s costs due to the nature of its activities are exclusively borne whereas other natural gas suppliers don’t incur. These costs are compensated by Electricity transfer, which includes both transmission and distribution, and gas distribution services in gas transmission system operator paying LNGT funds from the budget of collected LNGT security Latvia component by suppliers that supply natural gas to end customers. In Latvia electricity transfer, which includes transmission and distribution, and gas distribution services LNGT security component is an integral part of natural gas tariff to the customer. Final natural gas are provided by the company which is not a part of the Group. Electricity transmission and distribution tariff to end customers comprise of the following components: services are an integral part of electricity tariff to end users. Gas distribution services are an integral (a) Cost of gas import part of gas tariff to end users. Providing the provision of electricity and gas services as a whole to end (b) Natural gas transfer cost, which includes transmission over high-pressure and distribution over users in Latvia, the Group in 2018 did not identify electricity transfer and gas distribution services as a medium and low-pressure grids costs separate performance obligations. The Group considered itself as a Principal which provides one (c) LNGT security component performance obligation by treating that customer cannot benefit alone from supplied electricity without transfer and gas without distribution and vice versa. As well as, the Group considered itself as Pursuant to Article 5.2 of the Law on the LNGT, all users of the natural gas distribution system, providing a significant service of integrating the electricity transfer and gas distribution services including end-users, have to pay an additional security component along with other payments for promised in the contract with customers into a bundle of services that represent the combined output natural gas distribution services. As a natural gas supplier to end users the Group collects payments for which the customer has contracted. for LNGT security component directly from customers or natural gas suppliers, if the customers don’t have a direct contract with the transmission system operator. The Group acting as a natural gas In the course of its electricity and gas sales activities in Latvia the Group collects funds from customers supplier collects LNGT security component from the end users and transfers it to transmission system for the electricity transfer and gas distribution services and transfers these funds to the operator of operator. electricity transfer network and operator of gas distribution system.

LNGT security component generally is treated as a tax collected from distribution, and gas distribution service in Latvia the Group changed the method of these funds’ customers, however this tax cannot be treated as sales tax, or value-added tax (VAT), since: (1) LNGT accounting by treating itself as an Agent. Such decision has been taken after extensive analysis of security component is charged based on production or distributed energy unit, rather than sales relevant industry practice and taking into consideration the fact, that the Group is not responsible for amount, as is applied in VAT case; (2) the Group cannot claim a refund of the tax in the event the development/maintenance of electricity transfer and gas distribution network in Latvia, accordingly not related the customer fails to pay for the services being sold (i.e. the volume of gas consumption); (3) responsible that these funds are used for their intended purpose.

Following the above, the Group acting as a natural gas supplier to end users was treated by Management as a Principal in relation to A change in accounting treatment allows a better comparison of the Group’s performance with that of LNGT security component. LNGT security component collected from end users was recognised by the similar entities (especially when the electricity transfer and natural gas distribution components are Group in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income under the caption “Revenue excluded from the tariff).
