In this light, a campaign was launched towards spreading a message of rebuilding our Nation by maintaining peace and moving forward swiftly, in solidarity. The message “We are stronger united. Let us stand together as one nation.” was displayed across all our places of business through posters, pennants, digital displays, vehicle stickers, and on social and digital media as well as press. Further it was also advocated that all staff take the pledge of unity a private sector initiative, led by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, towards peace building in Sri Lanka and restoring its image as a peaceful country. 18 JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 LABOUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING Engagement with trade unions through joint consultative committees and other mechanisms are carried out on an ongoing basis by JKH. HEALTH AND SAFETY JKH has in place robust policies and processes to ensure a safe working environment for its employees – open communication, strict safety policies and training are prioritised across JKH, to ensure that it is a ‘Safe Place to Work’. As part of its Human Capital management strategy, incidents are recorded and monitored on an ongoing basis. During the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, JKH implemented stringent measures to ensure the health and safety of its workforce. JKH established a work arrangement protocol with detailed guidelines to be followed when entering the workplace, working from home, conducting meetings on site, travelling and ensuring workplace hygiene. INTERNAL AWARENESS CREATION, CAPACITY BUILDING AND STAFF VOLUNTEERISM Under Project WAVE, general sensitisation has been conducted among employees to create awareness on the subject areas. JKF also conducted a series of training of trainers programmes on gender based violence and child protection for a total of 68 employees to increase the pool of resources to sustain and scale gender and child protection awareness programmes under Project WAVE. John Keells Volunteer Trainers after the gender training of trainers programme STAFF VOLUNTEERISM Staff volunteers are the driving force of the projects conducted by JKF. The John Keells Volunteer Network enables employees to go beyond their day-to-day work and make a hands-on contribution to the community and environment. The Company’s flexible volunteer leave policy enables its employees to engage in volunteerism with minimum restraint. Staff volunteers vary from project champions, volunteer trainers and skill-based volunteers to field-based and administrative support and are eligible for recognition under various recognition schemes including `Extra Mile’ ratings under the annual performance appraisal system, recognition through internal communication platforms, award of certificates and trophies at the annual Volunteer Recognition Day event and Chairman’s Award for CSR. During the year in review, JKF recorded a total of 557 hours of CSR volunteerism by 86 staff volunteers in respect of activities conducted by JKF. 19 ENVIRONMENT Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 ENVIRONMENT JKH is committed to protect and conserve the environment for itself, the community and future generations, and its environmental policy revolves around this principle. With environmental impacts such as energy, water consumption, emissions, waste and effluents and biodiversity, JKH is aware that it is a custodian of the environment for future generations and as such takes best efforts to minimise negative environmental impacts and comply with all applicable laws and regulations. JKH has in place a well-structured Natural Capital management strategy which has been of paramount importance in enabling long­ term sustainable value creation to JKH. Through this, the organisation has established a comprehensive environmental management system which ensures policies and procedures and assure the sustainable and efficient operation of business whilst improving the bottom line. JKH is committed to efficiently managing inputs such as energy, water and conservation of biodiversity, while responsibly managing outputs such as emissions, waste and effluents. JKH has in place common guidelines for data measurements; all electricity consumption, and fossil fuel consumption are metered, with calibration of such meters carried out regularly. While water withdrawal is also measured through meters, waste water discharge is measured through meter readings as well as estimates based on pump time. Waste generated is also largely based on estimates. Carbon emissions are measured in accordance with the greenhouse gas protocol governed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The calculations use the carbon emission factor source of the IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, published by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) and includes only CO2. The sustainability goals of JKH focus predominantly on strengthening its commitment to optimising water usage and conserving energy, with an emphasis on managing impacts on Natural capital. In a bid to further strengthen JKH’s commitment to its Natural Capital management strategy, the organisation will embark on establishing a further set of sustainability goals to be achieved by 2025. This would provide JKH with a renewed set of goals, with a focus on contemporary environmental issues. ENERGY AND CARBON FOOTPRINT JKH is committed to responsible energy and emissions management. It constantly strives to manage its energy consumption and carbon footprint and to thereby minimise its energy related environmental impacts by operating under its energy and emissions policy. The policy requires the organisation to seek out methods for energy conservation through embracing lean energy management practices and replacement of fixtures with energy efficient alternates and encourages the assessment of feasibility of renewable sources of energy where possible and applicable. Through its energy management policy, JKH seeks to monitor and manage its carbon footprint to reduce impacts on natural capital. WATER MANAGEMENT Based on the JKH water policy, the Company seeks to conserve and optimise its use of water obtained from surface and ground water sources and wherever possible seeks to re-use waste water after treatment with a view to reducing the intake of fresh water. As part of its Natural Capital management strategy, JKH monitors and measures water from all sources, whilst all water withdrawn by JKH is from non-water stressed areas. The organisation seeks to ensure that systems and processes are in place to identify and implement applicable technologies, process improvements and motivate employee behavioural changes to conserve water. 21 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 | JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC ENVIRONMENT WASTE MANAGEMENT The JKH waste management policy is based upon the tenets of Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. JKH encourages its employees and stakeholders to be conscious in terms of reducing consumption and to reuse and recycle wherever possible. Waste generated by the Company is segregated as hazardous and non-hazardous waste and classified and tracked based on disposal method. Hazardous waste is disposed through specialised third-party contractors whilst JKH encourages non­ hazardous waste to be disposed through methods such as reducing, reuse, recycling, recovery and composting rather than directing waste to landfill as far as possible, as part of its Natural Capital management strategy. PAPER CONSERVATION JKH continued its long-term contractual arrangement with Neptune Recyclers (Private) Limited to collect waste paper from business locations for shredding and recycling during the reporting period. IMPACT DURING THE YEAR 18,111 Kg of waste paper collected with a payment of Rs.144,888 Indirect Savings:  309 Trees  31,784 litres of Oil  575,567 litres of Water  54 m3 of landfill  72,444 kWh of Electricity ZERO WASTE DAY As part of the ongoing environmental sustainability drive, JKH initiated a zero waste day for all employees. The first Friday of each month was identified as a ‘Zero Waste Day’, where all employees were requested to refrain from bringing single use waste to work and encouraged, wherever possible, to reuse paper. Tips for going 'Zero Waste', at meetings, workstations and the lunch room were also shared with employees with the objective of cultivating a mindset that aims to reduce or eliminate waste where possible. Creating awareness creatively on Zero Waste Day 22 JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 ENVIRONMENT 'PLASTICCYCLE' SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP INITIATIVE Plasticcycle was launched in 2017 with the vision of being the catalyst in significantly reducing plastic pollution in Sri Lanka, Plasticcycle seeks to drive change through three key areas of focus creating awareness, supporting responsible disposal and promoting recycling. Awareness initiatives undertaken during the year:  Awareness campaign educating up to 10,000 commuters who use the expressway to recycle their waste plastic bottles.  Worked closely with legislative bodies of various cities in Sri Lanka to place bins and raise awareness among the residents on the effective management and recycling of plastic waste.  Promoted a theme of ‘Zero Plastic’ across distinct events held by JKH.  Provided technical assistance for selecting gifts with limited single-use plastics to the children of the staff during the Christmas season.  Commenced awareness programmes on plastic waste in schools, educating students on the importance of the 4R’s (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse & Recycle), having conducted the first training programme at the Overseas School of Colombo and the Asian Grammar School, Kollonnawa. Actions to support responsible disposal:  Placed bins at the Outer Circular Highway, on the Kerawalapitiya interchange and Kadawatha exits.  Placed collection points at supermarkets, including 43 Keells outlets, 5 Laughs outlets and 3 Softlogic Glomark outlets.  Expanded collection points to sports, community and recreational venues including the Sugathadasa Outdoor and Indoor Stadium and the newly constructed De Mel Park Community Centre in Colombo 2. Promoting recycling initiatives:  Participated in the 10-day Ashara Mubaraka event held in Colombo and Kala Pola 2020 open art fair.  Completed a pilot project by the Sri Lanka Navy which aims to address non-recyclable plastics, including the testing of the prototype chamber and development of a product catalogue that will be marketed by the Sri Lanka Navy. Progress:  The Southern Expressway Project collected 2 MT, equivalent to over 60,000 PET bottles.  Together with the Sri Lanka Recyclers Association, collected and recycled 58 MT of plastic waste, equivalent to over 1.6 million PET bottles Plasticcycle bins and banners at the Kerewalapitiya interchange One of five Plasticcycle bins placed at Sugathadasa Outdoor Stadium 23 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 | JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC ENVIRONMENT RUMASSALA NATURE FIELD CENTRE The Nature Field Centre in Rumassala in the Galle District, Southern Province – established in 2008 by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) in collaboration with JKF works as a platform to facilitate experiential learning on environment and biodiversity conservation particularly among school children. Aesthetically designed by the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Moratuwa and constructed under the aegis of JKF, the Centre is located on the legendary Rumassala hill which is rich in biodiversity including several species of endemic birds, marine life, coral reefs and a number of rare medicinal plants. The Centre continued to attract a steady number of visitors during the reporting period with 2,275 visitors participating in CEA’s awareness programmes. Awareness session in progress at the Rumassala Nature Field Centre BEACH CLEANING INITIATIVE JKF in collaboration with Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, organised periodic beach cleanups as part of its sustained commitment to the preservation of the coastal and ocean ecosystem. The Marine and Coastal Conservation Authority and Sri Lanka Navy supported in these efforts. A volunteer at a beach clean-up 24 JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 ENVIRONMENT FAUNA AND FLORA CONSERVATION In 2014, John Keells Foundation in collaboration with Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts and the Centre for Conservation and Research initiated a sustained research on elephant behavioural and dispersion patterns in the North Central Province seeking to improve the management of elephant habitats and reduce the human-elephant conflict towards long-term conservation of the species and its habitat. As a result of this collaboration, two elephant matriarchs, were fitted with GPS satellite collars in November 2017 in collaboration with the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC). Formulation of scientific information to improve the management of elephant habitats was made possible by GPS tracking of these two elephant matriarchs (Tara and Biso). As result of these tracking devices, the team was able to obtain the very first image of Tara’s new elephant calf named ‘Tharaka’ on the 26th January 2018 enabling the DWC to determine the exact date of its birth as usually the date of birth is unknown. It is hoped that through this initiative the full story behind elephant gathering can be unravelled. JKF continued to support this long term collaboration for the fifth consecutive year including the following outcomes during the year under review:  52 field visits were made to both Kaudulla and Minneriya Wildlife Parks to observe the two matriarch elephants fitted with GPS satellite collars.  Data gathered over 2018/19 was presented to staff and selected park jeep drivers to foster knowledge sharing. ‘Tara’ collared with a GPS tracking device and her calf ‘Tharaka’ Elephant collared with a GPS tracking device 25 ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 ANTI-CORRUPTION JKH Policy JKH places the highest value on ethical practices and has promulgated a zero-tolerance policy towards corruption and bribery in all its transactions. JKH strives to maintain a culture of honesty and opposition to fraud and corruption. Based on this commitment, the Code of Conduct, anti-fraud, fraud prevention, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, validation and audit policies of JKH outline the principles to which we are committed in relation to preventing, reporting and managing fraud and corruption. It covers inter alia, theft, embezzlement, overriding controls, giving or receiving kickbacks, bribery, allowing oneself to be placed in situations of conflict of interest and statements (financial or non-financial) dishonestly and recklessly made contrary to the factual position. The Company also has a process to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations of the countries it operates in. JKH seeks to ensure that ethical business practices are the norm from the business unit level, down to the individual employee. Its transparent control and prevention mechanisms also extend to its value chain, to its customers, suppliers and business partners. At the employee level, every employee and director is required to comply with Company policies, including the Code of Conduct. The Company Leadership spearheads the implementation of the Code. During the reporting period, there were no departures from any of the provisions of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or the Code of Best Practice on Corporate Governance, jointly advocated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The Company ’s commitment to upholding Company policies, where emphasis is placed on ethical and legal dealings, zero tolerance for corruption, bribery and any form of harassment or discrimination in our workplace and any work-related situations is also affirmed. Training When Directors are newly appointed to the Board, they undergo a comprehensive induction where they are apprised, inter alia, of JKH Values and culture, its operating model, policies, governance framework and processes, the Code of Conduct and the operational strategies of JKH. At the employee level, every employee agrees to comply with JKH’s Code of Conduct, when accepting the terms and conditions of employment. As all executive and above staff need to complete a mandatory learning course on the policies, which is carried out through the Learning Management System, all employees are familiarised with the conditions of JKH’s Anti-Corruption policy which also extends to any agents who are authorised representatives of JKH and are educated on human rights practices. Employees are also expected to report any breach of the Code with the assurance of discretion and employees are provided with a number of channels to facilitate such reporting, such as Chairman Direct, Ombudsperson service and business unit-specific grievance handling process. Supplier forum 2019 27 COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 | JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC ANTI-CORRUPTION Value Chain In dealing with its value chain, JKH ensures transparency and fair practices, fostering mutually beneficial relationships based on open communication that stress the importance of business partners adhering to the ethical standards that underlie all business practices. Further, a comprehensive selection process is carried out for JKH’s key suppliers by JKH’s Group Initiatives Division which involves evaluation committees including independent category managers and neutral parties. All suppliers that are selected are contractually bound to adhere to JKH’s Supplier Code of Conduct which covers human rights and anti-corruption expectations and are required to submit their audited financial statements for the two most recent financial years upon registration. Further, if it is discovered that the supplier has violated the Supplier Code of Conduct including anti-corruption breaches, it becomes a reason for termination of contracts and cessation of dealings. Reporting Channels JKH is continuously working towards introducing innovative and effective ways of employee communication and employee awareness. The importance of communication – top-down, bottom-up, and lateral-in gaining employee commitment to organisational goals has been conveyed extensively through various communications issued by the Chairman-CEO and the management. Whilst employees have many opportunities to interact with the senior management, JKH has created the ensuing formal channels for such communication through feedback, without the risk of reprisal.  Skip level meetings  Exit interviews  Young Forum meetings  360-degree evaluation  Employee surveys  Monthly staff meetings  Ombudsperson  Access to Senior Independent Director  Chairman-Direct  Continuous reiteration and the practice of the ‘open-door ’ policy JKH has witnessed an increased level of communication flow from employees. Such communication and feedback received from the employees by the management are recorded, irrespective of the level of anonymity, and subsequently discussed and followed up. The respective outcomes are duly recorded. 28 JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 ANTI-CORRUPTION The Corporate Governance System JKH’s framework has its own set of internal benchmarks, processes and structures towards meeting accepted best practice, in addition to the ‘triggers’ which ensure compliance with mandatory regulatory requirements. This framework is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect global best practice, evolving regulations, and dynamic stakeholder needs, while maintaining its foundational principles of accountability, participation and transparency. The JKH’s Corporate Governance System plays a pivotal role in ensuring the implementation of Company policies and regulatory requirements, including policies aimed at fostering anti-corruption, anti-bribery, fraud prevention, anti-money laundering, among others, and also acts as an assurance mechanism with inbuilt internal controls. The diagram below illustrates the key components of the Corporate Governance System of JKH. It depicts the internal governance structure, from the Board of Directors cascading down to employee level, the integrated governance systems and procedures, the Assurance Mechanisms in place and the various regulatory frameworks JKH is compliant with from a Governance standpoint.

JKH assesses the risk of corruption as part of its risk management process and puts in place mitigation measures to reduce such risks. Independent audits and Management Committees continually review policies and assess the risk of non-compliance regarding corruption. All functions have a process for the prevention and reduction of corruption and are required to include and analyse the risk of corruption as part of their risk management process. In order to ensure compliance, reviews are carried out at Management Committee level while instances of non-compliance (if any) are formally disclosed to those tasked with governance and oversight on a quarterly basis. Whilst external compliance audits for JKH are carried out annually, independent process reviews are carried out periodically, to assess the efficacy of process and related controls to continuously improve the risk management, controls and compliance posture of the Company. Employees are also assessed with regard to whether or not they embrace those values set out in JKH’s Code of Conduct as part of the performance appraisal cycle. Strengthening the Governance framework and controls During the year under review, several initiatives were undertaken to further strengthen JKH’s governance framework and controls. These include implementing a comprehensive data classification and rights management system, roll-out of the anti-money laundering and anti-corruption policies across JKH and strengthening and streamlining the cybersecurity resilience through device management, user access and data protection to cater to the evolving hybrid cloud environment and digitisation requirements of the Company. While JKH has a strong information technology (IT) governance framework, given the higher incidence of remote working arrangements in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, measures have been taken to further strengthen the IT governance and cybersecurity framework. 30 JOHN KEELLS HOLDINGS PLC | COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS 2019/20 CORPORATE INFORMATION Name of Company Project Risk Assessment Committee Auditors John Keells Holdings PLC S S H Wijayasuriya Chairman Ernst & Young K N J Balendra Chartered Accountants Legal Form J G A Cooray P.O.
