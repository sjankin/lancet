WELCOME TO THE GANNI RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2019 2 MESSAGE FROM OUR FOUNDER 3 “LET ME START OFF BY SAYING, WE DON’T IDENTIFY AS A SUSTAINABLE BRAND, WE NEVER HAVE, AND WE DON’T KNOW IF FASHION CONSUMPTION CAN EVER BE SUSTAINABLE BUT WE GO TO WORK EVERYDAY AND TRY TO DO BETTER.” 4 “WE ARE NOW A 5 PERSON STRONG CSR & RESPONSIBILITY TEAM, WITH AN EMPLOYEE DEDICATED SOLELY TO SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY. THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM ARE THE CHALLENGES WE FACE. THE TOPIC IS STILL SUPER SENSITIVE AND THERE ARE NO CLEAR ANSWERS. FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WE THOUGHT BIODEGRADABLE CARRIER BAGS FROM CORN STARCH WERE THE ANSWER, BUT LATER FOUND OUT THAT THERE ISN’T THE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE SUCH MATERIALS. OR THAT VEGAN LEATHER ALTERNATIVES ARE MOSTLY PU, A TYPE OF PLASTIC WHICH IS NOT A VIABLE SOLUTION MEANING WE NEED TO INVEST IN BIO-BASED ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OFTEN A BYPRODUCT OR WASTE FROM THE FOOD INDUSTRY INSTEAD. WE ARE RELIANT ON CHANGE ON A SYSTEMIC LEVEL, AS WELL AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MATERIALS, RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE AND METHODOLOGY TO ACCURATELY MEASURE SUSTAINABILITY IMPACT AND PROGRESS. 5 WE’RE WORKING TOWARDS OUR END GOAL, TO CREATE AN IMPACT NEUTRAL OR EVEN A POSITIVE COLLECTION WITH OUR GANNI DESIGN DNA THAT DOES MORE GOOD THAN HARM. OVER THE NEXT 3+ YEARS, OUR GAME PLAN IS TO FOCUS ON 44 CLEAR, TANGIBLE AND MEASURABLE GOALS AROUND OUR FOCUS AREAS TO ENSURE EVERY EMPLOYEE AND AREA OF GANNI IS INVESTED IN OUR RESPONSIBILITY EFFORTS. YOU CAN READ MORE DETAILS ON THESE IN THIS REPORT. WE CAN’T BE COMPLACENT AND AS THEY SAY, THE TIME TO ACT IS NOW.” NICOLAJ REFFSTRUP, FOUNDER, GANNI 6 THE GANNI GAMEPLAN 7 2019 : FAST FORWARD TO THE FACTS 8 HERE’S OUR TOP 5 TAKEAWAYS OF WHAT WE MANAGED TO DO BETTER IN 2019. 9 1. SWITCHING TO CERTIFIED FABRICS IN 2019: WE HAVE FOCUSSED ON THREE KEY FABRICS: COTTON, VISCOSE AND POLYESTER AND MANAGED TO INCREASE THE SHARE OF CERTIFIED FABRICS BY 50% IN JUST TWO SEASONS WHEN LOOKING AT OUR TOTAL VOLUME PRODUCED. 10 2. CIRCULARITY: IN 2019 WE LAUNCHED GANNI REPEAT, A RENTAL PLATFORM AND OUR CLOTHING TAKE-BACK SCHEME IN STORES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH I:CO TO MAKE SURE OUR GARMENTS HAVE THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AFTERLIFE. 11 3. PLASTIC WASTE: 2019 MARKED THE FIRST YEAR WE OFFICIALLY REPORTED OUR PLASTIC PRODUCTION AND USAGE. WE PUBLICLY SHARED OUR PROGRESS IN REDUCING OUR PLASTIC CONSUMPTION AND COMMITTED TO ELIMINATE AND IF NOT, INNOVATE AND DESIGN 100% OF OUR PLASTIC PACKAGING TO BE REUSABLE, RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE. 12 4. 2019, A YEAR OF COMMITMENTS: WE BECAME A MEMBER OF THE SUSTAINABLE APPAREL COALITION AND JOINED A UN FASHION CHARTER FOR CLIMATE ACTION TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER COMPANIES ON INDUSTRY-WIDE SOLUTIONS TO FASHION’S BIGGEST CHALLENGES, SUCH AS RISING GHG EMISSIONS. 13 5. SUPPLY CHAIN TRACEABILITY: WAS A HUGE FOCUS FOR US IN 2019. WE LAUNCHED A TRACEABILITY WORKING GROUP WITH THE AIM OF 100% TRACEABILITY IN STAGES 1, 2 AND 3 OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. 14 2019 : A YEAR IN REVIEW 15 SELECT FROM THE SECTIONS BELOW OR SCROLL THROUGH FOR A DEEP DIVE OF WHAT WE ACHIEVED AND GEEK OUT ON THE STATS. 16 PLANET PEOPLE PRODUCT PROSPERITY 17 P PLANET PLANET 19 “THE FASHION INDUSTRY IS A WELL-KNOWN MAJOR PLAYER IN EXTRACTING THE PLANET’S RESOURCES AND RELIES ON 98 MILLION TONNES OF NON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES PER YEAR.” ELLEN MACARTHUR FOUNDATION (2017). A NEW TEXTILES ECONOMY: REDESIGNING FASHION’S FUTURE. 20 OUR PLANET IS UNDER AN INSANE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE. PEOPLE CONTINUE TO EXTRACT AND CONSUME MUCH MORE RESOURCES THAN EARTH CAN REGENERATE. IF THE FASHION INDUSTRY CONTINUES ON THIS CURRENT PATH, BY 2050, TEXTILE PRODUCTION WOULD USE MORE THAN 25% OF THE CARBON BUDGET FOR THE GLOBAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE TO STAY BELOW 2°C. THE FASHION INDUSTRY PRESENTS OVERWHELMING AMOUNTS OF WASTE ISSUES TOO. IN A BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO, MORE THAN 150 MILLION TONNES OF CLOTHING WOULD BE LANDFILLED OR BURNED BY 2050. HUMANITY AND THE PLANET CAN’T ENDURE THIS AMOUNT OF WASTE AND POLLUTION. WE TAKE THE VIEW THAT IT’S OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT GANNI HAS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND WORK TOWARDS MINIMISING HARM WITH REAL-TIME SOLUTIONS. WE’RE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT SO MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MINIMISE OUR IMPACT. OUR GOALS OVER THE NEXT 2-3 YEARS ARE PARAMOUNT, AND SETTING OURSELVES DEADLINES TO MEET THEM ASAP IN LINE WITH UNFCCC. 21 PLANET CONTENTS CO2 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS CO2 GAMEPLAN GOALS PLASTIC 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS PLASTIC GAMEPLAN GOALS WASTE 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS WASTE GAMEPLAN GOALS CO2 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS 1. In 2019, GANNI signed the UN Fashion Charter for Climate Action and committed to 30% reduction of CO2 per kg of clothing by 2023. We are active participants in the Charter’s Raw Material Working Group, which is developing a roadmap for reducing the GHG emissions related to raw material extraction and processing, the most carbon-intensive part of the fashion value chain. 2. We’ve been mapping our full value chain CO2 footprint since 2016, and carbon compensate by supporting UN approved social projects that promote clean energy. To date we have supported the implementation of 6,000 cookstoves across Nepal and Ghana. THE TOTAL ESTIMATED CARBON FOOTPRINT FROM OUR 2019 COLLECTIONS: 8,643 TCO2E IMPORT 6.4% OF CLOTHES 1.5% DISTRIBUTION 80.4% FABRIC 2.5% ADMINISTRATION PRODUCTION 1.9% PACKAGING 7.3% USE PHASE* *Use phase is the wearing and washing of the garment, taking into consideration both the energy consumption from a washing machine and energy for heating water (in the case of hand washing delicate fabrics such as silk and wool). Production of the fabric is by far the largest contributor to the clothing collection’s carbon footprint, and therefore the choice of fabric is of great importance to the overall level of carbon emissions. 3. Comparing 2018 and 2019 Co2 data, our total emissions have increased as a result of higher production volumes in 2019 and CEMAsys using more up to date Life Cycle Assessment data. The new CEMAsys data shows Silk having a much higher emission factor than before. Historically, Silk hasn’t been a priority for us but in light of this new data, it’s a fabric we need to look into. 4. The biggest share of our CO2 footprint still derives from the raw materials used in our production now at 80.4% and our Co2 reduction goals are based on Co2 emissions per kg of clothing produced, not the total emission factors. With the updated data from CEMAsys it will help shape our focuses for 2020 onwards. 25 TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS FROM 2019 FABRIC PRODUCTION 23% COTTON 21% CELLULOSE (VISCOSE, RAYON) 7% WOOL 14% LEATHER 1% METAL, RUBBER, WOOD ELEMENTS 32% 2% SYNTHETIC SILK (POLYESTER, POLYAMIDE) CO2 GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2. 3. 4.

In 2019, we signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment and reported on our plastic production and usage for the first time, you can read it here. We work to eliminate plastic we don’t need; Innovate so all plastics we do need are designed to be reused, recycled or composted; and circulate everything we use to keep it in the economy and out of the environment. We’re proud to share we are progressing ahead of targets, and expect to meet the goals 4 years earlier by 2021. PLASTIC PRODUCTION & USAGE TOTAL % SHARE OF PLASTIC PLASTIC HANGERS FROM WHOLESALE PARTNERS 7% RECYCLED ECOMM SHIPPING BAG 7% 53% RECYCLABLE POLYBAGS 17% OTHER (MIXED PLASTIC PACKAGING) 16% BIODEGRADABLE *Other mixed plastic packaging include: polly pockets, tape, bubble wrap, RETAIL CARRIER BAGS spare button plastic bag packaging, production samples packaging, poly strap, handtag string, cellophane cardboard protection, staff order packaging, small wholesale order packaging 2. In line with the commitment, we have removed 6 types of problematic or unnecessary plastic packaging for the business that account for 3.38% of all our plastics. 3. We have switched our e-commerce shipping bag to a postconsumer recycled & recyclable plastic bags, and our retail carrier bags to biodegradable and compostable. Together the packaging accounts for 24% share of all GANNI plastic packaging. 4. We introduced reusable packaging solution Re-Pack to European customers on GANNI.COM. Over a 6 month trial period 21% of EU online orders were shipped in a Re-pack, saving 2,178 Tco2 of emissions and elimating 363 kg of paper and plastic waste. 30 PLASTIC GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2. 3. 4.

It is a massive issue for all industries involved in plastic production and usage. So we’re committed to searching for the most relevant data on the market and collaborating on research through the NPEC Commitment. 31 WASTE 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS 1. In 2019, GANNI has continued to actively work with a variety of upcycling projects, mainly through GANNI KIOSK, our pop-up concept created alongside Copenhagen Fashion Week. Before unsold stock is sent to SOEX there will be multiple activities to upcycle deadstock* into new collections where possible. 2. Since 2018, we’ve partnered with SOEX in Germany to re-sell any unsold GANNI stock into markets where GANNI is not traded. We formed the partnership to ensure our deadstock* is handled in the most environmentally-friendly way possible. SOEX gives clothes a new life via reselling as a first port of call. If unsuccessful in re-sell, the products are recycled into new fibres to create products like microfibre cloths. SOEX is working on solutions to recycle materials into new fibres that can go back into the fashion loop, promoting a more circular economy. In 2019, GANNI shipped just shy of 2,000kg to SOEX. THE 2019 DOUBLE LOVE GANNI KIOSK HAS IN TOTAL FEATURED 355 UPCYCLED GARMENTS AND ACCESSORIES. IN ADDITION, KIOSK FEATURED 200 RUGS MADE FROM UPCYCLED DEADSTOCK FABRICS.

WE WANT TO SET THE BAR HIGH TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE SO WE CAN DEMAND BETTER FROM EVERYONE WE PARTNER WITH. A KEY FOCUS IS HOW OUR POLICIES TRANSLATE FURTHER DOWN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. RIGHT NOW WE WORK WITH LONG, COMPLEX SUPPLY CHAINS THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE EXTREMELY OPAQUE. SO OUR FIRST STEP FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IS FULL VISIBILITY OF THE SUPPLY CHAINS WE ARE DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY INVOLVED IN. 40 “IT’S FRUSTRATING AND SOMETIMES EVEN SCARY THAT WE DO NOT CONTROL OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IN ITS ENTIRETY BUT IT DOESN’T MEAN WE’RE NOT MOTIVATED NOR DETERMINED TO CHANGE THINGS FOR THE BETTER.” NICOLAJ REFFSTRUP, FOUNDER, GANNI 41 WITH OUR TRACEABILITY COMMITMENT WE ARE LOOKING AT 3 STAGES OF VISIBILITY IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN: STAGE 1 GARMENT MANUFACTURING: STITCHING, ASSEMBLY & KNITTING UNITS STAGE 2 HANDLING UNITS, DRYERS, PRINTERS, LAUNDRY, TANNERIES STAGE 3 FABRIC MILLS & YARN MILLS 42 PEOPLE CONTENTS CULTURE 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS CULTURE GAMEPLAN GOALS FEMALE EMPOWERMENT 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS FEMALE EMPOWERMENT GAMEPLAN GOALS ACCOUNTABILITY 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS ACCOUNTABILITY GAMEPLAN GOALS CULTURE 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS 1. In 2019, we started a Responsibility Ambassadors programme in our offices in London, Copenhagen and New York. Thanks to the Ambassadors we’ve rolled out 10+ initiatives in our offices, like introducing Re-Pack reusable packaging for all staff orders in Copenhagen. Our New York team volunteered at the Elizabeth Street Garden in SoHo, and all teams participated in the Global Climate Strikes across London, New York and Copenhagen. 2. In 2019, we donated 100% of proceeds from t-shirts sold at our pop-up GANNI Kiosk and at GANNI.com during Copenhagen Fashion Week 2019 to Conservation International. The amount donated equaled 196.610 DKK. 44 CULTURE GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2. 3. 4.

In October 2019, we visited 3 of our key suppliers in China. During the visit we wanted to understand their point of view on Social and Labour policies, third-party certifications that address social issues and their personal opinion on how we should engage on social responsibility with suppliers in the garment industry. The trip showed us that to truly embed positive change we need to work together and have clear concrete goals and on-the-ground solutions. 3. Garment manufacturers and suppliers often receive Codes of Conducts from brands they work with. One of the outcomes of speaking more with our suppliers around social responsibility showed that a lot of brands send similar Codes of Conduct that are often vague and super text heavy. As a result, we have now simplified our Code of Conduct highlighting our key messages and all Stage 1 suppliers (Agents, Manufacturers) have signed. 49 ACCOUNTABILITY GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2. 3.

In line with the GFA Circularity Commitment, we have started to work on implementing circular design principles into design briefs. We recognize the importance of properly equipping our employees with the right information and tools for Circular design. So, in 2019 GANNI partnered with Circular.Fashion, to roll out a Circular Design workshop for our design, sourcing and technical teams taking place in 2020. DESIGN GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2. 3.

In 2019, we have made a decision to accelerate the transition to more responsible, certified fabrics in our collection. By focusing on the 3 key fabrics in our collection: cotton, viscose and polyester, which accounted for 56% of our collections, we’ve been able to dramatically increase the volume of garments with a sustainable element*. Our collections are designed at least six months in advance, so a lot of the work we did in switching to more responsible materials in 2019, will be reflected in our 2020 collections. *Sustainable element is defined as at least 50% of the main material composition certified. COTTON VISCOSE POLYESTER PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY % SHARE OF TOTAL ORDER VOLUME PRE-SPRING 20 4% SPRING SUMMER 20 36% PRE-FALL 20 50% 2. We have created a GANNI Fabric Score, an internal sourcing guideline for our teams and introduced the following certified fabrics into our collections: GOTS ORGANIC Organic cotton certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard has proven a lower environmental impact, reducing water COTTON usage, greenhouse gas emissions, restricts the amount of chemicals used and ensures the workers rights are protected throughout the supply chain. GRS CERTIFIED Using recycled polyester reduces dependence on petroleum as a raw material and can divert plastic from ending in RECYCLED POLYESTER landfills. The Global Recycled Standard certification ensures a restricted use of chemicals and residues throughout the whole production process and ensures high social standards GRS CERTIFIED Using recycled cotton significantly lowers the environmental impact of the fabric, especially decreasing the water usage RECYCLED COTTON throughout the production process compared to virgin cotton. The Global Recycled Standard certification ensures a restricted use of chemicals and residues throughout the whole production process and ensures high social standards. continued. LENZING™ TENCEL™ Lenzing™ Tencel™ fibers are derived from responsible wood and pulp, from certified and controlled wood sources with a closed loop production process, which recycles water and reuses over 99% of the solvent. LENZING™ ECOVERO™ Lenzing™ EcoVero™ fibers are derived from responsible wood and pulp, from certified and controlled wood sources with a manufacturing that generates up to 50% lower emissions and water impact compared to generic viscose. RECYCLED WOOL Using recycled wool reduces waste, air and soil pollution and generates over 50% lower CO2 emissions compared to virgin wool. RECYCLED RUBBER Recycled rubber is repurposed from pre-consumer rubber waste, such as cut off’s and scraps from facilities production, that would otherwise be waste and go to landfill or be incinerated. RECYCLED LEATHER Recycled leather is repurposed from pre-consumer recycled leather, generated during the manufacturing process and is mostly made out of off-cut and wastage from leather items production. 3. Our focus area in the past year has been material innovation to try and crack embedding more innovative fabrics into our collections. To help us find pioneering fabrics and materials on the market we have launched a Fabrics of the Future initiative, where our Responsibility and Sourcing teams can explore new research and devlopments and drive forward possible innovations and try and scale them commercially. The Responsibility team is always presenting the more weird and wonderful innovations like a parasite Funghi that has the potential to behave like Leather, and the Sourcing team play a crucial role in bringing them down to earth on what’s realistic. 63 IN 2019, WE INTRODUCED: 7 MORE RESPONSIBLE FABRIC TYPES INCLUDING RECYCLED LEATHER, RECYCLED WOOL AND LENZING ECOVERO.

Cemasys. (2019). GANNI Carbon Footprint: 2018 Collection. Leather is a material made from the skin of an animal by tanning or a similar process. Virgin means it has not been previously used or consumed. For GANNI, purchasing virgin leather increases the demand for animal breeding, which has a high environmental impact due to greenhouse gas emissions from animal husbandry and deforestation to clear land for raising cattle. 65 CIRCULARITY 2019 ACHIEVEMENTS 1. We have partnered with I:CO, a global solutions provider and innovator for collection, reuse and recycling of used clothing and shoes, to introduce our take-back scheme in-store at 3 of our retail locations in Denmark and the UK, with plans to expand the take-back scheme to 6 more stores in 2020. Once sorted, 60% of garments and textiles are resold, 35% is open-loop recycled into building and car insulation. The remaining textile waste with no resell or recycling value is burned and transformed into energy. 2. Any money generated from the reselling of garments as part of the take-back scheme is directly invested into a innovation project that I:CO is working on, which supports the development of garment to garment recycling. 3. In 2019, we launched our rental platform GANNI REPEAT, our next step in helping extend the life cycle and longevity of our clothes. GANNI REPEAT aim is to help rethink and change consumer behaviour, working to ultimately reduce production excess. We wanted to offer a new business model that was not for profit to drive circular production and consumption. The sharing economy has many sustainability benefits, however we recognize some environmental concerns still need to be addressed, from the shipping and packaging to the dry cleaning of the rented garments. Right now, we’re working with a research body to assess the environmental impact of the rental and find suitable solutions to reduce it. 68 CIRCULARITY GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2. 3. 4.

In late 2019, we realised that we need to start measuring and evaluating the impact of changing various aspects of our business to work in a more responsible way. This was from a financial perspective but also in how our GANNI community perceives these changes. Our responsibility journey is not seamless, we will come up against challenges, hurdles and maybe not always make the best decisions even though we have the best intentions. 2.

Invest looks to address the fact that we as an SME are extremely reliant on technological advances, innovations and sometimes larger brands to pave the way. One challenge we have noticed is that there are some really cool material innovations on the market but these are often start-ups that need financial backing to scale up. 2. In 2019, we decided that our financial prosperity could put us in a position to help these companies a little. Invest is about looking at our annual spend on Responsibility initiatives and investing in some innovation projects that support a more responsible industry. 80 INVEST GAMEPLAN GOALS 1. 2.
