Continuous dialogue with the parties is crucial to achieving sustainable results. SEK’s stakeholders comprise the Swedish government, exporters, investors, banks, Team Sweden, employees and stakeholder organizations. Mutual stakeholder dialogue within Team Sweden Efforts to promote Swedish exports are conducted in collaboration with a number of other organizations. In 2019, SEK entered into a collaboration with Business Sweden, EKN and Swedfund to develop our initiatives to combat corruption in international transactions. The collaboration has been part of the framework for SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies. Within the framework of this partnership, a mutual stakeholder dialogue was conducted. Read more about SEK’s Stakeholder engagement in sustainability note 2. Focus 2019: Anti-corruption Since 2017, SEK has expanded its stakeholder engagement on various material sustainability areas. For 2017 it was human rights, and for 2018 it was climate and the environment. For 2019, it was a focus on anti-corruption. Voices from the stakeholder dialogue Ulrik Åshuvud and Lotta Rydström, Transparency International ”Team Sweden has a particular responsibility to set clear requirements for the companies that it works with and finances. Team Sweden must ask the necessary questions, regardless of how detailed and sometimes tricky they may be, to make the companies aware of the risks and what measures need to be taken to address them.” SEK Annual Report 2019  11 Client-centric strategy SEK’s strategy is client-centric and is based on the mission, macro-economic factors, stakeholders and the core values that guide our operations. Strategy SEK has a key role in strengthening Sweden’s export industry and contributing to increased growth and employment in Sweden. A big part of this increase is expected to come from medium-sized enterprises. Therefore, SEK’s growth ambitions have focused on reaching more clients in the medium-sized company segment. SEK will broaden the scope of business relationships with existing customers and attract new customers. Conditions will be created for more effective processing and servicing models through modernization and digitalization, creating profitability in transactions even if they are smaller. Increased collaboration with local banks, proactivity and marketing aimed at selected target groups will be a priority for creating new business opportunities. Dialogue with clients is key to understanding their needs and challenges. Partnerships have been deepened and today, business development is often conducted in collaboration with the clients. The transition to a fossil-free society is a global challenge. SEK aims to be a positive force for this drive and financing industry’s investments for Sweden’s transition is part of SEK’s strategy. The transition requires financing of large energy projects, climate-smart transportation, sustainable urban development, research facilities and fossil-frugal production. Swedish companies and Swedish environmental The transition to a fossiltechnology are already global leaders in several areas and free society is a global contribute to positive climate impact. challenge. SEK aims to be a positive force for this drive. Core values Together, SEK’s employees have prepared a set of core values that guide us in our work. This is based on employees in their various occupational roles endeavoring to be solution-oriented and professional, and cooperating to achieve results. SEK’s core values are a prerequisite for succeeding with the strategy. 12 SEK Annual Report 2019 Partners and collaboration A large part of SEK’s transactions derive from collaboration with banks throughout the world. Collaboration with Swedish and international banks, development banks, Almi, Business Sweden and the EKN is crucial to accomplishing the strategy. With the purpose of increasing Swedish deliveries to international infrastructure projects, in particular in developing countries, a collaborative initiative has been prepared within the framework for Team Sweden where EKN, Business Sweden, Swedfund and SEK are included. The initiative aims to forge relationships with international construction companies, also known as EPC companies (Engineering, Procurement & Construction), and offer financing to allow these companies to purchase Swedish goods and services for their projects. SEK is establishing relationships with EPC companies that set high requirements for sustainability and follow international guidelines. Procurements with high sustainability requirements benefit Swedish exporters’ competitiveness in general, since they are highly innovative and offer sustainable solutions. Strategy • Deepening relationships with existing clients • Attracting new clients • Create new business opportunities through partners and collaborations • Modernizing and digitalizing • Efficient and client-driven processes Sustainability strategy • Client offering with a sustainability focus • Borrowing linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals • Corporate culture, where employees feel included, are motivated and assume responsibility. SEK Annual Report 2019  13 Targets and outcomes SEK’s strategy is to attract new clients and to deepen relationships with existing clients through digitalization, collaboration and client-driven processes.

These were communicated at the 2015 annual general meeting and do not have any time limit. 5 According to the capital target, SEK’s total capital ratio is to exceed the Swedish FSA’s capital adequacy requirement by 2 to 4 percentage points. ­ The capital targets are decided annually by the annual general meeting and are valid until further notice. Comments on target attainment SEK exceeded the financial targets for 2019. The company ended the year with a return on equity of 5.5 percent, significantly above both the 2019 target of 3.9 percent and the previous year’s result of 3.6 percent. A very good financial result. In addition to the financial goals, the company set ambitious business goals for 2019. The company had decided to increase its customer base by 42 percent but did not reach all the way. The year ended with an expansion of the customer base of 20 percent, far from the ambitious target, but the largest expansion of the customer base ever. The target level for 2020 for the expansion of the customer base has been increased further in accordance with the strategy of attracting new clients by way of new offerings and structured client processing. The ambition to reach more clients with SEK’s green offerings have proved fruitful and we almost reached our target. By 2020, the company’s increased the ambition level significantly towards the goal of being a positive force in the transition. The green loans have a direct link to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The long-term financial targets are established by the owner and are to be viewed over a longer horizon. The employee survey reveal a positive shift to a sustainable workplace, even if there is some way to go in achieving the company’s ambitious targets. 14 SEK Annual Report 2019 Follow-up of the public policy assignment SEK’s administration of the official supported export credit system (CIRR system) is a specially commissioned public policy assignment by the Swedish parliament. The benefit to the national economy of this mission should be evaluated partly by measurement of the added value that SEK creates in terms of export credits (of which CIRRs comprise a part) and partly through the stakeholder dialogue. The stakeholder dialogue is presented in sustainability note 2. SEK follows up the public policy assignment using a biennial client survey. Below is parts of the results from the most recent survey that was conducted in 2018. 1. “Have SEK’s export credits helped execute clients’ export transactions?” 73 percent of clients who had engaged SEK’s services for export credits stated that SEK’s credits had contributed significantly or very significantly to the execution of their export transactions. This can be compared with 63 percent in the preceding survey. 2. “The reason why the exporters decided to collaborate with SEK” The responses are shown as open replies, in which the clients say, for example, that SEK has excellent understanding of business and that they want to partake of SEK’s competence. Other reasons stated are access to CIRR and that SEK is a bargaining tool for sales. 3. “Did the collaboration match the client’s expectations?” 66 percent of clients stated that the collaboration exceeded their expectations. 28 percent responded that the collaboration significantly exceeded their expectations. The corresponding figures for the 2016 client survey were 73 and 18 percent, respectively. 4. “How SEK can further improve its offering of export credits” Approximately two thirds of the clients considered SEK as proactive, but that it had improvement potential in this respect and scope to increase its proactivity. 5.“How the clients perceived the Swedish export credit system compared with corresponding systems in key competing countries” 73 percent of the client companies consider the Swedish export credit system to be better than the systems in key competitor countries. The corresponding figure for 2016 was 87 percent. SEK Annual Report 2019  15 Value creation and business model at SEK SEK’s mission, core values and strategy are the basis for its operations.

SEK’s general business model is to hold financial instruments measured at fair value to maturity. The net fair value changes that occur, mainly relate to changes in credit spreads on SEK’s own debt, which due to IFRS 9, are reported in other comprehensive income from 2018 compared to net results of financial transactions prior to IFRS 9, and basis spreads, which are recognized in net results of financial transactions. The changes could be significant in a single reporting period, but will not affect earnings over time since the lifetime cumulative changes in the instrument’s market value will be zero if it is held to maturity and is a performing instrument. When financial instruments are not held to maturity, realized gains and losses can occur, for example when SEK repurchases its own debt, or if lending is repaid early and the related hedging instruments are terminated prematurely. These are effects presented under “Derecognition of financial instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss”, “Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” and “Financial instruments under fair-value hedge accounting”. “Financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss” and “Financial instruments under fair-value hedge accounting” include realized as well as unrealized changes in fair value.

The structures are represented both in the security and the derivative hedging the bond. The sensitivity analysis is based on a shift in the interval for correlation between 0.1 and –0.1. The correlation is expressed as a value between 1 and –1, where 0 indicates no relationship, 1 indicates maximum positive relationship and -1 indicates maximum negative relationship. The maximum correlation in the range of unobservable inputs can thus be from 1 to –1. The table presents the scenario analysis of the effect on Level 3-instruments, with maximum positive and negative changes. 2 Of the total impact on total comprehensive income, the sensitivity effect of SEK’s own credit spread was Skr 174 million (year-end 2018: Skr 242 million) under a maximum scenario and Skr -173 million (year-end 2018: Skr -240 million) under a minimum scenario.

The ISDA Master Netting Agreements are complemented by supplementary agreements providing for the collateralization of counterparty exposure. SEK receives and accepts collateral in the form of cash.
