Stakeholders Dear Readers, For a better, a more sustainable world, we need visions that inspire people and guide them. We need a wide range of perspectives on how we can make these visions a reality. And we need solutions that help us get a little bit closer to our goals every day in the here and now. The year 2019 was a year of change for Continental and the entire mobility industry. The automotive industry and other sectors have initiated huge transformations in which sustainability plays an ever greater role. The future of mobility is now firmly linked to sustainability. Our goal is a healthy ecosystem for mobility in a comprehensive sense. For this reason, Continental 2019 has re-established its sustainability strategy and adapted it to these transformations. We are convinced: If you want the mobility of the future, you need Continental! The focus of the sustainability strategy is on the four strategic focus areas – Climate Protection, Clean Mobility, Circular Economy, and Sustainable Supply Chains. They are associated with major challenges for Continental, but also with great opportunities. And they stand for the fact that we want to set a clear example. When it comes to Climate Protection, for example, we as the Executive Board have defined a trajectory toward carbon neutrality. By the year 2050, we want to achieve carbon neutrality in our entire value chain, i.e. from purchasing the raw materials to the use of our products. By the end of 2020, we will already switch to the purchase of “green” electricity for our production worldwide, and will make our own business activities carbon-neutral by 2040. For us, a convincing sustainability strategy is part of a joint learning process with employees, customers, investors, suppliers, politicians, civil society, and within the industry to discuss the key challenges in a transparent manner, to look for the right ways and to develop new markets. We are thus relying on our four corporate values – Trust, Passion To Win, Freedom To Act, For One Another. We are delighted to take you on this journey. And we are looking forward to your comments or questions. I would now like to offer you exciting and informative reading on behalf of the entire Executive Board and all employees.
