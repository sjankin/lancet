CVM 5 STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Statement from the Board of Directors Paula Amorim Chairman of the Board of Directors During periods of profound transformation, the success of any company’s ambition will depend on maintaining the trust of all its stakeholders. At Galp, we are encouraged to continue innovating and developing our businesses sustainably, in a disciplined and responsible way, giving the best of us for a better society. This is part of our culture, and a fundamental reason for the results and trustworthiness received over the last decades, as well as a fundamental pillar to our future success. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our people, but also to the support from our suppliers, investors and customers, we exceeded our goals for 2019. The performance was robust both at the operational and financial levels, during a challenging and volatile year. We delivered growth. We created value. And the capital markets continued to recognise this through our share performance. On top of execution, during the year we focused on our strategy and on how to position Galp for the future of the sector. Energy will be produced from different sources and will be delivered and used by our customers in different ways. This will challenge us and our businesses will need to be agile and prepared to adapt to new regulatory, technological, environmental or social perspectives. Galp will seek the right opportunities to create value along this transition. Environmental, social and governance matters are crucial to the development and success of our business. And we understand that our responsibilities go beyond providing energy to people. 6 STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS We engage with our communities, take care of our people, while Therefore, over the next few years, our ambition is to balance being financially competitive and delivering value, as we have selective investments for growth with a progressive dividend been able to in the past. Galp has been recurrently regarded by policy, supported on the confidence in the Company’s cash the capital markets and investors for its transparency, generation trajectory. execution and discipline.

With a relevant presence across the energy value chain, and with a strong customer base I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuous in Iberia, we see the power generation from renewable sources support and trust as we move forward on this journey. I would as a step to better fulfil our customer needs. This allied with our also like to express a word of appreciation to our partners for existing portfolio is the basis for the sustainable and profitable working with us to shape a more sustainable future, and to growth cycle that we see ahead of us. Galp’s team for their outstanding dedication and commitment. In this context, we are happy with the recent addition of several high-quality solar projects located in Iberia. This will allow Galp to become the largest regional solar energy player and will create the basis for the Company’s future developments. The Company should also take advantage of the transformational scenario to adapt its businesses. We will not only increase our productivity and efficiency, but also develop new products and services, supported by digitalisation and Paula Amorim technology, fostering innovation and being creative. Chairman of the Board of Directors Galp is also reorganising its businesses to better respond to the challenges of the sector, as an integrated energy Company, aiming to be closer to our clients and to be better prepared to develop both its renewables and new businesses that will be a relevant part of the Galp of the future. It is also in this context that the Board of Directors elected in the last Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting (AGM) has been reinforced in terms of diversity of gender, background and expertise. We are convinced that the Company is well prepared to address the current market volatility and the challenges related with the COVID-19 outbreak, and confident on its capability to continue following a sustainable strategy with an increasing focus on capital discipline, project selection and on the continuous application of industry best practices. 7 STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Carlos Gomes da Silva CEO Dear Stakeholders, It is with pleasure that I look back to a year full of opportunities and achievements across the energy value chain. 2019 was again a year marked by commodity prices volatility. This resulted in lower oil and gas prices and a weak refining environment. Furthermore, the sector saw the market evolving towards a growing push into a corporate transparency, awareness and accountability on key environmental, social and governance matters. Galp responded to these challenges by delivering a strong operational and financial performance, together with renewed ambitions. The Company’s strategy has its basis in our integrated energy profile, focused on capturing value from the development of our cash generative, competitive and resilient portfolio, on a strong capital discipline and increased shareholder distributions. Galp is aware of its role in the energy transition. Our priority is to make sure we perform our activities responsibly and efficiently. Over 40% of our long-term investments are aimed at capturing opportunities within the energy transition context. This includes increasing the weight of natural gas in our production mix, developing a competitive renewable power generation business and looking into new businesses which could add value to our current activities, aligned with new trends and the transition to a lower carbon economy. As owners of a competitive upstream portfolio which will sustain our next growth cycle, it is our priority to develop it sustainably. We also reiterate our commitment to improve and increase the competitiveness and flexibility of our downstream operations. In the end everything we do has our final clients in mind. We are making every effort to deliver an attractive integrated offer and improve the customer experience at home, on the road, everywhere and anytime. 8 STATEMENT FROM THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS In 2019, we exceeded our goals. This is reflected in the increase Commercialisation is at the heart of our story, and its in oil and natural gas production, but also in the solid contribution to results has been consistent and robust.

OUR BRAND Today is a good day to change Galp’s success relies heavily on the level of appeal the brand can generate for the audiences that are most relevant to its activities.

HOW WE PLAN THE FUTURE We live in a complex world, marked by enormous challenges, particularly in the energy sector. Climate change and technological innovation has led to a very dynamic and diverse regulatory environment. The way in which these factors develop and relate to each other will be decisive for the evolution of consumption profiles and the resulting change in the energy mix in each geography. Willing to be part of the solution to many of these challenges, we seek to ensure the resilience of our strategy to different credible futures.

HOW WE PLAN THE FUTURE leaders are unable to reach a new consensus on environmental policy. After a sense of failure and impotence, a new generation of politicians promoted adaptation instead of mitigation and the sense of urgency regarding climate issues faded away. Emerging economies continue to insist on their own right to foster growth by harnessing cheap and abundant energy sources, while developed countries implemented protectionist measures and sets limits on migration flows to fight long-term unemployment and social instability. World demand for energy continues to be based on conventional technologies and fossil resources, and energy intensity has not been significantly reduced. Air pollution is one of the major problems facing large urban centres, but there have been no structural changes that would allow for a substantial reduction in emissions. Restrictions on city traffic abound, not only for environmental reasons but also to avoid congestion, and the lack of investment in the public transport network leads to the spread of private shared-mobility solutions. Limited solutions for EV charging and long hours in traffic jams have also hindered electric mobility growth, with NGV becoming the best option to avert urban pollution. Several nations with unconventional oil and gas resources have created strong local industries, making it difficult to make a political decision to eliminate fossil sources. Due to the lack of technological development and inadequate policies, renewable energies cannot become truly competitive and remain a niche solution in developed countries.

Natural gas resources accounted for 51% of the total 2C resources. 44 3 STRATEGIC EXECUTION 3.2. EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION 2019 production overview During 2019, the average WI production reached 122 kboepd, up 14% YoY, reflecting the higher contribution from the projects under development in Brazil and Angola. Oil accounts for most of Galp’s production, with natural gas representing 11% in 2019, all of which currently attributable to the associated gas from the Brazilian projects. Gas weight is expected to increase when the Area 4 projects in Mozambique come onstream. In Brazil, WI production was 108 kboepd, a 9% increase YoY, supported by the Lula and Iracema projects, namely benefiting from the ramp-up of FPSO #8, which reached the production plateau just 10 months after the first oil with the connection of the 6th producer well, and FPSO #9 which started operations in February. It is also important to highlight the first oil of FPSO #10 in November, starting the development of the Berbigão and Sururu accumulations, which will be an important contributor to the expected production growth in 2020. The remaining units operating in Brazil produced steadily throughout the year, with maintenance activities being performed according to plan, including compulsory inspections to ensure the integrity of the units and their operations under optimal conditions. The competitiveness of Galp’s portfolio is supported by a large resource base, low production costs, and commercial potential, In Angola, WI production was c.14 kbpd, up 65% YoY, as the with its high quality and low sulphur content positioning these first unit deployed in the north of block 32 continued to rampresources well for the energy transition.

EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION Galp’s E&P portfolio Galp has 45 upstream projects at different stages of maturity, from exploration to development phases, located almost entirely in deepwater. The most significant projects include the development of one of the largest oil discoveries in recent decades, located in the Brazilian pre-salt Santos basin, and the large natural gas discoveries in Mozambique’s Rovuma basin, as well as the developments in the Angola’s Lower Congo basin. Brazil Offshore developments Galp’s portfolio offshore Brazil is mostly focused on the presalt polygon, where the Company has been present since the exploration and appraisal of the first prospects. The Brazilian pre-salt plays are a benchmark in the industry, mostly due to the size and quality of its resources which, together with the technology deployed in its development concepts, position these projects amongst the most competitive projects globally. At present, Galp has several projects at both the exploration and appraisal stage and at the development and production phase in the pre-salt Santos and Campos basins. 46 3 STRATEGIC EXECUTION 3.2. EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION A typical pre-salt project development Galp started production in the pre-salt in 2010, through the FPSO Cidade Angra dos Reis located in the Lula pilot area and, by the end of 2019, it had deployed a total of 10 FPSO units, seven in Lula, two in Iracema and one in the Berbigão-Sururu West area. 47 3 STRATEGIC EXECUTION 3.2.

THE PACE OF SOCIETY EVOLUTION There is currently emerging the double challenge of delivering The great challenge for society as a whole is to find fair and more energy to a growing society while reducing greenhouse global transition mechanisms and platforms, focusing on the gas emissions, using technology as one of the drivers of this principles of technological diversity, with an emphasis on the change the energy transition. This transition brings the proportionality of internalising carbon cost and transparency, inclusion of climate variables in business models and decisionbased on the development of market mechanisms that promote making at the top of the global and Organisations’ agenda. the most efficient and competitive solutions for each case. The international sustainable development context steers organisations towards alignment with the Sustainable Development Agenda (SDA) and the Paris Agreement. The SDA aims to reconcile prosperity with the protection of the planet, acknowledging that sustainable development requires the simultaneous pursuit of economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection. The Paris Agreement, the global agreement for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, establishes the objective of keeping the global temperature increase well below 2ºC, compared to the pre-industrial period, and seeks to motivate the development of long-term visions that translate into risks and opportunities for business models. 84 5 THE JOURNEY TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 5.2. OUR PURPOSE 5.2. OUR PURPOSE Our value proposition Galp has the ambition to contribute to internationally established sustainability benchmarks and principles, being Based on the challenges outlined above, our purpose is to committed to an ethical and responsible performance, focused develop profitable and more sustainable businesses, creating essentially on four pillars, which are incorporated into our long-term value for our stakeholders. strategy: • Gradually reducing our carbon intensity; • Place People at the centre with a common purpose; • Reduce our ecological footprint; and • Develop a conscious business. 85 5 THE JOURNEY TO A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 5.2. OUR PURPOSE Management's commitment We incorporate the principles of sustainability into the Organisation’s management process, starting with the governance model. The objective of our governance model is to promote a decision-making culture based on the assessment of risks and opportunities and on an integrated management approach that considers the entire life cycle of operations.
