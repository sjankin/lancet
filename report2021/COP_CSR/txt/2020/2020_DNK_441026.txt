Our game-changing solutions are dedicated to optimizing the construction and management of our clients’ well stock, from well completion design and construction to the intervention services required to ensure performance and integrity. We address the factors that maximize value creation, continuously innovating to reduce well construction time, speed up access to the hydrocarbons and reduce the capital expenditure compared to more conventional methods. This results in maximized hydrocarbon production and increased total recovery while minimizing operating downtime. It’s Welltec’s philosophy to challenge existing conventions and think laterally in order to develop products and services which increase oil and gas recovery while improving the sustainable, economic, environmental and safety aspects of our industry. In practice we develop, test and manufacture stateof-the-art technology to enhance the production and recovery rates for our clients, thereby improving their profitability through a longer term revenue stream, while at the same time improving upon health, safety and environmental attributes. In an industry challenged by low oil prices, our Flex-Well® design provides new perspective to drilling and completing wells, adopting a holistic approach which adds value continuously over the life-cycle of the well. From reducing geological uncertainty, accelerating first production, minimizing CAPEX, reducing costs and simplifying P&A our approach can boost cash flow now and over the life of the well. Our value proposition is compelling; our technology enables clients to unlock more production from their assets and to address reservoir complexities and uncertainties with a greater number of options, which are cleaner, safer and more sustainable.

Welltec ® ANNUAL REPORT 2019 / MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY 7 OUTLOOK The outlook for the future will be negatively affected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the measures taken by governments in most of the world to mitigate the impacts of the outbreak, see also note 25. Events after the balance sheet date. Even before the COVID-19 outbreak, 2020 was expected to be another challenging year for the industry as the volatile oil price environment continues to impact both operators and services companies. As we enter into 2020 the global supply of oil continues to outpace demand, which combined with complex geopolitical topics continue to fuel volatility and uncertainty across markets. This has been further fuelled by the COVID-19 outbreak. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, revenue was expected to be close to USD 300 million with an EBITDA margin around 40%. Many of Welltec’s customers have indicated that they will continue operations and projects in progress, but there is still a risk that revenue and earnings will decline as a consequence of COVID-19. Management is monitoring developments closely. It is, however, too early to give an opinion about to which extent COVID-19 will impact revenue and earnings in 2020. Management does, however, expect a negative impact on the outlook for the year. Naturally, Management will continue to monitor the revenue development closely and continuously, and will take the necessary actions to uphold and maintain industry leading margin levels.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 23.2.2 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following tables detail the Parent and the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in DKK, INR, NOK, AED and NGN against the relevant foreign currencies. The percentage used is the sensitivity rate and is representing Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the Group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity where the currency strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the currency against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative: PARENT Currency Currency Currency DKK impact INR impact AED impact 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 USD in thousands Profit/(loss) (275) 267 339 465 (207) Equity 1,342 1,317 1,054 GROUP Currency Currency Currency DKK impact NGN impact NOK impact 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 USD in thousands Profit/(loss) (275) 267 1,262 2,099 260 Equity 22 59 295 Welltec ® ANNUAL REPORT 2019 / FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / PARENT COMPANY & CONSOLIDATED GROUP 72 23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 23.2.3 Interest rate risk management From the beginning of 2012 the Group’s interest rate risk relates to the Group’s interest bearing debt to bondholders. The interest is fixed at an effective rate of 8.5%. In November 2017 the interest bearing debt was refinanced with a new bond loan. The interest is fixed at an effective rate at 9,75% As the interest rate is fixed the Group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments. Thus any changes in fair value are recognized directly in statement of comprehensive income as financial income or financial expenses. 23.2.4 Interest rate sensitivity analysis A 250 basis point increase or decrease represents Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 250 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s: profit for the year and equity as of 31 December 2019 would be affected with USD 850 thousand (2018: 850 thousand). 23.3 Liquidity risk management It is the Group’s policy that capital raising and distribution of cash are managed centrally by the Group’s finance department to the extent it is deemed appropriate. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. The Group is adjusting centrally the cash outflow in investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in Denmark. For general corporate and working capital purpose the Group holds a USD 40 million Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). The RCF contains reqiurements for mandatory prepayments upon certain events, also the RCF contains financial covenant. Please see note 19.2. Maturity dates for financial liabilities.

EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE The implications of COVID-19 with many governments across the world deciding to ”close down their countries” will have great impact on the global economy. Management considers the implications of COVID-19 a subsequent event occurred after the balance sheet date (31 December 2019), which is therefore a non-adjusting event for Welltec. In consequence, the impairment test made by Management at 31 December 2019 is based on the future cash flows expected by Management at 31 December 2019, which may differ from the cash flows expected by Management at the time of adoption of the Annual Report, see comments in outlook for the future in Management’s Review. To date, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in decreased demand for oil which together with a disagreement between OPEC, Russia and USA on adjusting the supply for oil has led to significantly lower oil prices. However, many of Welltec’s customers have indicated that they will continue operations and projects in progress, but there is still a risk that revenue and earnings will decline as a consequence of COVID-19. Covid-19 has impacted the Group’s ability to move field personnel from country to country due to the travel restrictions, which can impact the ability to take on certain jobs. Furthermore, shipment of tools and spare parts has also been affected as air cargo capacity has been significantly reduced. To ensure that Production, D&E and other departments can operate at an adequate production capacity, certain precautions has been implemented to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 infection in the production. A few suppliers from Italy are closed, but alternative suppliers have been introduced. Although Welltec with the listed precaution is able to still operate and demand for services is still considered at a relatively satisfying level, COVID-19 is still expected to have a negative impact on the Welltec’s revenue and earnings in 2020. Management is monitoring developments closely. It is, however, too early to give an opinion about to which extent COVID-19 will impact revenue and earnings in 2020. Naturally, Management will continue to monitor the revenue development closely and continuously, and will take the necessary actions to uphold and maintain industry leading margin levels. At 31 December 2019 cash and cash equivalents amounted to USD 30 million. Furthermore, a RCF of USD 40 million is available given that certain financial covenants are met. At 31 December 2019 USD 5 million has been drawn, and USD 9 million is reserved to warranties.
