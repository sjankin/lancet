Important stakeholder groups include customers, influencers, employees and management, suppliers, NGOs, our owner and society. An employee engagement survey pilot was carried out in 2018 and then rolled out in 2019, helping us get regular and structured input from our employees. Both management and employees were given a survey in 2017 where they were asked to rank the most relevant sustainability areas for themselves and Daniel Wellington. The results included being a fair employer, focusing on health & wellbeing, working with responsible suppliers and reducing climate change impacts. Research is showing that corporate responsibility is increasing in importance for consumers all around the world. In 2017, a survey was conducted among a small group of customers in five main markets. The customers highlighted a wide range of areas including the importance of responsible production and the choice of materials used. In ongoing market research, we include sustainability aspects whenever relevant. Daniel Wellington’s owner and board have stated the importance of sustainability going forward. It is both our responsibility to do the right thing and also help the company be better prepared to achieve long-term profitability.

To achieve this, we need to take full GLASS part of this commitment, we conducted an initial mapping of our responsibility for our purchases, including complete transparency gift box supply chain in 2018. During 2019, we worked closely on the materials we are using and where they come from. Reducing LEATHER 6% 1% with our suppliers to achieve FSC certification of their facilities resource consumption from improved product design, production 6% as well as for the raw materials purchased.

Our research traced the gold back to a 90+9+1L conflict-free mine. Eventually, our ambition is to use gold originating from recycled sources as an alternative with lower environmental impact than PACKAGING virgin gold. In 2019, we started a project looking into different METAL PLASTIC options of sourcing recycled gold, and we hope to see some positive results in 2020. 9% 1% LEATHER The leather supply chain is another major impact. All leather used in our watch straps is sourced from Italy and the tanneries 482 are visited on a regular basis. Our commitment is that all our tanneries should be certified by the Leather Working Group, and during the year we worked to implement this. By the end of 2019, all purchased leather came from tanneries certified against the Leather Working Group standard, an increase compared to TONNES around a quarter of all leather in 2018. Going forward, this is a requirement for any new tanneries coming onboard. We are now working to trace the source of the leather even further back in the 90% supply chain.

Moreover, the gift boxes serve as storage space for the products when not used. Over the past couple of years, we reinvented the gift box to make it more sustainable. In 2017, we redesigned the box to reduce the total material weight and overall plastic use, resulting in a significantly lower environmental impact. The next step was to source the paper from sustainably managed forests. We decided to implement 100% FSC certified paper and board. “CONTRIBUTES BY CHOOSING FSC CERTIFIED PRODUCTS, DANIEL WELLINGTON TO THE RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT OF THE WORLD’S FORESTS.“ Lena Dahl, Executive Director FSC Sweden. FSC is a non-profit organization that sets high standards to ensure the practice of environmentally responsible and socially beneficial forestry. It is recognized by WWF as the “hallmark of responsible forest management”. When a product is FSC Certified, it means the wood used in the product and the manufacturer that made it, complied with the requirements of the Forest Stewardship Council. Rather than changing suppliers, which might have been faster, we supported our current suppliers in reaching FSC certification. This process was completed during summer 2019. Since October 2019, all our paper and board products; including the paper bag, owner’s guide and gift boxes are FSC certified.

In 2019 we initiated a project to look at producing the strap with recycled polyester instead of virgin fibers. By doing this the material’s environmental footprint is reduced since the production of recycled fibers needs less energy than virgin fibers. It is a little more expensive to buy, however, using recycled material also helps stimulate demand and hopefully contributes to keeping plastic waste out of landfills. “OUR WE ARE LOOKING INTO ALL PARTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND DO UTMOST TO MAKE THE MATERIAL AS WELL AS PRODUCTION PROCESSES MORE SUSTAINABLE, SO SHIFTING MATERIAL TO RECYC LED POLYESTER WAS AN EASY DECISION DESPITE THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER COST. Frank Vejbåge, Production and Sourcing Director, Hong Kong. “ The final product meets the same strict quality standards, meaning consumers will not be able to tell the old and new straps apart. The performance of recycled polyester is the same as for virgin polyester, high strength and durability remain key benefits of the material. We completed trial runs using recycled polyester in 2019 and during 2020 we aim to shift all our NATO strap production to 100% recycled material.

Our ambition is that all the jobs created in our supply chain should contribute positively to society. The working environment should be safe, and people need to be able to live and support their family on a normal worker’s wage. OUR SUPP LIERS Daniel Wellington’s supplier base is mainly located in China. To manage the sustainability impacts and risks associated with our supply chain, we have set up a five-step process to help us prioritize and focus our actions. As a minimum, our suppliers should follow local laws in the country where the business is conducted. In addition, our Supplier Code of Conduct sets the minimum requirements for how we expect our suppliers to act. All our direct product suppliers have signed the code. See section Our Guiding Policies for more details on the Supplier Code on Conduct. Once the supplier has signed the Supplier Code of Conduct, they are part of our audit program. We plan and prioritize our work based on input such as the supplier spend, the product type and previous history with the supplier. During 2019, 100% of our direct product suppliers were audited, including all watch assembly factories, using qualified third-party audit firms. The work with improving issues found during audits is ongoing and we are continuing to see progress in terms of social insurance coverage and controls of working hours. Following each audit, dedicated Daniel Wellington staff We continued to increase our knowledge of tier 2 and 3 suppliers during the year. All our suppliers work together with the suppliers on improving the areas identified. We follow-up on working hours need to report on their tier 2 factories on a regular basis and for some vital components and materials and social insurance coverage monthly, enabling us to track and support the suppliers in achieving we are also following up on tier 3 factories.

This includes the work to oversee, manage and defend the company’s worldwide IP rights and specifically to protect and control the use of the company’s trademarks and designs, which are of great value and importance to the company. In recent years, it has become apparent that Daniel Wellington products are attractive to copy. This implies several problems, e.g. counterfeits being of poor product quality which may result in potential health and safety issues for the consumers buying and using such counterfeits, not to mention forced labor, terrorism and human trafficking – which are only a few of the bigger concerns linked with the business of counterfeits. In order to manage these problems, and to ensure that the company’s rights are duly respected, Daniel Wellington works actively to counteract counterfeiting. This work comprises both preventive and corrective measures and we work in close collaboration with e.g. digital marketplaces, customs, police departments, prosecutors and other law enforcement agencies worldwide. Further, Daniel Wellington is active within several organizations, including the Swedish Anti-Counterfeit Group, the Together Against Counterfeit Alliance (TAC) and the International Trademark Association (INTA), to mention a few. Over the past five years, Daniel Wellington’s anticounterfeiting measures have led to the seizure of over 500,000 fake products globally and the take-down of more than 700,000 contested e-commerce ads. The preventive and corrective measures, as well as the collaborations with inter alia the mentioned organizations and relevant authorities, has enabled Daniel Wellington to contribute to the process of combating the global and encompassed problems which the counterfeit market gives rise to.
