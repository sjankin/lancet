Guided by OUR PHILOSOPHY, we will promote sustainable growth through unified group management. Toru Kuwano, TIS Chairman and President, provides details on OUR PHILOSOPHY—the recently announced basic philosophy for the TIS INTEC Group—and progress on Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020). Q1. Please summarize OUR PHILOSOPHY. Our objective is to fill the future—still essentially a blank canvas—with vibrant colors as a mover using digital technology. We recently announced OUR PHILOSOPHY, a basic philosophy for the TIS INTEC Group that represents a sense of values shared throughout the Group. OUR PHILOSOPHY broadly clarifies Group management, corporate activities and vital concepts and ideals for members of the Group, including directors and employees. A company exists, essentially, for the diverse range of stakeholders connected to it and, by extension, all of society. Given this underlying perspective, we made it the mission of the TIS INTEC Group to fill the future—still essentially a blank canvas—with vibrant colors as a mover using digital technology. The meaning of “mover” implies our movement as a corporate group as well as driving the movement of society through our activities. The spread of digital technology has transformed every aspect of society and is sure to continue to spur more changes. Positives are widely expected, but negatives are still a concern, particularly technological singularity—that is, a hypothetical point in time when artificial intelligence evolves beyond human intelligence and causes a major shift in the mode of human life. The future is a blank canvas, and we believe it is necessary to make it bright. With this in mind, a vivid pallet of color is required—that is, innovative possibilities and a range of choices that appeal to society. OUR PHILOSOPHY embraces this perspective as well as being a declaration of our mission, our duty as a corporate citizen to support the use of digital technology, establish a presence that brings about the realization of a brilliantly colored society through our own corporate activities, and contribute to society as a mover capable of creating a future in which people are happy. It is our raison d’etre. Q2. Please describe the process involved in formulating OUR PHILOSOPHY. OUR PHILOSOPHY is the equivalent of a corporate constitution for the TIS INTEC Group. The TIS INTEC Group was established, albeit under a different name, back in April 2008 through management integration and became today’s TIS INTEC Group in July 2016 through realignment of companies under the Group umbrella. The shift from a pure holding company structure to that of an operating holding company was a major turning point in our corporate history. Maybe for this reason, it was also the perfect opportunity to redefine our corporate philosophy and highlight the qualities that we seek to demonstrate as a corporate group while also addressing changes in the social landscape that had occurred over the years since our 2008 establishment. The announcement of OUR PHILOSOPHY came after we unveiled Group Vision 2026 in May 2017 and Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020) in April 2018 because it was to be the axis around which the entire Group turned, and we needed time to carefully craft the content. Nevertheless, we had an idea of what OUR PHILOSOPHY should be, and the thinking behind this philosophy actually infuses Group Vision 2026 and Toru Kuwano, Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020). Chairman and President Group Vision 2026 describes the place we want the TIS INTEC Group to be in business markets 10 years from now. Toward this end, we invited participation from principal Group companies, specifically, division managers and deputy managers in their 30s and 40s who would likely play key roles in the TIS INTEC Group 10 years into the future. Through repeated dialogue opportunities, we formed the image we want the Group to present by 2026—that is, a Group able to create an exciting future by utilizing advanced technologies and know-how to realize business innovation and market creation—and also clarified our intention to secure a position on the global stage and defined specific strategic domains. We will travel through three three-year management plans to reach the final destination that is Group Vision 2026. Each medium-term management plan will be a detailed map, with specific milestones, for each stage along the way. 3 4 OUR PHILOSOPHY is essentially a corporate constitution premised on Group Vision 2026 and medium-term management plans. It represents a perspective—a way of thinking—that forms the foundation of all corporate activity. Q4. What is the status of Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020)? What does the TIS INTEC Group do? Striving to generate sales and income is a given for any profit-seeking company. However, real corporate growth is not On the performance front, results are better than expected, and business restructuring is leading to steady determined by numbers alone. Success, from the OUR PHILOSOPHY perspective, will be measured by how well we fulimprovement on a qualitative basis as well. fill our ultimate mission—social contribution through business activities—and how much we improve value for stakeFiscal 2019 was the first year of Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020), and it brought higher sales and holders. We will encourage each and every employee to recognize the underlying significance of groupwide corporate income than initially predicted. In addition, strategic domains—the four business segments that will play a key role in activities as this understanding will underpin achievement of quantitative targets. our future success—contributed 42% on a net sales basis, surpassing expectations. I feel that this is a reflection of solid steps toward structural transformation but also sets the medium-term management plan off to a great start. The three years of the current medium-term management plan form the first step in building a platform for achieving Q3. What is the connection between society’s demands on companies and OUR PHILOSOPHY? Group Vision 2026. But a launchpad for the next step, that is, the next medium-term management plan, must be put The concepts under OUR PHILOSOPHY are style, policy and membership, creating a foundation that will in place as well, and this requires efforts to accelerate structural transformation of the Group. Balancing short-term underpin achievement of our mission. improvement in business results with mediumto long-term progress on structural transformation is by no means an easy task since certain aspects cancel each other out. But we will diligently strive to achieve sustainable growth. TIS—and by extension, the TIS INTEC Group—signed on to the U.N. Global Compact in July 2018 and has been To promote structural transformation, TIS will attempt something during the current medium-term management involved in initiatives aimed at developing a sustainable society. Also, Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020) plan that the Company has never tried before—split its operations into account-style business, which emphasizes highlights the slogan “Transformation to 2020—Achieving structural transformation as a corporate family and taking Strategic Partnership Business, and service-style business, which focuses on IT Offering Services to create industry platthe lead in finding solutions to social issues”. OUR PHILOSOPHY brings together several universal principles and, form solutions under a prior investment style approach. Both sides of operations will interact to meet the needs of linked to our medium-term management targets, it will be integral to a structure that enables us to implement the each client company while enabling TIS to capitalize on opportunities across a diverse business spectrum. This is activities that society requires companies to perform. another aspect of structural transformation. Going forward, we will introduce measures extensively throughout the OUR PHILOSOPHY is built on three concepts—style, policy and membership—that support efforts to achieve our Group to keep the structural transformation process moving ahead. mission. Each concept is defined, respectively, as a code of conduct befitting a good corporate citizen, a peopleoriented management policy, and a sense of honesty that provides the basis for the Group’s corporate activities. Amid heightened calls from society that companies improve their compliance and governance practices, we acknowledge, as a good corporate citizen, the importance of going beyond social norms and the expectations of sociQ5. In what direction will structural transformation take the TIS INTEC Group? ety. At the same time, we must cultivate an open and free corporate culture and atmosphere that enables all employTo galvanize the Group’s strengths, we will promote measures that emphasize cohesive power and diversity. ees to express their own opinions. Right now, we are working through a structural transformation. And for us to fulfill People are, without a doubt, the most valuable management resource any company can have. For the TIS INTEC our role as a mover—to anticipate social issues and build a new business model—it is vitally important that we proGroup, it is therefore vital, above all else, that frontline employees—those who are closely involved in the process of mote a flexible approach to communication inside and outside our corporate walls. We must be proactive. The code structural transformation—acquire a new outlook for success. For example, service-style business presents many of conduct for the TIS INTEC Group is based on this perspective and embodies the three concepts of style, policy and opportunities to work with startups and other companies with potential in the area of open innovation. I think we can membership noted above. deliver good results by taking a more proactive approach in deploying human resources with the right capabilities, Information meetings on OUR PHILOSOPHY were held for employees, and then seminar programs were gradually regardless of age or level of experience, to build alliances using a more flexible organizational template. Toward this rolled out according to job position, such as director, division manager, regular employee and new employee. end, we will continue to vigorously invest in human resources, including training and performance evaluations Although we are diligently implementing awareness-building opportunities, it will take time for OUR PHILOSOPHY to matched to the new business model. permeate the consciousness of everyone—some 20,000 people—under the Group umbrella. But we are blessed with On a groupwide basis, we will concurrently strive to increase cohesive power and emphasize diversity while mova phenomenal corporate culture, and just like a beautiful flower, OUR PHILOSOPHY will bloom and grow in this enviing through structural transformation. As the operating holding company, TIS is the de facto leader and will promote ronment through consistent efforts to promote the underlying beliefs. unified group management in line with OUR PHILOSOPHY. But in practice, there is no one-size-fits-all method to bring out the best in each Group company. For example, it is okay for personnel systems to differ, matched to whatever business model is used at each company. If the system adheres to underlying Group policy, specific details can be left to the discretion of management at each company. However, we are also looking to enhance management practices on a groupwide basis and improve efficiency by leveraging access to shared head office systems through the “G20” project to elevate head office functions. This process is inviting active dialogue within the Group. Recognizing the similarities and differences—that is, diversity—in our business activities is an indispensable component of unified group management. I expect this process to lead to new developments, such as the separation or concentration of future business activities and the creation of common platforms, that will strengthen the Group’s overall capabilities. Q6. Is there anything of particular importance you’d like to say to stakeholders? We will expand the possibilities of digital technology and help to solve social issues from a global perspective. Digital technology is indispensable in today’s world. Its reach extends to so many facets of society now and is key in delivering solutions to all sorts of global issues, from disasters to sickness and poverty. Considering how reliant the world is on digital technology, the role that the TIS INTEC Group must fulfill is growing in size and so is the potential that we can achieve with the right responses. This situation is sure to continue. For example, I firmly believe that our strengths in the payment settlement business will meet the huge demand generated by a cashless society—a new payment culture increasingly embraced at home and abroad. Additionally, we are involved in various initiatives, including Utility 3.0 for a carbon-free society, next-generation transport services such as MaaS (Mobility as a Service), and application of digital technology in areas such as SDGs Future Cities (cities in Japan selected by the national government as models of urban planning with state-of-the-art environmental sustainability, strong disaster resilience and superb livability). Everyone under the TIS INTEC Group umbrella, from management to employees, is fully aware that realizing a bright future requires a heavy commitment and recognizes the social responsibility we must fulfill. As a team, we will strive to enhance corporate value by helping to solve social issues through our business activities and by contributing to the realization of a sustainable society. The support of our stakeholders is and always will be integral to success. 5 6 TIS INTEC Group History The TIS INTEC Group has, in one form or another, provided industry-leading services since the dawn of the domestic information services industry.

We will leverage structural transformation and work Summary of Fiscal 2019 Results toward higher corporate Fiscal 2019, ended March 31, 2019, was the first year of Medium-Term Management Plan (2018-2020). A good operating environment created a favorable tailwind that we rode to a solid landing, exceeding initial performance targets. Net sales increased value, underpinned by a for the ninth straight year and operating income grew for the eight straight year, marking all-time highs. We are definitely off to a great start. “profit emphasis” Under good operating skies, we accurately identified client needs in sectors where the trend toward IT investment is particularly strong. This translated into a 3.7% increase in net sales, to ¥420.7 billion, which was 1.6% more than our original target. Operating management policy. income jumped 16.2% year on year, to ¥38.0 billion, or 8.7% better than we had expected, pushing the operating margin to 9.0%, compared with 8.1% a year ago. Net income attributable to owners of the parent company followed suit, climbing 26.3% year on year, to ¥26.0 billion, or 11.7% more than projected. By key segment, the drivers of growth were the Service IT Business, which benefited mainly from wider demand for payment settlement-related services and ERP upgrades, and the Industrial IT Business, which enjoyed a positive shift in demand due to growing IT investment by a wide range of client groups, including companies in the energy business. The BPO Business and the Financial IT Business posted lower sales, but the downturn reflects, for BPO, a significant impact from the fourth-quarter sale of consolidated Growth Strategy/Business Strategy subsidiaries as part of management’s policy of concentrating on core operations and for Financial IT Business, a reactionary drop following the end of some large development projects. Operating income was up year on year in all segments, with a notable increase for the Industrial IT Business, thanks to the success of measures to boost profitability, including a review of transaction margins and steps to enhance productivity. *Please go to page 23 for details on business strategies and performances by segment.

The “profit emphasis” management policy will become a major driving force, steadily pushing corporate value higher. Performance Forecast for Fiscal 2020 Toward further improvement in ROE Business sentiment for fiscal 2020 is rather uncertain, but the operating environment for the TIS INTEC Group is expected to Throughout the TIS INTEC Group, we emphasize management practices conscious of capital costs, and the medium-term continue to shift in a favorable direction, reflecting greater interest in digital management and a stronger trend toward IT management plan describes a target of 12.0% for ROE as a key performance indicator measuring a return that exceeds capital investment by companies keen to realize management strategies based on robust use of IT. costs. To achieve this target, we will seek a more appropriate capital composition, underpinned by efforts to promote growth Against this backdrop, the Group will work energetically on various measures, making steady progress toward Medium-Term investment, maintain financial health and strengthen return to shareholders—all in the right balance. Management Plan (2018-2020) targets, based on stated management direction. We anticipate higher sales and income on a ROE for fiscal 2019 reached 11.5%, up 1.6 points from fiscal 2018, putting us ever so close to our 12% target. The biggest consolidated basis in fiscal 2020, with net sales inching up 1%, to ¥425 billion, operating income rising 5.1%, to ¥40 billion, the factor for this was better business results and, subsequently, improved profitability. Taking advantage of our transition to an operating margin improving 0.4 point, to 9.4%, and net income attributable to owners of parent increasing 4.1%, to ¥27.1 operating holding company in July 2016, we accelerated decision-making and delivery of strategies groupwide. This fueled the billion. These estimates assume a net sales impact totaling about ¥12.0 billion, comprising about ¥6.0 billion from the sale of success of various measures, not limited to reducing the number of unprofitable projects, which had been a major issue, but subsidiaries at BPO and others, and another ¥6.0 billion due to a drop in demand for system development following completion extending to enhanced KPI management, including verification of potential profitability at time of order receipt and improved of large projects at Financial IT Business. Also, for operating income, we are assuming an increase of about ¥2.5 billion earmarked productivity in enhancement domains. In addition, we were able to implement the profit emphasis more thoroughly, exemplified for robust upfront investment to leverage structural transformation. We are aiming for a gross profit ratio of 23.1%, up 0.6 point by a careful review of the business portfolio from a profitability perspective. Comparing key numbers for fiscal 2016—which from fiscal 2019, which would see us achieve our target of 23%, which was internally assumed on the expectation of an preceded the transition to an operating holding company—with the most recent fiscal year, that is, fiscal 2019, shows significant operating margin of 10%, a year ahead of schedule. growth across the board. But what is particularly noteworthy is how fast the gross profit margin improved. Achieving 22.5% in fiscal 2019 means the inherent strength—the success factor—of our businesses is more robust. Consequently, earnings per share Growth Strategy/Business Strategy Group Management Direction in Fiscal 2020 has more than doubled over the past three years, driving ROE higher. The profit emphasis has steadily propelled corporate value higher, and I feel it will continue to generate good results. Also, this breeds a positive cycle, represented by the fact that TIS’ total 1 Robust prior investment to fuel business expansion and structural transformation Selectively invest in growth fields and areas of expertise to turn service-style businesses into growth engines shareholder returns over the last five years exceed TOPIX (Tokyo Price Index) and results reported by industry rivals. 2 Promote measures and review business portfolio with view toward higher profitability From this point forward, if we can realize structural transformation as planned, we will take profitability to new heights, Concentrate on forte fields and key client businesses, eliminate unprofitable projects, emphasize order profitability and thoroughly implement which in turn fuel progress toward the 10% target we have set for operating margin, as per the medium-term management plan, enhancement reforms as well as the 12% target for ROE.

For that reason, a duty that the Board of Directors must fulfill is, when drafting a management plan, to adequately consider Number of Directors Nine, including three external directors whether or not the ideas on which the plan is based are in good balance and then, through subsequent verification and evaluation of progress, reflect that Director’s Term of Office One year status in the next plan.

An issue that concerns me, given that TIS is promoting structural transformation for the future against a backdrop of solid corporate results— higher sales and higher income—with an emphasis on speed, is the pitfall of prioritizing speed at the expense of prudent risk evaluation. How will the opinSix, including three external directors and theee external audit & Number of Independent Directors ions and advice of external directors be incorporated to realize more effective management? supervisory board members Even as an external director, I know that there are watch points for corporate governance when business is good, just as there are when business is poor, and I am reminded of the need for calm judgment and the importance of stating opinions based on this perspective. I take special interest in organizational diversity and will actively contribute to discussions from this perspective. Naoko Mizukoshi, External Director (Partner of Leftright Law & IP) TIS formulated Group Vision 2026 to guide the TIS INTEC Group and seeks to shape an organization oriented for the future, contributing to society, brimming with vitality and boasting diversity in its human resources through efforts to instill OUR PHILOSOPHY in the minds of employees at all companies under the Group umbrella, training for employees and a fine-tuned human resources strategy. This is the cornerstone of structural transformation, based on the medium-term management plan, which will see the development of strategically anticipated businesses and increased created value. In addition to Board of Directors’ meetings and briefing sessions held prior to these meetings, TIS sets up opportunities for directors to exchange opinions in a candid and open atmosphere, conducts dialogue on human resources, the future of stock-based business and overseas strategies, steadily undertakes structural transformation, and strives to create a corporate group that is trusted by and indispensable to society. That said, issues I feel TIS must continue to address include improving group governance as a company heading up a corporate group of some 20,000 people and dealing with the increasingly fast-paced changes developing across the competitive landscape. For me, I take special interest in the perspective of diverse stakeholders, including shareholders; views based on experience as a lawyer and at an IT company; and organizational diversity from a woman’s standpoint. My participation in discussions reflects these perspectives. I will continue to be an active voice in meetings of the Board of Directors, the Nomination Committee, the Compensation Committee and opportunities for opinion exchange, and I will strive to contribute to higher composite corporate value for the TIS INTEC Group. 53 54 Organizational Chart Summary of Results of Analysis and Evaluation of Effectiveness of Entire Board of Directors Since fiscal 2016, ended March 31, 2016, the Company has c­ ompanies, through deliberation based on Company regulaevaluated the effectiveness of the Board of Directors each fiscal tions.
