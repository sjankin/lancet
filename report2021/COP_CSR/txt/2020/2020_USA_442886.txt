Today, fossil fuels and other natural resources are still the driving forces behind economic growth. However, this linear model of “take-make-waste” has an extensive value chain and associated waste streams resulting in huge environmental impacts. Recently, the concept of the circular economy has emerged to fundamentally shift the way we utilize resources and design our products. A circular economy is based on the principles of designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. As Tennant Company designs and manufactures products in-house, we have taken these principles as guidance to developing our future products and processes. In fact, we are already firmly rooted in keeping products in use with our RECON™ program, where we take back products from customers, recondition them, and then resell to customers looking for a high-quality product at a lower price. Tennant Company is also a member of the Minnesota Sustainable Growth Coalition (SGC), a business-led partnership focused on advancing the next frontier of corporate sustainability and the circular economy. Member companies collaborate and share expertise within three primary focus areas of clean energy, water, and materials. While we are committed to all three, Tennant Company has joined the Materials team to help advance a circular economy by focusing on these key areas: design for circularity, reuse or repurpose, recycle, and regenerate. Our involvement in the SGC will not only bring meaningful, positive impacts to our broader communities and partner companies, it will help accelerate us on the path to becoming a more sustainable enterprise. A cross-functional team of Tennant employees attended the first annual Circularity19 conference, hosted by GreenBiz, in Minneapolis, MN.

This affected many of our customers in construction, mining, concrete processing, and metal foundries, as they could no longer use simple dry sweeping or compressed air for housekeeping purposes. Per the standard, they are required to reevaluate their cleaning practices and implement solutions to limit employee exposure to respirable crystalline silica. In the years leading up to the standard implementation, we worked with customers and industry groups to develop solutions that would satisfy both the OSHA requirements and customer needs for exceptional cleaning. Fast forward to today, Tennant equipment with integrated HEPA filtration has been a sought-after solution for our customers, especially those in concrete processing and foundries, as their processes are not well-suited for wet cleaning. Tennant Company products will continue to evolve alongside regulations such as this to offer solutions that provide our customers high-quality cleaning while remaining within the bounds of compliance. 22 FOCUS AREA: PRODUCTS IPC & Gaomei Product Sustainability IPC SUSTAINABLE INNOVATIONS Since IPC was founded in 1965, they have always worked to deliver the most innovative solutions to help improve cleaning tasks.

Our aspiration is that all purchased materials provide the highest and best use attainable to our customers and all other stakeholders. This aspiration feeds our broad view of waste to include operational inefficiencies as well as material and resource waste. We define waste as materials that enter our boundary which do not become part of the products we sell. 32 FOCUS AREA: WASTE Tennant Company continues to make progress We continue to expand and improve our industrial toward becoming a zero-waste enterprise by recycling as employees identify waste streams that applying the solid waste hierarchy of Reduce, Reuse, should be diverted.

The sale included a full complement of aging, traditionally configured furniture that did not contribute to the agile, collaborative workspace we’re building. This meant that we needed to remove 1,000 workstations and auxiliary furniture – enough to fill an estimated 80 trailers. Tennant Company aspires to be a zero-waste-to-landfill organization, so we chose a partner to help us responsibly manage the used equipment left on the campus. We didn’t want to contribute to the 8.5 million tons of office assets the United States EPA estimates are sent to landfill waste annually. Our local partner has a long history of decommissioning office furniture, so we tapped into their large network to reuse the furniture we needed to remove as we remodeled the campus. As our furniture partner described, decommissioning office furniture is nothing new and is increasingly included in purchase agreements of new furniture. In many instances, the furniture is still functional and in good-to-excellent working condition. However, if it is no longer in-line with current workplace design trends, it becomes more difficult to rehome full workstations. There are many ways furniture can be decommissioned or redeployed. In this case, the furniture has been donated to different non-profit organizations and schools in Minnesota and Wisconsin, after a stop at a refurbishing firm for rework to make the furniture functional for the new user. None of the furniture acquired with the purchase of the property contributed to landfill waste in 2019.

Our facilities across the globe have been working hard to help us achieve this goal. In 2019 the manufacturing plant located in Qingpu, China, which manufactures Tennant-branded products, began a comprehensive sorting program. Their waste is now sorted into four different categories: recyclables like bottles and cans, wet or kitchen waste, dry waste, and hazardous waste. The team set up sorting stations around the facility, with labels and signs so employees know what goes where. Tennant looks forward to continued progress toward our goal to become zero waste to landfill.

I worked on a variety of smaller projects that touched on many different steps in the product development process. In order to make sure I was knowledgeable enough to effectively complete these projects, Tennant offered me a variety of hands-on learning experiences such as a welding, machining, 3D printing, and press brake tutorial. These experiences allowed me to have a better understanding of how to design manufacturable, serviceable, cost-effective, and marketable machines.” Liz Heile, Tennant Company Intern “During my internship with Tennant Company’s Indirect Procurement Team, I was given multiple projects which were both challenging and interesting. I participated in projects from the very beginning, such as writing an RFP, selecting vendors, and analyzing indirect supply spend. The projects allowed me to have a chance to interact with vendors and other Tennant employees in different departments to successfully choose our business partner.

These facilities, along with the global sales and service fleets, make up the Company’s Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. Many of these facilities are relatively small and used for sales and/or service offices, parts warehouses, or storage. Based on analysis of the facility ownership/ rental/lease arrangement and utility usage, we have identified 38 facilities as material. These will be included in our reporting boundary for 2019, including IPC facilities. All fleets in countries with direct sales and service presence are within the reporting boundary. The facilities outside the boundary are, in aggregate, less than 1% of our total emissions and energy consumption. Tennant Company closed on the Gaomei acquisition on January 4, 2019; facilities and fleets acquired as part of Gaomei are excluded from 2019 GHG emissions reporting boundary. Tennant Company has updated our internal reporting calendar, which means just as with the 2018 report, we will be decoupling the events of 2019 featured in this report from the carbon reporting. This will allow Tennant to publish our annual Corporate Sustainability Report in a timely fashion, creating a more relevant report for our stakeholders. Stakeholder Engagement Tennant Company performed an extensive materiality assessment with our stakeholders in 2013. The outcome helped define the company’s current Sustainable Enterprise strategy. Considering our ENGAGEMENT STR ATEGIES recent acquisitions, Tennant Company anticipates returning to our stakeholders to refresh this materiality assessment. We performed a multi-step process performed in 2013 for identifying material issues. We first identified stakeholder groups and key members of each group. CUSTOMERS INVESTORS EMPLOYEES We then defined our engagement strategies for each group, with no group being engaged the same way. For some groups we employed proxies where direct dialogue was not practical. Table 2, Stakeholder Engagement Strategy and Tactics, lists each MATERIAL TOPICS stakeholder group, the strategies and tactics used for engaging them, and their concerns and priorities. Our three primary stakeholder groups are: customers, investors, and employees. 2019 Corporate Sustainability Report | Tennant Company 61 INDEX: STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT The objective of the stakeholder engagement and Engagement for Scope 3 supply chain emissions materiality exercises was to identify and prioritize (Categories 1, 4 and 9) come primarily from our stakeholder needs, expectations, and concerns.

In addition, employees completed an all-employee attitudinal survey in 2015. Based on this employee survey, Tennant refocused our Human Resources priorities to address areas of opportunity for our Sustainable Enterprise strategy, such as communication and collaboration, while continuing to support stewardship, job fit and impact. We use different collaboration platforms to educate and request feedback from employees, as well as formal and informal training on a variety of sustainability topics, including waste, recycling, and the circular economy. 62 INDEX: STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT Table 9 STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES, TACTICS AND AREAS OF INTEREST Stakeholder Engagement Strategy Engagement Tactic Major Issues and Concerns Group What strategy will Tennant Company employ to How will Tennant Company implement these strategies?
