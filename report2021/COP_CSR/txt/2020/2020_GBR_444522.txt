We also express our desire to advance these principles in our area of influence and to integrate them into our company's strategy, its commercial culture, and its modus operandi. We recognize that our active participation in the Global Development Partnership is key to advancing the United Nations goals, particularly the Millennium Development Goals. In this annual report, we describe the actions we take to always improve the integration of the ten principles into our company's strategy, our culture and our daily actions.
