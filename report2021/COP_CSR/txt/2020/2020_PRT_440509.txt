MAXIMIZING CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICE AND THE BEST CONTENT 07 08 09 10 Sales and support processes and channels are also reflecting the effort to streamline and digitalize, as reflected in the level of in-store digitalization, process automation, electronic bill take-up (over 90% with new customers) and introduction of digital signatures, amongst others. As an example of the value captured from rollout of some of these projects, we have witnessed an increase in paperless processes to 85% and a reduction of FTEs of close to 15% within our stores. The introduction of digitalized price tags has also led to a big improvement of in-store efficiency and has reduced time to deploy nationwide product offers and promotions. Implementation of a seamless omnichannel experience is key to our strategy, having evolved from an almost independent multichannel structure in the past. The end goal is to deliver an agile and smooth handover between sales and service customer touchpoints, independently of where the contact is initiated and where it is completed, thus promoting a more satisfactory sales experience and increased customer loyalty. Conscious of the need to excel in customer experience, already at the start of 2020, we started to provide customers with more simplified contractual information resorting to a clearer and more concise information sheet providing all relevant contractual information when the contract is signed. The sheet provides more detailed information about contract durations, related charges and how outstanding debts are calculated in the event the contract is terminated earlier than forecast, and under which circumstances a contract may be terminated, amongst others. With this initiative, our customers can make a more informed and conscious choice about the services being contracted, such as the main features, offers and discounts related to customer loyalty, duration of the contract, and the costs and charges arising from early cancellation. We believe this voluntary self-regulation initiative will be extremely beneficial for our customers by increasing the level of transparency of the contractual relationship and therefore driving a higher level of customer experience.

When such indications exist, the Group calculates the recoverable value of the asset to determine the existence and extent of the impairment loss. For t nt of financial position under The recoverable value is estimated for each asset individually or, if that is not possible, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows to the cash-generating unit, except for the assets allocated to the cinema exhibition business, which are grouped into regional cash-generating units. Financial liabilities and equity instruments The recoverable amount is calculated as the higher of the net sale price and the current use value. The net sale price is the amount that would be obtained from the Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to their contractual substance irrespective of their legal form. Equity instruments are contracts that sale of the asset in a transaction between independent and knowledgeable entities, less the costs directly attributable to the sale.

Provisions for legal procedures taking place against the Group are made in accordance with the risk assessments carried out by the Group and by their legal advisers, based on success rates. Variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event giving rise to them occurs.

A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that transfers the right to use a good (the underlying asset) for a period in exchange for a value. As stipulated in the above standard, deferred income tax assets are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that these may be used to reduce future At the beginning of each contract, it is evaluated and identified if it is or contains a lease.

Portuguese commercial legislation requires that at least 5% of annual net profit must be appropriated to a legal reserve until it represents at least 20% of the share capital.

The statement of cash flows is prepared in accordance with the direct method.

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer also include bank overdrafts included in the statement of financial position under Borrowings . the liability may occur: The statement of cash flows is divided into operating, investing, and financing activities. On the main market of the assets and liabilities, or Operating activities include cash received from customers and payments to suppliers, staff and others related to operating activities.

Rights of use Events occurring after the date of the statement of financial position, which provide information on conditions that occur after that date, are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, when they are materially relevant. The Group determines the end of the lease as the non-cancelable part of the lease term, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain that it will be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease agreement, if it is reasonably certain that it will not be exercised. The Group has the option, under some of its lease agreements, to lease its assets for additional periods. NOS assesses the reasonableness of exercising the option to 3. Judgements and estimates renew the contract. That is, NOS considers all the relevant factors that create an economic incentive for exercising the renewal.

However, at the date of completion of such operations, their results may differ from these estimates. probability and amount of internal resources required to meet obligations may give rise to significant adjustments, either due to changes in the assumptions made, or Changes to these estimates that occur after the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements will be corrected in the income statement in a prospective due to the future recognition of provisions previously disclosed as contingent liabilities. manner, in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . Deferred income tax assets The estimates and assumptions that imply a greater risk of giving rise to a material adjustment in assets and liabilities are described below: Deferred income tax assets are recognised only when there is strong assurance that there will be future taxable income available to use the temporary differences or Entities included in the consolidation perimeter when there are deferred tax liabilities whose reversal is expected in the same period in which the deferred tax assets are reversed. The assessment of deferred income tax assets is undertaken by management at the end of each period taking account of the expected future performance of the Group. To determine the entities to be included in the consolidation perimeter, the Group assesses the extent to which it is exposed, or has rights, to variability in return from its involvement with that entity and can take possession of them through the power it holds over this entity. Expected credit losses The decision that an entity must be consolidated by the Group requires the use of judgment, estimates, and assumptions to determine the extent to which the Group The credit risk on the balances of accounts receivable is assessed at each reporting date, using a collection matrix based on the historical past collections adjusted is exposed to return variability and the ability to take possession of them through its power. from the future expectation of collections evolution, to determine the uncollectability rate. The expected credit losses of the accounts receivable are thus adjusted for the assessment made, which may differ from the effective risk that will incurred in the future. Other assumptions and estimates could lead to the Group's consolidation perimeter being different, with direct impact on the consolidated financial statements. Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Impairment of non-current assets, excluding goodwill When the fair value of an asset or liabilities is calculated, on an active market, the respective market price is used. When there is no active market, which is the case The determination of a possible impairment loss can be triggered by the occurrence of various events, such as the availability of future financing, the cost of capital or d on market assumptions, are used. other market, economic and legal cha The Group applies evaluation techniques for unlisted financial instruments, such as derivatives, financial instruments at fair value and instruments measured at The identification and assessment of impairment indicators, the estimation of future cash flows, and the calculation of the recoverable value of assets involve a high amortised cost. The most frequently used valorisation models are models of discounted cash flows and option models, which incorporate, for example, interest rate degree of judgment by the Board. and market volatility curves. Impairment of goodwill For certain types of more complex derivatives, more advanced valuation models are used containing assumptions and data that are not directly observable in the market, for which the Group uses internal estimates and assumptions. Goodwill is annually subjected to impairment tests or whenever there are indications of a possible loss of value in accordance with the criteria described in Note 8. The recoverable values of the cash-generating units to which goodwill is allocated are determined based on the calculation of current use values. These calculations require Errors, estimates, and changes to accounting policies the use of estimates by management.

The life of an asset is the period during which the Company expects that an asset will be available for use and this should be reviewed at least at the end of each financial year. The determination of the useful lives of assets, the amortisation/depreciation method to be applied, and the estimated losses resulting from the replacement of equipment before the end of its useful life due to technological obsolescence is crucial in determining the amount of amortisation/depreciation to be recognised in the consolidated income statement each period.

For the purposes of impairment tests, goodwill is attributed to the cash-generating units to which it is related, which may correspond to the business segments in which the Company operates, or a lower level. The costs of current maintenance and repairs are recognised as a cost when they are incurred. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the corresponding goodwill is included in determining the corresponding gain or loss realised. The estimated costs of dismantling and removal of the assets will be considered as part of the initial cost. Depreciation is calculated, once the asset becomes available for use by the straight-line method, on a monthly basis in accordance with the estimated useful life for Impairment of tangible and intangible assets, excluding goodwill each class of assets.

MANAGEMENT REPORT NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 131 The Company classifies its financial assets into the following categories: financial investments at fair value through profit or loss, financial assets measured at amortised For receivables and assets resulting from contracts under IFRS 15, the Company adopts the simplified approach when calculating expected credit losses. As a result, cost, financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Its classification depends on the entity's business model to manage the financial assets and NOS does not monitor changes in credit risk, recognising instead impairment losses based on the expected credit loss on each reporting date. The Company presents the contractual characteristics in terms of the cash flows of the financial asset. an impairment loss criterion based on the history of credit losses, adjusted by specific prospective factors for the clients and the economic environment. Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Derivate financial instruments This category includes financial derivatives and equity instruments that the Company has not classified as financial assets through other comprehensive income at the Initial and subsequent recognition time of initial recognition. This category also includes all financial instruments whose contractual cash flows are not exclusively capital and interest. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as exchange rate forward contracts, interest rate swaps, to cover its exchange rate risks, interest, Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in results in the year in which they occur respectively. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value on the date the derivative is contracted and are subsequently measured at fair value. Derivatives are presented in assets when their fair value is positive and in liabilities when their fair value is negative. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income In terms of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are those that are part of a business model whose objective is achieved through the • Fair value hedge when the purpose is to hedge the exposure to fair value changes of a registered asset or liability or an unregistered Company collection of contractual cash flows and the sale of financial assets, being that these contractual cash flows are only capital and interest reimbursement on the capital • Cash flow hedge when the purpose is to hedge the exposure to cash flow variability arising from a specific risk associated with the whole or a component of a in debt. registered asset or liability or an anticipated highly probable occurrence or exchange risk associated with an unregistered Company • Coverage of a net investment in a foreign operational unit. Financial assets measured at amortised cost NOS uses derivative financial instruments with fair value and cash flow hedges. Financial assets measured at amortised cost are those that are included in a business model whose purpose is to hold financial assets in order to receive the contractual At the beginning of the hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedging relationship for which hedge accounting is intended to apply cashflows, being that these contractual cash flows are only capital reimbursement and interest payments on the capital in debt. as well as the management and strategy purpose of such hedge. Cash and cash equivalents Before 1 January 2018, the documentation included the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the hedged risk and the deposits and other investments with maturities of less manner in which the Company assessed the effectiveness of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument according with the Company's exposure to changes than three months which may be immediately realizable and with a negligible risk of change of value. in the fair value of the hedge item or cash flows arising from the hedged risk. Such hedges should be highly effective to compensate changes in fair values or cash flows and would be assessed on a continuing basis in order to demonstrate their highly effectiveness over the reporting period. drafts included in the statement of financial position under Beginning 1 January 2018, the documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Company will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge Financial liabilities and equity instruments ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements: Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to their contractual substance irrespective of their legal form. Equity instruments are contracts that i) There is an econo y are recorded at the amount received, ii) net of the costs incurred in their issue. Financial liabilities and equity instruments are regained only when extinguished, i.e., when the obligation is settled, cancelled iii) The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Company actually hedges and the or extinguished. quantity of the hedging instrument that the Company actually uses to hedges that quantity of hedged item. In accordance with IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for: Hedges that meet all the quantifying criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, as described below: a) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. These liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, should subsequently be measured at fair value; Fair value hedges b) Financial liabilities that arise when a transfer of a financial asset does not meet the conditions for derecognition or when it is applied the continued involvement The change in the fair value of a hedging instrument is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the approach; risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognised in the statement of profit or loss. c) Financial guarantee contracts; For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment to carrying value is amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term of the d) The commitments to grant a loan at a lower interest rate than the market; hedge using the EIR method. The EIR amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. e) The recognised contingent consideration by a buyer in a concentration of business activities to which IFRS 3 applies. Such contingent consideration shall be subsequently measured at fair value, with changes recognised in profit or loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to Financial liabilities of the Company include: borrowings, accounts payable and derivative financial instruments. the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss. Impairment of financial assets Cash flow hedges At the date of each statement of financial position, the Company analyses and recognises expected losses on its debt securities, loans and accounts receivable. The expected loss results from the difference between all contractual cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in OCI in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised entity expects to receive, discounted at the original effective interest rate. immediately in the statement of profit or loss. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. The objective of this impairment policy is to recognise expected credit losses over the respective duration of financial instruments that have undergone significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, assessed on an individual or collective basis, taking into account all reasonable and sustainable information, including The Company uses forward contracts of: i) currency contracts for its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments; ii) interest rates prospects.

Lease liabilities are remeasured at the occurrence of certain events (such as a change in the lease period, a change in future payments that result from a change in the reference rate or rate used to determine such payments). This remeasurement of the lease liability is recognised as an adjustment in the ROU. The amounts accumulated in OCI are accounted for, depending on the nature of the underlying hedged transaction. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the separate component of equity and included in the initial cost or other Rights of use of assets carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. This also applies where the hedged forecast transaction of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability subsequently becomes a Company The Company recognises the right to use the assets at the start date of the lease (that is, the date on which the underlying asset is available for use). is applied. The right to use the assets is recorded at acquisition cost, deducted from accumulated depreciation and impairment losses and adjusted for any new measurement of For any other cash flow hedges, the amount accumulated in OCI is reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during lease liabilities. The cost of the ROU of the assets includes the recognised amount of the lease liability, any direct costs incurred initially and payments already made which the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss. prior to the initial rental date, less any incentives received. When IFRS 16 was implemented, during the computation of the values of rights of use, the potential impact If cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued, the amount that has been accumulated in OCI must remain in accumulated OCI if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise, the amount will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. After discontinuation, once the hedged Unless it is reasonably certain that the Company obtains ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the recognised right of use of the assets is cash flow occurs, any amount remaining in accumulated OCI must be accounted for depending on the nature of the underlying transaction as described above. depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the term of the lease. Rights of use are subject to impairment. Subsidies Subsidies are recognised at their fair value when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and the Company will meet the requirements for their award. Liabilities with leases Operating subsidies, mainly for employee training, are recognised in the income statement by deduction from the corresponding costs incurred. At the start date of the lease, the Company recognises the liabilities measured at the present value of the future payments to be made until the end of the lease. Investment subsidies are recognised in the statement of financial position as deferred income and it is recognised as income on a systematic and rational basis over Lease payments include fixed payments (including fixed payments on the substance), deducted of any incentives to be received, variable payments, dependent on an the useful life of the asset. index or rate, and expected amounts to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a call option if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option, and penalties for termination of the lease if it is reasonably certain that the Company will terminate the lease. If the subsidy is considered as deferred income, it is recognised as income on a systematic and rational basis during the useful life of the asset. Variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event giving rise to them occurs. Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets To calculate the present value of the lease payments, the Company uses the incremental loan rate at the start date of the lease if the implied interest rate is not readily Provisions are recognised when: (i) there is a present obligation arising from past events and it is likely that in settling that obligation, the expenditure of internal determinable. resources will be necessary; and (ii) the amount or value of such obligation can be reasonably estimated. When one of the above conditions is not met, the Company After the start date of the lease, the value of the lease liability is increased to reflect the increase in interest and reduces by the payments made. In addition, the book discloses the events as a contingent liability unless the likelihood of an outflow of funds resulting from this contingency is remote, in which case they are not disclosed. value of the lease liability is remeasured if there is a change, such as a change in the lease term, fixed payments or the purchase decision of the underlying asset. Provisions, for legal procedures taking place against the Company are made in accordance with the risk assessments carried out by the Company and by their legal advisers, based on success rates. Income tax Provisions for restructuring are only recognised when the Company has a detailed and formal plan, which identifies the main features of the restructuring programme NOS is covered by the special tax regime for groups of companies, which covers all the companies in which it directly or indirectly owns at least 75% of the share and after these facts have been reported to the entities involved. capital and which simultaneously are resident in Portugal and subject to Corporate Income Tax (IRC). Obligations that result from onerous contracts are registered and measured as provisions. There is an onerous contract when the Company is an integral part of the The remaining subsidiaries not covered by the special tax regime for groups of companies are taxed individually based on their respective taxable incomes and the provisions of an agreement contract, which entail costs that cannot be avoided and exceed the economic benefits derived from the agreement. applicable tax rates. Provisions for potential future operating losses are not covered. Income tax is stated in accordance with the IAS 12 criteria. In calculating the cost relating to income tax for the period, in addition to current tax, allowance is also made for the effect of deferred tax calculated in accordance with the liability method, taking into account the temporary differences resulting from the difference between Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements, unless the exception provided under IFRS 3 business combination, and are disclosed whenever tax losses carried forward at the date of the statement there is a good chance to shed resources including economic benefits. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements, being disclosed when there of financial position. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities were calculated based on the tax legislation currently in force or of legislation already published for is a likelihood of a future influx of financial resources. future application. Provisions are reviewed and brought up to date at the date of the statement of financial position to reflect the best estimate at that time of the obligation concerned. As stipulated in the above standard, deferred income tax assets are recognised only when there is reasonable assurance that these may be used to reduce future taxable profit, or when there are deferred income tax liabilities whose reversal is expected to occur in the same period in which the deferred income tax assets are Rights of use and Leases reversed. At the end of each period, an assessment is made of deferred income tax assets, and these are adjusted in line with the likelihood of their future use. A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that transfers the right to use a good (the underlying asset) for a period in exchange for a value. The amount of tax that are either to be included in current tax or in deferred tax, resulting from transactions or events recognised in equity accounts, is directly recorded At the beginning of each contract, it is evaluated and identified if it is or contains a lease. This assessment involves an exercise of judgment as to whether each contract under those items and does not affect the results for the period. depends on a specific asset, if the NOS obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset and whether the NOS has the right to control the use In a business combination, the deferred tax benefits acquired are recognised as follows: of the asset. a) The deferred tax benefits acquired in the measurement period of one year after the merger, and that result from new information about facts and circumstances All contracts that constitute a lease are accounted for on the basis of the on-balance model in a similar way with the treatment that IAS 17 establishes for financial that existed at the date of acquisition are recorded against the goodwill-carrying amount related to the acquisition.

These promises in customer contracts may be express or implied, provided such In turn, benefits granted based on shares but paid in cash lead to the recognition of a liability valued at fair value at the date of the statement of financial position. promises create a valid expectation in the client that the entity will transfer a good or service to the customer, based on the entity's published policies, specific statements or usual business practices. ted to costs associated to their management, which is debited to its subsidiaries and recognised in equity.

Capital Interest revenue is recognised using the effective interest method, only when they generate future economic benefits for the Company and when they can be measured reliably. Legal reserve Revenue from dividends is Portuguese commercial legislation requires that at least 5% of annual net profit must be appropriated to a legal reserve until it represents at least 20% of the share capital.

According to IFRS 2 Share-based payments , the responsibility with the medium-term incentive plans settled by delivery of own shares is recorded as credit, under Reservations for mid-term incentive plans and such reserve is not likely to be distributed or used to absorb losses. Financial charges and borrowings The Company recognises in equity the responsibility of all the action plans of various companies in the NOS Group, since it is responsible for its delivery to its Financial charges related to borrowings are recognised as costs in accordance with the accruals principle, except in the case of loans incurred (whether these are employees, against results for the year and accounts receivable of subsidiaries when dealing with own employees or employees of subsidiary companies, respectively. generic or specific) for the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that takes a substantial period (over one year) to be ready for use, which are capitalised in the acquisition cost of that asset.

Fair value measurement distributed or be used to absorb losses. The Company measures part of the financial assets, such as financial assets available for sale, and some of its non-financial assets, such as investment properties, at fair value on the date of the financial statements. Own shares reserves The fair value measurement assumes that the asset or liability is exchanged in an orderly transaction among market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability the legal reserve. Under Portuguese law, the amount of at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value measurement is based on the assumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer distributable reserves is determined according to the individual financial statements of the company prepared in accordance with IFRS. In addition, the increases the liability may occur: resulting from the application of fair value through equity components, including its application through the net profit can only be distributed when the elements that originated them are sold, exercised liquidated or when the end their use, in the case of tangible fixed assets or intangible assets. On the main market of the assets and liabilities, or Own shares In the absence of a primary market, it is assumed that the transaction occurs in the most advantageous market. This is what maximises the amount that would be received for selling asset or minimises the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability, after considering transaction costs and transport costs. The own shares are recorded at acquisition cost as a deduction from equity. Gains or losses on the sale of own shares are recorded under other reserves . Since different entities and businesses within a single entity can have access to different markets, the main or most advantageous market for the same asset or liability Retained results can vary from one entity to another, or even between businesses within the same entity, but it is assumed that they are accessible to the Company. This item includes the results available for distribution to shareholders and earnings per fair value in financial instruments increases, financial investments and The fair value measurement uses assumptions that market part investment properties, which, in accordance with paragraph 2 of article 32 of the CSC, will only be available for distribution when the elements or rights that originated asset to maximise its value. them are sold, exercised, terminated, or settled. MANAGEMENT REPORT NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT 134 The Company uses valuation techniques appropriate to the circumstances whenever there is information to measure the fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs. Judgements and estimates All assets and liabilities measured at fair value or of which disclosure is mandatory, are rated on a fair value hierarchy, which ranks data in three levels to be used in the tement of financial position and measurement at fair value, and detailed below: the reported results. These estimates are based on the best information and knowledge about past and/or present events, and on the operations that the Company considers may it may implement in the future. However, at the date of completion of such operations, their results may differ from these estimates. Level 1 Listed and unadjusted market prices, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date; Changes to these estimates that occur after the date of approval of the financial statements will be corrected in the income statement in a prospective manner, in Level 2 valuation techniques us accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors . Level 3 valuation techniques using inputs not based on observable market data, based on unobservable inputs. The estimates and assumptions that imply a greater risk of giving rise to a material adjustment in assets and liabilities are described below: The fair value measurement is classified in the same fair value hierarchy level at the lowest level of input, which is significant to the measurement as a whole. Relevant accounting estimates Employee benefits Provisions Personnel expenses are recognised when the service is rendered by employees independently of their date of payment. Here are some specificities: The Company periodically reviews any obligations arising from past events, which should be recognised or disclosed. The subjectivity involved in determining the a) Termination of employment. The benefits for termination of employment are due for payment when there is cessation of employment before the normal probability and amount of internal resources required to meet obligations may give rise to significant adjustments, either due to changes in the assumptions made, or retirement date or when an employee accepts voluntarily to leave in exchange of these benefits. The company recognises these benefits when it can be shown due to the future recognition of provisions previously disclosed as contingent liabilities. being committed to a termination of current employees according to a detailed formal plan for termination and there is no realistic possibility of withdrawal or these benefits are granted to encourage voluntary redundancy. When the benefits of cessation of employment are due more than 12 months after the balance Tangible and intangible assets sheet date, they are updated to their present value. The determination of the useful lives of assets as well as the amortisation / depreciation method to be applied is crucial in determining the amount of amortisation / b) Holiday, holiday allowances and bonuses.

NOS has a program of risk management that focuses its analysis on the financial markets in order to minimise potential adverse effects on its financial performance. Risk management is handled by the Financial Management in accordance with the policy approved by the Board. There is also at NOS an Internal Control Committee Liquidity risk with specific functions in the control area of risks of the activity of the Company. NOS manages liquidity risk in two ways: Exchange rate risk i. ensuring that its debt has a high component of medium and long-term maturities appropriate to the characteristics of industries when its subsidiaries exert their activity; and Exchange rate risk is mainly related to exposure resulting from payments made to foreign suppliers mainly denominated in US dollars. ii. through contractual arrangements with financial institutions of credit facilities available at any time, for an amount that ensures adequate liquidity. contract or may contract financial instruments, namely short-term foreign currency forwards, in order to hedge the risk associated with these balances.

NOS has not adopted any policy of hedging the risk of exchange rate variations for these companies on cash flows in foreign currencies. 4.6 Capital risk management Additional disclosures are made in the consolidated financial statements of NOS. At 31 December 2018 and 2019, balances payable to suppliers in currencies other than the Euro are not material. At 31 December 2019, NOS holds financial assets and liabilities valued at fair value, namely Equity Swap derivatives and interest rate swap derivatives (Note 21) and the Teliz financial investment, that holds investments in Angolan companies (Note 9). Interest rate risk In accordance with IFRS 13 Fair value measurement, the levels of the fair value hierarchy are described as follows: The risk of fluctuations in interest rates can result in a cash flow risk or a fair value risk, depending on whether variable or fixed interest rates have been negotiated. Level 1 Financial instruments valued based on quotations in active markets to which the company has access are included in this category, securities valued based NOS has adopted a policy of hedging risk through the use of interest rate swaps to hedge future interest payments on bond loans and other borrowings. on executable (immediate liquidity) published by external sources. NOS uses a sensitivity analysis technique which measures the expected impacts on results and equity of an immediate increase or decrease of 0.25% (25 basis points) in market interest rates, for the rates applying at the date of the statement of financial position for each class of financial instrument, with all other variables remaining Level 2 Financial instruments whose value is based on directly or indirectly observable data in active markets are included in this category, securities valued based constant. This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, since in practice market rates rarely change in isolation. on bids provided by external entities and internal valuation techniques using only observable market data. The sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: Level 3 All financial instruments valued at fair value that do not fall in level 1 and 2. • Changes in market interest rates affect interest receivable or payable on financial instruments with variable rates; The calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps derivatives was based on the estimate of discounted future cash flows (Level 2). • Changes in market interest rates only affect interest receivable or payable on financial instruments with fixed interest rates when they are recognised at fair value; The calculation of the fair value of the financial investment in Teliz (using the market approach) was based on the calculation of the implicit multiple of Finstar and ZAP Media's Ebitda Enterprise Value / EBITDA (Level 2). • Changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities; • Changes in the fair value of derivatives and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting future cash flows from current net values using market rates at the end of the year. Under these assumptions, an increase or decrease of 0.25% in market interest rates for loans that are not covered or loans with variable interest at 31 December 2019 would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual profit before tax of approximately 1 million euros (2018: 1.1 million euros). In the case of the interest rate swaps contracted, the sensitivity analysis which measures the estimated impact of an immediate increase or decrease of 0.25% (25 basis points) in market interest rates results in changes in the fair value of the swaps of approximately 0 euros (2018: over 319 thousand euros and down 320 thousand euros, respectively) at 31 December 2019. The impacts of the sensibility analysis are near zero because market interest rates are negative and there is a floor of 0% on the loan and on the swap contracts.
