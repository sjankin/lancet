Employees, managers and shareholders: we all are convinced that it is our responsibility to contribute, at our level, to a better world. For a long time, the strong decisions taken by OLVEA have shown that investing in industrial units in the native countries of the raw material (Morocco, Burkina Faso and Mauritania) is a risky but virtuous economic model, with a strong social and environmental impact. Every year, we further implement sustainable development in our activities. For the 5th consecutive year, we reaffirm our support to the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact and our desire to take part in the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Since 2018, we have formalized this approach, with dedicated leading employees, through a CSR Policy, a CSR action plan and, today, this first report. This commitment will continue in 2020 with the strong will to set ambitious and quantifiable goals, in the medium and long term, with the horizon of OLVEA’s 100th anniversary in 2029. We are aware of the urgent need for concrete action on CSR issues; therefore, we are pleased to share with you today our first OLVEAct Now report.
