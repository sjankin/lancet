This commitment continues today and has resulted in the development of an integrated Sustainability strategy for the business based on the United Nations Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs). The strategy aims to deliver stakeholder value through ethical and sustainable excellence, creating a long-term competitive advantage. We set global corporate responsibility priorities, which are enacted at a local level. These are then incorporated into objectives and programmes for diversity and inclusion, business conduct, safety, and the environment as set out in the diagram below.

The increase was in part due to the start of operations at the St Athan manufacturing facility which is due to formally start production in Q2 of 2020.

Also, the company has implemented a new water management system to measure and monitor our water consumption, recycling and discharge levels. This system has enabled us to identify areas of high usage, enabling us to implement water saving measures Our journey towards carbon neutrality has continued throughout the past year, following our decision in 2018 to source 100% of our energy from Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGO) backed sources for our UK operations. This initially excluded our St Athan manufacturing site which wasn’t operational, and the supply was not under our control. In late 2019 we agreed the terms of a similar REGO backed supply for the St Athan site which went live on 1 January 2020, sourcing all energy from a local renewable supplier.
