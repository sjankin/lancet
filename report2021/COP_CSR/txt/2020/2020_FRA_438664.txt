Interview INTERVIEW WITH DOMINIQUE LEFEBVRE AND PHILIPPE BRASSAC The addition of geopolitical, social and health risks, with their effects on the world economy, interest rates and market are transforming the conditions of banking trades. How does the Group react to this environment? Dominique Lefebvre The Group has means to cope with an adverse environment. We are the 10th largest bank worldwide, one of the most robust ones in the EU, we are leaders in our markets in France, as well as in Europe in certain areas. In 2019, Crédit Agricole Group adapted to an environment with disruptive elements and cyclical tensions. The effects of the Coronavirus pandemic will be of another magnitude. It will be a question of mobilizing our human skills and our financial solidity to support our customers, individuals and businesses, in the service of the recovery of the economy. Our universal banking model, mobilising our ability to innovate and anticipate and capitalising on our solid, long-term mutualist structure, enables us to meet our clients’ needs over the long term. Philippe Brassac This is the meaning of our Group Project and our 2022 Medium-Term Plan, Chief Executive Officer which stem from the formulation of our “Raison d’Être”: “Working every day in the interest of our customers and society”. Formulating a “Raison d’Être” not only gives meaning to the fundamental strategic choices we make, it also commits the Group to all its stakeholders. We ensure that our banking services are accessible to all, in terms of Our 142,000 employees in France and around the world work every day pricing, physical and digital accessibility, and that they combine social to meet the challenges of tomorrow’s world. interest with responsibility towards our fellow citizens and the planet.

Meeting the societal expectations that enables us to develop and build a solid Group, just like the search of our clients does not mean reconciling two conflicting interests, but for usefulness has enabled the Group to develop by accompanying major rather always acting in the interest of all. social changes from the financing of agricultural equipment in the 19th century to the democratisation of electronic banking and home ownership in more recent times. As you said, the Group last June launched a new Medium-Term Plan. What does it actually change? Society’s demands on companies are becoming more and Philippe Brassac more important. How does the Group respond/is in a position It is an engaging project based on the Group’s “Raison d’Être” that to respond to them? Dominique just spoke about. It consists in more than just adding up Dominique Lefebvre financial goals. There is a fundamental quest for meaning in today’s society, and we It can be broken down into three major areas: a Customer Project, aiming believe that companies have a role to play in this. They must define for excellence in relationships, a Human Project focusing on empowered the response they wish to provide to these societal demands, whose to the men and women of the Group for customers, and a Societal Project diagnosis and aims we share.

Is organic growth still the Group’s priority, or do you see any acquisitions? Philippe Brassac Crédit Agricole pays attention to possible banking consolidation movements Dominique Lefebvre and their potential impact on our businesses. Nevertheless, we note that Chairman of the Board of Directors European prudential regulations are not conducive to the emergence of the cross-border consolidation that the authorities seem to be calling for. On the other hand, it leaves room in the business lines for commercial that should not be feared, quite the contrary: it allows people to focus on partnership agreements, with or without capital ties, seeking synergies, their highest added value, and to be attentive to and support their clients’ while respecting the brands of each and their client relationships. transformations.

Non-financial performance From increased responsibility to integrated responsibility 2 In addition to meeting the regulatory requirements of the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (DPEF), this chapter is intended to present the policies and actions implemented by the entities of the Crédit Agricole Group. Firstly, it describes the how the new strategic plan will be implemented (governance, management tools and goals) as well as the Group’s main non-financial risks and challenges, in accordance with its business model (detailed in Chapter 1), its business relations and the services that it provides. The Group has identified these risks using methods developed in-house. Risks related to climate challenges are analysed and described in section 3.2 of this chapter “Green and sustainable finance: one of the Group’s keys to growth”, following the 11 recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Secondly, the Group describes the policies and actions aimed at addressing the main risks identified for each of the three major projects comprising Ambitions 2022 in detail along with the corresponding performance indicators. In addition, and pursuant to the law of 27 March 2017, Crédit Agricole S.A. has established and is implementing a vigilance plan to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, harm to personal health and safety, and damage to the environment that could potentially result from the Group’s activities. This vigilance plan is described in Chapter 3. The DPEF allows Crédit Agricole to present specific social, societal and environmental information according to how consistent it is with the principle risks or the policies carried out. It helps provide better information to stakeholders about the management of social and environmental risks. It is also a real strategic management tool for the Group. Even though the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (DPEF) must – in legal terms – cover the scope of Crédit Agricole S.A. – namely, Crédit Agricole S.A. (UES) and its subsidiaries – we have also chosen to provide, when this might be useful, information regarding the policies and action plans of Regional Banks in order to inform our stakeholders about the high degree of integration of the Group’s operations and show the social, environmental and societal impacts of the Group as a whole. The preparation of this DPEF is the result of the ongoing and collective work of Crédit Agricole Group: the CSR, Finance, Human Resources, Customer Relations and Innovation, Strategy, Risk, and Communications Departments, and the Corporate Secretariat of Crédit Agricole S.A., Group subsidiaries, and FNCA have held many preparation meetings. This year, following the publication of the Group’s Ambitions 2022 project, the methodology used to identify main risks, as well as the policies and actions plans, were reviewed and reorganised as part of this report. The Group updated its business model, particularly in relation to its new Raison d’Être. Through all its work, the Crédit Agricole Group is implementing, once again, an integrated approach recognised by its stakeholders. GOVERNANCE OF NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE To ensure that the Group’s CSR challenges are shared with and integrated The CSR Committee, chaired by the Corporate Secretary of Crédit Agricole S.A. into all the Group’s business lines and processes – and make sure all and comprising the Chief Executive Officers of key subsidiaries and business its main risks are covered – Crédit Agricole S.A. has created a structure lines, is responsible for driving and coordinating the Group’s CSR policies in composed of several bodies with complementary missions.

It relies on the CSR Department, which has six ensures that the Group’s strategy and business take its environmental and employees and reports to the Corporate Secretary, and on a network of social concerns into account. To that end, the Board of Directors relies on the 150 CSR contributors (20 CSR officers and reference persons) across entities work performed by its Specialised Committees, primarily the Strategy and and business lines.

It makes it possible to manage CSR challenges every year that will be implemented within each entity, including nine within different entities and promote the involvement of the Group’s projects defined specifically by each entity and three at Group level. To be executives and all its employees. Created in 2012, in 2019 FReD became eligible, the projects must focus on each of the three FReD pillars (“Fides”, the tool used to roll out and manage the societal and environmental “Respect” and “Demeter”) and diversified in terms of length: short term commitments made as part of the Group’s Ambitions 2022 project.

Every year, the FReD index measures the progress made, project by project, by calculating the change in rating between the current and previous year. It is then calculated by entity, and then consolidated at the Group level. In 2019, 15 entities contributed to this system and, for the seventh consecutive year, Crédit Agricole S.A. is publishing its Group index, which was 1.7 in 2019. FReD is an evolving tool. In 2019, two FReD IS AN INTERNAL SYSTEM FOR MEASURING entities tested it with the goal of integrating the official index beginning in AND MANAGING GROUP PROGRESS ON CSR MATTERS 2020.

FReD is also used by several entities to calculate 8 000 involved incentives and therefore affects the variable compensation of more than employees 10,000 employees.

In order to identify CSR challenges and the key risks for our activities, our business model and the geographical areas where we Key Risks operate, we used a methodology based on a systematic approach. The methodology and the key risks are presented on page 43 of this Report. Building on the three Pillars of its Ambitions 2022 plan, the Group has put policies and action plans in place to reduce the risks Policies and Action Plans identified and help customers move towards a more inclusive and less carbon-intensive economy.

Non-financial performance From increased responsibility to integrated responsibility 2 MAIN RISKS IDENTIFIED In order to identify CSR challenges and the main risks for our activities, Step 2: Complementary approach to define business model and locations where we operate, we used a methodology the scope of the CSR challenges based on a step-by-step approach: The issues defined in ISO 26000 and the subjects listed in section II, Article Step 1: Formalisation of non-financial areas defined R. 225-105 were combined with the four major areas of commitments by the Raison d’Être of the Group related to the Raison d’Être, which allowed us to identify around thirty non-financial challenges. This step led to the definition of four major themes for its commitments:  be the trusted partner of all its customers; Step 3: With regard to the most significant  a performance model articulated around human responsibility; CSR challenges for the Group, identification  a natural mobilisation for its territories; of the non-financial risks that could affect  a deliberate commitment to environmental and societal issues. our business and our stakeholders The objective of this step was to produce a list of 15 significant short-, mediumor long-term challenges and identify the potential non-financial risks related to each challenge. The general risks identified were then assessed on the basis of two criteria: their potential severity and their probability of occurrence. A time dimension was also used for certain risk factors that are less important today but could become more significant in the future. The assessment was made using “raw criteria” that did not include the Group’s risk mitigation mechanisms. This work was conducted by the Group’s CSR, Risk, Compliance and HR Departments. The main CSR challenges and risks are as follows: Extra-financial challenges Associated risks Policies for managing associated risks Combating corruption Fair competition Non-compliance and legal risk Ethical culture Fair practices in marketing, information and contracts After-sales service, assistance and resolution of claims Customer satisfaction and culture of excellence and disputes for consumers Protection of consumer data and privacy Ethical culture Non-compliance and legal risk Operational risks Adapting our offers to new uses Access to essential services Mutualist Commitment to inclusive development Deep managerial transformation Employment and employer/employee relations for empowerment Non-compliance and legal risk Working conditions and social protection Operational risks Physical risk: safety, security and prevention Strengthened environment of trust for mutual commitment of employees and the Company Non-compliance and legal risk Social dialogue Operational risks In-depth managerial transformation Development of human capital Non-compliance and legal risk for empowerment Promotion of corporate social responsibility Operational risks Responsible purchasing in the value chain (responsible purchasing) Non-compliance and legal risk Operational risks Vigilance Plan Duty of vigilance Physical risk: safety, security and prevention Responsible purchasing Climate risk Non-compliance and legal risk Green finance: one of the Group’s Keys Mitigation of climate changes and adaptation Operational risks to growth Climate risk Non-compliance and legal risk Protection of the environment, biodiversity and restoration Operational risks Direct environnemental footprint of natural habitats Physical risk: safety, security and prevention Climate risk Mutualist Commitment to inclusive development Improvement of the vision of the overall performance Non-compliance and legal risk Crédit Agricole: an influential player for a more of our counterparties (sustainable investments and lending) Operational risks inclusive and less carbon-intensive economy Refer to the glossary page 647 for the definition of the technical terms. l 2019 Universal registration document CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 43 2 Non-financial performance From increased responsibility to integrated responsibility KEY NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS Risk management policies Non-financial indicators 2017 2018 2019 2022 target Scope covered CUSTOMER PROJECT Customer satisfaction Net promoter score (NPS)(1) 7th 7th 5th 1st LCL and culture of excellence 4th 3rd 3rd 1st Regional Banks % of employees made aware N/D N/D 16.93% Crédit Agricole S.A.

To calculate its carbon footprint, Crédit Agricole follows the recommendations in the sectoral guide for the financial sector Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emissions, published by ADEME, ABC and ORSE. Produced in 2014 with the participation of some twenty financial institutions, NGOs and experts, the guide recommends that corporate and investment banks and universal banks use a macroeconomic approach (so-called top-down methodologies), which is the only way to guarantee all results are added together and therefore the accuracy of the resulting order of magnitude. Crédit Agricole deploys this approach worldwide using the P9XCA methodology, developed as part of a university research project (with École Polytechnique and University Paris Dauphine). The project revealed a footprint of around 120 million tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2018, an order of magnitude consistent with the Group’s market share in the financing of the French and global economies. With regard to this major difference, we believe it is important to point out that the methodology used by Crédit Agricole correlates, by construction, the sum of the carbon footprints of all global financial institutions with total global emissions, whereas the methodology used in the Oxfam study results in a sum equal to several times this level (around four to five times the global emissions, with the bias noted in the figures produced in the report).

Non-financial performance Societal Project: committing to a more inclusive and lower-carbon economy 2 THE AVAILABILITY OF NON-FINANCIAL DATA IS CRUCIAL TO THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE At the end of the year, the European Commission adopted a uniform classification system (a taxonomy) to assess an economic activity’s degree of environmental sustainability based on objective criteria. The Commission was assisted in its work by a group of high-level experts. Among other things, the work led to a solid definition of a sustainable activity. Specifically, an activity is sustainable if it contributes substantially to one (or more) environmental objectives, without causing significant harm to the environment and while complying with international standards of social law. This positive taxonomy was initially designed to identify sustainable investment activities and specifically those financed by so-called “green” funds. However, its scope of application is expected to extend quite quickly to financing activities. The European Commission has also decided to adopt new guidelines on corporate climate reporting, in accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Nevertheless, the availability, quality and traceability of non-financial data is a major challenge. The relevance and speed of the support provided by financial players for a decarbonised economy depend to a large extent on the relevance of the disclosures, which should include: 1) data provided by internal information systems. The Commission’s work in this case is a valuable aid in qualifying, codifying and comparing the impact generated by the financing provided; 2) data provided by the companies themselves, either directly or indirectly via non-financial rating agencies. Numerous improvements should increase the relevance of the taxonomy proposed by the Commission, while experimentation will also cause some adjustments. For this reason, Crédit Agricole supports the European Commission’s efforts to make any non-financial corporate disclosures that significantly affect climate change available, public and verifiable. In 2020, the Group will implement an innovative information system to manage and publish this non-financial data. Managing and reducing direct and indirect carbon footprints Policy Following the adoption of several measures, including the use of 100% renewable electricity at all French facilities, Crédit Agricole S.A. has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, encompassing energy (in terms of square metres) and transportation (in terms of FTE) for the period from 2016 to 2020. This requires each Group entity to implement action plans to reduce energy consumption in their buildings and data centres, as well as the carbon footprint of employee travel. These action plans have been successful as the greenhouse gas emissions of scope 1 and scope 2 have decreased by 7% and 5% from 2018 to 2019. Action plans and results Since 2007, energy consumption has been monitored at all Crédit Agricole S.A. entities in France and abroad.

Non-financial performance Cross-reference table 2 NOTE ON METHODOLOGY The scope of the disclosures and data published in this Statement of Non-Financial Performance covers all fully consolidated entities with employees. Each item presented in this document is accompanied by an indication of the scope of employees covered (as a percentage of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees at year-end). Data relating to the Regional Banks is not included in this report (apart from some action plans). The consolidated data cover one calendar year, from 1 January to 31 December. The contents of this Statement were compiled from surveys of CSR managers, Human Resource Directors and various departments of Crédit Agricole S.A., across a broad representative sample of Crédit Agricole Group entities. As part of our ongoing policy to improve the reliability of social indicators, once again this year we asked our Statutory Auditors to conduct an in-depth examination of our voluntarily published social indicators. This work is the subject of an independent reasonable assurance report. Following an analysis to identify CSR issues and main risks (see introduction to this chapter), the following topics were not identified by the Group as posing the highest risk (with respect to its activities and geographical locations): collective bargaining agreements entered into by the Company and their impact on the Company’s economic performance and employee working conditions; actions aimed at combating discrimination and promoting diversity and measures taken to support people with disabilities; societal commitments in favour of sustainable development, the circular economy and the battle against food waste; respect for animal welfare; and responsible, fair and sustainable food. Nevertheless, the Group has implemented policies and action plans to address these important issues. Employment reporting  Unless otherwise stated, the population under review is that of “working” employees. The notion of working implies: −− a legal tie in the form of a standard fixed-term or permanent employment contract (or similar abroad); −− inclusion on the payroll and in the position on the last day of the period; −− up until 2018, a working time percentage of 50% or more. This condition was removed from the data starting in 2019.  Unless otherwise stated, the data are presented from the employer’s viewpoint and not the beneficiary’s viewpoint. The difference relates to employees seconded by one entity to another (with no change in the employment contract) who report to their host entity from the beneficiary’s viewpoint and to their contracting entity from the employer’s viewpoint.  From 2018 onwards, training and absenteeism data are calculated over 12 months. However, in order to take difficulties faced by some of the entities into account, it is possible, in select cases and on an exceptional basis, to substitute the value of the 12th month by extrapolating it according to the first 11 months. The extrapolation must be an interim version toward full 12-month reporting in accordance with regulatory requirements. Environmental and societal reporting  An exclusion threshold was used to compensate for difficulties collecting information on entities with fewer than 100 FTEs (although excluding these entities still made it possible to cover over 80% of the workforce in the financial consolidation scope). It should be noted that the entities Crédit Agricole Srbija, Crédit Agricole Romania, Santander Securities Services S.A., Kas Bank NV and Europejski Fundusz Leasingowy (EFL) did not communicate data in 2019. A progress plan was defined in order to collect data from these entities.  Environmental data for 2019 covers France and subsidiaries with more than 100 employees.  CO emissions are calculated using the benchmark emission factors of the International Energy Agency for electricity (excluding France). For 2 entities in France, the emission factor used is 0.006kg CO2eq/KWh, the Group having signed a national contract with EDF in 2015 for the supply of 100% renewable energy of French origin (mainly from hydropower). For other types of energy, emission factors used are those of DEFRA (British Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and the Ademe (French agency for environment and energy management) Carbon Base. For journeys by air, the emission factor takes into account emissions related to radiative forcing.

This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities namely CACEIS Luxembourg, Cariparma, Credit Agricole Bank, Crédit Agricole Bank Polska S.A., Crédit Agricole Leasing & Factoring, Crédit Agricole S.A. as well as in the head office of Crédit Agricole S.A. for information consolidated at Group level or specific information related to entities not listed above, and covers between 24% and 100% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests;  we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important;  we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.

Corporate governance 4. Reward policy 3 INTERVIEW – BÉNÉDICTE CHRÉTIEN, HEAD OF HUMAN RESOURCES In June 2019, Crédit Agricole S.A. launched its 2022 Medium-Term Plan (MTP). What are the main human resources issues at stake? The discussions on the new MTP was an opportunity to express, for the first time, the Raison d'Être of the Crédit Agricole Group: “Working every day in the interest of our customers and society”. This is what motivates the Group's employees on a daily basis, committed to a relationship of trust and closeness to our stakeholders the key to our universal banking model. With this in mind, the 2022 Medium-Term Plan aims to amplify and accelerate the Group's profitable and responsible growth trajectory, based on three inseparable pillars: a Customer Project, a Human-centric Project and a Societal Project. To become the preferred bank for individuals, entrepreneurs and businesses alike, we reaffirm the place of the Human factor in an increasingly digitalised economy. Our Human-centric Project seeks to offer our customers direct access to an empowered relationship manager, using discernment and having more responsibilities to answer more quickly to customers needs. It is based on three pillars: managerial transformation, to empower our employees; organisational transformation, to increase customer proximity; and strengthening the social pact, for better initiatives, with a mutual commitment from the employee and the Company. With a strong ambition: to become the preferred employer in financial services in France and among the top five in Europe. Very concretely, how does the Human-centric Project of Crédit Agricole S.A. present itself? A very large number of activities have already been launched. On the first pillar, that of managerial transformation, a program is being deployed to train our executives in the new leadership model. It will next be rolled out in each of our entities, to all our managers. We have also deployed an online platform of philosophical content for all our employees that can inspire and clarify our day-to-day management actions. In terms of organisational transformation, we need to streamline our organisation and decision-making processes: 80% of decisions will be made in our retail banking networks in France, working as closely as possible with the customers. We also focus on the development of mobility, where we have forged partnerships with startups to enhance the skills of our employees. Finally, we are consolidating the framework of trust offered to our employees by pursuing a social dialogue based on transparency and partnership. In 2019, we signed a framework agreement with the international trade union federation UNI Global Union, establishing an identical social base for all our employees. The first concrete implementation of this agreement is the introduction of 16 weeks of paid maternity leave throughout the world. Strong commitments in terms of gender diversity, social diversity and integration have also been made, such as accelerating the increase in the number of women in our decision-making bodies and the internationalisation of our talent pools, welcoming 300 interns who are current year 10 students from the REP and REP+ priority education areas each year and continuing our recruitment efforts in favour of people with disabilities. What are the consequences of the Human-centric Project on the Group's reward policy? Empowering employees, strengthening our customer focus, developing a framework of trust: these topics must also be addressed from the perspective of employee reward, which encompasses both compensation and benefits. Our reward policy was the subject of major changes this year: alignment of annual variable compensation criteria with the objectives of the MTP, in particular the Human-centric Project; introduction of a free share allocation scheme, aimed in particular at young talent and rare skills; reinforcement of the CSR criteria in the compensation of all senior executives. These changes are part of an approach to rewards based on fairness and transparency, characterised by a common framework and rules specific to each profession or population. After all, rewards are an expression of our values. At the same time, the employee shareholding scheme, which is now annual, continues to attract internal support: nearly 20,500 employees subscribed to the capital increase in 2019, bringing the share of Crédit Agricole S.A. held by employees to 4.68%.

REWARDS FOR ALL EMPLOYEES IMPORTANT TO KNOW  Reward combines elements of compensation in the strict sense of the word, that have been submitted to the vote of shareholders, as well as social benefits and peripheral compensation.  Bearer of the values of the Group, the reward policy is based on fairness and common rules for all employees, in compliance with the regulatory corpus specific to the financial sector.  The reward policy is at the service of the Group's Raison d'Être, of its Group Project and 2022 Medium-Term Plan and, in particular, of its Human-centric Project, providing its customers direct access to a local customer relations manager. Through the implementation of free share grants and the annualisation of capital increases reserved for employees, the reward policy supports the three founding principles of the Human-centric Project: empowerment, outreach and initiative-taking. 4.1.1. Approach and objectives of the reward policy Faithful to its mutualist values and founding cooperative principles, Crédit Agricole S.A. has defined a responsible reward policy, serving its purpose: “Working every day in the interest of our customers and society” and its 2022 Medium-Term Plan. It strives to reconcile the expectations of all its stakeholders – customers, employees, service providers, associations, public authorities, shareholders – with the demands of a competitive market in order to position us as the leader in retail banking. The Group bases the compensation of employees and executive managers on objective foundations, which reflect the performance and long-term responsibility of the organisation. Its policy participates in the three founding principles of the Human-centric Project: empowering employees, strengthening our customer focus and developing a framework of trust; and meets four objectives: Objectives Implementation procedures Attracting, motivating and retaining  Respecting the values of fairness and merit the talent that the Group needs  Consistency and competitiveness with reference markets and country laws in terms of rewards Recognising individual and  Taking account of skill sets, specific business factors and the performance of the entity and of the Group collective performance over time  Employee empowerment, through annual and long-term variable compensation Aligning the interests of employees  Payment of deferred variable compensation over three years using share-linked instruments with those of Crédit Agricole S.A.  Payment of long-term compensation in the form of free share grants as from 2020 and/or in the form and its shareholders of instruments linked to the share price  Promoting employee savings and shareholding, a collective variable compensation system to enable the sharing of created value, through capital increases reserved for employees annual since 2018 Promoting sound and efficient risk  Respecting the declaration and risk appetite framework approved by Group governance management  Setting variable compensation consistent with the ability of Group entities to strengthen their equity capital  Taking account of all risks, including the liquidity risk, and the cost of capital  Guaranteed bonuses authorised only on recruitment and for a period that may not exceed one year, subject to the deferred compensation plan applicable over the financial year 174 l CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2019 Universal Registration Document Refer to the glossary page 647 for the definition of the technical terms.

The contribution represents Medium-Term Plan an entity’s capacity to fund bonuses, taking into account the cost of risk, the cost of capital and the cost of liquidity. It is defined as: Revenues(1) – direct and indirect expenses before bonuses – cost of risk – cost of capital before tax –––––––––––––––––––––––––-–-––––––– = Contribution The payout ratio represents the portion of the Contribution that the entity wants to pay out in bonuses. It is dependent on the entity’s financial performance and the practices of competing companies operating in comparable businesses. The individual award of variable compensation is defined in compliance with regulatory principles. The amounts must not hamper the ability of Group entities to strengthen their equity as necessary. As well as economic and financial criteria, the performance assessment takes all risks into account, including liquidity risk, as well as the cost of capital. Variable compensation is related directly to annual performance. Unsatisfactory performance, failure to comply with rules and procedures or at-risk behaviour have a direct impact on variable compensation. Individual variable compensation (RVP) Employees and executive managers:  central support functions;  retail banking;  specialised financial services;  insurance;  real estate;  other. Individual variable compensation (RVP) reflects the employee’s individual performance, assessed by line management on the basis of the attainment of individual and/or collective objectives. The objectives are described precisely and measurable over the year. They systematically take into account the customer, employee and societal aspects of activities. The degree of attainment or exceeding of objectives is the principal criterion for the award of RVP. It is supplemented by a qualitative assessment of how these objectives were achieved (assuming responsibility, discernment, autonomy, cooperation, commitment, management, etc.). Bonus Employees and executive managers:  corporate and investment banking;  wealth management;  asset management;  capital investment. The award of a bonus is decided upon by line management based on a formal annual individual performance appraisal, which looks at the achievement of both quantitative and qualitative objectives. There is therefore no direct and automatic link between the level of financial results of an employee and their variable compensation level. Employees are evaluated on their results, those of their activity and the conditions under which such results have been achieved. Similarly to individual variable compensation, targets are clearly defined and measurable over the year. Qualitative objectives are individualised, related to the professional activity and to the level of responsibility. They include the quality of risk management, resourced allocated, the behaviours (assuming responsibility, discernment, autonomy, cooperation, commitment, management, etc.) implemented to achieve results. Guaranteed variable Employees compensation restrictions Executive managers Guaranteed variable compensation is strictly limited to new hires, for a period that may not exceed one year. Guaranteed variable compensation is awarded subject to the deferred compensation plan applicable to the financial year. Accordingly, all rules on variable compensation for identified staff (deferred payment schedule, performance conditions and reporting) also apply to guaranteed bonuses. (1) It is understood that, by definition, revenues are calculated net of the cost of liquidity.

This agreement, which concretises the ambitions of the Human-centric Project of the 2022 Medium-Term Plan, focuses on human rights, fundamental labour rights and the development of social dialogue, with concrete impacts on the Group's reward policy. In particular, it includes a strong commitment to parenthood, establishing the principle of 16 weeks paid maternity leave for all employees. The agreement also provides for commitments in favour of employee benefits (short and long-term disability, death and health), with the first step being to draw up an inventory of all systems in effect at the Group's entities.

This means that their individual variable compensation comes either from the individual variable compensation plan (RVP) or from the bonus system. As for all employees, the system on which they are dependent is defined according to their home entities. Individual variable compensation/bonus All executive managers Annual variable compensation is calculated based on two sets of criteria:  50% on the basis of financial criteria, in line with those of the 2022 Medium-Term Plan, with criteria based on Crédit Agricole S.A.’s scope of responsibility in terms of underlying net income Group share, cost/income ratio excluding SRF and RoTEand on the scope of responsibility of the senior executive;  50% on non-financial criteria, in line with the Group’s Customer, Human-centric, and Societal Projects and which measure value creation: −− customer: satisfaction with the services and advice provided, adaptation of offers to new uses, innovation engagement, −− human: ability to attract, develop and retain employees, and to initiate managerial transformation to create a framework of greater trust and confidence, −− social: mutualist and societal commitment, respect for values beyond legal obligations, development of green finance.

Domestic demand pace since the rebound following the global financial crisis of 2008/2009. remained the main driver, with strong contributions from household This slowdown is obviously the result of strong trends affecting, albeit consumption (1.8 percentage point) and public expenditure (0.4 point), unevenly, all countries and elements specific to each economy or each but a marked decline in productive investment (0.2 point) and a negative sector. In addition to the general trends amplifying the cyclical and structural contribution from foreign trade (-0.2 point). While the economy is at full slowdowns already at work (major developed economies and China) there employment (with an unemployment rate of 3.5% at the end of 2019), are weaknesses specific to certain major emerging countries (Brazil, India, inflation remained moderate.

Reports of non-compliance that strongly mobilise the Compliance department, on the system are provided to the governance bodies of the entities and the and more broadly all Group stakeholders: employees, managers and Group.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement provided for by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 823-10 of said Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the financial statements of the information contained in this statement which has to be subject to a report by an independent third party. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Crédit Agricole SA by your Annual General Meeting held on May 19, 2004 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and in 1985 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres. As at December 31, 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres were in the 16th and 35th of total uninterrupted engagement, respectively. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for preparing consolidated financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Objective and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company’s management. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements; Refer to the glossary page 647 for the definition of the technical terms. l 2019 Universal registration document CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 563 6 Consolidated Financial Statements Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements  assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;  evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon. Report to the Audit Committee We submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit.

REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed Statutory Auditors of Crédit Agricole SA by your General Meeting of Shareholders held on 19 May 2004 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and in 1985 for ERNST & YOUNG et Autres. At 31 December 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and ERNST & YOUNG et Autres were in the sixteenth and the thirty-fifth consecutive year of their engagement, respectively. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for preparing financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with French accounting principles, and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 614 l CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2019 Universal registration document Refer to the glossary page 647 for the definition of the technical terms. PARENT COMPAGNY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ﻿Statutory Auditors’ report on the financial statements 7 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Objective and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company’s management. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:  identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;  obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;  assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;  evaluate the overall presentation of the financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit Committee.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. Annual General Meeting held to approve the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2018 To the General Meeting of Shareholders of Crédit Agricole S.A., In our capacity as statutory auditors of your Company, we hereby present to you our report on related party agreements. We are required to inform you, on the basis of the information provided to us, of the terms and conditions of those agreements indicated to us, or that we may have identified in the performance of our engagement, as well as the reasons justifying why they benefit the Company. We are not required to give our opinion as to whether they are beneficial or appropriate or to ascertain the existence of other agreements. It is your responsibility, in accordance with Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), to assess the relevance of these agreements prior to their approval. We are also required, where applicable, to inform you in accordance with Article R. 225-31 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) of the continuation of the implementation, during the year ended December 31, 2019, of the agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting. We performed those procedures which we deemed necessary in compliance with professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie nationale des commissaires aux comptes) relating to this type of engagement. These procedures consisted in verifying the consistency of the information provided to us with the relevant source documents. AGREEMENTS SUBMITTED FOR APPROVAL TO THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING In accordance with Article L. 225-40 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been notified of the following related party agreements which received prior authorization from your Board of Directors. With Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Crédit Agricole S.A.’s subsidiary Persons concerned Ms Catherine Pourre and Ms Françoise Gri, common directors, and Mr Philippe Brassac and Mr François Thibault, chief executive officer or directors of Crédit Agricole S.A. and chairman or directors of Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank Nature and purpose The sale agreement to CA CIB of Visa Inc. “Class C” preferred shares hold by 6 entities of Group Crédit Agricole have been authorized by your Board of Directors as at August 1st, 2019, due to common directors. Given the common directors between Crédit Agricole S.A. and CA CIB, this agreement falls into the scope of related parties’ agreements defined by the Article L.225-38 of French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Although the discount applied to Visa shares’ fair value booked in the balance sheet stands within the market range adopted by concerned European banks, the transaction, by its nature, is unusual and isolated which complexifies the qualification of “usual transaction concluded in normal market condition”, which would exclude the transaction from the definition enforces by Article L.225-39 of French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Conditions Transactions related to C shares are highly regulated. It is only allowed between banks which already hold the shares or between controlled subsidiaries of a Group among which an entity is a holder. Despite a holding percentage less than 100%, diligences have been realized with Visa to ensure that transactions considered by LCL and Crédit Agricole S.A. with Crédit Agricole CIB was possible. Reasons justifying why the Company benefits from this agreement Your Board of Directors gave the following reasons: The transaction enables to freeze a gross added value close to MEUR 100 for C shares holders, which multiply the shares value by 2,3 within 3 years. For Crédit Agricole S.A., the frozen value amounted to approximatively MEUR 35. Since it is an internal reclassification and given that the transaction permits a risk transfer carried by the entities of the Group Credit Agricole on the entity which has the expertise to manage, the impact should be neutral or advantageous to the shareholders, including minority shareholders. 638 l CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2019 Universal registration document Refer to the glossary page 647 for the definition of the technical terms. gEnEral Information Statutory auditors’ report on related party agreements 8 AGREEMENTS PREVIOUSLY APPROVED BY THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING In accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), we have been notified that the implementation of the following agreements, which were approved by the Annual General Meeting in prior years, continued during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Noting, in addition to the presence of common directors, that the rules of governance described above do not reflect the division of the capital between the Regional Banks and their subsidiaries (36%) and the Crédit Agricole S.A. group (64%), it was considered that this Shareholders’ Agreement constituted a regulated agreement within the meaning of the provisions of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). The Shareholders’ Agreement has been authorized by your Board of Directors at its meeting on May 14, 2018.

Nature and purpose In its meeting held on December 19, 2017, your Board of Directors authorized the transfer of your Company’s IT activities (MSI) to Global IT (GIT) which performs the same assignments for the Crédit Agricole CIB scope. The transfer itself does not constitute a regulated agreement, but within the framework of this operation, your Company and Crédit Agricole CIB set up a temporary billing and collection mandate which does fall within the scope of section 2 of Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to regulated agreements. As such, this mandate was authorized by the Board of Directors in its meeting held on December 19, 2017, separately from the overall authorization of the transfer of business. Conditions During a transition period of six to twelve months from the date of transfer, some of the Crédit Agricole Group entities may benefit from the services of MSI, via signed quotations. The billing and collection services would be carried out by your Company within the scope of a billing and collection mandate which notably includes the guarantee by your Company to Crédit Agricole CIB concerning the collection, from the entities benefiting from these services, of the amounts billed by your Company in the name and on behalf of Crédit Agricole CIB. At the end of this transition period, CA-CIB may decide, if appropriate, to perform the services for the other Group entities, through Progica or another entity of the Crédit Agricole Group, depending on the result of the services performed during the transition period, regulatory changes and any other potential reorganization of activities within the Crédit Agricole Group.
