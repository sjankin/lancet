I am also praying that everyone who is being forced to lead a daily life of constraint because of this pandemic can resume their normal way of living as soon as possible. I would like to express my deepest gratitude to medical professionals and others for their dedicated efforts to prevent the further spread of the disease and keep society as safe as possible. We have been working to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and secure business continuity by giving the highest priority to the well-being of people. We are still doing our utmost to fulfill our social responsibility especially by keeping the supply of products and services uninterrupted, contributing services to host communities and society at large, and safeguarding the health and safety of employees of the Nitto Group as well as their family members. They say that we will have to maintain socioeconomic activities while simultaneously taking preventive measures against the spread of infection, and I am afraid that this battle against COVID-19 is going to be a long one. We at the Nitto Group have renewed our determination to overcome this difficulty through concerted efforts by all with stakeholders. Responding to Change Flexibly to Persevere in an Uncertain Time Hideo Takasaki Representative Director, President The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought with it economic stagnation and changes in CEO, COO consumer behavior, which is increasing the uncertainty of the future. Nitto Denko Corporation Throughout its more than a century-long history, the Nitto Group has been able to sustain its growth through numerous tribulations. Faced with this latest hardship, we hope to keep moving forward by flexibly coping with change. When the whole world plunged into a recession in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008, we implemented drastic reforms under the keywords of “Mu-Gen-Dai”: “Mu (eliminating),” “Gen (reducing),” and “Dai (substituting).” At that time, we extensively examined what in our everyday jobs, equipment, and systems could be “eliminated,” “reduced,” or “substituted.” With this approach, we were able to make a turnaround earlier than expected. Going forward, we will streamline the things that we should continue doing, and replace what needs changing with novel ideas, in an attempt to wade through this time of uncertainty. 11 Nitto Group Integrated Report 2020 12 Management Profile Top Message Business Models Strategies Foundations Governance Data Section Top Message Leveraging Our Strengths to Sustain Growth Building a Revenue Base Immune to External Environments For us to keep growing as we cope with changes, I believe that it is important to return to What underpins continual growth is a solid revenue base that is unaffected by external our strengths.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is projected to change people’s values and industrial structures, which in turn will accelerate various social shifts. History tells us that infectious diseases inevitably impair the economy and at the same time trigger paradigm shifts that end Nitto Group’s Determination to Manufacture Responsibly up giving rise to new needs and industries. As such, we must be able to change to adapt to a new environment. We need to set our direction toward a new growth phase for the Nitto Group without being complacent within the In every business activity that we undertake, the safety of our employees is an overriding status quo. priority.

At the Nitto Group, we do not regard considerations for the environment and society as a Remaining faithful to our brand slogan, “Innovation for Customers,” we will continue cost factor, but instead, as a necessary investment for enhancing our corporate value. creating new values and enhancing corporate value over the long term by meeting the To successfully invest in a way that results in a positive effect on the environment and expectations of our many stakeholders, while amazing and inspiring our customers. society, we need to base our decisions on a far-sighted perspective. We have thus set up a unique scheme called “management fund,” which allows us to make investment decisions related to the environment and safety for the good of the entire Group. As a gesture of responsible corporate behavior, in February 2020, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact in support of its Ten Principles on human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption. In compliance with these universal principles, we will engage in manufacturing in a responsible manner to realize a sustainable society. Addressing Material Issues for Sustainability in the Context of Business Activities In fiscal 2019, we identified “material issues for sustainability,” which present social issues for which solutions must be prioritized. We will make greater efforts to ensure that those issues will be taken into account in our business activities so that each and every member of the Group demonstrates a sense of ownership and works as one to offer solutions to these issues. 15 Nitto Group Integrated Report 2020 16 Management Profile Top Message Business Models Strategies Foundations Governance Data Section What Makes the Nitto Group Unique Sanshin Activities Niche Top Strategy Sanshin Activities stimulating new demand through Shooting for the leading share by leveraging proprietary technologies in the development of new applications and new products niche markets where we have a competitive advantage Finding “new” applications for existing products and then adding new Market The Niche Top strategy is Nitto’s unique focus/differentiation strategy, under which we technologies to them or using new technologies to develop “new” products Existing New pour our management resources into niche market spaces where we can tap into our and then expanding their applications, thereby creating “new” demand – proprietary technologies and maximize our competitive advantage in the ever-growing New product New demand Literally translated as “three new activities,” Sanshin Activities is Nitto Group’s New development creation (-changing) market.
