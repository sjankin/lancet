LAMMHULTS DESIGN GROUP AB | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 | 2 A word from the CEO on sustainability in 2019 Design for a circular economy Design for a circular economy represents one of the most pressing realignments of our times. Leading a group in which design has always been one of the guiding principles and in which innovation and entrepreneurship are cornerstones, provides energy and confidence in the future. And these provide scope not only for creativity and innovation, which are both prerequisites for the transition to circularity and sustainable growth. They are also cornerstones for Lammhults Design Group and our development of products and services. The transition to supporting a circular economy is a key element in in the Swedish province of Småland, famous for its traditions of our strategy. In leading the transition with products and solutions frugality, housekeeping with resources is in our DNA. This is true in all that meet stringent requirements, we perceive favourable business areas. To limit the environmental impact from the company’s vehicle opportunities. fleet, approved models are now restricted to hybrid or fully electric cars. All aspects of our operations are to be pervaded by the insight Increased awareness of the importance and influence of furniture and consideration that continue to make us an attractive choice for results in further consideration when choosing furniture. This means our customers, employees, as well as for our planet. that furnishings for the conference facilities and workplaces of the future will be subject to increasingly stringent requirements. In our sustainability work, we act throughout the value chain, from Furniture shall not only meet demands on function, quality and suppliers to customers. Our sustainability work is governed by ISO useful lifetime. To extend their useful lifetime, it should also be 26000, while the ten principles of the Global Compact also provide a possible to upgrade items of furniture with reusable materials and base. We prioritise our resources based on a perspective of risk and components. For us, an important driving force is being able to impact. provide furniture and fittings that, besides meeting requirements of circularity, contribute to a pleasant and creative working Sweden’s newly formed Delegation for Circular Economy has staked environment for our customers. We develop furniture that makes out the path for continued efforts for sustainable and innovative for productive meetings, which are, in turn, pieces of the transition business. The Delegation prioritises three areas: plastics, public puzzle. This is an urgent mission, in which we perceive favourable procurement and design for circularity. The EU Commission that opportunities for growth. Customers, employees and partners are all took office in December has chosen to prioritise a “Green deal for the participating in the transition and appreciate our core values. EU”, in which the transition to a circular economy forms one of the cornerstones. Our ambition is to continue being part of the solution. The essence of circular design entails creating products using renewable, recyclable or recycled materials, to extend the useful lifetime of the products, making them repairable and reducing waste in materials, energy and chemicals in production.

Lammhults Biblioteksdesign 2019 Overarching sustainability objectives Lammhults Design Group’s strategy for the immediate years ahead selects five of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals where we are best placed to make a difference. These are SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 5 (Gender equality), SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth), SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) and SDG 15 (Life on land). We work in accordance with the established sustainability targets and the associated key performance indicators to achieve sustainable development in business and society. Alongside the established Codes of Conduct and policy documents, these are used to guide and prioritise the sustainability efforts of the companies. Of the 169 sub-goals that comprise AGENDA 2030, our strategy GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING focuses on ten of them, which can be summarised under three Ensure a healthy life and promote points well-being for all and for all age • Products with superior environmental performance and groups circular design • Environmentally-intelligent and climate-intelligent GENDER EQUALITY operations and suppliers • Favourable working environment Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls AGENDA FOR TRANSITION TO CIRCULARITY A central element of the sustainability agenda for all of DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH Lammhults Design Group’s subsidiaries involves transitioning to increased circularity.

The following year it received “Awards for design excellence”, which are awarded annually by Design og Arkitektur Norge (DOGA). The chair has been a major success, with more than 50,000 having been sold. Ten years later, in September 2019, Clint Cover was launched in connection with Designers Saturday in Oslo. Clint Cover is available in many different colours and materials, the purpose of which is to extend the useful life of Clint chairs while encouraging more sustainable consumption with regard to furniture. UP-CYCLING IS MORE THAN A TREND A FUNCTIONAL AND AESTHETIC LIFE “Up-cycling” means reusing a product for a new purpose or adding Society’s increased focus on sustainability requires a growing new to create a new product.

The functional life span is very long while the aesthetic life span is shorter. “If you are restoring furniture, some of the climate benefits will be lost in logistics to and from the factory.

Design Daniel Lavonius Jarefeldt and Josef Zetterman Morgana, 2018 LAMMHULTS DESIGN GROUP AB | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 | 11 Materiality analysis We focus on generating value by prioritising what is of material importance for our stakeholders. The transition to a circular economy is one of the cornerstones. International efforts have been initiated to develop a new ISO standard for the Circular Economy concept, aimed at establishing shared definitions and concepts, as well as uniform measures. Efforts in industrial organisations and in working groups within the EU for environmentally appropriate procurement of furniture has resulted in several reports and analyses of the requirements and priorities that have the greatest effect on the environment and climate, and of the criteria that should apply to furniture. Group companies are members of industrial associations in the countries in which we operate. In Sweden, TMF (an association of woodworking and furniture companies) is conducting extensive efforts on environmental and sustainability issues. Möbelfakta is an established and updated reference and labelling system for furniture imposing strict demands on function, longevity, environmental consideration and social responsibility. The environmental demands reflect stringent external requirements that are updated regularly and the technical requirements are based on international product standards (CEN and ISO), while the social responsibility requirements are based on the directives of the UN Global Compact. Since 2014, Lammhults Design Group has supported the UN Global Compact in its work on human rights, working conditions, the environment and anti-corruption, which is crucial for sustainable development. The results of our materiality analysis indicate three areas of focus for the strategy period, relating to the identified global sustainability goals.

Lammhults Design Group reports annually on its sustainability work, simultaneously with the production of the Annual Report for the preceding calendar year. Reading references appear in the appendix (see GRIContent Index) to this report by means of a GRI cross-reference table. Parts of the information can be found in the Annual Report and reference is made to this where appropriate. Financial and social indicators encompass the entire Group. For environmental aspects, all production and distribution units are included. The sales companies have only a marginal impact on the environmental indicators. The environmental impact of subcontractors’ factories is not covered by the report. The Sustainability Report at hand has not been subject to external review. Morgana AB conducts operations subject to a duty of notification under the Swedish Environmental Code, the Ordinance concerning environmentally hazardous activities and the protection of public health (1998:899). Environmental impact primarily constitutes emissions of solvents from the coating process. A transition to UV-cured coatings has reduced solvent emissions. None of the Group’s other companies is engaged in operations that in themselves may be classified as particularly hazardous to the environment, and as a result no duty of licensing or notification under the Swedish Environmental Code applies.
