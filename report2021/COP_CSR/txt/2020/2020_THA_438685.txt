The CSR Committee collected old calendars and donated them to the Bangkok School for the Blind located at Ratchathewi Road, Bangkok, on two occasions, one on February 15, 2019, and another on March 20, 2019, to produce braille books for instruction media for students and people who are visually impaired at the Foundation of the Blind in Thailand. This is another important step for Thai education administrators in helping decrease the disparity of education by showing that physical disability shall not disrupt the fundamental education. Activity 2: Build a new school building for Ban Mae Hoi School, Tambon Mae Na Jon, Amphoe Mae Chaem, Chiang Mai province, and handed over the building to the school, March 2, 2019. Ban Mae Hoi School is located in Amphoe Mae Chaem, Chiang Mai province. The school is in the Chiang Mai Primary Educational Service Area Office 6. It is a small school situated on a high mountain that is difficult to traverse due to the rough road and highly sloping land. The school provides classes from primary levels 1-6. It has 57 students, with 14 who reside at the school. The parents and villagers are members of the Karen hilltribe who are poor and mostly engage in agricultural. The school lacks a sufficient number of classrooms as there is only one school building, which is in a dilapidated condition since it was built over 20 years ago. The building is rundown, the ceiling and wood poles are damaged by termites, and rainwater leaks through the ceiling into the classroom, causing a concern that the school building could collapse. One classroom is used for 2 classes at the same time. 59 The Company provided support to construct the new school building, comprising 4 classrooms each 7 meters x 28 meters with a budget of Bt955,097. The building was officially handed over to the school on March 2, 2019. Activity 3: Cash donation for the purchase of medical equipment to Nong Bua Lamphu hospital, Amphoe Muang, Nong Bua Lamphu province, for Bt1,000,000, on March 17, 2019.

The Company helped support the project by obtaining medical equipment by donating Bt1,000,000 to the hospital on March 17, 2019, which comprised: • 1 transport incubator valued at Bt500,000 • 1 radiant warmer valued at Bt500,000 Activity 4: Provide plastic bottles to produce monk robes to Wat Chakdaeng, Tambon Songkanong, Amphoe PraPradaeng, SamutPrakan provinvce, on June 8, 2019 and July 7, 2019. Wat Chakdaeng, whose abbot is Phra Maha PranomThama LungKalo, has a project to recycle robes by accepting donations of plastic garbage, which is sorted and recycled to produce monk robes. Fifteen plastic bottles can make one robe, and 60 bottles can produce one set of three garments. The project is aimed at reducing the volume of plastic garbage and to be a center for the study of integrated waste management for the community. The Company took part in this project in order to help reduce environmental pollution by PR on accepting donations of plastic bottles for the temple. The Company made 2 deliveries, one on June 8, 2019, and one on July 7, 2019. 60 Activity 5: Donation for monthly school expense of Bt20,000 per month to Wannawit school, Khlong Toei, Bangkok, starting from July to December, 2019. Wannawit School is a small private school on nearly 3 rai of land located in the middle of Sukhumvit Soi 8, which is an expensive residential area in Bangkok. It has 514 students and 37 teachers. Most students reside in the Khlong Toei community area where parents are employed as laborers, are poor and do not have enough money to send their children to another school. Wannawit School collects a fee of Bt1,702 per school term for the primary level and Bt1,317.50 per school term for Mathayom levels 1-3, and as a result the school does not have enough funds to cover its monthly expenses. The Company realizes the importance of education for children in the community, and it thus made a donation of Bt20,000 each month to support the school’s expenses from July to December 2019. Activity 6: Distributed survival kits to flood victims at Tambon Bung Mai, Ubon Ratchathani province, on October 5, 2019. Tropical storms ‘Podul’ and ‘Kajiki’ resulted in flash floods and landslides in the Northeast of Thailand from August 23, 2019, onward. There were 378,409 families affected and 29 deaths, and houses, buildings, schools, and temples were severely damaged. The government and private sector provided assistance in accelerating in water drainage and building temporally shelters. However, even after the floods subsided on September 15, many areas were still lacking public utilities, particularly in Ubon Ratchathani province. 61 The Company together with staff distributed survival kits, rice and dried food to people who were impacted by the flood in Amphoe Warinchamrap, Ubon Ratchathani province. On October 5, 2019, the company also helped clean the road, buildings and houses in the village, and distributed 200 survival kits and 2,400 bottles of drinking water. 62 Activity 7: Donation to support a project to restore occupational skills and social welfare to become selfsupporting for patients with autism at Yuwaprasart Waithayopathum Psychiartric Hospital, Amphoe Mueang, Samut Prakarn province. Yuwaprasart Waithayopathum Hospital provides psychiatric care for 211 patients both children and teenagers on average every day on an inpatient basis. The hospital initiated a project to develop social and occupational skills of patients with autism to help them obtain employment. The project began in 2012 and currently has 75 participants and 62 employed in more than 20 companies. Due to a rather limited number of occupations available, however, the hospital is seeking to provide more occupations to help patients become self-supporting, convince them of their self-worth, instill a feeling of self-esteem, create recognition in the family, relieve the burden on health care facilities from taking care of patients, and reduce bias against persons suffering from autism in society. The Company took part in a project to develop social and occupational skills for patients suffering from autism by donating B254,530 in support of the following training for occupational skills: YUWA Coffee shop, 10 persons Bt97,080 Thai desert making, 15 persons Bt45,000 Making Fabric purse and fabric painting, 5 persons Bt32,695 Making of Doormats made of cloth rags and Hula-hoops, 10 persons Bt22,955 Glass painting, 6 persons Bt20,800 Cleaning and gardening, 10 persons Bt36,000 Activity 8: Donation for an educational fund, school supplies, sport equipment, water filters, maintenance of the canteen and toilet and recreational activity with students at Ban Nong Peeknok School, Tambon Huai Khun Ram, Amphoe Phatthana Nikhom, Lop Buri province, on November 23, 2019. Ban Nong Peeknok School is located in Amphoe Phatthana Nikhom, Lop Buri province. The school provides classes from kindergarten to primary level 6. It has 6 teachers, 1 volunteer teacher and 65 students. The school is far from the village, and therefore school development is slow. Most students come from poor agricultural families, and some have very little employment. During the summer months when agriculture is not possible, children must live with their grandparents while the parents seek work in nearby provinces. The Company donated Bt20,000 for educational fund, and provided school supplies, stationery, sports equipment and water filters for students. In addition, staff of the Company painted the canteen and toilets and arranged recreational activity with the students on November 23, 2019. 63 Activity 9: Provided lunch and donated consumer products to the elderly at a nursing home for the elderly in Tambon SanamChan, Amphoe Mueang, Nakhon Pathom province, on December 7, 2019.

They mostly reside in Nakhon Pathom province and in nearby areas. The nursing home cares for 46 persons. It receives funds from SanamChan District 64 Municipality to supply three meals a day, clothing, bedding, and necessary personal supplies. It also provides annual health checkups, medical treatment and rehabilitation medicine. The Company provided lunch for the patients and donated rice, dried food, consumer products and medicine.

Ban Mae Sapung School is located on land surrounded by mountains in Amphoe Mae La Noi, Mae Hong Son province. It has 95 students. Most villagers are Tai-Yai, PgaK'nyau, Lawa and Hmong, and are poor. The village has a variety of cultures and religions, and most of people engage in farming and raise animals to feed themselves. Due to problems in transportation, locally grown agriculture products cannot be delivered for sale. The weather is generally cold the entire year and icy in the winter as the area is in the middle of a valley. The Company initiated a project to give the community an opportunity for a better education and support the livelihood of the local people residing on the mountain by bringing necessary consumer products, school supplies, sports equipment for the students to use. The following were provided: Scholarships totaling Bt20,000 100 blankets 100 sweaters School stationery; books, pencils, pens, drawing books, 100 sets of crayons Sports equipment Snacks, bread, Mama (instant noodle), dried food and canned food 66 Activity 11: Donated 490 blankets for a project called “Get the sister ready for the coming winter” initiated by PhraPalad Wayo Thawaro of Wat Huay Sing in Tambon Mae Yuam, Amphoe Mae Sariang, Mae Hong Son province, on December 28, 2019.
