The Olav Thon Group has been a signatory to the UN Global Compact initiative since 2012. This is the world’s largest corporate sustainability initiative and is based on 10 principles covering the areas of human rights, labour practices, the environment and anti-corruption. We signed up to the Global Compact out of a desire to run our business in accordance with these principles wherever possible. In December 2013, I established the Olav Thon Foundation and transferred ownership of the Olav Thon Group to it. The purpose of the foundation is to exercise stable, long-term ownership of Olav Thon Gruppen AS and its subsidiaries, and to distribute funds to non-profit causes. I hope that ensuring the continued development of the Olav Thon Group, while also making sure that some of the profits generated by the business are used for non-profit purposes, will prove a sustainable approach – for the company, its employees and for society in general. I hope you find this a good read!

Immediately following its formation, Olav Thon transferred all of the shares in Olav Thon Gruppen AS to the foundation. The purpose of the Olav Thon Foundation is to exercise stable, long-term ownership of Olav Thon Gruppen AS and to distribute funds to non-profit causes.

The idea is that the bottle deposit lottery will encourage more people to recycle bottles, while also creating a permanent source of funding for non-profit organisations. The lottery is operated by Norsk Pantelotteri AS, a company owned by the Norwegian Red Cross and the Olav Thon Group. 45.43% 2019 will go down in history as the best year for the Pantelotteri of all time.

The Olav Thon Group believes that it is essential to identify the most relevant goals the Group can help to achieve in order to make a genuine contribution to the UN’s Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. In connection with this, it has completed a project aimed at identifying which of the UN Sustainable Development Goals it would be most relevant for the Olav Thon Group to focus on.

Group’s contribution.* We have developed more detailed documents on how we determined the impact the Olav Thon Group has on the various Sustainable Development Goals and how we will contribute. These documents have been published on www.olavthon.no. The work to operationalise the Sustainable Development Goals has not been completed and will continue in 2020. There are therefore limited opportunities to report on the goals for the 2019 calendar year. It has been decided that the SDG Action Manager tool, developed by B Lab and UN Global Compact, will be used as the evaluation tool for the work on the 16 Sustainable Development Goals. * See the next page for more information.
