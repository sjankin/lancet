With this in mind, we have provided For this report we have adopted the commonly used updates throughout this report on those SDGs for ESG terminology to assess the more specific actions which we believe Stahl can make the greatest impact. that Stahl has taken on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) during the year. Acronyms aside, I have always felt that sustainability and the welfare of its stakeholders are critical for Stahl’s success. I also believe that ESG performance is directly linked to financial performance and is necessary for creating lasting value for our customers and shareholders. That’s why we continued to integrate ESG into all aspects of our business in 2019, like the Road to Zero safety campaign, mandatory employee compliance training and the Responsible Chemistry initiative focused on reducing the environmental footprint of the supply chains that we serve. Another significant ESG highlight in 2019 was the certification of Stahl’s global leather portfolio in the ZDHC Gateway Chemical Module, which underlines our long-standing commitment to transparency in the complex world of chemical substance compliance. 2019 was a challenging year but we emerged from it stronger than ever. Indeed, the industry will always face Climate change is the defining issue of our time and Stahl new challenges but Stahl will continue to view them as an fully recognizes the need to continuously reduce its opportunity, to take action and create a better future. Greenhouse Gas emissions. In 2019 we beat our 5-year target and reduced CO2 emissions by 25% (since 2015) Sincerely, but there is still more to do. Stahl is investing in renewable on-site energy sourcing, we have stepped-up research into renewable carbon technologies, and throughout our offices and manufacturing sites we continue to reduce the use of single-use plastics.

Our renewable energy commitment Using energy more efficiently and switching to renewable energy sources is essential for combating climate change. Upgrading our production sites and laboratory facilities helps Stahl to achieve energy efficiencies which, more importantly, improve our environmental footprint. Our site in Brazil has a self-generation method to obtain 50% of its energy from the Stahl’s energy consumption is the sum of electricity, gas, sun. The energy is taken from the sun by solar oil, steam, renewable briquettes and high speed diesel panels and is injected directly into the consumed at the manufacturing sites (see the pie chart company’s electrical system. on the next page). Energy is reported as the total energy consumed in terajoule (TJ) and per production volume: Fabiano André Trein the energy intensity. Several energy projects are underway Stahl Brazil towards the goal of self-sufficiency and renewable energy sourcing.
