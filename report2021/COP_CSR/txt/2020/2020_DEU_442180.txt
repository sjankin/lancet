PAPSTAR Progress Report 2020 | Greeting _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 3 “Especially in difficult times it shows how strong employee loyalty is!” Times are changing! And sometimes more seriously than we would all like. When I was asked exactly one year ago to write a greeting for our first Sustainability Report published in magazine form, “Naturally Sustainable!”, it was far from clear that only 12 months later the world would be a different one. Corona has turned everything upside down. In the moment, containment of the health implications remains high on the agenda, and that is right. Many people fear for the wellfare or economic livelihood of their families and and their close relatives. This is accompanied by drastic effects on the German economy – from a lack of customer contact and slumps in sales to existential hardships. From the extremely successful re-validation to the No events and festivities and the temporary closure of all “GREEN BRAND Germany & Austria 2020/2021” and the gastronomical business have also posed PAPSTAR for unfor“Climate Neutral Site Kall 2020” label (in cooperation with seeable challenges.

This project additionally supports key Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations, in particular the creation of decent employment and the promotion of qualified education. Working in cooperation with “Climate-Partner GmbH” (climate protection for organisations), PAPSTAR has calculated the quantity of greenhouse gases emitted in 2019. Even after implementing numerous measures to actively avoid and reduce the CO2 load, the “Corporate Carbon Footprint” (CCF) analysis for the Kall site shows that PAPSTAR still produced remaining CO2emissions of roughly 3,985 tonnes.
