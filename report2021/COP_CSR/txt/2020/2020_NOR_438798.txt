The company has no own shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The company has one category, which is share options, of dilutive potential ordinary shares. A calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to share options. The number of shares calculated is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options. (note 19).

The total amount by which the share capital may be increased is NOK 1 761 926.10. The authority applies until the ordinary general meeting in 2020 but no longer than 30 June 2020. The authorization is limited to encompass capital requirements or issuance of consideration shares in relation to strengthening of Kitron ASA’s equity, acquisition of other companies or businesses, joint ventures or joint business operations, incentive programs for employees and acquisition of property and business within Kitron ASA’s purpose. The authorization was used by the board in 2019 to increase the share capital by NOK 291 137.90. The authorized share capital of the Company is therefore NOK 17 910 399.00. Own shares The ordinary general meeting on 30 April 2019 authorised the board to acquire own shares for a total nominal value of up to NOK 1 761 926.10 which is equal to 10 per cent of Kitron’s registered share capital at 30 April 2019. Under this authorization the company shall pay minimum NOK 1 per share and maximum the prevailing market price per share on the day the offer is made, provided, however, that the maximum amount does not exceed NOK 25 per share. The authority is valid until the ordinary general meeting in 2020 but no longer than 30 June 2020. The authority had not been exercised at 31 December 2019. Notes to the consolidated financial statements ANNUAL REPORT 2019 35 Note 19 Share-based payment Kitron ASA in 2015 established a management option program. The Board of Directors was authorised to increase the share capital by NOK 550 000, which corresponds to 5 500 000 shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.10. In 2019 the option program was exercised, resulting in a share issue of 2 911 379 new shares in the company to the option holders at a strike price of NOK 0.10 per share. In addition, Kitron decided to terminate 2 027 358 options under the option program against cash consideration. The cash consideration was utilized to cover the tax cost for the option holders which were subject to advance tax deductions by Kitron after exercise of the option. The conversion of options was made at NOK 8.97, which was equal to the closing price on Oslo Børs on 29 May 2019 less the strike price of NOK 0.10 per share. In 2018 the Board introduced a new share option program for executive management comprising of up to 5 000 000 shares. The program is divided into four three-year subprograms, each with an allocation of 1 250 000 option, where the first program started in 2019, followed by one program every year until 2023. The total program corresponds to approximately 3 per cent of the market capitalization. The share option program entails that executive management, on certain terms, may be granted a right to subscribe for shares in Kitron at NOK 0.10 per share after a vesting period of three years. The number of options that are vested for each subprogram are linked to the development of the market capitalization at Oslo Stock Exchange, adjusted for dividends and share buy-backs. For each program to vest fully, the market capitalization adjusted for dividends and share buy-backs must increase 50 per cent. The program starts to vest at an increase of 20 per cent and will vest linearly between 20 per cent to 50 per cent. Each subprogram is capped at 200 per cent increase of the market capitalization, adjusted for dividends and share buy-backs. The program has a clawback clause. Each of the subprograms has a lock up-period of one year and a down-sale period of two years. The company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the impact of stock option grants in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payment, on the company’s net income. The model utilizes certain information, such as the interest rate on a risk-free security maturing generally at the same time as the option being valued, and requires certain assumptions, such as the expected amount of time an option will be outstanding until it is exercised or it expires and the volatility associated with the price of the underlying shares of common stock, to calculate the fair value of stock options granted. The model also estimate the likelihood of performance fulfillment and takes this into account in the valuation. During the period ended 31 December 2019, the company has had share-based payment arrangements for employees, as described below.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements ANNUAL REPORT 2019 53 Note 32 – Business combinations On 15 February 2019 the US subsidiary Kitron Inc completed the acquisition of the EMS division of API Technologies Corp. The acquisition marks a substantial strengthening of Kitron's position in the US market. The operations of the EMS division are highly complementary to Kitron's existing operations and are expected to provide added value to current operations, in particular in the United States. The division's main focus is on defence, aerospace, medical/industrial, and communications/ consumer, and it is well aligned with Kitron's overall strategy. The business is located in Windber, Pennsylvania, close to Kitron's current US facility in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, with approximately 100 employees operating a total of six production lines and a facility of approximately 10 000 square meters. Total revenues in 2019 amounted to approximately USD 27.7 million. The purchase price to be paid, after certain post-signing adjustments, is NOK 135.6 million (USD 15.6 million). The fair value assessment of the assets and liabilities recognized as a result of the acquisition is as follows: Fair value (Amounts in NOK 1000) 15.02.2019 Tangible fixed assets 49 678 Other intangible assets: customer contracts 3 149 Deferred tax assets 28 365 Inventory 66 032 Accounts receivable 23 494 Contract assets 30 122 Other receivables 4 156 Cash and cash equivalents (746) Loans (36 872) Accounts payable (25 099) Other payables (16 770) Net identifiable assets acquired 125 508 Add: goodwill 10 138 Net assets acquired 135 646 The goodwill is attributable to workforce and synergies.

If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2019, consolidated pro-forma revenue and profit for full year 2019 would have been NOK 3 320.1 million and NOK 133.4 million respectively. 54 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Note 33 – Flooding In July 2019, the facility of Kitron Technologies Inc. (formerly the EMS division of API Technologies Corp.) in Windber, Pennsylvania, was damaged by flooding and production was moved to a temporary site. Indemnification from insurance increased revenues by NOK 30.5 million in 2019. Correspondingly the profit and loss statement is charged with write down of assets, salvage costs and other expenses as follows: Cost of materials NOK 3.5 million, Other operational expenses NOK 19.1 million, Depreciation and impairments NOK 6.0 million and Tax NOK 0.6 million. The financial impact on the net result in 2019 was positive NOK 1.3 million. The balance sheet has per 31 December 2019 incorporated a restoration liability for the building of NOK 12.9 million (line “Other payables” – current liabilities) and a corresponding receivable on the insurance company (line “Other receivables” – current assets).

Demand is so far not materially affected, and the order backlog is close to NOK 2 billion, which supports the current outlook. All tier-1 suppliers in China have re-started operations and are gradually increasing capacity. European suppliers are currently delivering according to plan, with only minor deviations, so currently there has been no major disruption to supply chains outside China. We expect there will be some material allocations as the production capacity has been lower for some time for Chinese producers, and we are preparing for this situation. Kitron is normally dependent on customer approval of changes to the supply chain, and this is a process that usually takes some time. Consequently, this is not likely as a short term action, but is an option in the longer term. Kitron has implemented a number of actions to reduce the risk of our employees contracting the virus, and currently, we know of no Kitron employee who has contracted the corona virus. This includes keeping safety distance between people, hygiene and increased cleaning and sanitizing of all company facilities. All employees who can do their work from home are doing so. The purpose is to minimize the exposure of our blue-collar workers. Visitors will not be allowed to access Kitron facilities. Keeping our employees healthy and working is key to having the needed production capacity. Kitron has a solid banking relationship with DNB, going back many years, consisting of long-term loans (5 year), leasing financing of equipment, factoring solutions for Sweden and Norway and a credit facility. Kitron also has credit insurance for revenues in all countries except China. The main covenants for Kitron are Equity % and NIBD/EBITDA. The Equity % covenant is highly contingent on the size of the total balance sheet and is therefore at risk if inventory levels or trade receivable should rise. For NIBD/EBITDA, the margin is broader and allows for both a reduction in EBITDA and also an increase of debt. Kitron continuously makes capacity adjustments based on demand fluctuations but is now preparing for significantly larger fluctuations, if they should occur. Normally this includes adjustments to number of indirect and direct employees, as well as cost cuts. Cost cuts of fixed expenses are primarily related to costs such as consultancy costs, travel, consumables etc. To better control the demand, and further the visibility, we ask customers to convert forecast to fixed and firm orders. In summary, we see uncertainty and volatility going forward related to the demand and supply chain situation. Kitron is preparing contingency plans in order to mitigate potential adverse effects from the situation.

The Board of Directors was authorised to increase the share capital with NOK 550 000, which corresponds to 5 500 000 shares, each with a par value of NOK 0.10. In 2019 the option program was excercised, resulting in a share issue of 2 911 379 new shares in the company to the option holders at a strike price of NOK 0.10 per share. In addition, Kitron decided to terminate 2 027 358 options under the option program against cash consideration. The cash consideration was utilized to cover the tax cost for the option holders which were subject to advance tax deductions by Kitron after exercise of the option. In 2018 the Board introduced a new share option program for executive management comprising of up to 5 000 000 shares. The program is divided into four three-year subprograms, each with an allocation of 1 250 000 option, where the first program started in 2019, followed by one program every year until 2023. The total program corresponds to approximately 3 per cent of the market capitalization. The share option program entails that executive management, on certain terms, may be granted a right to subscribe for shares in Kitron at NOK 0.10 per share after a vesting period of three years. The number of options that are vested for each subprogram are linked to the development of the market capitalization at Oslo Stock Exchange, adjusted for dividends and share buy-backs. For each program to vest fully, the market capitalization adjusted for dividends and share buy-backs must increase 50 per cent. The program starts to vest at an increase of 20 per cent and will vest linearly between 20 per cent to 50 per cent. Each subprogram is capped at 200 per cent increase of the market capitalization, adjusted for dividends and share buy-backs. The program has a clawback clause. Each of the subprograms has a lock up-period of one year and a down-sale period of two years. The company utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the impact of stock option grants in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based payment, on the company’s net income. The model utilizes certain information, such as the interest rate on a risk-free security maturing generally at the same time as the option being valued, and requires certain assumptions, such as the expected amount of time an option will be outstanding until it is exercised or it expires and the volatility associated with the price of the underlying shares of common stock, to calculate the fair value of stock options granted. The model also estimate the likelihood of performance fulfillment and takes this into account in the valuation. During the period ended 31 December 2019, the company has had share-based payment arrangements for employees, as described below.

Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (Management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements of the (2) Auditor’s report ANNUAL REPORT 2019 81 Independent Auditor's Report Kitron ASA Company in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, and for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. The financial statements of the Company use the going concern basis of accounting insofar as it is not likely that the enterprise will cease operations. The consolidated financial statements of the Group use the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control. • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. (3) 82 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Auditor’s report Independent Auditor's Report Kitron ASA • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the statements on Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposed allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on Registration and Documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the Company’s accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
