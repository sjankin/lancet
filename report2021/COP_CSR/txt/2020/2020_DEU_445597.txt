That’s why we are actively involved in circular economy, climate protection and fair pay, for example. In one sentence: We know our responsibility and act upon it.

Our activities and funding priorities in this area are specifically adapted to the needs of 29,162 individual regions and countries so that we can meet the specific needs of the people who live there and thus improve their ecological and social development in the regions concerned. Schwarz Group divisions support charitable goals mainly through monetary donations and donations in kind in addition to sponsoring and partnering with schools, NGOs, and other organizations. Whenever we talk of our commitment as a corporate citizen, we mean all CSR-related GRI 102-16 projects, measures, and donations that we carry out voluntarily and which go beyond our immediate core business. It is our understanding that sponsoring activities can also be based on the promotion of social or ecological issues. On the basis of these principles, in 2019 the Schwarz Group worked out group-wide guidelines GRI 201-1 for handling donations and sponsoring, and rolled them out to the countries in which it operates. The purpose of these guidelines is to ensure that we manage contributions in a responsible, transparent, and comprehensible manner. The guidelines are further supplemented by additional divisionspecific regulations. These include the Kaufland guidelines titled “Donations and Sponsoring”, which among other things govern its principles of corporate citizenship, the Lidl guidelines governing the topics of donations and sponsoring, and the Schwarz Produktion guidelines titled “Donations, Sponsoring and Memberships”. 48 03 Life Quality Organization and directed decentrally to any business location in addition to being sent to the central email address.

As a result, no data are available for FY 2018. 4 For reasons of data collectability, all GreenCycle employees were assigned to the German region, even though a few GreenCycle business units are based abroad. 5 Among other factors, the drop in temporary workers is due to new guidelines at Kaufland Deutschland by which temporary employment contracts are no longer permitted without good reason. 6 All employees who began working in the Schwarz Group in the respective FY (initial hires) are included regardless of the length of their employment contracts. 7 All employees who left a Schwarz Group company in the respective FY are included with the exception of temporary employees, interns, working students, or undergraduates. Due to the system, employees who moved within the Schwarz Group are counted as departures. However, employees who moved within the Group for reasons of re-integration are not counted as departures. By contrast, any Lidl employee with a fixed-term contract of less than 6 months is not included, nor are moves within the Lidl division counted. 8 Ratio of employees who left the company to the average number of employees. 53 03 Life Quality Diversity in Management Bodies Percentage of personnel in management bodies1, 2 23.8 % 4.8 % 19.0 % > 50 years old < 30 years old Female GRI 405-1 By By age gender 71.4 % 81.0 % 30 – 50 years old Male Employment Diversity Personnel by employee category in FY 2019 ( ) 2, 3, 4, 5 Employees without Higher Top Management Total Average age of managerial functions management management employees: Number Share Number Share Number Share Number Share Number Share in % in % in % in % in % 2019 36.1 Total workforce 412,438 33,573 762 324 447,097 By age Age group 139,496 33.8 5,569 16.6 10 1.3 0 0.0 145,075 32.4 < 30 years old 2018 Age group 30 – 50 years old Age group > 50 years old 214,052 58,890 51.9 14.3 25,135 2,869 74.9 8.5 633 119 83.1 15.6 272 52 84.0 16.0 240,092 61,930 53.7 13.9 36.0 By gender GRI 405-1 Female 280,114 67.9 13,680 40.7 137 18.0 40 12.3 293,971 65.8 Male 132,324 32.1 19,893 59.3 625 82.0 284 87.7 153,126 34.2 Employee Health Sick leave in percent 6, 7, 8 6.8 % 2019 8 GRI 403-2 6.5 % 2018 1 Management bodies are considered the divisional boards of directors.

This includes full-time/part-time employees, marginal employees, apprentices, dual students, trainees, participants in the Kaufland Management Program, posted workers from abroad, employees in the active phase of sabbaticals and partial retirement, working students, interns, undergraduates, and temporary employees (provided they worked during the reporting period). Long-term absentees are excluded from this group for the following reasons for example: illness / inability to work / private accident / work accident / quarantine / family care leave for more than 90 days / maternity or parental leave including employment prohibition / reintegration following illness. 4 In accordance with the internal definition, employee categories are broken down as follows: top management = management levels I-II, higher management = management level III, management = managers starting from management levels IV-VI with no deputy / no specialist level, employees without managerial functions = other employees. 5 As these key figures were collected for the first time in FY 2019; figures from the previous year are not available. 6 For reasons of relevance to internal control, we only collect and report information on sick leave. 7 This key figure indicates the ratio of sick hours to the planned hours of work to be performed by employees (sick hours divided by planned hours x 100). Included are the sick hours of all employees who are normally entitled to continued remuneration in the event of illness (e.g. excluding temporary employees). The method used for counting sick hours varies from country to country and is based on national conditions and/or laws. The development of a standard, group-wide method of counting is currently in planning. 8 In contrast to the survey for FY 2019, employees on long-term sick leave were not included in the FY 2018 survey. This also explains the increase in numbers in FY 2019. 54 03 Life Quality Employer Awards Kaufland Lidl Europe Bulgaria Europe Belgium Croatia Czech Republic Bulgaria Cyprus Germany Poland Finland France Romania Slovakia Greece Italy Lithuania Malta Netherlands Poland Romania Slovakia Spain The employer awards depicted here are just a few examples.

The selection and composition of the food we provide as a retail company ultimately impact the health and well-being of our customers. A key area of focus for us in this area is the reduction of sugar and salt in our own brand products. We also take aspects of sustainability into account when designing our assortment of products, and we are working steadily to increase our assortment’s share of ecological, fairly traded products with appropriate seals and certifications. 57 04 Product Quality SUSTAINABLE ASSORTMENT POLICY It is a challenge, especially for the food retail industry, to reconcile issues of sustainability with consumer expectations of low prices. Sustainable agriculture is essential if we intend to leave behind a good future for our children.

The food retail sector offers a wide range of different foods, which makes it possible for consumers to maintain a healthy, balanced diet. Retailers can make a valuable contribution in this area by reducing the amount of sugar and salt contained in their own brands. Consumer information also plays a key role in this: Appropriate and transparent labeling of products and related information campaigns by retailers can sensitize customers and help them make responsible choices from retailers’ shelves. Stefan Genth, Secretary General, Handelsverband Deutschland (German Retail Federation) 69 04 Product Quality Materiality and Kaufland goal1 Objectives Lidl goal2 Through its 12,500 stores around the world, the Schwarz Group reaches a large number of customers who purchase food, drugstore items GRI 102-11 | 416 | 417 and non-food products for their daily needs from Kaufland or Lidl. In this way, we not only make a significant contribution to supplying local areas, but we also impact the health and sustainable behavior of our customers – not just through the products we sell but also through the associated communication with consumers. In addition to the central aspect of product safety and quality (see p. 64), the selection and composition of the food we offer are a key tool for customer health and conscious nutrition. One area of focus for the Schwarz Group in this regard is the reduction of sugar, salt, and fat. In order to counteract these substances, our retail divisions as well as Schwarz Produktion have adopted appropriate reduction strategies which significantly reduce the share of those ingredients. Kaufland in Germany has set itself the goal of reducing the By 2021 sugar, salt, and fat content in more than 300 own -20% brand items by an average of 20 percent by 2021. This goal is well on its way to being reached, with Kaufland Germany reaching an average content reduction of 19 percent in over 190 products up to and including 2019. One focus in this area is reduction of sugar, salt, and fat on products that are frequently consumed by content on average in more than children, such as soft drinks and cereals. 300 own brand items By 2025 -20% Lidl has set for itself the goal of reducing the weighted average content of added sugar and salt in its own brand assortment by 20 percent by 2025. In addition to Germany, this goal also applies to 17 Lidl countries, and four other countries have reduction of sales-weighted also adopted similar reduction strategies. To this average content of added end, the corporation has defined product groups sugar and salt in the own brand to focus on for reducing sugar (including yogurt assortment and sweet pastries) and for reducing salt (including bread, bread rolls, and pizza), which have nutritional profiles that can potentially be improved and/or have the potential to do without additives altogether.

Less plastic means closed loops – this is also the vision of our REset Plastic strategy for plastics. In Germany, we can already map out the entire material loop for PET bottles completely in‑house – from the integrated production and recycling companies of Schwarz Produktion to our retailers and our GreenCycle environmental division. This makes it possible for us to collect and reuse virtually all of the recycling materials that accumulate. 75 05 Circulatory Systems RECYCLABLE MATERIALS & RECYCLING Waste is just recyclable material that is in the wrong place – this fact is our mission at GreenCycle. A large share of worldwide waste is not disposed right or reused properly – and that is a huge problem for the environment. This is why we focus on a closed loop, which starts by having a completely reusable product from retail and disposal up to sustainable recycling and repro cessing into new products. Our goal: zero resource waste across our entire value chain.

Our basic aim in this regard is to avoid resource waste across our entire value chain. As part of our internal CSR strategy, the Schwarz Group is especially committed to the topics of waste avoidance and food waste, and has formulated corresponding goals: of all waste is recycled, reused, fermented or composted. Zero Waste: We will reuse, recycle or recover This is the equivalent the volume of waste that accumulates in the to 2,260,678 tons (2019) corporation1 by a significant percentage by the end of 2025. We strive to limit our non-recoverable waste that accumulates within our own company1 in pilot countries to a maximum of 5 percent by the end of 2022. Food Waste: We will reduce our food waste at the Schwarz Group level by 50 percent2 by the end of 20303. We will reduce food waste in the supply chain for selected raw materials. 1 Not including municipal waste (e.g. parking spaces). 2 Compared to the base year 2018 for retail companies. 3 We will reduce food waste for in-house production by 50% (food) by 2025 (compared to base year 2017; in relation to material quantity turnover).

Before you can assess how environmentally friendly a piece of packaging is, you need to consider its full life cycle. We, in beverage production, rely on disposable PET bottles with high recycled content and low weight. As a result, we only transport our water in Germany over short distances. Our bottles are light, hygienic, and safe – and the environment wins as well. After the bottles are returned to stores, they are pretreated in our recycling plants and then processed into new bottles. In this way, everyone can work together to contribute to conserving resources and protecting the climate.

We construct stores and buildings to be as energy-efficient as possible in order to promote the transition to sustainable energy. More than 30 percent of the power we consume comes from renewable energies – we even produce some of these energies ourselves. Our commitment to efficiency and sustainability also includes initiatives related to the consumption of fresh water, the protection of lakes and oceans, and the preservation of biodiversity – for example, we use circulatory systems and rigorous systems for waste, chemical, and pesticide management. 91 06 Ecosystems ENERGY & EMISSIONS The threat to the world’s food supply caused by climate-related droughts, floods and harvest failures only can be overcome if we keep global warming under 2 degrees Celsius. This means we need to bring our production of greenhouse gases down to zero by 2050. As a vital part of our economy, the food retail business also bears responsibility for achieving this goal. The Schwarz Group should therefore make an appropriate contribution to the stabilization of our climate. To do this, it needs a solid plan for rapidly reducing its emissions resulting from the cooling, lighting, distribution, and of course the production of its goods. This will make it possible for our grandchildren to also live safely and eat well.

Pollution of our oceans, rivers, and seas endangers the organisms which live in them and represents one of the biggest challenges for our global community. Our oceans already contain an estimated 150 million tons of plastic, and every year this figure increases by more than ten million tons. A number of different factors are often at play with the issue of water pollution – and the retail trade is responsible for some of them because of its enormous consumption of plastic.
