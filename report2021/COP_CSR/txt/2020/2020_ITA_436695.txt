The idea behind Design Holding is to bring together companies that make excellence in design their founding value. For many decades, the history of industrial design has been marked by extraordinary iconic products generated by these companies through partnerships with legendary designers. The creation of the group thus aims to connect businesses, each with their own strong and unique nature, under a unanimous banner of international growth based on shared values and visions. As a worldwide Group, we will have the potential for enhanced geographical reach, having access to widened sourcing and distribution networks, and the ability to better adapt to market evolution and to customers’ changing expectations. Beside working on the creation of Design Holding, in 2018, we renewed our environmental stewardship by taking the first step towards the inclusion of circular economy principles in designing our products through assessing products circularity. Indeed, the idea of improving products recyclability and circularity perfectly embodies our attitude towards long product life-cycle, innovative materials and manufacturing processes. Moreover, following Arclinea’s commitment to support sustainable forest management and wood supply, B&B Italia obtained the FSC certification. Willing to promote the social and economic wealth of our local communities and people, we kept investing in everyone’s development while ensuring positive and long-lasting relations. In line with Design Holding’s vision of fostering design culture and excellence, in 2018, we signed an agreement for the exclusive production and distribution of a selection of the iconic original pieces of Luigi Caccia Dominioni, under the historical Italian brand Azucena. Aiming to leverage the architect’s legacy we also supported themed exhibitions as a tribute to its iconic modern-classic products. Along the same line, we continued to sponsor cultural initiatives in every artistic domain, from the design history to the culture of food. We deeply believe that this new challenging beginning will be crucial for B&B Italia Group both for our economic growth and for strengthening our sustainability path. It is indeed only by true integration of business targets and sustainable development that we will be able to create value for all our stakeholders. The 2018 Sustainability Report thus supports our commitment to the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact and to transparently communicate our sustainability performance and philosophy. Giorgio Busnelli Gabriele Del Torchio President Chief Executive Officer 6 7 2018 Sustainability Report 2018 Sustainability Report B&B ITALIA B&B Italia Group, an overview B&B Italia S.p.A. (hereinafter also referred to as “B&B Italia”) is a leading Italian design furnishings Company. Established in 1966 as the result of the entrepreneurial vision of Piero Ambrogio Busnelli, B&B Italia has built GROUP WORLD its success on the ability to represent contemporary culture through design and to anticipate trends, constantly seeking to respond to changes in taste and living needs [102-1]. B&B Italia S.p.A. and its fully consolidated subsidiaries (hereinafter B&B Italia Group) is present on the residential furniture market with B&B Italia, Maxalto, Arclinea and Azucena brands. All of them are associated with unique collections and individual identities, yet express the same philosophy, namely a balanced blend of innovation and design to create products, whose unique style and elegance are unmistakable [102-2]. Maxalto represents nowadays one of the Group’s most iconic brands and it is well recognized worldwide for its distinctive know-how in the processing of the highest quality materials, especially wood. Initially run by Afra and Tobia Scarpa, the Company inherited the renowned craft traditions of Italian woodworking. Since 1993, the architect Antonio Citterio has coordinated Maxalto’s collections and has progressively widened the product offer, which currently covers a range of fittings for the living room and the bedroom. Arclinea, an Italian leader in high-end design kitchens, entered the B&B world in September 2016, when B&B Italia signed an agreement to become its majority shareholder. This strategic partnership enhanced the complementary nature of B&B Italia and Arclinea products by building on their shared ability to merge design, tradition and innovation through their industrial production approach. Founded in 1925 by Silvio Fortuna and based in Caldogno, Vicenza, Arclinea started its business activity as an artisanal laboratory specialized in wood processing. In the following decades, the Company managed to become recognized as a reference in terms of innovation and capability of anticipating social changes. In 1958, for instance, it launched the first modular kitchen, soon followed by the first kitchen with built-in electrical appliances and stainless-steel hob. In the ‘80s, the company started collaborating with famous architects and designers, in particular with Antonio Citterio, who introduced for the first time the characteristics of professional restaurant kitchens into a home kitchen. Since then, several models have been produced in collaboration with Mr. Citterio, consolidating the brand’s innovative traits and reputation. At the end of 2017, B&B Italia Group acquired the Italian brand Azucena and, simultaneously, decided to produce and distribute Luigi Caccia Dominioni’s design icons. Founded in 1947 by Luigi Caccia Dominioni, Ignazio Gardella and Corrado Corradi Dell’Acqua, Italian undisputed masters of design and post-war architects, Azucena was created to gather the architects’ products, that combine formal elegance, understated luxury and an aesthetical purity in all their collections. Luigi Caccia Dominioni most iconic products include some of the most symbolic pieces of the Italian design history, such as the Catilina chair, the ABCD armchairs, the Toro sofa and pouf, the Cavalletto table and the lamps Poltrona and Imbuto.

The Division conceives each single detail to satisfy specific customers’ needs and invests in liaising with the customer and architects, at the same time combining research, testing and engineering of each project element. For instance, in 2018 the Contract Division participated in ambitious and renowned projects like the realization of the Blue Lagoon Retreat Hotel in Iceland, the interior designing of more than 200 apartments and offices of the One Crown Place in London, the furnishing and building of the Polaris Lounge at San Francisco International Airport and the engineering of the B&B Italia Group for Starbucks In 2018, B&B Italia participated in the realization of the new Starbucks Reserve™ Roastery in Milan, the first Starbucks in Italy and the biggest roastery in Europe. In particular, B&B Italia Contract Division realized the roastery roof, designing the geometric structure and implementing the audio and light systems. The Contract Division has also engineered and produced the bronze cask, which is part of the roaster, custom-built exclusively for the new Starbucks. The cask is an impressive 8-meter-high cylinder, that periodically unfolds and rotates, like a blooming flower, to give customers a rare glimpse of the de-gassing phase of the coffee bean roasting process, when the coffee bean is transformed to enhance all its qualities. The collaboration with Starbucks has represented an exceptional challenge for B&B Italia, where technological research and attention to details were carried out by the expert team of B&B Italia with extreme audacity and mastery. A project that reveals the potential of the company's Contract Division even in areas where it does not usually work. new Starbucks Reserve™ Roastery in Milan. Sustainable development is also a component of B&B Italia innovation history, from the use of sustainable materials to the upgrade of industrial processes in order to lower their environmental impact. The Company has already achieved some progress in these areas. As an example, it promoted the elimination of freon in the polyurethane formula, the use of recycled and recyclable techno-polymer coats (Husk, 2011), the transition to water-based solvents for wooden products (completed in 2015 at the Misinto site), the fabrication of coatings from recovered leather scraps (Hive Pouf, 2013) and the elimination of formaldehyde from chipboards. For B&B Italia Group, innovation lies also in building unique design experiences, starting from a careful study of their clients and customers’ needs and leveraging the accredited experience of their professionals. The central pillar of the Group’s approach is making the purchase of its products and services as “something valuable in time” that remains etched in the memory. The Group uses different channels to express this concept and its culture of contemporary design, encouraging an open conversation 26 27 2018 Sustainability Report 2018 Sustainability Report with its clients and customers. ity of curved geometries led to the creation of Moon System, a sofaIndeed, inside its own stores, B&B Italia Group welcomes visitors to folsculpture that has been an authentic “design statement” since the very low a journey where design encounters emotion, involving all the senses. beginning.

Among the products shown there were several B&B Italia models, like the “Amanta” and “Camaleonda” sofas or the “Vol au vent” chair. Moreover, the exhibition dedicated a section to “Le Bambole”, Bellini’s most iconic project for B&B Italia, which has become famous over the decades because of the irreverent and ironic advertising campaign featuring Donna Jourdan and signed by the world-famous photographer Oliviero Toscani. Furthermore, B&B Italia enthusiastically accepted the invitation of MAXXI – Museo nazionale delle arti del XXI secolo to pay homage to Zaha Hadid, one of contemporary architecture’s most important and influential figures, one year on from her sudden passing.

Since 1997, B&B Italia has put in place an ISO 9001 Quality Management AND IMPACTS System at the Novedrate, Misinto, Arosio and Carugo sites, certified by an independent third party. This Management System is a fundamental element of B&B Italia’s way of working, given that it sets the rules and boundaries that regulate quality control at all levels. Similarly, Arclinea’s Caldogno factory has an ISO 9001 Quality Management System, first obtained in 2012. Both B&B Italia and Arclinea have updated their Management Systems to the new international technical standard UNI EN ISO 9001:2015 during the last few months. The context analysis carried out by the two companies did not identify any relevant quality risks connected to quality management. The continuous and full implementation of the Quality Management Systems is the key instrument to meet all statutory and regulatory requirements and standards applicable at the Group’s export destinations. B&B Italia’s products meet all relevant legal requirements, including European and US laws and regulations. Across the product life cycle, all categories are assessed with respect to health and safety impacts and in terms of compliance with applicable regulations with the support of leading Italian and international test laboratories. In addition, in Arclinea each product is subject to manual checks along and at the end of the production process. In case problems or defects are identified, staff of the Caldogno factory conducts a series of remediation activities in the shortest time possible and usually within two hours. This allows Arclinea to deliver high quality products, while acquiring replicable best practices by learning from previous production mistakes. Arclinea’s Quality Function organizes a series of periodic internal working groups aimed at brainstorming on how to continuously ameliorate the production stream. The absence of non-compliance issues with regulations concerning the health and safety impacts of products is proof of B&B Italia Group's Quality Management System’s effectiveness [416-2]. On customer service, the Group believes in the value of offering consumers a product as a long-term investment, and therefore we keep working to increase the lifecycle of our creations. In this context, all B&B Italia products include an identification code, which allows the Company and the customer to trace all the technical documentation and product standards for each item sold. Considering customer’s growing interest and relative sensitivity relating to product safety and durability, beyond mere compliance, B&B Italia Group monitors these parameters through specific activities and tests, in accordance with numerous voluntary codes and regulations that can be applied, depending on national laws of intended markets and clients’ specific needs. Products are therefore validated by conducting strength and durability tests on the product family’s most significant or representative article, and/or the one that is most critical in terms of construction technique. The tests are carried out according to the principal methods applied in the furniture industry, in particular under the standards listed above.

NOTE As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) Initiative from 2016, this report represents B&B Italia Group's third Communication on Progress – a public disclosure providing valuable information to stakeholders regarding the implementation of the 10 principles of the UNGC. For ease of reference, the UNGC principles are clearly mapped alongside the GRI indicators in the GRI Content Index on page 60. With regard to Human Rights, B&B Italia Group’s 2018 Sustainability Report does not directly address the UNGC issues and principles, since the major part of the Group’s direct activities and suppliers are located where laws ensure the regulation of human rights. Nevertheless, B&B Italia Group includes clauses on labor conditions and on the respect of human rights in its Code of Ethics in order to reduce risks in its value chain. Moreover, relevant human rights issues related to the Group’s activities, such as the protection of worker’s occupational health and safety is an issue on which the Group is continuously committed to report on. Committing to the UNCG requires B&B Italia Group to foster sustainable development by supporting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda — adopted by world leaders in September 2015. The SDGs aim to end poverty and other deprivations, develop strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality and spur economic growth, all while tackling climate change and working to preserve oceans and forests. B&B Italia Group, through its activities and initiatives, contributes to meeting seven out of 17 SDGs, as highlighted in the figure below.

The following table outlines the connections between B&B Italia Group’s material issues and relevant SDGs and the corresponding GRI Standards (Topic-specific Disclosures). In addition, the table provides the aspect boundary, related to where the impact is realized (within or outside of the organization) and who by. The table also includes any potential reporting limitations due to the current unavailability of data and information.

Total water consumption decreased by 11% between 2017 and 2018. The decrease in water consumption is mainly due to Arclinea, which in 2018 used less ground water for the cooling process of its painting department. In fact, Arclinea’s consumption has almost halved over the same period (-47%), whereas B&B Italia consumption increase by 15%. In 2016, B&B Italia experienced an anomalous malfunctioning in its air conditioning system, which led to higher than usual water consumption levels of about 41%.
