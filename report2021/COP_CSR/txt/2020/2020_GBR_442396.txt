Direct Indirect We have dedicated home deliveries in our UK (B&Q only) and Polish markets. Around 23% of our direct carbon footprint (scope 1 and 2) comes from the transport, distribution and delivery of our products. Reducing absolute emissions from transport is challenging since our business is growing, we are transporting more of our products ourselves and we are making more home deliveries as online shopping increases. Our focus is on improving efficiency, working closely with our logistics partners. This includes measures to improve route planning, optimising how products are packed onto pallets and into lorries, exploring alternative fuels, and investing in more efficient fleets. Direct haulage emissions (those from our own dedicated delivery fleets and which are included in our carbon target) have increased by 2.6% against our 2016/17 baseline. This is due to an increase in deliveries to our stores. Emissions from home delivery reduced, however, this is largely due to a change in data scope since Castorama France no longer have a dedicated home delivery service.
