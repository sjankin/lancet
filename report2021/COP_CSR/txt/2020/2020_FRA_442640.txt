This department worked in collaboration with the QSE service, to start directing our purchases not only towards economic performance, but also by combining respect for social and environmental values. When choosing a new supplier, we have been verifying since 2019, its compliance with OEMServices rules which include, among other things, CSR criteria. As such, we have built a questionnaire which must be completed by the suppliers, and which allows us to see the share of commitment of each of them. When selecting a supplier, the QSE service, which is one of the stakeholders involved in the choice, will give its opinion based on the supplier's responses to the CSR criteria. We try to match our needs with our values.

The health watch was set up by the management to follow the evolution of the situation for all the OEMServices service centers. Of course, all the equipment necessary to protect the health of employees was provided at all sites and the appropriate behaviors (not kissing, not shaking hands, keeping a safe distance) were adapted from the start. At group level and in this context, OEMServices no longer authorizes any business trip to and from any country. No visitor, except for operational purposes, is allowed to enter our premises. Delivery and collection of packages are done in strict compliance with preventive measures. All employees whose activity allows it were requested to work from home. The people who must are present on site in two teams (warehouse) and during the day (facility management, IT, accounting, HR). The return to the office is very gradual and very limited. In June, an alternating return to telework office every other week.

It is not necessary to launch ourselves in big actions. Small steps are enough to start. We think that any renaturation, however modest, is welcome That’s why, in 2019, the QSE team proposed to set up an OEMServices vegetable garden. A call for volunteers was made to all employees and a working group, the Green Team was formed. Fences, small greenhouse, sowing, tubs, watering were put in place and the first harvests took place in summer 2019. This vegetable garden improves well-being at work, makes it possible to share moments of conviviality, becomes a place conducive to exchanges between colleagues Our first harvest : 3.4 Anti corruption policy 3.4.1 Guide to good commercial practices OEMServices wishes to govern with ethics and honesty Implementation of a Guide to Good Commercial Practices which is given to all employees of the Company who are in commercial relations with third parties: customers, Business Partners, intermediaries and suppliers.

The Label is based on 5 logistics CSR areas: Organizational governance Economic performance Social progress Environmental Protection CSR CO-01 Global Compact Date: June 20th, 2020 COP 2020 Page 20 /20 Energy management As part of our CSR approach, we wanted to be awarded this certification and followed the following steps for obtaining the certificate: Self-assessment with the support of an expert Diagnosis and result of the evaluation after audit by the expert guide Decision on priority improvements to be implemented over 3 years with at least one action per area Commitment to carry out the action plan (commitment charter) OEMSercices obtained the Label 6PL for 3 years. The action plan will be followed up with the auditor every year The 6PL label is the only French CSR label targeted at the logistics activities of SMEs / SMIs and the logistics sites of large groups. 4.3 Proximity Management Establishment in 2019 of a Lean culture centered on the employee. Creation of a Method and continuous improvement department to contribute to this process. This management system has made it possible to set up Animation at Interval Court (AIC) (Short Intervals Management Meeting), an organizational tool which is used to predict and anticipate drifts of situations which disrupt activities. These AICs are carried out daily or weekly in the presence of a manager, one or more employees and other guests if necessary. This participative communication and management system makes it possible to raise the irritants encountered by the collaborators and to alert as soon as possible of a problem, to release tension and to be able to be reassured on the continuation. This method favors exchange, participation, it is useful for both employees and managers: It makes it possible to discharge the mental burdens that weigh on daily work as soon as possible. It allows the manager to help his collaborators in the good accomplishment of their tasks.
