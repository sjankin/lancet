In a complex and changing global context, we continued to pursue our clear-eyed business plan, laying the groundwork for the Group’s next step to serve its international and domestic markets with increasing efficiency, generating value for all our stakeholders that have placed their trust in us. After our successful growth transactions of the past few years, including the acquisition of Lane in the United States, 2019 was the year of Progetto Italia, our project to create a large Italian infrastructure operator, partly through aggregations. This industrial transaction was made possible also thanks to the support of our new shareholder, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), and major Italian banks (Intesa Sanpaolo, Unicredit and BPM). Our goal is to kick-start the domestic construction sector, starting with the re-opening of the blocked work sites, together with CDP and the banks to create development opportunities for Italy and jobs in the north and especially in the south of Italy. Progetto Italia is designed to shore up Italy’s depressed infrastructure sector and its top notch contractors. By blending their vast expertise and incredible experience with our skills, we can relaunch an industrial sector that has great potential and give birth to a group well placed to compete on a constantly growing global market, that has a common set of values and can invest in technological innovation and systems as well as the safety of its workers. To prepare for this challenge, we introduced tailored measures to continue our growth, including a capital increase, the sale of non-core assets and the consequent generation of cash inflows, derisking and a better overheads/turnover ratio. We also reorganised our internal processes and invested in training for our employees and the new generations who will work in the construction sector. We are well aware that the global challenges on the international stage posed by climate change, the increasing scarcity of natural resources, a growing global population and ongoing urbanisation require a coordinated response by all stakeholders and an unprecedented mobilisation of resources. These global challenges also offer a great opportunity for us and our sector, with enormous investments earmarked by governments and international financial institutions for the next few years. According to G20 Global Infrastructure Outlook estimates, at global level, investments of roughly USD77 trillion will be needed to 2040 for just the business areas our Group operates in, i.e., energy, water and mobility infrastructure, and this figure includes approximately USD62 trillion that has already been budgeted for. In order to turn these challenges to our advantage, we have drawn up a business strategy underpinned by three pillars: specialisation in large projects, focus on fast growing countries with a low risk profile and concentration on sectors closely linked to sustainable development and that offer the best development opportunities for infrastructure, directing global growth. To achieve this strategy, we have strengthened our business model in pursuit of greater operating efficiency, technological innovation and responsible conduct. We have also invested in an ambitious growth plan to better compete with large international players on the global stage and at home. 5 The choices we made to either develop the most innovative products and processes with our partners or acquire them on the market have been fundamental to become more competitive and to offer our clients engineering solutions and products at better prices. We carried out many projects during the year, both during the bidding stage and contract performance stage, to develop highly innovative technical solutions at the cutting edge of today’s engineering boundaries, such as for example: • Australia: the Snowy 2.0 generation and pumping plant with installed capacity of 2,000 MW, which has entailed the construction of a power station 800 metres underground using first-of-a-kind excavation and support techniques; • Argentina: the Riachuelo environmental restoration plant for which we developed the innovative Riser Concept technology (and for which Salini Impregilo has filed a patent application) for the vertical bottomup drilling of the underwater tunnel; • USA: Texas High Speed Rail (Dallas-Houston), an approximate 380 km high speed railway line with 190 km of tunnels and works to be completed in five years, thanks to a state-of-the-art work industrialisation system; • France Grand Paris Express Metro, for which we have trialled for the first time the production of fiberreinforced concrete segments for the EPB TBM. Our Group underwent great change in 2019 with a new shareholding base, a new corporate governance structure and a new brand identity with a new name, which emphasises our focus on the value of the team (We) and our mission as builders (build). Our Group will develop under our new name “Webuild” and is even more determined to satisfy the expectations of our investors and shareholders, to provide our clients with innovation solutions for sustainable mobility, the production of renewable hydro energy, water management and building of green buildings. We intend to make an active contribution to progress towards 11 out of the total 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). During the year, we also engineered processes to become more efficient and reorganised some units to better monitor our internal procedures, focusing in particular on core areas like the Operations, Commercial/Business Development, Supply Chain, HR, Organisation and Systems units. The changes to the organisational model were flanked by specific process review projects like the “Performance Dialogue” system, adopted by contracts worldwide to allow the coordinated monitoring and control of their operations. We also introduced new applications, including an integrated commercial and bidding data and information flows management system, and systems for electronic signatures in documents. We rolled out digital procurement solutions and a HR process digitalisation project. We intend to continue this trajectory, bolstered by our achievements of 2019. We are proud to present the results of our business strategy presented for the first time by business area: Sustainable Mobility, Clean Hydro Energy, Clean Water and Green Buildings. Of our 2019 revenue of €5.33 billion, a very impressive over 85% was from projects that contribute directly to progress towards the SGDs, while more than 55% of our projects were low-carbon, which means that they have a decreased carbon footprint. 6 2019 saw the completion of some extraordinary projects, such as the Cityringen Metro in Copenhagen, Denmark, which provides 85% of the capital’s population with access to a sustainable mobility network just 600 metres from their doorstep. In Italy, we managed to relaunch the strategic high speed Genoa Milan railway project and took on tough challenges, such as the new Genoa Bridge, being built in record time thanks to an extremely tight-knit team, the deployment of the fast-track method and incredible synergies with our client and the institutions: providing a tangible example of Italy’s enormous potential to provide our country with modern and efficient infrastructure. With respect to our order backlog and new orders, we received a record €8.1 billion of new orders, of which more than 75% acquired in markets with a low risk profile such as Australia, North America and Europe. We are very pleased to have entered new markets like Norway and Canada, demonstrating our ability to penetrate our targeted markets and the validity of the industrial transaction pursued through Progetto Italia in the case of Canada, thanks to the experience contributed by Astaldi. After completing Lane’s turnaround, we have a foothold in many US states and, alongside the ongoing projects in the sustainable mobility and clean water business areas, we have commenced the preliminary work to build the first high speed railway line in the United States which will connect Houston to Dallas in Texas in just 90 minutes. We will achieve this by applying all our know-how acquired in the construction of large high speed railway projects around the world. We are delighted to announce that we have increased our share of the Australian market which we continue to invest in. Thanks to important projects such as Snowy 2.0, we are one of the global infrastructure leaders in the water and hydroelectricity business areas, a source of inexpensive renewable energy. Our results and new challenges are and will be achieved/met thanks to a crucial, unique asset of which we are extremely proud: our people. During this year, they applied their unique expertise, acquired on the most complex projects in the world, and demonstrated their ability to work together to achieve our business goals. I would like to especially thank them for their focus on our business objectives and concurrently roll out complex corporate operations, like Progetto Italia, this year. In 2019, we continued to invest in our people and provide them with better working conditions. We strengthened our commitment to inclusion and diversity. We also introduced a new leadership model in early 2020, identifying the managerial skills which, together with our people’s technical know-how, are essential to achieve the Group’s strategic goals. We continued to invest in projects to upskill our resources through assessment programmes, business coaching and our Global Managerial Academy, officially opened in February 2020 for key figures and internal talents. We also continue to invest in our partnerships with universities in Italy and abroad and in professional training for younger students who consider us as one of the best employers in Italy for university graduates and professionals. Starting from February 2020, the world’s global production system and the business world’s capacity to operate has been sorely tested by the spread of COVID-19. With its escalation in Italy, the Group immediately adopted measures to combat this and to protect its employees’ health both in the offices and at work sites, while concurrently managing to meet our clients’ requirements and ensure activities could continue at the work sites in safe conditions together with the trade unions. 7 We prioritised safety throughout the year and have received accolades for our commitment and results achieved in all the countries where we operate in recent years, including in complex situations like those linked to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Once again, this year, we bettered our injury rate by another 25%, an achievement that we intend to improve on day by day. We will continue to invest in the creation of a shared culture that places safety at the centre of our business, strengthening training and internal communication activities to raise employee and vendor awareness of the fundamental value of safety in our work places. Our aim for 2020 is to continue to improve our economic, financial and sustainable performances through our strategic plan designed to ensure the satisfaction of our shareholders and investors, that believe in the value of our business, and progress towards the SDGS, notwithstanding the impact that COVID-19 will have on the world. Pietro Salini 8 Highlights 9 Salini Impregilo Group: our vision and performance Who we are Salini Impregilo is an industrial group specialised in the construction of large complex infrastructure in the business areas of sustainable mobility, clean water, clean hydro energy and green buildings. It is a market leader in Italy and one of the global players on the international stage. The Group has been recognised as the first global contractor in the water sector for five years by Engineering News Record (ENR) and one of the top ten operators in the environmental sector since 2018. In addition to being the leading Italian general contractor, Salini Impregilo is one of the top 10 contractors in the US and the Middle East in terms of its revenue generated outside its domestic market 1. In 2019, Salini Impregilo entered the Leadership level of the CDP (ex Carbon Disclosure Project) Climate Change programme. 1 (source: ENR Report, Top 250 International Contractors, 19/26 August 2019) 10 2019 revenue by geographical area At 31 December 2019, the Group has an order backlog worth €36,229 million (including €29,541 for construction contracts), new orders of €8,105 million and revenue of €5,331 million 2. Contract revenue includes 88% from projects tied to achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while 58% relates to climate action projects that allow the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The Group has a concise vision which envisages strong growth in Italy and a more competitive position in some of its more interesting markets, namely, the US, Australia and the Northern European countries for 2020. Salini Impregilo has developed a robust business model capable of creating economic value for its shareholders, investors and clients while generating social and environmental value for its employees and the stakeholders of the areas in which it operates, adopting an approach designed to create shared value. The countless works built around the world tell the story of a Group that has based its business on its passion to build, the search for excellence and a commitment to meet global challenges, tied to the essential needs of the local areas and their communities for over 113 years. It has built railway lines and metros, dams and hydropower plants, hydraulic systems, drinking water, desalination and water treatment plants, airports and motorways and civil and industrial buildings. 2 Adjusted figures comprising the reported data increased by the results of the non-subsidiary joint ventures of Lane Industries and inclusive of the losses recognised on the assets in Venezuela. 11 Business model The Group's business model is underpinned by distinctive strategic pillars: efficiency, innovation and responsible conduct. It generates value shared with its shareholders, investors, clients, employees and the communities where it operates, contributing to 11 of the main SGDs.

They are significantly changing people's needs, influencing the priorities of public bodies and investors and modifying market competition. Infrastructure is significantly affected by the current trends and construction companies can offer long-life effective solutions that stand up to the challenges of our global society. 12 Main megatrends that affect the infrastructure market INFRASTRUCTURES MOBILITY WATER ENERGY CLIMATE 70% 68% 20% / 30% 50% 60% Global population Global energy GHG emissions Unbuilt essential Growth in global water residing in urban areas consumption using associated with the infrastructure in 2050 demand up to 2050 in 2050 electricity infrastructure sector 92% +100% 52% 86% 45% Global population in GHG emissions in 2030 SDGs achievable with Demand for urban Energy demand met by water stress areas in to achieve carbon adequate infrastructure mobility in 2050 renewable sources 2050 neutrality by 2050 The international community has undertaken important initiatives to manage the changes underway, like the United Nations' 2030 Agenda (which includes the SDGs) for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement. Infrastructure directly and indirectly contributes to achievement of 92% of all the targets linked to the SGDs 3. It is a fundamental part of the fight against climate change as it contributes more than 60% of the global GHG emissions4. Meeting the growing global demand for infrastructure and achievement of the SDGs require investments that can only increase over the next decades as shown in the next graph based on the Global Infrastructure Hub 5 estimates. 3 Source: Thacker S, Adshead D, Morgan G, Crosskey S, Bajpai A, Ceppi P, Hall JW & O’Regan NO.

Ongoing clean hydro energy projects contributed 17% to contract revenue, make up 26% of the construction order backlog and a very impressive 51% of new orders, mostly thanks to the acquisition of the Snowy 2.0 contract in Australia. Completed or ongoing clean water projects made up 8% of contract revenue, 5% of the construction order backlog and 11% of the new orders in 2019, while green building projects accounted for 5% of revenue and 2% of new orders. Overall, 93% of the new orders came from the above business areas, which contribute to progress towards the SDGs with a record 71% of new orders for low-carbon projects. Sustainable Mobility The transport sector is responsible for two thirds of the global consumption of oil and continues to be the fastest growing GHG emitter with roughly 1 billion people still without access to viable roads all year round. Passenger traffic is expected to increase by 50% by 2030 to then double by 2050 while, in the meantime, only 16% of global urban journeys takes place using public means of transport. The Group is one of the key operators in the urban (metros and light rail) and non-urban (high speed railways) sustainable mobility sectors as well as in the land transport infrastructure (roads and motorways), sea (ports, navigable channels) and air (airports) sectors. 15 The metro projects under construction alone will allow the fast, efficient and sustainable transportation of roughly three million people a day on state-of-the-art infrastructure, avoiding emissions of roughly 550 thousand tonnes of CO2 a year. The high speed railway projects will shorten travel times by between 25% to 50%, providing around 23 million people with safe, rapid and low-carbon services. In fact, rail transportation services generate emissions up to one eighth of those of the most environmentally-friendly cars and up to one ninth of the most efficient aircraft. The Group has built 7,534 km of metros and railway lines, 64,194 km of roads, 590 km of bridges and viaducts and 1,587 km of tunnels and underground works. It has constructed unique works like the new Panama Canal, which has enabled the post-Panamax ships to cross the American continent since 2016 rather than going around it, leading to an approximate 16 million tonne reduction in CO2 emissions a year. Clean Hydro Energy The energy sector is responsible for two thirds of the global GHG emissions while roughly 840 people still do not have access to electricity. Hydropower is the first renewable source of energy in the world and provides 71% of all the global renewable electricity. Unlike the other renewable sources like wind and solar power, which are intermittent and, therefore, cannot ensure the constant supply of energy, hydropower is the most reliable and constant source. This is why it is essential for the world's energy transition. Hydropower is one of the renewable sources with the lowest unit cost, which makes it particularly suitable for those areas of the world where most of the population still does not have electricity, like some of the emerging economies. The Group is one of the key players in this sector and has installed capacity of 45,000 MW, which includes both completed and ongoing projects. The ongoing hydropower projects will have capacity of more than 14,000 MW and will provide low-cost clean energy to tens of millions of people around the world, especially in the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia and surrounding countries) Central Asia (Tajikistan and adjacent countries) and Australia. This should avoid emissions of roughly 14.5 million tonnes of CO2 a year. 16 Clean Water The efficient management of water is one of the principal global challenges given that five billion people live in areas subject to water stress, 2.4 billion people do not have access to drinking water, 4.2 billion to modern sanitation services and 80% of the water discharges are released into the environment without proper treatment. In fact, the effects of climate change are having a faster-than-expected effect. The Group is a global leader in the water infrastructure sector and active in the entire water cycle, from supply to drinking water to irrigation and the final treatment of wastewater. Thanks to the group company Fisia Italimpianti, which leads the desalination, drinking water and water treatment sector, the Group is a strategic partner for public and private sector clients in areas subject to water stress like the Middle East. It builds essential water infrastructure for millions of people. Salini Impregilo also has immense experience in building water storage for drinking water and/or irrigation, environmental recovery projects and works to upgrade urban wastewater management infrastructure to make it more resilient to the increasingly frequent extreme weather events, protecting areas affected by flooding and preventing the pollution of the receiving water bodies. More than 20 million people are served by just the plants built by Fisia while another approximate 14 million people will benefit from the water infrastructures currently being built by the Group, in addition to seven thousand hectares of new irrigable land thanks to the irrigation reservoirs under construction. Green Buildings By 2050, 68% of the world's population will live in urban areas, which are already highly polluted and subject to environmental stress which has a significant fall-out effect on the health of residents and public finance. Estimates indicate that 91% of the global urban population breathes air of a quality below the standards set by the World Health Organisation. Over the years, the Group has constructed civil, institutional, commercial, cultural, sporting and religious buildings accumulating vast experience in Eco-design & Construction systems, which allow a reduction in the works' environmental footprint over their life cycle. Specifically, adoption of these systems (e.g., Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design LEED) allows both a reduction in the environment footprint during construction, thanks to the use of low-environment impact raw materials and optimisation of production and logistics processes, and maximisation of the building's environmental performance during its lifetime as a result of lower energy and water consumption and less emissions. 17 The environmental advantages of using Eco-design & Construction systems are measured by comparing them to environmental performances obtained using standard design and construction methods. The Group has found that green buildings generate lower environmental impacts of more than 30% and this is one of the reasons why the Group's projects have garnered important accolades at international level for their innovative and environmental sustainability characteristics. Strategic pillars Given the complexity of global challenges and the competitive playing field, the Group has to be agile and dynamic, ready to pre-empt the market's needs before it is even aware of them and the related business opportunities. Accordingly, the Group has refreshed its organisational model significantly in recent years to ensure continuous improvement and a sharper focus on efficiency, innovation and responsible conduct. Efficiency This organisational overview has affected the entire Group, has had a profound impact on its internal culture and has required the active involvement of all levels of decision makers and operational resources. The objective was to ensure optimal management of all core processes, from commercial planning to the bidding and execution processes. The corporate competence centres ensure the application of best practices and the Group's guidelines by all subsidiaries as well as optimisation of operating competencies and synergies along the entire value chain. Organisational model designed to foster efficiency Core processes Organisational structure Commercial planning Bidding Execution Human Resources, • Systematic approach for scouting new talents (key recruits from different Organisation and Systems industries and geographical areas) • Support to core processes (e.g., risk assessment/country return during the Risk Management commercial process) Competence Centres • Centralised activities supported by best-in-class tools enable diligent Supply Chain/ management of subcontractors reducing operational risk (digitalised Procurement procurement process) • Organisation by product/geographical area to strengthen core Engineering competencies and alignment with Operations • Strong project control liquidity management Finance Other staff functions (CSR, • Guidelines and best practices Compliance, Communications, etc.) 18 A key facilitator of the organisational re-engineering project undertaken by the Group is the Performance Dialogue tool. It allows continuous monitoring of the ongoing projects through regular debriefing sessions that involve all internal levels of the Group's organisation. The tool ensures a structured exchange of information between the resources in the field and at headquarters, shared objectives and management priorities, the definition of agreed action plans and activation of operating tools to resolve any critical issues and benefit from potential opportunities. Making processes more efficient has a significant impact on productivity and optimisation of the allocated resources, for example, in terms of personnel productivity (revenue/employees), which improved by roughly 7% in 2019. Innovation Salini Impregilo considers innovation to be fundamental for its long-term sustainable development. The Group's sector is known for the highly customised processing, techniques and technologies deployed depending on the nature of the works to be performed even though the construction sector is generally considered to have a low innovation level. Each project is unique and requires the development of bespoke solutions designed thanks to highly specialist know-how. The Group's work sites are real hives of innovation and advanced research. Innovation is not only a lever to overcome the technical challenges of the projects to be built but it also underpins the Group's competitiveness, as it contributes to making its core processes more efficient, thanks to optimised performance times and costs and support processes, as well as its social and environmental performance, because it translates into an improvement in safety conditions and a smaller impact on the environment, and, thus, on the communities where the Group operates.

The Group invested on average more than €19 million a year in the 2017-2019 three-year period in innovation, research and development activities for a total of approximately €58 million. These projects have involved on average more than 100 group specialised resources. Responsible conduct As well as building works that contribute to a territory's sustainable development, the Group's operations reflect its principles of integrity, correctness, reliability and sustainability. Its priorities include the protection and enhancement of its people in the social sphere and the fight against climate change and promotion of the circular economy in the environmental sphere.

Shared development The Group generates value in its works, its operations and its relations with internal and external stakeholders and shares this value with its shareholders, investors, clients, employees, suppliers, institutions and local communities. The economic value generated and distributed is a widely-accepted indicator of the Group's contribution to its stakeholders. It is also known as the social cash flow as it considers an organisation’s cash inflows and outflows that affect its main stakeholders. Value creation is measured as both the value generated by the Group (revenue and other inflows) and the value distributed to its stakeholders6 or retained by it for reinvestment. 6 The value distributed to stakeholders consists of dividends proposed by the board of directors to the shareholders as set out in this report. 22 Economic value generated and distributed to stakeholders in 2019 Suppliers Revenue Economic value €3,716m distributed €4,771 m Human resources €4,905m €791m Economic value Lenders Other revenue generated €262m €359m €5,076m Public administration €109m Shareholders Net financing Economic value income/(costs)* retained €27m (€54m) €171m * This caption is the sum of the following financial statements captions: Financial expense + Exchange differences + Gains (losses) on * equity investments. 23 The social cash flow measures just the direct value generated by the Group, without considering the indirect and induced contributions of its activities to the areas where it operates. The Group has employment and procurement policies designed to maximise the use of local labour and suppliers and optimise the multiplicative effect of its investments on the local economies. In 2019, 69% of its workforce was made up of local workers while a very impressive 94% of its purchases was made from local suppliers. 24 Key events of the year Progetto Italia 2019 was a crucial year for the Group in terms of the non-recurring transactions it was involved in, mostly linked to Progetto Italia. This industrial operation is of vital importance to the whole country and is designed to strengthen its infrastructure sector by acquiring and subsequently integrating Italian construction companies into Salini Impregilo. The operation has its roots in the Group's growth vision followed for more than ten years, through internal and external growth. It is also a response to the need to relaunch the Italian infrastructure sector, hit by difficulties in recent years that have affected the main construction companies with a significant impact, inter alia, on employment levels. Salini Impregilo intends to lever Progetto Italia to create a group of a size, technical expertise, know-how and financial, capital and economic solidity to compete more aggressively with the large international players on the global stage. The Project will create value not only for the Group but also all its stakeholders and the entire country. Progetto Italia will benefit the integrated companies as well as the Italian economy, bolstering employment in the construction sector and induced sectors (which include over 36 related business segments). It will contribute to the sector's relaunch and the unblocking of the many currently blocked work sites. Completion of the unfinished infrastructure and more competitive Italian construction companies active on the international market will contribute to Italy's GDP and tax revenue. Therefore, Progetto Italia is an operation that is closely related to achievement of the SDGs in Italy, especially Goal 8 Decent work and economic growth and Goal 9 Industry, innovation and infrastructure. In addition to Salini Impregilo, the aggregator , Progetto Italia involves CDP Equity7, as the strategic partner, and a syndicate of Italian banks (Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit and Banco BPM) as the financial backers. The first integration transactions took place between the end of 2018 and the start of 2019 and involved Seli Overseas S.p.A. and Grandi Lavori S.r.l. (which wholly owns GLF Construction, USA)8 and Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A.9. In 2019, Salini Impregilo presented an offer for an investment in Astaldi10, the second largest Italian construction company. Astaldi’s involvement is essential to Progetto Italia as it will allow the integration of the two most important Italian general contractors, creating an operator with stronger local roots, like the other large global players, and more competitive on international markets, thanks to the synergies between their geographical bases and infrastructure sectors served. 7 CDP Equity S.p.A. is a holding company of the Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) Group, a company controlled by the Italian Ministry of the Economy and Finance which promotes the country's growth. 8 Salini Impregilo has a right of usufruct on their shares and quotas, pending their subsequent acquisition 9 The acquisition agreement was finalised on 29 March 2019. 10The offer is part of Astaldi's business continuity proposal with which it has applied for a deed of arrangement procedure to the Rome Court. 25 Salini Impregilo has drawn up a detailed financial plan for Progetto Italia, designed not only to achieve the Project's objectives but also to improve the new construction hub's flexibility. The financial plan includes, inter alia, the placing of new ordinary shares for €600 million, the commitment to subscribe Astaldi’s capital increase for €225 million and the incorporation of Beyond S.r.l. to acquire the bonds issued by Astaldi. The new shares were successfully placed in November 2019, with demand significantly exceeding offer at the subscription price, demonstrating the confidence in Salini Impregilo and Progetto Italia of European and US investors and investors of other countries. It has expanded and further diversified the parent's investor base. The new share issue changed the ownership structure. At the end of 2019, the main shareholders were Salini Costruttori S.p.A., CDP Equity S.p.A., Intesa Sanpaolo S.p.A., UniCredit S.p.A. and Banco BPM S.p.A.11. It also led to a new corporate governance structure with the creation of a strategic committee to advise the board of directors on Progetto Italia and its implementation. Rebuilding the fragmented Italian construction sector, strengthening its financial structure and profit-making capacity, enhancing its know-how and management skills, vertical geographical and specialisation integration: these are the objectives set by Progetto Italia as a solid industrial operation that will create an increasingly global and flexible player able to respond to the specific requirements of any individual context thanks to a network of suppliers and partners in more than 50 countries and an unique blend of expertise and innovative capacity. Progetto Italia includes the Group's rebranding as WeBuild . It is a name that very clearly evokes the Group's vision, accompanied by a strong and direct verb, Build , that represents the DNA of a construction company that builds large complex infrastructure, in addition to the values of solidity, quality and partnership, while the word “We expresses the fundamental role played by people and teams. 11 Salini Costruttori S.p.A. with 44.99%, CDP Equity S.p.A. with 18.68%, Intesa San Paolo S.p.A. with 5.27%, Unicredit S.p.A. with 5.27% and Banco BPM S.p.A. with 0.67% of the shares with voting rights. More information is available in the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure. 26 Main milestones of Progetto Italia First offer for Completion of potential investment placing of new in Astaldi S.p.A.

The Group records the current and outstanding contract outcome in its order backlog. Projects are included when the Group receives official notification that it has been awarded the project by the client, which may take place before the definitive binding signing of the related contract. The Group’s contracts usually provide for the activation of specific procedures (usually arbitrations) to be followed in the case of either party’s contractual default. The order backlog includes the amount of the projects, including when they are suspended or deferred (i.e., Venezuela and Libya), pursuant to the contractual conditions. The value of the order backlog decreases: when a contract is cancelled or decreased as agreed with the client; in line with the recognition of contract revenue in profit or loss. The Group updates the order backlog to reflect amendments to contracts and agreements signed with clients. In the case of contracts that do not have a fixed consideration, the related order backlog reflects any contract variations agreed with the customer or when the customer requests an extension of the execution times or amendments to the project that had not been provided for in the contract, as long as these variations are agreed with the customer or the related revenue is highly probable. The measurement method used for the order backlog is not a measurement parameter provided for by the IFRS and is not calculated using financial information prepared in accordance with such standards. Therefore, the calculation method used by the Group may differ from that used by other sector operators. Accordingly, it cannot be considered as an alternative indicator to the revenue calculated under the IFRS or other IFRS measurements. Moreover, although the Group’s accounting systems update the related data on a consolidated basis once a month, the order backlog does not necessarily reflect the Group’s future results, as the order backlog data may be subject to significant variations. The above measurement method differs from the method used to prepare the disclosure on performance obligations yet to be satisfied in accordance with IFRS 15 as set out in note 34 to the consolidated financial statements. Specifically, the main contract revenue included in the order backlog and not considered in the notes includes: • revenue from concession contracts as it is earned mainly by equity-accounted investees; • revenue from the joint ventures not controlled by Lane Group and measured using the equity method; • income from cost recharges attributable to non-controlling members of Italian consortia classified as “Other income”. • contracts signed with clients that do not meet all the criteria of IFRS 15.9 at the reporting date. 33 Performance by geographical area Italy The Group operates in the construction segment in Italy, mostly in the areas of sustainable mobility and green buildings, and the concessions segment. Reference context and macroeconomic scenario Italy is ranked 30th in the SDB Global Rank, the index that measures progress towards achievement of the SDGs in 162 countries around the world. Italy shows progress in the majority of the goals that are most pertinent to the Group’s business areas although it still faces tough challenges with respect to, in particular, mobility and the fight against climate change.

They include uncertainty about the weak global economy as well as internal factors such as the low private consumption levels, small tax revenue and weak industrial production. According to the IFM’s most recent projections of March 2020, economic growth is estimated to be 0.3% in 2019. According to the estimates published by the IMF on 20 March 2020, GDP is expected to decrease by 0.6% while public debt will rise to 137% of GDP and the deficit to 2.6%. These estimates only partly reflect the effects of the Coronavirus. According to the 2020 construction market report issued by CRESME, an Italian research centre, investments in public works will grow by 5.5% in 2019, after growth of 2.3% in 2018. This growth is mainly triggered by investments in transport infrastructure (railways, roads, ports, airports and metros), including crucial infrastructure which is already under construction and is of strategic interest to the country. The main growth stimuli are the public sector’s renewed spending ability (its gross capital expenditure is projected to increase throughout the period from 2019 to 2022) and the amendments to the sector regulations with the decree to mobilise work sites (the “Decreto Sblocca-Cantieri”). 34 Bolstering the upturn in investments, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane Group announced that its 2019-2023 business plan includes investments of €58 billion, including €28 billion for railway infrastructure and €14 billion for road works. 2019 estimates 1.0% 0.8% YoY variation 0.6% 0.4% 0.2% 0.0% Bank of Italy European IMF OECD Consensus Forecast Commission Sources: Bank of Italy, January 2020 IMF, January 2020 Outlook for 2020 In line with the new direction undertaken in 2014 with the decree to mobilise work sites (Decree law no. 133/2014), the 2020 budget law (Law no. 160 of 27 December 2019) includes measures to boost infrastructure investments of approximately €20.8 billion, mostly in the period from 2020 to 2034. They include grants for municipalities for the implementation of safety measures for buildings and the local areas (€4.9 billion to €8.8 billion), funds for municipalities for infrastructure investments (€400 million per year from 2025 to 2034), definitive and executive design costs borne by local entities (€2.7 billion safety measures, hydrogeological risk, public buildings and municipal assets and roads), a fund for municipality-run playschools (€2.5 billion) and for the road system and schools operated by provinces and metropolitan cities (€6.1 billion). The 2020 budget law should extend the timeline for compliance with the requirements to tender and set up work sites for the work envisaged in the decree to mobilise work sites (Decree law no. 133/2014) in line with its stated intention and to relaunch public investments in the infrastructure sector. It should also confirm the strategies designed to identify the country’s infrastructure requirements up to 2034. Part of the requirements for the procurement and setting up of work sites for the work envisaged in the decree led to the implementation and, in certain cases the completion, of the works for strategic projects such as the Milan Venice high speed railway line, the Giovi third railway crossing and especially projects for southern Italy (the Naples Bari high speed/capacity railway line and the doubling of the Palermo Catania Messina railway line). 35 On 17 March 2020, Decree law no. 18/2020 (the “Marzo Cura Italia” decree) was issued whereby the government earmarked €25 billion to stem the immediate effects of the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19). Another Decree law should be issued in April to relaunch the economy by injecting liquidity of some tens of billions of Euros. The infrastructure sector should be one of those that will benefit from this measure.

(RFI, formerly TAV S.p.A. as Ferrovie dello Stato’s operator) with the agreement of 16 March 1992 and subsequent rider of 11 November 2011. Salini Impregilo has a 99.999% stake in the consortium as its leader. Its stake changed during the year after Condotte’s interest therein was decreased to the minimum as described in detail in the notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements. The works began on 2 April 2012 and the contract is worth approximately €4.7 billion. It is split into six non-functional construction lots for a total of roughly 125 months excluding the preoperating/inspection phase (three months). On 18 June 2019, RFI informed the consortium that, following enactment of Law no. 55 of 14 June 2019 containing urgent measures to relaunch the public works sector, the conditions established by the RFI-COCIV rider had been met. This rider provided for the contract to be drawn up for the sixth and last construction lot worth approximately €528 million and, accordingly, it was formalised. In October 2019, the consortium received the contract advance of roughly €53 million. As provided for contractually, the contracts for the two Pozzolo Tortona and Voltri Polcevera lots were formalised during the year for €425 million as per the costs estimated in the tender bids. At 31 December 2019, all the six lots provided for in the rider of 11 November 2011 were fully financed for €4.4 billion. The call for tenders for the last lots to be assigned will start up again in 2020. 36 Information about the orders issued by the Rome and Genoa public prosecutors which also involved certain parties related to the consortium is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section. High-speed/capacity Verona Padua Railway Project The IRICAV DUE consortium is RFI’s general contractor for the design and construction of the high speed/capacity Verona Padua section as per the agreement of 15 October 1991. The 78.8 km railway line will cross 19 municipalities (six in the Verona Province, nine in the Vicenza Province and four in the Padua Province), to quadruple the existing line, increase the quality of the Italian railway system and assist its integration with the European network. Salini Impregilo’s involvement in the consortium is 34.09%. On 22 December 2017, after the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport completed its inspection, the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning (CIPE) approved the definitive project for the first functional lot, the Verona Vicenza junction, of the high speed/capacity Verona Padua railway section, estimated to be worth approximately €2.4 billion. It authorised commencement of the first construction works worth an estimated approximate €850 million. On 18 July 2018, after completion of the legitimacy checks by the Court of Auditors, the CIPE’s approval measure was published in the Official Journal and became effective. The approval measure authorised a maximum investment of €4.8 billion by RFI in the entire Verona Padua railway line section, of which €4.2 billion for the general contractor. During the year, the consortium was again involved in reviewing the updated definitive project for both the new works required by the CIPE and the new railway regulations and rules implemented since the date of commencement of the authorisation process. It also held preliminary meetings with Italferr S.p.A., the technical expert engaged by RFI, to assess the project’s technical and financial characteristics. On 9 July 2019, following publication of the “Costs-benefits analysis” by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, RFI notified the consortium of the timeline for the works necessary to be able to sign the rider for the first Verona – Vicenza junction functional lot. Negotiations to define the lump-sum consideration and the text of the rider to the agreement of 15 October 1991 with RFI are still ongoing. Other projects in Italy Naples Bari railway line Naples Cancello section The high capacity Naples Bari railway line is of strategic importance to southern Italy as it connects its two most important economic and urban areas, which contribute more than 40% to the south’s total production 37 output. The project will extend the high speed/capacity service to southern Italy, connecting it to the rest of Italy and reducing travel times by between 20% to 45%. The University of Sannio carried out a study which estimated that the new line will lead to demographic growth of 2.1% in the municipalities it crosses thanks to the stops along the way. This, in turn, should trigger growth of 1.6% in the related provinces’ GDP and an increase of 6.6% in the residents’ average income. With respect to the Naples Cancello section of the Naples Bari railway line, the contract for which was signed in December 2017 by the joint venture led by Salini Impregilo (60% share), the contract advance was received on 5 April 2019. During 2019, work commenced including the clearing of ordnance and laying of the foundations for some viaducts and tunnel sections. On 26 November 2019, Salini Impregilo signed a rider with RFI for the supply of crushed stone by the joint venture and the removal of the above-ground materials in areas located in the Casoria Municipality. This increased the contract consideration to approximately €417.7 million. Naples Bari railway line Apice Hirpinia section On 28 March 2019, RFI announced that the joint venture comprising Salini Impregilo (leader with 60%) and Astaldi had been awarded the contract for the executive design and construction of the Apice Hirpinia section of the Naples Bari railway line worth €608.1 million. On 1 July 2019, the two partners set up Consorzio HIRPINIA AV and it signed the related contract with RFI on 31 July 2019. It collected the contract advance of €121.6 million, equal to 20% of the entire amount, on 25 October 2019. During the second half of 2019, the consortium carried out the activities for the executive design and related geognostic investigations. It delivered the executive design to the site manager Italferr S.p.A. and the client RFI in February 2020. Palermo Catania railway line Bicocca Catenanuova section Again with respect to railway works, as leader of a consortium (51.3%), Salini Impregilo signed a contract with RFI to double the tracks on the Bicocca Catenanuova section of the Palermo Catania railway line, including the executive design. The contract is worth approximately €192 million. Following approval of the executive design on 14 December 2018 and delivery of the works on 20 December 2018, the joint venture collected the contract advance on 5 April 2019. In 2019, the ongoing works include the ordnance clearance, the deep foundations and reinforced concrete works of the main viaducts, the temporary deviation of the current line, construction of the tunnel, hydraulic manholes of the railway line under construction, electric traction and light driving power, construction and renovation of ailway buildings and the demolition of disused tracks. 38 Brenner base tunnel Isarco River Underpass This contract consists of underground civil works and external works for the relocation of national road SS12 and a cargo loading/unloading area on the A22 motorway. Salini Impregilo is the lead contractor with a share of 41%. During 2019, the main activities involved the works to complete the excavation of four shafts, commencement of the works to strengthen the Isarco River Underpass, commencement of boring of the northbound tunnels, continuation of consolidation works using the jet grouting technique and the excavation and lining of the southbound tunnels. Milan Metro Line 4 Metro Blu S.c.r.l. (Salini Impregilo’s investment: 50%) was set up to carry out the works and services related to the civil works to build the new Line 4 of the Milan Metro. The new line, which will be fully automated (i.e., driverless), will cover a 15.2 km stretch from Linate to Lorenteggio. It will increase the city’s public sustainability mobility system carrying an additional 24 thousand passengers an hour in each direction. The contract includes the construction of two single-track tunnels, one in each direction, 21 stations and a depot/workshop. Work started in 2013 under an accessory agreement pending approval of the concession agreement of 22 December 2014 and the subsequent rider no. 1 of 5 February 2019. The consideration for the EPC contract is roughly €1.8 billion. The project comprises three stages and will take 103 months from the agreement’s effective date, including the pre-operating and functional trials. The expected completion date is 22 July 2023. Boring of the tunnels is 83% complete and the work should be finished during the first half of 2020. Rebuilding of the Polcevera Bridge of the A10 motorway With respect to motorways and bridges, Salini Impregilo and Fincantieri were awarded the contract worth approximately €200 million to rebuild the bridge over the Polcevera River in Genoa, as per the decree of the extraordinary commissioner for the reconstruction project of 18 December 2018. The bridge’s design incorporates environmental aspects, based on projections about the climate in the area to ensure that the bridge will stand up to the increase in rainfall expected to occur over the next 80 years. In addition, 100% of the excavation materials will be reused during the works and the completed project, once it is in operation, will have a photovoltaic system that will provide it with 95% of its energy requirements. On 18 January 2019, the extraordinary commissioner signed the contract to rebuild the Polcevera Bridge, part of the A10 motorway, with PERGENOVA S.C.p.A., the consortium company limited by shares set up by Salini Impregilo and Fincantieri Infrastructure S.p.A. (50:50). The contract covers the design and execution of the works and services to rebuild the new bridge. The consortium company received the contract advance on 25 39 February 2019. The work areas were delivered on 15 April 2019 and awork is scheduled to take 382 days. At year end, the consortium company has completed the works for the sub-foundations of the bridge and the aboveground work was underway. On 1 October 2019, the first section of the deck was installed. Jonica state highway 106 Third maxi-lot Sirjo S.c.p.A. (Salini Impregilo investment: 40%) is the general contractor for the design-build contract signed on 12 March 2012 for the third maxi-lot of Jonica state highway 106. The contract is worth approximately €980 million. CIPE approved the definitive designs with resolution no. 3/2018 of 28 February 2018 published in the Italian Official Journal no. 178 of 2 August 2018, which followed its previous resolution no. 41/2016 approving the definitive designs for the first lot, published in the Italian Official Journal on 1 August 2017. Sirjo S.c.p.A. sent the executive designs to the client on 15 April 2019 for checks by Conteco Check of the quality, technical and financial adequacy and compliance with the ruling regulations. Conteco Check completed its checks on 24 September 2019 and issued its report with a positive opinion. ANAS’ board of directors should approve the executive designs by May 2020. In addition, on 28 November 2019, ANAS sent the executive designs to the competent bodies so that they could check their implementation/compliance and approval of the plan for the utilisation of excavated soil and rocks (PUT, piano di utilizzo delle terre e rocce da scavo) pursuant to Legislative decree no. 161/2012. Given that no comments were received within the legal limit of 90 days for the plan’s approval from the Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea (MATTM), work on the project can be commenced. Once the Ministry has approved the plan and ANAS’ board of directors the executive designs, the site manager can deliver the works, slated to take place during the second quarter of 2020. ENI headquarters The Group does not limit itself to infrastructure. It is also engaged in acquiring orders in the commercial building sector, thus availing of development opportunities mostly created by the growth of Italy’s large metropolitan areas. In partnership with a leading group of investors and acting as contractor, Salini Impregilo signed a contract on 28 July 2017 for the building of ENI’s new headquarters in San Donato Milanese. This construction contract is worth roughly €151 million (Salini Impregilo’s share: 60%). Work began at the end of 2017 and continued in 2019 with construction of the three buildings. Activities for the bulk of the project, such as the installation of the systems and facades, have been stepped up. Negotiations with the customer about the internal finishings became more intense towards the end of the year to be settled with a rider with a value of approximately €15 million. This will lead to an extension of the delivery times of around six months. … 40 Unforeseen costs have been incurred on the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section and Eni’s headquarters and the contractor has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and contract liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. 41 Italian concessions The Group’s concessions activities in Italy mainly consist of investments in the operators still involved in developing projects and constructing the related infrastructure.

Following the recent developments due to the spreading of the Coronavirus, COVID-19, and its effect on the economy, the IMF has revised its global growth forecast downwards by 0.1% to 3.2% in its press release of 22 February 2020. This impact has been estimated assuming that Chinese economic growth will return to normal in the second half of the year. At the date of this report, updates about the global GDP’s estimated trend, reflecting the spreading of COVID19 in countries other than China, are not available. With respect to the Group’s reference sectors, according to the IHS Markit January 2020 report, global infrastructure investments increased by 2.9% in 2019. 48 Oceania Australia Reference context and market scenario Australia is ranked 38th in the SDG Global Rank. It shows progress in the majority of the goals that are most pertinent to the Group’s business areas in this country, although it still faces tough challenges with respect to, in particular, energy and the fight against climate change.

Thanks to the growing prestige of the leader Abiy Ahmed, the country’s cooperation with Europe, the United States and the East has intensified. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are among the supranational bodies that provide support and ongoing guidance to the country while the European Union has recently lent Ethiopia €170 million to assist the local government with its ongoing political and economic reforms. The African country’s commercial and strategic importance will encourage the inflow of hard currencies to the central bank in Addis Abeba. This is key to providing the financial resources necessary to, inter alia, make foreign payments for infrastructure projects. Outlook for 2020 The local government intends to make the most of the country’s natural resources, and especially its water resources, to encourage investments in renewable energy and the installation of additional production capacity. The generation of electricity and its subsequent export to the surrounding countries will assist the continent’s integration and encourage flows of hard currency. 56 The Group has a strong operating and commercial base in the country and will continue to work on its existing projects (Gerd and Koysha). It will also leverage on its know-how and existing presence in the country to exploit all new business and industrial opportunities.

The Rogun Hydropower Project assigned to the Group is of fundamental importance to boost the country’s economic growth over the next few years with the export of electrical energy generated by the hydroelectric power plant. The country’s government’s efforts to engage in relations with its counterparties of the surrounding countries have been successful. For the first time in nine years, Tajikistan has started to export electrical energy to Uzbekistan. The country intends to put to use its vast hydropower potential to meet demand from South Asian countries. It is engaged in additional negotiations for the sale of electricity energy counting on the near completion of the early generation stage of the Rogun Hydropower Project, when electrical energy will be provided although at a lower output than when the project has been completed. Outlook for 2020 To complete financing of the project, the government has already approved, inter alia, the issue of bonds for USD1 billion (an additional USD500 million to those already placed). During 2020, other lots should be assigned to the Group in accordance with the signed framework agreement. 58 Main ongoing projects The following table shows the amounts involved in the main contract: (Share in millions of Euros) Project Residual order backlog Percentage of Residual order backlog Percentage of at 31 December 2018 completion at 31 December 2019 completion Rogun Hydropower Project 1,481.4 25.6% 1,657.1 31.3% Total 1,481.4 1,657.1 Rogun Hydropower Project On 1 July 2016, Salini Impregilo signed a framework agreement with the Tajikistani government worth approximately USD3.9 billion to build a hydroelectric power plant (split into four functional lots). The Group, with a 100% share, has been assigned the first executive lot (Lot 2) of roughly USD1.9 billion to build a 335 metrehigh rockfill dam with a clay core, the tallest in the world, on the Vakhsh River in Pamir, one of Central Asia’s main mountain ranges. The contract term is 11 years (plus two years warranty). On 16 November 2018, the first of the six power house turbines (each with a full capacity of about 600 megawatt) was successfully launched. On 9 September 2019, the second turbine also became operative marking another important milestone in the completion of the early generation stage. Americas Canada Reference context and market scenario Canada is ranked 20th in the SDG Global Rank. It shows progress in the majority of the goals that are most pertinent to the Group’s business areas in this country, although it still faces tough challenges with respect to, in particular, mobility, water and the fight against climate change.

The complete Mobilinx team, which also consists of John Laing, Hitachi, Amico, Bot and Transdev, will design, build, finance and operate the HuLRT for a 30-year term. The HuLRT is an 18-kilometre, 19-stop light rail transit system, able to transport up to 14 million passengers a year, that runs along Hurontario Street from Port Credit in Mississauga to the Brampton Gateway Terminal. The HuLRT will operate in a separated guideway with traffic priority throughout most of the corridor. With a 42% stake in the joint venture for the civil construction work (€385 million), Salini Impregilo will lead the engineering, procurement and construction of the civil works. Astaldi has a 28% stake (for a value of approximately €257 million). 60 Peru Reference context and market scenario Peru is ranked 51st in the SDG Global Rank. It shows progress in the majority of the goals that are most pertinent to the Group’s business areas in this country, although it still faces tough challenges with respect to, in particular, mobility.

Main ongoing projects The following table shows the amounts involved in the main contract: (Share in millions of Euros) Project Residual order backlog Percentage of Residual order backlog Percentage of at 31 December 2018 completion at 31 December 2019 completion Lima Metro Line 2 577.1 16.0% 540.7 22.2% Total 577.1 540.7 Lima Metro Line 2 and Ramal Av. Fuacett – Av. Gambeta On 28 March 2014, the international consortium comprising Salini Impregilo Group and other international groups won the contract for the construction and operation of the extension to Lima’s metro network under concession from Agencia de Promociòn de la Inversiòn Privada. The project includes the construction of the works and operation of the infrastructure over the 35-year concession. Line 2 will make a very important contribution to the capital’s sustainability mobility as it is expected that it will be able to carry 665 thousand passengers a day. 61 The Group’s share of the construction work is 25.5% of the civil works. On 13 December 2018, the consortium and the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications signed Addendum 2, which established the new delivery dates with a revised work schedule and billing programme. It also defined new concession areas in some cases. The contract consideration is approximately USD3 billion. … Unforeseen costs have been incurred on the Forrestfield Airport Link (Australia), Koysha Hydroelectric Project (Ethiopia), Gerd (Ethiopia), Rogun Hydropower Project (Tajikistan) and Line 14, Lot 4 (France) contracts referred to above and the contractor has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. 62 Foreign concessions The Group’s foreign concessions comprise both investments in the operators, which are fully operational and, hence, provide services for a fee or at rates applied to the infrastructure’s users, and operators that are still developing and constructing the related infrastructure and will only provide the related service in future years. The current concessions are held in Latin America (Argentina, Colombia and Peru), Canada, the UK and Turkey. They refer to the transportation sector (motorways and metro systems), hospitals, renewable energy and water treatment sectors. The two Argentine operators are currently in liquidation and their contracts have been terminated. During 2020, the Group sold its stake in Consorcio Agua Azul S.A. for roughly USD13 million.

As part of its internal controls and risk management system, the Group has a risk management framework, which it keeps up-to-date, is an integral part of internal procedures and is extended to all operating companies to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks in accordance with industry best practices. Development, implementation and circulation of the risk management framework (presented in the following chart) is designed to assist senior management with strategic and commercial planning and operations through the comprehensive, in-depth analysis of relevant factors for the Group’s business, the local contexts in which it operates and the particular operating requirements of its individual contracts, facilitating the identification and monitoring of related risks, be they economic, financial or non-financial (sustainability or ESG risks). During 2019, the Group focused on strengthening its methods and tools to analyse contract risk during the bidding stage and to continuously include procedures for the efficient management of the most significant risks, such as country and counterparty risks (involving, therefore, clients, partners, subcontractors and significant suppliers). It also implemented procedures to analyse and manage economic, financial and non-financial risks in more depth, both at contract and corporate level. These procedures and the Group’s ongoing development of the frameworks allow it to promptly and carefully analyse its risk profile and identify how to manage those more relevant risk events with tailored measures. Business risks External risks are those that may compromise the Group’s achievement of its objectives, i.e. all events whose occurrence is not influenced by corporate decisions. This category includes all risks arising from a country’s 64 macroeconomic and socio-political dynamics, global megatrends (climate change, resource scarcity and urbanisation), sector trends and competitive scenario, as well as from industry-specific technological innovation and regulatory developments and the projects’ long-term nature. Given the nature of such risks, the Group must rely on its forecasting and managing abilities. Specifically, Salini Impregilo integrates risk vision in its strategic and business planning processes through the definition of commercial and risk guidelines and the development of a process for the prioritisation and selection of initiatives to be pursued, also and above all based on the assessment of relevant risks linked to the country and/or sector in which operations are planned, rather than to the counterparty. Risk control is also ensured by monitoring the progress of strategic objectives, including in terms of composition and diversification of the portfolio and its development over time in terms of risk profile. Strategic risks These risks arise from strategic, business and organisational decisions that may adversely impact the Group’s performance and ultimately result in the non-achievement of strategic objectives. They include risks resulting from the choice of business or organisational models through which the Group intends to operate, those arising from M&A transactions, or the ineffective management of the order portfolio or the relationships with key counterparties (clients, partners, suppliers, sub-contractors, etc.). Salini Impregilo considers risk a key element for the preliminary assessment of decisions and strategic choices, so much so that it provided for integration of the strategy definition and development process with that for the identification, measurement and management of risks. The choices pertaining to the adoption of a business or organisational model, the assessment about the opportunity of proceeding with an extraordinary transaction or establishing a partnership are subject to preliminary analysis and evaluation of the related risks and opportunities, with the concurrent identification of risk management methods and strategies to be promptly activated should such risks arise. Financial risks Risks linked to the availability of group resources, depending on the management of receivables and cash and cash equivalents and/or the volatility of market variables such as interest and exchange rates, are included in this category. Specifically, liquidity management has the objective of ensuring the financial autonomy of contracts in progress, taking into account the structure of consortia and special purpose entities, which can tie the availability of financial resources to the execution of the relevant projects. Moreover, liquidity management takes into account restrictions to currency transfers imposed by the legislation of some countries. Salini Impregilo also considers specific risk areas such as the counterparty’s credit rating, raw materials price volatility and management of assurance issues, equipping itself with effective financial planning tools. Legal and compliance risk This risk class includes risks for the management of legal issues and/or risks related to compliance with laws and regulations (e.g. taxation, local legislation, etc.) required in order to operate in the sector and/or specific countries and the risks arising from the management of contracts with business partners. Salini Impregilo deems that monitoring contractual issues linked to contract management and, particularly, the relationship with relevant 65 counterparties, is fundamental. This also includes any internal and external fraud risks, and, more generally, the compliance with procedures and policies established by the Group to govern its operations. With respect to the aforementioned factors, Salini Impregilo implements a regulatory risk monitoring and management policy in order to minimise the impact of such risk, through a multi-level control system that entails collaborative and ongoing liaison with relevant counterparties and business units affected by regulatory developments and the comprehensive assessment of any potential impacts. Operational risks These are risks that could jeopardize value creation and are due to an inefficient and/or ineffective management of the Group’s core business, particularly those linked to bid management and actual execution of contracts. The various risk areas that fall into this class include bid design and planning, logistics and inventory management, as well as those linked to the management of IT systems, planning and reporting, effective supply chain and personnel management, including with respect to health and safety, the environment, human rights and local communities. The Consolidated Non-Financial Statement in Part II of this report provides more information about sustainability risks. These risks arise during the bidding stage and/or performance of contracts, should group policies and procedures not be sufficiently adequate for the management of risk factors linked to the level of complexity of the project or unforeseeable events. To this end, the Group intends to monitor such risks starting at the bidding stage of each contract with a risk/benefit analysis of the project in the event of its award and its impact on the portfolio structure, both in terms of risk concentration and overall risk profile. At this time, Salini Impregilo, as part of a wider process, prepares a pre-bid risk assessment aimed at identifying potential risks and impacts linked to the project, as well as the necessary mitigation and/or contingency measures to counter them. The risk surveillance activity is then performed again at tender stage and monitored and updated during contract execution in order to promptly detect the risk exposure development and swiftly implement adequate remediation measures. *** As part of the aforementioned framework for the identification and classification of risks applicable to group operations, Salini Impregilo has adopted a cross-functional approach for the analysis of risk dimensions that are considered more relevant due to the specific features of its business. These dimensions include various risk areas identified and belonging to Salini Impregilo’s risk universe. Country risk The Group pursues its objectives by operating almost everywhere in the world, leveraging business opportunities in different countries and hence exposing itself to the risks resulting from the characteristics and conditions dictated by them, such as the political, economic and social scenario, local regulations, taxation and operational complexity and, last but not least, work and safety conditions. Being aware of and constantly monitoring country risk through specific indicators enables the Group first and foremost to define informed commercial strategies, as well as to gain an optimal understanding of the operating scenario and, therefore, adopt precautions and/or implement actions aimed at removing barriers and mitigate potential threats. 66 Counterparty risk Management of counterparty risk requires identification of potential criticalities linked to relationships with the Group’s clients, shareholders, subcontractors and suppliers, so as to create a comprehensive overview of the features of the partners with which Salini Impregilo may start or continue to collaborate. For each of the above counterparty types, risk factors linked to financial and operational reliability apply to a different extent, as does the potential strategic role of a partnership for a specific business initiative, as well as all legal and compliance aspects and those related to the applicable standards (ethics, quality, health and safety, environment, human rights) that safeguard the lawfulness of the relationship. The Group performs a counterparty analysis for each new project, involving all the competent departments and the Group Risk Officer, to obtain more precise identification of the critical issues that could arise during the contract’s operational stages and more accurate planning of the possible mitigation actions. Contract risk The contract dimension is key for an effective analysis of all risks linked to the Group’s core business, since it is considered to define tools capable of identifying and monitoring so-called contract risks starting from the bidding stage in a risk prevention perspective, as part of an in-depth analysis of the risks and opportunities linked to the pursuit of a specific activity. Another fundamental aspect is the ongoing tracking of risks once they have been consciously taken on by management, managing the resulting risk exposure in a proactive, dynamic way, as well as its ongoing development over time. *** The analysis of key risk dimensions and the related risk areas has the aim of providing management with a twosided overview: a detailed one (i.e. at individual country, counterparty and contract level) and a portfolio one (for assessment of the overall exposure to such dimension), in order to assess the Group’s risk profile as well as its compliance with the exposure limits imposed by its risk management capacity. Moreover, the portfolio overview enables the performance of systematic assessments about the potential development of the risk profile upon occurrence of certain events and/or specific choices that may result in any changes to it, through the use of dedicated risk management tools. The risk management framework, as outlined above and subject to further and future developments, has been designed to support decision-making and operational processes at every stage of the management of projects, in order to reduce the possibility that certain events may compromise the Group’s normal business operations or attainment of its defined strategic objectives: to this end, it is integrated in strategic and business planning processes, which, therefore, cannot be separated from the Group’s risk profile, as well as from its choices in terms of risk appetite. 67 Initial considerations on the comparability of management accounts figures The Group’s results for the 2019 are not fully comparable with those for the previous year as it has applied IFRS 16 Leases using the modified retrospective approach. This has entailed the recognition of the cumulative effect of FTA in retained earnings at 1 January 2019. For management account purposes only, the Group has calculated adjusted figures that reflect the effect of IFRS 16 FTA as described below. Financial highlights The “Adjusted reclassified statement of profit or loss” and the “Adjusted net financial indebtedness” tables show the Group’s adjusted key financial indicators for 2019 compared to the previous year. Adjustments are not provided for by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and endorsed by the European Union. The Group deems that these adjusted figures and data provide information useful to management and investors to assess the Group’s performance and compare it to other companies active in the same sector. They also provide an additional picture of the results. As a result, the Group has adjusted its IFRS accounting figures to reflect the effects summarised below. Joint ventures not controlled by Lane The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the non-subsidiary joint ventures consolidated on a proportionate basis. These figures show the status of contracts managed directly by Lane or through noncontrolling investments in joint ventures. Impairment Venezuela In the last three years, the Group has calculated the recoverable amount of its total exposure to Venezuelan government agencies to reflect the negative developments caused by the deterioration in the country’s credit standing. The tests performed, including with the assistance of independent experts, showed that the exposure’s recoverable amount was approximately €159.7 million at 31 December 2019, net of cumulative impairment losses of €479.7 million. At 31 December 2019, due to the developments of the year, the Group recognised another impairment loss of €35.7 million to adjust the exposure’s recoverable amount. As a result, its net exposure amounts to €128.7 million, equal to 20% of the gross exposure’s nominal amount. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of this report. 68 IFRS 16 Leases The Group adjusted the figures for 2018, using the best estimates available, to reflect the application of IFRS 16. These estimates were based on the following: ▪ leases include those in place at 31 December 2018 and, therefore, they do not include those of the Plants & Paving Division sold at the end of that year; ▪ the IFRS 16 FTA effects on profit or loss have been estimated by anticipating the date of initial application from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2018 or an interim date if the lease was agreed in 2018; ▪ the discount rates at 1 January 2019 have been used. The section on the “Change in standards” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of the standard and the effects of its application. 69 Adjusted reclassified statement of profit or loss 2018 Adjusted 2019 Adjusted Salini Joint Salini Joint Impregilo ventures not Impairment IFRS 16 Total Impregilo ventures notImpairment Total (in millions of Euros) Group controlled Venezuela FTA (**) adjusted Group controlled Venezuela adjusted by Lane (*) by Lane (*) Revenue 5,197.7 216.7 5,414.4 5,130.0 201.2 5,331.2 Gross operating profit (loss) 413.3 (13.0) 23.2 423.4 531.2 (108.6) 422.6 (EBITDA) Gross operating profit margin 8.0% 7.8% 10.4% 7.9% (EBITDA) % Operating profit 68.1 (13.0) 165.5 1.6 222.2 256.8 (108.6) 35.7 183.9 (loss) (EBIT) R.o.S. % 1.3% 4.1% 5.0% 3.4% Net financing costs (72.9) (3.9) (76.8) (73.2) (73.2) Net gains (losses) on equity (29.5) 13.0 (16.5) (127.7) 108.6 (19.1) investments Profit (loss) before (34.2) 165.5 (2.3) 128.9 55.9 35.7 91.6 tax (EBT) Income taxes (39.3) (39.7) (79.0) (69.2) (8.6) (77.7) Profit (loss) from continuing (73.5) 125.7 (2.3) 50.0 (13.3) 27.2 13.9 operations Profit (loss) from discontinued 114.8 114.8 (0.9) (0.9) operations Non-controlling interests 12.9 12.9 (8.0) (8.0) Profit (loss) for the year attributable to the owners of the 54.2 125.7 (2.3) 177.6 (22.1) 27.2 5.0 parent (*) The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the non-subsidiary joint ventures consolidated on a proportionate basis.

(**) The figures for 2018 have been restated using the best estimates available to reflect the application of IFRS 16. 70 Adjusted revenue for the year is €5,331.2 million compared to €5,414.4 million for 2018. The main contributors to the adjusted revenue are some large projects and, specifically, Lane’s projects, the high speed/capacity railway works for the Milan Genoa railway line section, the Ethiopian contracts, the projects in Saudi Arabia including the design and building of the new Riyadh Metro and the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan. The adjusted gross operating profit amounts to €422.6 million (€423.4 million) while the adjusted operating profit comes to €183.9 million (€222.2 million). The adjusted net financing costs approximate €73.2 million compared to €76.8 million for 2018. They include: financial expense of €147.1 million (€145.8 million); partly offset by: financial income of €69.6 million (€55.8 million); net exchange gains of €4.3 million (€13.3 million). Net losses on equity investments come to €19.1 million, compared to net losses of €16.5 million for 2018, due to the losses recognised by the equity-accounted investees. The profit before tax amounts to €91.6 million, a decrease on the balance of €128.9 million for 2018. The income taxes for the year are €77.7 million (€79.0 million). The loss from discontinued operations of €0.9 million (profit of €114.8 million) entirely reflects the costs of the USW Campania business unit for the year. The profit for 2018 also included the loss of €115.2 million made by Lane’s Plants & Paving Division, which was sold in December 2018. Non-controlling interests amount to a profit of €8.0 million. They mainly relate to the group companies working in Saudi Arabia on the construction of Line 3 of the Riyadh Metro. The loss for 2018 was due to the allocation of the loss for that year to non-controlling interests. 71 Adjusted net financial indebtedness 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Salini Impregilo Group IFRS 16 FTA Total adjusted Salini Impregilo Group (in millions of Euros) (*) Net financial indebtedness (859.6) (81.9) (941.6) (631.4) Gross indebtedness (2,338.5) (81.9) (2,420.5) (2,270.1) (*) The figures at 31 December 2018 have been adjusted to reflect the application of IFRS 16 as described in the “Initial considerations on the comparability of the management accounts figures” section for comparability purposes. Adjusted net financial indebtedness has improved by roughly €310.2 million compared to 31 December 2018 considering the higher financial liabilities due to application of IFRS 16 (from €941.6 million at 31 December 2018 to €631.4 million at 31 December 2019), while gross indebtedness decreased by around €150.4 million. Net of the debt of approximately €85.1 million of Beyond S.r.l. (set up in 2019 as part of Progetto Italia), gross indebtedness would be €2,185.0 million which, compared to the adjusted balance at 31 December 2018 (€2,420.5 million), is an improvement of about €235.5 million on the previous year end. More information is available in the section on the group’s financial position. 72 Group performance This section presents the Group’s reclassified statement of profit or loss and statement of financial position and a breakdown of its financial position at 31 December 2019. It also provides an overview of the main changes in the Group’s financial position and results of operations compared to the previous year. Unless indicated otherwise, figures are provided in millions of Euros and those shown in brackets relate to the previous year. The “Alternative performance indicators” section gives a definition of the financial statements indicators used to present the Group’s financial position and results of operations for the period. 73 Group performance The following table shows the Group’s reclassified IFRS statement of profit or loss.

(**) Starting from 2019, the Group has decided to present “Impairment losses” separately in the reclassified statement of profit or loss for their better presentation. Therefore, the 2018 comparative figure has been restated accordingly. Revenue Revenue for the year amounts to €5,130.0 million (€5,197.7 million), including €3,208.9 million earned abroad (€3,917.4 million), of which €1,038.8 million in the US (€787.9 million) and €882.3 million in Italy (€492.3 million). “Other income” mostly refers to contract work in progress and specifically industrial activities and related works not directly related to contracts with customers. The increase of €25.8 million is mostly due to the cost recharges to non-controlling consortium members (other income in the consortium’s financial statements). Salini Impregilo Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system whereby the costs incurred by the SPE are invoiced to the consortium members in line with their investment percentages. As this income does not arise on the performance of the contract obligations or contract negotiations, it is recognised as “Other income”. 74 Operating profit The operating profit amounts to €256.8 million for the period (€68.1 million), showing a significant improvement on the previous year. The increase in this item is mainly due to the reduction of Condotte’s interest in COCIV to the minimum (0.001%) (the notes to the consolidated and separate financial statements provide more information about this), which impacted the gross operating profit by approximately €107.5 million, the reduction of €102.4 million (€194.5 million) in impairment losses, as a result of the larger losses recognised in 2018. Amortisation, depreciation and provisions of €171.9 million (€150.7 million) increased principally as a result of higher depreciation expense on the right-of-use assets recognised since 1 January 2019 in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments The Group recorded net financing costs of €73.2 million (€72.9 million). The item comprises: financial expense of €147.1 million (€141.9 million); partly offset by: financial income of €69.6 million (€55.8 million); net exchange gains of €4.3 million (net losses of €13.3 million). The rise in financial expense is mostly due to the effect of the measurement of loan assets recognised at 31 December 2019 in accordance with IFRS 9 and payment of interest of €13.7 million by the Ethiopian branch for the years from 2014 to 2016 as part of a tax assessment. This increase is partly offset by the reduction in financial expense on the bonds of approximately €10.7 million compared to the previous year following the redemption of the unsecured senior bonds in August 2018. The €13.8 million increase in financial income is chiefly related to Constructora Ariguani and comprises interest accrued as compensation on the recovery of an advance paid after the dispute with the former partner/subcontractor Conalvias was settled in the second half of 2019. Net exchange gains of €4.3 million mainly arose on the Euro’s performance vis-à-vis the US dollar and Ethiopian birr. Net losses on equity investments came to €127.7 million (€29.5 million). The increase in this item is due to the Group’s share of losses of equity-accounted investees (mostly belonging to Lane Group) and, in particular, the joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate contract. It made a loss in 2019 due to the higher costs incurred. At the date of preparation of this report, the joint venture is preparing a claim which will include additional consideration for these costs. 75 Income taxes The increase in income taxes is due to the significant rise in the profit before tax, the payment to settle the tax assessment in Ethiopia and the results of the group companies. Loss from discontinued operations The loss from discontinued operations of €0.9 million (profit of €114.8 million) entirely reflects the costs of the USW Campania business unit for the year. The profit for 2018 also included the loss of €115.2 million made by Lane’s Plants & Paving Division, which was sold in December 2018. Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests amount to a profit of €8.0 million. They mainly relate to the group companies working in Saudi Arabia on the construction of Line 3 of the Riyadh metro. The loss for 2018 was due to the allocation of the loss for that year to non-controlling interests. 76 The Group’s financial position The following table shows the Group’s reclassified IFRS statement of financial position: Table 2 Reclassified statement of financial position 31 December 31 December Variation Note (*) 2018 2019 (€’000) Non-current assets 7-8-9-11 1,153,554 1,305,277 151,723 Goodwill 10 74,713 76,062 1,349 Net non-current assets held for sale 21 5,683 11,976 6,293 Provisions for risks 28 (84,213) (137,922) (53,709) Post-employment benefits and employee benefits 27 (57,025) (61,868) (4,843) Net tax assets 13-18-30 259,066 333,352 74,286 Inventories 14 192,304 156,368 (35,936) Contract assets 15 1,512,866 2,040,450 527,584 Contract liabilities 15 (1,149,588) (1,186,076) (36,488) Receivables (**) 16 1,929,562 1,824,875 (104,687) Liabilities (**) 29 (2,363,438) (2,588,844) (225,406) Other current assets 19 640,269 684,995 44,726 Other current liabilities 31 (322,061) (323,077) (1,016) Working capital 439,914 608,691 168,777 Net invested capital 1,791,692 2,135,568 343,876 Equity attributable to the owners of the parent 835,710 1,395,395 559,685 Non-controlling interests 96,354 108,750 12,396 Equity 22 932,064 1,504,145 572,081 Net financial indebtedness 859,628 631,423 (228,205) Total financial resources 1,791,692 2,135,568 343,876 (*) The note numbers refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements where the items are analysed in detail. (**) This item shows liabilities of €23.9 million and loans and receivables of €2.3 million classified in net financial indebtedness and related to the Group’s net amounts due from/to consortia and consortium companies (SPEs) operating under a cost recharging system and not included in the consolidation scope. The balance reflects the Group’s share of cash and cash equivalents or debt of the SPEs. The Group’s exposure to the SPEs was shown under “Liabilities” for €22.2 million and “Loans and eceivables” for €1.1 million at 31 December 2018. 77 Net invested capital This item increased by €343.9 million on the previous year end to €2,135.6 million at 31 December 2019. The main changes are due to the factors listed below. Non-current assets Non-current assets increased by €151.7 million. They may be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Property, plant and equipment 415,941 333,511 (82,430) Right-of-use assets 144,184 144,184 Intangible assets 199,356 185,096 (14,260) Equity investments 538,257 642,486 104,229 Total non-current assets 1,153,554 1,305,277 151,723 Property, plant and equipment decreased by €82.4 million, mostly as a result of: reclassifications of items, mainly plant and machinery, to right-of-use assets of €79.7 million; depreciation for the year of €92.9 million; partly offset by investments of €85.4 million, mostly for Lane Group’s contracts and the new Snowy 2.0 project in Australia. Following the application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the Group has recognised right-of-use assets of €144.2 million at 31 December 2019, including €79.7 million classified under property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2018. These assets mainly consist of plant and machinery and buildings. Intangible assets show a net decrease of €14.3 million mainly due to amortisation. The €104.2 million net change in equity investments is due to the increase of €135.3 million in the Grupo Unidos Por el Canal investment after payments made during the year. Net non-current assets held for sale Net non-current assets held for sale at 31 December 2019 amount to €12.0 million and comprise the net assets of the USW Campania projects and the investment on Consorcio Agua Azual S.A. held by Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V.. It was reclassified to non-current assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 at 31 December 2019 as a result of its sale at the start of 2020. Provisions for risks These provisions of €137.9 million increased by €53.7 million over 31 December 2018, mainly due to the losses of the equity-accounted investees of Lane Group (mostly the joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate project). Net tax assets The following table analyses the item: 78 (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Deferred tax assets 205,386 253,453 48,067 Deferred tax liabilities (11,374) (7,399) 3,975 Net deferred tax assets 194,012 246,054 52,042 Current tax assets 112,102 90,513 (21,589) Current tax liabilities (144,693) (87,137) 57,556 Net current tax assets (liabilities) (32,591) 3,376 35,967 Other current tax assets 146,166 132,109 (14,057) Other current tax liabilities (48,521) (48,187) 334 Net other current tax assets 97,645 83,922 (13,723) Net tax assets 259,066 333,352 74,286 The decrease is mainly due to the smaller current tax liabilities after payment of the taxes on sale of the Plants & Paving Division and the increase in deferred tax assets on impairment losses recognised during the year. Working capital Working capital increased by €168.8 million from €439.9 million at 31 December 2018 to €608.7 million at the reporting date. The main changes in the individual items making up net working capital are summarised below: • contract assets amount to €2,040.5 million (€1,512.9 million). The increase of €527.6 million is the net balance of the reduction in contract advances (€168.4 million) and the increase in contract work in progress net of progress payments (on approved work) mostly related to certain large projects in Saudi Arabia such as the design and construction of the new Riyadh metro line, the housing and urbanisation project commissioned by the Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG Villas) and the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan. • loans and receivables decreased by €104.7 million, principally as a result of the reduction in amounts due from the Ethiopian customer following collections received during the year; • current liabilities increased by €225.4 million, chiefly due to the greater liabilities with unconsolidated group companies and other related parties, mainly in connection with the projects for the Genoa Bridge and the Naples Cancello section of the Naples Bari railway line. 79 Net financial indebtedness Table 3 Net financial indebtedness of Salini Impregilo Group The following table shows the Group’s net financial indebtedness at 31 December 2019 and 2018: 31 December 31 December Variation Note (*) 2018 2019 (€’000) Non-current financial assets 12 235,692 378,272 142,580 Current financial assets 17 135,280 241,248 105,969 Cash and cash equivalents 20 1,107,340 1,020,858 (86,482) Total cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets 1,478,312 1,640,378 162,067 Bank and other loans and borrowings 23 (617,895) (751,256) (133,361) Bonds 24 (1,088,158) (1,091,890) (3,732) Lease liabilities 25 (55,530) (98,709) (43,179) Total non-current indebtedness (1,761,583) (1,941,855) (180,272) Current portion of bank loans and borrowings and current account 23 (499,362) (231,640) 267,722 Current facilities portion of bonds 24 (13,295) (13,295) Current portion of lease liabilities 25 (43,206) (61,673) (18,467) Total current indebtedness (555,863) (306,608) 249,255 Derivative assets 12-17 602 268 (334) Derivative liabilities 26 (2,012) (2,012) Net financial position with unconsolidated SPEs (**) (21,096) (21,595) (499) Total other financial liabilities (20,494) (23,339) (2,845) Net financial indebtedness continuing operations (859,628) (631,423) 228,205 Net financial indebtedness including discontinued operations (859,628) (631,423) 228,205 (*) The note numbers refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements where the items are analysed in detail. (**) This item shows the Group’s net amounts due from/to unconsolidated consortia and consortium companies operating under a cost recharging system and not included in the consolidation scope. The balance reflects the Group’s share of cash and cash equivalents or debt of the SPEs. The balances are shown under trade receivables and payables in the consolidated financial statements. At 31 December 2019, the Group has net financial indebtedness from continuing operations of €631.4 million ( €859.6 million). The improvement in the Group’s net financial indebtedness is due to the capital increase completed on 12 November 2019 (described in more detail in the “Key events of the year – Progetto Italia” section), partly offset by the utilisation of working capital and certain non-recurring items such as: payments of €135.3 million made to GUPC; payments of taxes of €57 million on the sale of the Plants & Paving Division; 80 the increase in lease liabilities of €81.9 million, mostly as a result of the application of IFRS 16 from 1 January 2019; payments of taxes and interest of €32.5 million to settle the Ethiopian branch’s tax assessment. The debt/equity ratio (based on the net financial indebtedness from continuing operations) is 0.42 at group level at the reporting date. Salini Impregilo has given guarantees of €166.9 million in favour of unconsolidated group companies securing bank loans. Gross indebtedness of €2,270.1 million at the reporting date is roughly €68.4 million lower than that at 31 December 2018. Net of the debt of approximately €85.1 million of Beyond S.r.l. (set up in 2019 as part of Progetto Italia), gross indebtedness would be €2,185.0 million which, compared to the balance at 31 December 2018, including the FTA of IFRS 1612 (€2,420.5 million), is an improvement of about €235.5 million on the previous year end. 12As the Group elected to use the modified retrospective approach (i.e., recognising the cumulative effect of FTA by adjusting the opening retained earnings at 1 January 2019), it also adjusted the figures as at 31 December 2018, using the best estimates available, to reflect the adoption of IFRS 16 retrospectively. The figures have been adjusted on the basis of the following: ▪ leases include those in place at 31 December 2018 and, therefore, they do not include those of Lane’s Plants & Paving Division sold at the end of that year; ▪ the IFRS 16 FTA effects on profit or loss have been estimated by anticipating the date of initial application from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2018 or an interim date if the lease was agreed in 2018; ▪ the discount rates at 1 January 2019 have been used. 81 Presentation of the results in US dollars In accordance with the IFRS, the parent prepared its consolidated financial statements in Euros which is the functional currency of the reporting entity. However, given the materiality of the transactions in currencies other than the Euro at group level, the parent has decided to present its results in US dollars in this section. Pursuant to IAS 21, this presentation has been prepared using the following criteria: a) the Group’s assets and liabilities (including the comparative data) have been translated using the closing rate of 1.1234 (1.145 at 31 December 2018); b) revenue and costs have been translated using the average rates of the periods to which they refer (1.1195 in 2019 and 1.181 in 2018). The adjusted reclassified statement of profit or loss and the reclassified statement of profit or loss for 2019 and the reclassified statement of financial position at 31 December 2019 of the Group translated into US dollars are presented below. As required by IAS 21, the comparative figures for 2018 are also presented. 82 Adjusted reclassified statement of profit or loss of Salini Impregilo Group in US dollars 2018 Adjusted 2019 Adjusted Salini JV not Salini JV not Impregilo controlled Impairment IFRS 16 Total Impregilo controlled Impairment Total (in millions of US dollars) Group by Lane Venezuela FTA adjusted Group by Lane Venezuela adjusted Revenue 6,138.4 256.0 6,394.4 5,743.0 225.2 5,968.2 Gross operating profit (loss) 488.1 (15.3) 27.3 500.1 594.6 (121.6) 473.1 Gross (EBITDA) operating profit margin 8.0% 7.8% 10.4% 7.9% (EBITDA) % Operating profit (loss) (EBIT) 80.4 (15.3) 195.4 1.9 262.4 287.5 (121.6) 40.0 205.9 R.o.S. % 1.3% 4.1% 5.0% 3.4% Net financing costs (86.0) (4.6) (90.6) (81.9) (81.9) Net gains (losses) on equity (34.8) 15.3 (19.5) (143.0) 121.6 (21.4) investments Profit (loss) before tax (EBT) (40.4) 195.4 (2.7) 152.3 62.6 40.0 102.6 Income taxes (46.4) (46.9) (93.3) (77.4) (9.6) (87.0) Profit (loss) from continuing (86.8) 148.5 (2.7) 59.0 (14.8) 30.4 15.6 operations Profit (loss) from discontinued 135.6 135.6 (1.0) (1.0) operations Non-controlling interests 15.2 15.2 (8.9) (8.9) Profit (loss) for the year attributable 64.0 148.5 (2.7) 209.8 (24.8) 30.4 5.6 to the owners of the parent 83 Reclassified statement of profit or loss of Salini Impregilo Group in US dollars 2018 2019 Variation (USD’000) Revenue from contracts with customers 5,744,552 5,340,726 (403,826) Other income 393,885 402,267 8,382 Total revenue and other income 6,138,436 5,742,992 (395,444) Operating expenses (5,650,370) (5,148,360) 502,011 Gross operating profit (EBITDA) 488,066 594,632 106,566 Gross operating profit margin (EBITDA) % 8.0% 10.4% Impairment losses (229,726) (114,663) 115,063 Amortisation, depreciation and provisions (177,919) (192,483) (14,565) Operating profit 80,421 287,486 207,065 Return on Sales % 1.3% 5.0% Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments Net financing costs (86,044) (81,932) 4,112 Net losses on equity investments (34,780) (142,965) (108,184) Net financing costs and net losses on equity investments (120,825) (224,897) (104,072) Profit (loss) before tax (EBT) (40,403) 62,589 102,993 Income taxes (46,383) (77,425) (31,042) Loss from continuing operations (86,786) (14,836) 71,951 Profit (loss) from discontinued operations 135,581 (1,001) (136,582) Profit (loss) before non-controlling interests 48,795 (15,837) (64,631) Non-controlling interests 15,214 (8,937) (24,151) Profit (loss) for the year attributable to the owners of the parent 64,009 (24,774) (88,781) 84 Reclassified statement of financial position of Salini Impregilo Group in US dollars 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation (USD’000) Non-current assets 1,320,819 1,466,348 145,529 Goodwill 85,546 85,448 (98) Net non-current assets held for sale 6,507 13,454 6,947 Provisions for risks (96,424) (154,942) (58,518) Post-employment benefits and employee benefits (65,294) (69,503) (4,209) Net tax assets 296,631 374,488 77,857 Inventories 220,188 175,664 (44,524) Contract assets 1,732,232 2,292,242 560,010 Contract liabilities (1,316,278) (1,332,438) (16,160) Receivables (**) 2,209,350 2,050,064 (159,285) Liabilities (**) (2,706,139) (2,908,307) (202,168) Other current assets 733,108 769,523 36,415 Other current liabilities (368,760) (362,945) 5,815 Working capital 503,701 683,803 180,104 Net invested capital 2,051,486 2,399,096 347,611 Equity attributable to the owners of the parent 956,887 1,567,586 610,699 Non-controlling interests 110,325 122,170 11,844 Equity 1,067,212 1,689,756 622,543 Net financial indebtedness 984,274 709,340 (274,934) Total financial resources 2,051,486 2,399,096 347,610 (**) This item shows liabilities of USD26.8 million and loans and receivables of USD2.6 million classified in net financial indebtedness and related to the Group’s net amounts due from/to consortia and consortium companies (SPEs) operating under a cost recharging system and not included in the consolidation scope.

(**) Starting from 2019, the parent has decided to present “Impairment losses” separately in the reclassified statement of profit or loss for their better presentation. Therefore, the 2018 comparative figure has been restated accordingly. Revenue Total revenue for the year amounts to €2,741.0 million (€3,068.3 million), including €688.9 million (€363.5 million) earned in Italy and €2,052.1 million (€2,704.8 million) abroad. Operating profit (EBIT) The operating profit of €257.0 million shows a significant improvement on the previous year when it included impairment losses on assets related to infrastructure works in Venezuela, higher than those recognised in 2019 (i.e., €35.7 million in 2019 and €165.5 million in 2018). Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments The parent recognised net financing costs of €65.0 million (costs of €5.8 million). The item comprises: financial expense of €119.0 million (€95.6 million); partly offset by: financial income of €48.6 million (€58.5 million); net exchange gains of €5.4 million (net gains of €31.3 million). Financial expense increased by €23.4 million, mainly due to the payment of interest of €13.7 million by the Ethiopian branch for the years from 2014 to 2016 as part of a tax assessment and interest expense on the loan with Lane (higher by approximately €11.4 million). 86 Financial income decreased by approximately €9.9 million, mostly due to the smaller interest income accrued on amounts due from foreign customers. Net losses on equity investments amount to €37.8 million compared to net gains of €41.6 million in 2018. The item includes impairment losses recognised to align the equity investments’ carrying amounts with the parent’s share of the investees’ equity. The 2018 balance included dividends of €153.3 million compared to €13.9 million in 2019. Income taxes The €24.4 million increase is mostly due to the payment for the tax assessment in Ethiopia and the greater impact of permanent differences. 87 Financial position of the parent Salini Impregilo S.p.A.

Net invested capital This item increased by €271.1 million on the previous year end. The main changes are due to the factors listed below. Non-current assets Non-current assets decreased by €14.5 million. They may be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Property, plant and equipment 169,527 128,113 (41,414) Right-of-use assets 58,138 58,138 Intangible assets 123,755 103,326 (20,429) Equity investments 1,324,130 1,313,339 (10,791) Total non-current assets 1,617,412 1,602,916 (14,496) 88 Property, plant and equipment decreased by approximately €41.4 million due to: reclassifications of €37.2 million to right-of-use assets as a result of the application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019; depreciation of €31.2 million; partly offset by increases of €25.0 million, chiefly related to investments made for the two Paris metro lines and the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan. Following the application of IFRS 16 on 1 January 2019, the parent has recognised right-of-use assets of €58.1 million at 31 December 2019, including €37.2 million classified under property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2018. These assets mainly consist of plant and machinery and buildings. Intangible assets mostly comprise the cost incurred to acquire contracts and decreased by €20.4 million, chiefly as a result of amortisation. Equity investments decreased by €10.8 million as a result of the following changes: sale of the investment in the Dutch subsidiary Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. to Lane Group for €133.1 million; impairment losses of €27.9 million, mostly recognised on the investments in GUPC (Panama), HCE and FIBE, partly offset by capital transactions of €153.4 million, mainly for the SPE GUPC (Panama) (€135.3 million), Salini Polska (€9.9 million) and Fisia Italimpianti (€6.0 million). Provisions for risks This item of €87.4 million increased from the 2018 year end balance by €38.8 million, mainly due to the accruals of €45.8 million made during the year to provide for the situations of certain consortium partners.

It hinges on the Group’s core business of providing clients and the market with infrastructure for sustainable mobility, clean hydro energy, clean water and green building solutions to global challenges. It also embodies the ethical, social and environmental responsibility policies and practices applied by the Group to protect and enhance people and the environment and to contribute to the social and economic development of the countries where it operates. The Sustainability Strategy allows the Group to pursue 11 of the key Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations. Pillar 1: Pillar 2: Contribute to global challenges Act responsibly We assist our clients with We contribute to the issues such as sustainability economic and social mobility, water, hydropower development of the and green buildings. We build areas in which we infrastructure that contributes operate, guaranteeing to communities' development the well-being of and well-being. individuals and respect for the environment. The Group’s dedication to these goals involves the entire value chain as shown in the following diagram: 96 Additional information about the Group’s business model is available in the “Salini Impregilo Group: our vision and performance” section of the directors’ report. 97 Company organisation Salini Impregilo’s corporate governance model is a traditional management-type model and complies with international best practices. It is an essential tool in ensuring the efficient management of the Group and effective controls over its activities, in line with the Group’s goals of creating value for shareholders and protecting stakeholder interests. The Company’s governance system is based on integrity and transparency. It complies with the relevant legal requirements, Consob (the Italian commission for listed companies and the stock exchange) regulations and the recommendations of the Code of Conduct for listed companies (July 2018 edition). At the end of 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors had 15 members, including five women (33.3%) and nine who met the independence requirements (60%). The Board of Directors has four committees: the Strategic Committee, the Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee, the Compensation and Nominating Committee and the Committee for Related-Party Transactions. The Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee, comprised of six independent directors, examines this Consolidated Non-financial Statement in connection with the Company’s activities and engagement with its stakeholders. The Company has an organisational and management model based on a system of principles (Code of Ethics and Policies) and management and control tools (risk management, procedures and controls) designed to supervise significant non-financial topics in line with the regulations applicable in the countries where it operates, standard principles and international guidelines. Salini Impregilo is a signatory of the UN’s Global Compact, the largest global sustainability initiative that requires companies to align their operations and strategies with ten universally-recognised principles on human rights, labour practices, the environment and anti-corruption. Code of Ethics The Company has a Code of Ethics, which sets out its principles and rules of conduct that people who work for or with Salini Impregilo are required to adhere to during their everyday work. The Code applies to the directors, statutory auditors, managers and employees of Salini Impregilo as well as all those parties that directly or indirectly, temporarily or on an ongoing basis work with the Company, to the extent of their duties and responsibilities. They are required to comply with the laws and regulations applicable in the various geographical areas in which the Company operates and to base their conduct on that set out in the Code. The Code of Ethics has three sections: Ethical principles: the reference principles to which Salini Impregilo employees are required to adhere: integrity, honesty, reliability and sustainability. Rules of conduct: the practical implementation of the ethical principles incumbent on all parties required to comply with the Code; the rules of conduct set out in the Code cover non-financial aspects dealt with in this Statement. 98 Application and compliance: the internal procedures used to monitor application of the Code and the communication systems available to the parties required to comply with the Code. Company policies Salini Impregilo has issued a number of company policies, which alongside the Code of Ethics, represent the main points of reference for people working for the Company. They are summarised below: Sustainability: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with during its operations in order to contribute to economic progress, social well-being and the environmental protection of the countries where it operates. Health and safety: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to protect the health and safety of its employees, suppliers and subcontractors during the entire life cycle of its contracts (design, construction and development) and in the workplace; its objective is “zero injuries”. Environment: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with in order to mitigate possible adverse effects on the environment, protect the ecosystem and increase the beneficial effects, contributing through its projects to resolving the main global environmental issues. Quality: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to ensure its client’s full satisfaction, the active involvement of all stakeholders and ongoing improvement of the Quality System, based on its fundamental goal of “build to perfection”. Human rights: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to ensure the protection of human dignity, just and favourable conditions of work and the protection of the human rights of stakeholders affected by its activities. Equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion: the principles that the Company is committed to complying with to encourage inclusive work environments that value the individual, developing human capital. Anti-corruption: the anti-corruption principles to be adhered to by employees, based on the fundamental tenet of “zero tolerance”. The Company strengthened its commitment to the environment, health and safety and human rights and workers with the International Framework Agreement signed in 2014 with the Italian (Feneal-UIL, Filca-CISL and FilleeCGIL) and international (BWI Building and Wood Workers’ International) trade unions of the construction sector. The above principles are reiterated in the Suppliers Code of Conduct, introduced early in 2020, through which the Company extends its responsible operating practices to its supply chain. This Code is binding for all Salini Impregilo’s suppliers and, together with the Code of Ethics, is an integral part of their contractual relationship with the Company. 99 Management and control system The Company has an internal control and risk management system incorporating rules, procedures and organisational structures to ensure healthy, ethical business practices that are consistent with its objectives through appropriate procedures to identify, measure, manage and monitor the main risks. This system is based on standards which require that: business activities be based on applicable internal and external rules, can be mapped and documented; the allocation and exercise of powers as part of a decision-making process be commensurate with the positions of responsibility and the size and/or significance of the underlying transaction; those parties that take or implement decisions, that record transactions and those that are required to perform the controls over such transactions provided for by law and procedures envisaged by the internal controls be different parties; confidentiality and compliance with the personal data protection legislation be ensured. Salini Impregilo has also voluntarily adopted an Integrated QEHS (Quality, Environment, Health and Safety) Management System in compliance with the international standards ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, as well as an Anti-Corruption Compliance System pursuant to ISO 37001. Its system is certified by an independent expert. The quality, environment, health and safety management system certifications cover: • the definitive and executive designs, works management and performance to build large works, civil and industrial works and related technological systems; • the design and management of integrated operation and maintenance services for infrastructure, civil and industrial buildings, related technological systems and electromedical devices. The quality management system also applies to the coordination of the general contractor activities carried out in accordance with Title III of Legislative decree no. 50/2016 and Legislative decree no. 56/2017 as subsequently amended and integrated. The scope of these systems includes all the work sites where the Company operates and all types of company in which it is involved. The anti-corruption management system covers the design, construction, restructuring and maintenance, on its own behalf or for third parties, of civil engineering, industrial, infrastructure and plant engineering works. It applies to the Group’s core and strategic processes managed by the Italian offices and the Company’s operations, including those of the foreign branches and directly-managed work sites. Centralisation of the main processes exposed to corruption risks (including business development and procurement) has meant that the related controls are carried out as part of the certification. 100 The Company has an ISO 31000 compliant risk management system, certified by an independent expert. It covers construction on its own behalf or for third parties of roads, ports, buildings, hydraulic, hydropower, railway and other civil engineering works in Italy and abroad. Salini Impregilo refers to the OECD Guidelines for multinational enterprises and ISO 26000 “Guidance on Social Responsibility for its CSR issues. It has also adopted the UN’s Guiding principles on business and human rights for the management of human rights. Subsequent sections of this Statement provide more information on these frameworks. Organisation, Management and Control Model Salini Impregilo has introduced an Organisation, Management and Control model (the “231 model”) to: • prevent the commission of the predicate crimes as per Legislative decree no. 231/2001; • define and implement an internal culture based on respect and transparency; • increase awareness among employees and stakeholders. The Model sets out specific controls implemented in internal procedures in order to monitor transactions exposed to the potential risk of crimes that would trigger the administrative liability of companies. It includes measures to identify and reduce potential risks of non-compliance with the provisions of Legislative decree no. 231/01. With respect to the risk of bribery crimes, the Model’s controls are aligned to the Anticorruption Compliance System. The Integrity Board, which is an independent control body, monitors the effective implementation of and compliance with the Model. The Company has informed its employees of an email and postal address for any communications to be made directly to the Integrity Board, guaranteeing their anonymity and protection from any form of reprisal. Notification of alleged violations of the Model can also be made using the whistleblowing system (see the Anti-corruption section) which forwards them to the Integrity Board. This complies with Law no. 179/2017 and Confindustria’s Explanatory Note dated January 2018. Non-financial reporting system Salini Impregilo has a non-financial reporting system that complies with the requirements of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 and the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. The Corporate Social Responsibility Department supervises this reporting system. This Statement is approved by the Company’s Board of Directors after it has been examined by the Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee. Main organisational changes Salini Impregilo revised parts of its organisation during the year to ensure more effective controls over its internal processes. 101 Specifically, the main organisational projects, which also led to the recruitment of new resources from the market, involved: ▪ setting up a Commercial Department in the Commercial/Business Development area to scale up business development, strategic marketing, commercial planning and bidding assistance processes; ▪ the Global Supply Chain Department, which combines the Procurement Department and the Plant & Equipment Department optimising know-how and operating synergies along the supply chain to facilitate projects more effectively and efficiently; ▪ the HR, Organisation and Systems Department to focus on organisational development and bolstering its activities to enhance the Group; ▪ the Global Operations Department, due to the additional streamlining of the geographical segments in line with the new direction of the Group’s business. The changes in the organisational model were flanked by a review of internal processes and innovation for the purposes of ongoing improvement and operating effectiveness and efficiency. Specifically, the “Performance Dialogue” project is up and running to ensure transparent and consistent key objectives/priorities and make the assistance provided by all the functions for achievement of contract objectives more efficient. This includes scheduling regular project performance review meetings at various internal levels, using standardised tools and reports to ensure consistent reporting of the progress of all the Group’s projects and identify any appropriate improvement and/or recovery actions. This project covered the Group’s entire contract portfolio over the course of 2019. The Company continued its ongoing digitalisation project as described in the relevant paragraph of the Innovation, research and development section. The Company has continued to fine-tune its Knowledge Management Programme as part of its drive to improve process efficiency and create value by harnessing and re-deploying experience gained in the field. The programme is designed to optimise the knowledge-sharing tools and methods and access to specialist expertise. It also continued to encourage its subsidiaries to apply organisational and process best practices as part of its drive to steadily disseminate and standardise the organisational models and operating methods at group level. This approach allows for the optimisation of internal processes by promoting the parent’s competence centres’ role in communicating guidelines, recommendations and specialist assistance. Specifically, Lane has aligned its processes and organisation with the Company’s standards with regards to the: Technical Department (Engineering and Bidding Office); Procurement; HR & Organisation. Finally, the Company tweaked and supplemented its procedures as part of its project for ongoing improvement of its organisation and to reflect changes in the legislative framework. It wrote and distributed a Compliance Handbook to all the Group’s operating units after which it monitored the effective application of procedures 102 throughout the Group with a multi-functional project for the start up of contracts. This is designed to ensure that the contract’s organisation, systems, processes and procedures are in line with the Group’s standards right from their inception. The Handbook provides useful references to organisational charts, systems and shared procedures. Innovation, research and development Salini Impregilo considers innovation essential for its long-term sustainable growth in an era of technological and environmental challenges. Innovation is key to be competitive in terms of core process efficiency, contract timing and costs and a company’s social and environmental performance thanks to less work-related incidents, a smaller impact on the environment and the communities affected by its operations. The Company’s sector is known for the highly customised processing, techniques and technologies deployed depending on the nature of the works to be performed. Each project is unique and requires the development of bespoke solutions designed thanks to highly specialist know-how. The Group’s work sites are hives of innovation and advanced research. R&D activities are carried out at project and company level. At project level, in addition to researching materials and energy efficiency, the most challenging activities are those for projects with technical characteristics that cannot be dealt with using conventional techniques and technologies. At company level, the technical departments work unceasingly to develop state-of-the-art methods for projects and support processes. The Company’s technicians work alongside the best experts and professionals in the market, universities and research centres to develop tailored solutions able to meet clients’ requirements while protecting the local environment and communities right from the initial tender stage. During the 2017-2019 three-year period, the Company invested on average over €19 million in innovation, research and development projects for a grand total of approximately €58 million. These projects have involved on average more than 100 group specialised resources13. Innovation Unit 2017 2018 2019 Employees involved in R&D projects no. 119 99 97 Investments in R&D €m 30.4 12.1 15.5 R&D projects mainly related to construction techniques, digitalisation, virtual reality, materials and energy efficiency. 13Long-term projects (and the related personnel) are considered for each year. 103 Construction techniques Salini Impregilo best expresses its innovative potential in this area. One of its most significant projects undertaken in the 2017-2019 period is the study of the boring of a tunnel using pressure boring technology carried out to develop a bid for a section of the Naples Bari high capacity railway line in Italy. The project required improved technical solutions to resolve interference with the water table inside the tunnel, especially as regards the temporary works to allow boring inside the tunnel without water. The Company opted for an innovative but efficient and safe solution, able to guarantee dry boring in simple, repetitive and expeditious executive stages, eliminating the risk of any disturbance to the existing structures and the water table. Another interesting research project, developed as part of the environmental restoration project of the MatanzaRiachuelo catchment basin in Argentina was the development of a new method to install vertical pipes underwater, called the riser concept. This solution, for which Salini Impregilo has filed a patent application, involves installing vertical pipes from the bottom up, working inside a tunnel built on the bed of a water body when there are soft ground formations. Before this innovative equipment, only vertical bottom-up excavation methods in rocky material existed, which were not possible in underwater conditions. Significant offshore work and seaworks were necessary for these projects, working from the top down, which significantly lengthened the contract times and complexity due to the numerous external factors, especially weather and navigation conditions. The new riser concept technique almost completely eliminates the seaworks as it allows the pipes to be laid directly inside an undersea tunnel with substantial improvements in terms of simplifying construction and the reduction in the number of offshore processing activities and works, optimised costs during the construction and operating stages, strong construction planning and timelines, elimination of interference with shipping, reduction of the overall environmental impact and fewer construction risks. Another noteworthy project is the study of experimental and numerical models to assist the design and testing of special works like the iconic Western Station of the Riyadh Metro the Group is building in Saudi Arabia. This study dealt with wind dynamics and the vulnerability of special iconic structures to the wind (large irregular shaped roofs and canopies) using numerical models developed internally by the design challenge team and as partnerships with external research centres. Together with the Milan Polytechnic, the team carried out trials in the wind tunnel as well as dynamics analyses on software developed specifically by the University, without parallel on the market. The study enabled the Company to acquire new skills in the field of non-conventional structures’ reaction to wind (which are not fully covered by the current international regulations) and to hone its knowledge and awareness of the importance of adopting a non-conventional approach to the dynamic factors of special structures, especially given the increased frequency of extreme weather events. The Group has also decided to reengineer its production processes, covering both its normal work site activities and the main support activities. This lean construction process is the construction sector’s take on the lean 104 production principles and involves focusing on operating planning and an analysis of the KPIs when preparing bids. Digitalisation These projects apply to many areas. They entail the development of innovative tools that use artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to analyse and share data. The tools facilitate the processing of big data with summarised and detailed outputs available in real time. Digital innovation is essential to Salini Impregilo’s competitive edge in a world undergoing continual technological transformation. In 2019, it implemented new applications to assist its day-to-day business, including: an integrated commercial and bidding data and information flows management system to provide better assistance with strategic decisions and the traceability and security of information; processes and systems for electronic signatures in documents; digital procurement solutions to make the management of purchase requests and formalisation of supplier contracts more efficient; a HR process digitalisation project to introduce technological best practices for the day-to-day activities of the HR and organisation department. Virtual reality Management deemed it strategic to develop BIM (Building Information Modeling) tools to guarantee top service quality levels and promote the sector’s high level of competition and technological innovation to the market. In order to gain a greater share of international markets and to expand its global footprint, the Company has rolled out its first ever internal project to develop more innovative BIM tools than those available on the market. Rolled out in 2017, this R&D project’s objective was to develop and implement innovative algorithm models whose application to some future contracts and all calls for tenders, would allow Salini Impregilo to improve its service levels, delivery timeliness and security while also cutting industrial costs. The underlying objective was to obtain external intelligence to serve virtual graphic software that uses an algorithm to identify the correlation between the type of material to be used and the type of work to be designed and built. The model would also establish the quantities and costs as well as construction and installation methods. The innovative BIM system, initially considered to be an operating model and not a tool, was designed as an information model to plan, design, build and maintain large works, i.e., a model containing all the information about the work’s entire lifecycle, from design to construction and until demolition and decommissioning. Its innovative feature was that of being a parametric model housing all the information about the work’s entire lifecycle. This solution can be used to create a three dimensional model as well as a dynamic, interdisciplinary, shared and constantly evolving information model, which includes data about geometry, materials, the weight-bearing structure, thermal 105 characteristics and energy output, plants, costs, safety, maintenance, lifecycle, demolition and decommissioning. During 2019, the Company extended the use of this virtual model to the security area, reproducing the work environments to identify and categorise the risk factors. The simulation of critical areas and processing and the identification of restricted access zones allows Salini Impregilo to analyse risks before they arise and thus prevent them. Materials The more important studies carried out in recent years are those for the mixes for the concrete used to build the dams in Ethiopia and Namibia. Specifically, the R&D activities identified optimised mixes, with a low cement content, for the GERD project in Ethiopia. This enabled a saving of more than 200 thousand tonnes of cement and, in turn, a saving in transportation. As a result, the study will allow a reduction in the project’s carbon footprint of over 290 thousand tonnes of CO2. An on-site production process was developed at the same work site for concrete admixtures which avoided their purchase and related transportation from abroad (i.e., Europe). This will lead to lower transport emissions of roughly 27 thousand tonnes of CO2. In Namibia, the Group developed a special concrete mix using fly ash instead of cement, which meant more than 21 thousand tonnes less cement was used, reducing the project’s carbon footprint by over 14,500 tonnes of CO2. Energy efficiency One of the most important projects carried out in the three-year period was that launched in 2017 to develop “Construction 4.0” electrical systems. The study involved an innovative system to monitor a work site’s electrical parameters and obtain a detailed analysis of the power quality to improve the work site’s electrical and energy performances. The project entailed a feasibility study and the design and engineering of new systems and technologies for energy efficiency. In 2018, the work site for the Isarco River Underpass section (Italy), which is the south lot of the Brenner Base Tunnel contract, was the first pilot site to test this technology. The new equipment installed at the logistics base showed an improvement of roughly 8% in electrical efficiency with the related proportionate reduction in consumption and, therefore, greenhouse gases (GHG). The analysis of the results for the first three months showed that the work site saved roughly €12 thousand with around 30 tonnes of CO 2 emissions avoided in 2019. 106 Analyses of the electrical and energy performances at the COCIV site in Italy, which is the second to have this system, were also started in 2019. In Tajikistan, the Company has developed an innovative technique for the automated transportation of construction materials using high capacity conveyer belts, again for energy efficiency purposes. These belts can transport up to 5,500 tonnes of material an hour, improving the production output and avoiding their usual transportation by truck. This has generated large financial and environmental benefits. In 2019 alone, the estimated benefits in terms of decreased transport-caused emissions are more than 11,300 tonnes of CO 2. In addition to continuing its ongoing projects, the Company constantly scouts for new potential innovation, research and development projects to invest in. At year end, it had identified projects to be carried out in the three-year 2020-2022 period for an investment in excess of €15 million. Their key objective is to design and roll out an innovative platform, which integrates new technologies to be used in advanced production processes in the construction sector. The end purpose is to encourage a new approach to the Company’s operations strongly orientated towards digital technologies to improve efficiency and sustainability. 107 Human resources ≈50 thousand people 45% direct and indirect workforce employees under 35 37% women -25% at the head office reduction in injury rates Internal policies People, their skills and their dedication are fundamental to any organisation’s competitive edge. Human capital is an increasingly critical success factor given the nature of Salini Impregilo’s business, consisting of the building of unique large, complex infrastructure projects, its need to understand and have a flexible organisation that can adapt to different cultures and the complex transformation it is currently undergoing. The adoption of a HR strategy and policy is essential and they must underpin the Group’s strategic objectives through the efficient management of human resources and the organisation. Objectives: guarantee that employees act in accordance with common rules and practices in compliance with the Code of Ethics and the Company’s values; foster an inclusive work environment that enhances individual skills and encourages employees to develop their potential; cultivate diversity and inclusion as levers to understand the various cultural contexts in which Salini Impregilo operates, to encourage innovation and the ongoing improvement of decision-making processes key to achievement of the business objectives; attract, retain and motivate employees by guaranteeing their best placement within the Group to enhance their talents and growth; maintain the highest levels of protection for health and safety in the workplace for its employees, ensuring the necessary prevention and protection measures are in place to avoid or minimise occupational risks and instil a safety-based culture at all levels and proactive and ethical conduct; encourage the adoption of a single organisational model throughout the Group, based on structures and processes to create value and to concurrently comply with the legislation of all the countries where Salini Impregilo operates; 108 introduce digitalisation as an essential tool to bolster the efficiency and standardisation of processes and maximise knowledge and the sharing information between people across the Group. Main risks and management methods The Company’s HR management policy complies with the principles set out in its Code of Ethics and the laws and regulations of the countries where it operates. The risks and methods used to manage the key employee-related aspects and risks are described below. Workforce At 31 December 2019, the Group’s workforce was as follows: Direct workforce by category (GRI 102-8) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Managers no. 351 357 359 White collars no. 7,194 6,738 6,192 Blue collars no. 23,592 19,469 17,975 Total No. 31,137 26,564 24,526 Direct workforce by geographical segment (GRI 102-8) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Italy no. 1,936 1,771 1,699 Africa no. 11,273 8,923 8,724 Europe no. 1,487 1,301 755 Americas no. 6,977 4,288 4,248 Asia and Oceania no. 9,464 10,281 9,100 Abroad no. 29,201 24,793 22,827 Total No. 31,137 26,564 24,526 At year end, technical and production employees made up 79% of the workforce with office employees accounting for the other 21%. The split between open-ended and fixed-term employment contracts is 93.6% and 6.4%, respectively. If the indirect resources (employees of subcontractors, temporary work agencies and other service providers involved in the Group’s projects) are included, the total workforce deployed by the Group in 2019 numbered 49,375. Total workforce by geographical area (GRI 102-8) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Italy no. 4,859 5,242 6,392 Africa no. 14,619 11,620 9,992 Europe no. 4,508 4,515 2,389 Americas* no. 11,224 7,806 8,733 Asia and Oceania no. 28,396 35,904 21,869 Abroad no. 58,747 59,845 42,983 Total No. 63,606 65,087 49,375 * Figure for indirect resources unavailable for North America The above figures relate to the Group’s employees at 31 December of each year. 109 New hires and outgoing employee trends are affected by the unique nature of the infrastructure sector, where workers are taken on for specific projects with employment contracts that usually end when the works have been completed. In 2019, the Group hired 6,247 resources, including 2,448 under 30 years old. Outgoing employees numbered 12,501 and this figure includes the transfers of resources among group sites. The greatest number of departures was seen in the Middle East as a result of the advanced stage of completion on the main ongoing projects. Voluntary departures made up 10% of the total. Attraction, selection and development Employee attraction, selection and development activities are carried out in accordance with the principles contained in the Code of Ethics and company policies. Employer Branding The Group continued its multi-year Employee Branding activities during the year, focusing on the attraction and selection of young people and the provision of professional counselling and tutoring about construction sector career opportunities. This involves strategic agreements with universities, engagement initiatives such as career days, recruiting days, themed workshops in university faculties, presentations and visits to construction sites, with a focus on communications via digital and social media, university websites and the main on-line job boards, as these allow direct and ongoing contact with potential candidates. Among the strategic agreements with universities, the Company stepped up its collaboration with the Australian universities. It continued to partner the University of Technology (UTS) in Sydney to fund a scholarship for deserving engineering students (the “Salini Impregilo Tomorrow’s Builders scholarship”) and started a university programme to promote the academic and professional training of female engineers. This wide-ranging collaboration, covered by an agreement signed in 2018, was extended to other projects in 2019 including the design of a joint short-course in Tunnelling, to be held in Spring 2020, and the identification of joint research projects. The Group also commenced talks with the main universities of Melbourne to assess future developments and collaborations. To this end, it participated in the “STEM Internship” career fair organised by RMIT University. In the US, Lane’s employer branding plan extended to the main colleges and universities of the states where the Group operates, such as University of Florida and University of Washington State, mainly in the form of participation at career fairs and recruitment days. In Europe, the Group participated in the Career Forum of the École Spéciale des Travaux Publics (ESTP) in Paris which attracts thousands of engineering students for the second consecutive year. The school, which is also called “École Des Grand Projets” is one of the leading French institutes for training in the construction sector. At home, Salini Impregilo increased its collaboration with Genoa University, rolling out a number of activities during the year for the training, orientation and recruitment of university students. This included the learning 110 centres formula, with workshops on the technical and management aspects of the Group’s projects and visits to work sites. The Liguria Regional Authorities acknowledged the Group’s involvement in the “Register of Endorsers” and its contribution to the regional professional orientation project for students at all levels (#progettiamociilfuturo). Salini Impregilo made the “Best Employer of Choice 2019” ranking for the fourth consecutive year, at fourth place in the general classification and taking first place as the most attractive employer for technical and scientific graduates. Again in 2020, Salini Impregilo is one of the Best employers of choice of university graduates, ranking 10th in the general classification and holding on to its position as one of the most attractive employers for STEM university graduates. It was also included in the “Best Awareness” programme ranking fourth as the company best known by Italian university graduates. These prestigious recognitions, based on the results of a survey, and the Group’s consistent ranking among the top places bolsters its reputation on the labour market and its appeal as an employer of choice, assisted by its regular notification of job vacancies and intense employer branding activities at the main universities. Salini Impregilo is not only a favourite among university graduates. It also obtained the “Universum” ranking as the “Most attractive employer” in the construction sector. During the year, it launched the new “Our team” section of its “Careers” section of the website to give more visibility to the vast range of professionals and operating profiles within the Group. The section presents the internal positions and teams through direct endorsements from group personnel. Selection and acquisition The employee selection and acquisition activities are regulated by a defined, standardised procedure at corporate level and for its projects that require the structured scheduling of requirements, followed by a scouting stage (on the market or internally) and recruitment. The Company uses a special system that ensures the traceability and transparency of the talent acquisition process and the ongoing updating of the pipeline of candidates to be recruited. The Company introduced a new onboarding process in 2019 to smooth the entry of new resources, facilitate their integration with the managers and colleagues, promote a faster transfer of internal know-how and competences and transmit the internal values and culture. It defined specific tools such as the dedicated training courses through E-Learning Academy, the preparation and gifting of a welcome kit with the main organisational and operating documents as well as mentorships to encourage integration and reception of the Company’s culture. Training and development Training programmes were continued in 2019 and the Company defined specific tools to support and promote career paths, organisational growth and the continuity of its succession plans. Salini Impregilo defined a new leadership model which identifies managerial skills and conduct necessary to achieve its strategic objectives in line with its values. Roll out of the model will continue in 2020 with tailored 111 communication and training campaigns and will be the basis for HR management processes (selection, training, management performance). It will also be a reference point for group resources in their daily working lives. The Company also introduced assessment programmes to support growth and, specifically: • the Step-up programme for «Early career profiles» This programme was earmarked at a group of young professionals who have been with the Company for three to four years. They participated in readiness and potential assessments (tests, interviews and simulations) and had to return an individual report providing additional information on their managerial profile, strengths and areas for improvement. This provided the Group with important information to be used to define subsequent training courses. • an assessment programme to support the promotion and development policies for senior corporate and project resources. Specifically, the programme is designed to assist with the assessment of managers who are potential candidates for promotion, integrating the assessment of their technical and specialist skills with managerial skills assessment tools, including the assessment of the new leadership model skills, specific personality tests and one-on-one interviews with the HR department. Development activities included business coaching for certain managers to assist their development in line with the Company’s values and required skills. These sessions were designed and carried out to develop the leadership qualities of certain key figures and/or rising talents. It had a positive influence on business performance and the internal environment, strengthening the managers’ motivation and sense of belonging as well as facilitating their move up the corporate ladder. In 2019, the coaching programme focused on the technical and operations resources. It will be extended to the managerial roles of other professional areas in 2020. The key management development levers include the Global Managerial Academy, conceived in 2019 and officially opened in February 2020. It has been designed to encourage the development of leadership and managerial skills of those resources who already hold key positions or are rising through the ranks and is structured differently depending on the resource’s seniority. Training activities entail the participants’ involvement in a digital business game to gain experience in a wide range of skills through training in the form of simulations and experiential learning. They cover technical and financial aspects, processes and leadership qualities with a special focus on change leading, complexity management, development of team skills in an inclusive approach and the enhancement of diversity and customer orientation. The Company’s training programme is based on an analysis of training requirements, which identifies any gaps and the most appropriate training to resolve them, and strategic change management objectives and the Company’s workforce development. The Group’s Learning Academy, introduced in 2015 to promote a new training model that strengthens the existing expertise and disseminates the know-how throughout the organisation, has various programmes: 112 induction courses on internal policies and procedures for new employees, and courses on compliance (companies’ administrative liability as per Legislative decree no. 231/2001 and anti-corruption), health and safety (including the innovative Safety Builders course), languages, technical expertise, economic and financial issues, team building and managerial development. The Group also provides training through the E-Learning Academy, which deploys the new digital technologies to provide e-learning courses, facilitating the sharing of technical and specialist knowledge. While classroom courses and activities still take place, there are more on-line courses using virtual classrooms and webinars and a vaster range of e-learning courses. One of these e-learning courses introduced in 2019 is that on data security and cybersecurity, designed to increase employees’ awareness of the risks of circulating information and, specifically, of cyber attacks and cybercrime. In 2019, new important training courses were planned for launch in 2020. They will be provided through the ELearning Academy and include, for example, the new e-learning course on anti-corruption and that on human rights, designed to increase employees’ understanding of the related internal policies. In 2019, the third edition of the master’s degree course “International Construction Management” at the Milan Polytechnic, a leading university partner, was completed. The one-year course of 30,000 hours, held in English and open to international students, offers a unique post-degree course as it combines mentoring, tutoring, knowledge-based training, soft skills and professional training. Classroom lessons are mostly provided by Salini Impregilo professionals with a six-month apprenticeship in Italy and abroad under the guidance of company tutors to complete the course. Graduation Day took place on 27 September and the 15 students (33% international students, 40% female students additional proof of the Company’s ongoing commitment to promoting the training and professional careers of newly graduated female engineers) presented their dissertations to the scientific commission. Salini Impregilo also invests in the professional development of its employees around the world in order to ensure their performance meets the Group’s technical, qualitative, environmental and health and safety standards and so that it has qualified personnel for its ongoing and future projects. Accordingly, projects include professional training courses for the local workforce, defined using parameters that identify the training requirements and needs for each position. Employees must attend the specific training course identified for their roles and requirements (both classroom and on-site). These courses avoid the risk that employees’ technical, professional and managerial skills become obsolete as this could affect the productivity, efficiency and safety of their jobs. Training hours (classroom and on-site) provided in 2019 covered many aspects (health and safety, the environment, quality, technical/specialist, compliance, management, etc.) for a total of 252,357 hours. These courses were supplemented by important safety courses provided directly in the work sites. During 2019, the Group carried out more than 105 thousand Tool Box Talks (short meetings on safety-related aspects, around 88 thousand, and the environment, roughly 17 thousand, held at the start of work shifts) at its work sites, equal to more than 290 a day. 113 Average per capita training hours (GRI 404-1) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Managers and white collars hours 15 16 11 Blue collars hours 12 11 10 Total hours 13 12 10 In addition to training given to group personnel, the staff of its subcontractors attended courses on QEHS subjects totalling 230,002 hours in 2019. The attraction, selection and development activities described above, help the Company mitigate risks such as not being able to fill positions due to a lack of qualified personnel available on the market, or a time lapse between the assignment of the project and the starting of works, or an inability to retain and motivate key professionals, including for the broader business continuity purposes. Total reward The Company has operating procedures and practices designed to ensure that its remuneration policies comply with the regulations applicable in the countries where the Group operates and especially the minimum wage requirements, where these exist. At both corporate and operating level, the Company regularly meets with the trade union representatives (when appointed) to discuss remuneration. A well-thought out remuneration policy is essential to retain key resources, mitigating the risks Salini Impregilo is exposed to, which are mainly the possible more aggressive remuneration and career policies of competitors. To this end, Salini Impregilo’s remuneration policy has the following objectives: guarantee fair treatment in terms of the enhancement of know-how and professional skills of individuals and their roles and responsibilities, check that remuneration matches the related positions, ensure fair and consistent remuneration in line with the reference market and award bonuses in line with results and actions. Salini Impregilo’s remuneration policy has the following objectives in line with the above principles: retain and motivate qualified professional resources to pursue the Company’s and Group’s objectives; encourage these resources to stay with the Company and the Group; align, as far as possible, management’s interests with the medium to long-term interests of shareholders and stakeholders; ensure financial balance and the sustainability of its policies over time. In 2019, the Company continued its performance management programme for its key resources. This programme’s aim is to strengthen the result-oriented culture and has two categories of objectives. The first is Group performance in line with that of senior management (30%). The second is individual performance. In recent years, the security objectives have gained importance steadily, especially for those resources in the business departments. Greater weight has been given to this aspect, introducing a specific objective that includes both the development and introduction of the quality, environment and safety management system and a reduction in the injury rate. At the end of the year, the results are assessed in qualitative and quantitative terms to obtain the overall performance achieved. Salini Impregilo is aware of the importance that employee satisfaction plays in terms of the quality and productivity of their output and that work/life balance also contributes to this satisfaction. The Company is one 114 of the first in the domestic construction sector to have formalised a welfare agreement, despite the current complexities faced by the sector due to the blocking of large public works which has not helped it. During 2019, the Company continued to develop its welfare plan (“LIFE@salini-impregilo”), introduced on 19 July 2018, which supplements the traditional monetary incentives and benefits provided to an increasing number of employees. In September 2019, a satisfaction survey was carried out with a 66% response rate, which was very positive. More than 90% of the participants were in favour of the initiative. The analysis and investigation approach is one of the pillars of design and implementation and will be repeated in each year of the project to obtain a clear view of the beneficiaries to be involved in the plan and also what type of services to offer. Given the high satisfaction level received by the pilot project, the Company is evaluating new solutions to incorporate the requests made by the employees in the monitoring survey in a sustainable manner. The plan offers a flexible supplement to the employees’ remuneration packages giving them the option to purchase social utility services using their personalised budget, which can be put towards the cost of education, assistance for elderly family members, public transport passes, private healthcare, voluntary transfers to pension plans and goods and services in kind. In addition and to assist employees achieve a good work-life balance, the in-house services have been extended (they already include a launderette, pharmacy and shuttle service). The journey to work can be very stressful in large cities and Salini Impregilo is convinced that mobility is one of the main issues that a company dedicated to the welfare of its employees and protection of the environment should manage as best it can. As part of its focus on the requirements of individuals and environmental issues, the Company launched another survey of the employees at the Milan and Rome offices for information on how they travel to work in order to study possible solutions to make it easier and more sustainable for them. This survey was the starting block for the construction of a new sustainable mobility plan which will be introduced in 2020. Equal opportunities, diversity and inclusion The Group is strongly committed to creating a work environment that acknowledges, promotes and values diversity in all its forms (gender, age, nationality, ethnicity, social or civil status and religion). It believes that this gives it a competitive edge in terms of growth, the creation of synergies and in understanding and capitalising on the challenges of a multi-cultural business environment. In 2019, the Company published its Policy on Equal Opportunities, Diversity and Inclusion which reiterates the Group’s commitment to these issues through: • advancement of a safe, gratifying and respectful work environment; • non-discrimination and equal opportunities in HR management processes; 115 • combating harassment and discrimination, including by making suitable and formalised whistle-blowing tools available; • encouraging and active promotion (for example, through communication and training projects) of an inclusive culture and an awareness that diversity is positive; • the ability to work with all cultures as an integral part of the leadership model; • a request of its suppliers to commit to diversity and inclusion; • monitoring and reporting on commitments and results in the areas of diversity and inclusion. The Company has appointed a Diversity Manager, who is part of the Group’s HR and Organisation Department and monitors the implementation of diversity and inclusion policies and practices. Salin Impregilo’s commitment to these two issues is reflected in all areas. The Group has employees of more than 100 nationalities, 69% of the workforce is local, increasing to roughly 96% in Africa and the Americas. Local managers make up 70% of the total (more information is available in the “Social” section of this Statement). With respect to diversity, the Group’s leadership status is enriched by the ideas and outlook of international managers from non-construction sectors. International resources cover 24% of the Group’s key positions. Another important contributor to diversity is the young age of the Group’s resources. The following tables provide a breakdown of its employees by age bracket: Employees by age bracket (GRI 405-1) Unit 2017 2018 2019 < 30 years % 28% 27% 26% 30-50 years % 57% 59% 59% > 50 years % 15% 14% 15% Considering employees under 35 years old, the percentage of this age bracket increases to 45%. With respect to gender diversity, the Company proactively promotes equal opportunities for men and women in a sector that has traditionally been a male domain. Employees by gender (GRI 405-1) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Men % 91% 91% 90% Women % 9% 9% 10% At group level, women make up 9% of the management team, 19% of white collars and 7% of the blue collars, while at functional level, they represent 4% of the technical and production staff and 30% of the office employees. 116 The presence of female employees is higher at the central Milan and Rome offices, where they make up 37% of the total workforce (+1% on 2018). The average remuneration received by women compared to that received by men in 2018 was 69% for the managers and 85% for the white collar employees. This percentage is affected by the fact that the male employees have greater seniority than the female employees. The diversity and inclusion initiatives will continue in 2020 with specific projects that are already being prepared. They include training on intercultural dialogue, mentoring and reverse mentoring, specific training courses on female leadership and projects to increase awareness about gender diversity at leadership level for both men and women. Health and safety in the workplace Focus on health and safety in the workplace is one of Salini Impregilo’s fundamental values. It has an ISO 45001 certified occupational health and safety management system, which defines the main processes, roles and specific responsibilities to achieve its objectives and implement its safety policies. The new certifications have been updated as follows: scope: to include definitive and executive designs, works management and works performance to build large infrastructures, complex civil and industrial works and related technological systems, and the design and management of integrated operation and maintenance services for infrastructure, civil and industrial buildings, related technological systems and electromedical devices. application: all the work sites where the Company operates and all types of company in which it is involved. The Corporate Safety, Environment and Systems Unit is organised to better meet management’s objectives: ensuring coordination of the HSE management system activities to be of use to HSE teams at work sites; encouraging a change in the HSE culture through a competence centre to develop policies; setting up a technical safety unit to further integrate health and safety aspects within engineering processes; set up a corporate health unit to monitor contracts; ensuring continued health and safety operating support to the contract work sites. The main risk the Group is exposed to in this respect is partial non-compliance with the relevant regulations with the resulting potential impact on its workers, in terms of professional illnesses and injuries, and on itself in terms of potential sanctions. Changes in regulations and external factors tied to the operating context (e.g., climate, social, cultural factors) are the main sources of risk for the Company. 117 Specifically, workers are exposed to various types of risks that could affect their health and safety based on the geographical location of each operating unit and their specific activities. Each office and work site that applies the Group’s health and safety management system has the following measures to manage these risks: identification and assessment of the exposure to the risk; identification of the persons at risk; assessment of each job’s risk; identification of control measures to reduce the risk; monitoring work areas to check that control measures are in place and effective; making employees aware of these risks through information, training and communications. These measures are regulated by internal guidelines and procedures, which include, inter alia, the documentation each operating unit is required to have, comprising the risk assessment document, operating safety plans, emergency and evacuation plans, fire prevention and control plans and first aid plans. The Employer and downstream (in line with the proxy system) the managers, officers and workers shall ensure that health and safety management measures are in place. Specialist teams ensure their management in each operating unit. Specific attention is given to training employees about specific duties and the operating controls over work processes, performed either directly by the Group’s employees or subcontractors’ staff. Training programmes are defined at operating unit level by the health and safety manager and approved by the Employer, based on a risk assessment and the applicable legislative requirements. The training courses provided to each worker cover at least the following issues: ▪ the health and safety organisation (Employer, health and safety manager, health and safety officers and supervisors, company doctor and the workers’ safety representative), the legislative framework and an overview of the management system; ▪ health and safety risks arising from the Group’s activities in general and the specific risks faced by the workers; ▪ first aid and emergency management procedures (in particular, the fire fighting and evacuation plans). The health and safety managers receive special information and training courses. The key topics are the legalregulatory framework, safety management and organisation, risk identification and measurement, communication, training and discussions with workers. The health and safety officers and supervisors undergo additional training to that provided to the workers on the definition and identification of risk factors, incidents and near misses, techniques to communicate with and raise the awareness of employees, checking that workers comply with the legal and internal rules and the use of collective and personal protection equipment. 118 Workers, health and safety officers and supervisors and managers attend regular refresher courses. The courses for health and safety specialists meet the minimum requirements of the relevant legislation. Training and information activities are documented in terms of participation numbers and the content presented and materials used. The work site workers (employees of the Group and its subcontractors) receive special training on the related risks, specific activities and the possible risks of interference (Induction, Tool Box Talk, Job Safety Analysis/PreJob Meetings, etc). In order to ensure the collaboration of all the Group’s employees, they have the right to appoint safety representatives in accordance with the applicable legislation. These representatives are given the relevant training and information about HSE issues to encourage risk mitigation measures. They are also consulted about the implementation of key mitigation measures, including as a minimum: ▪ the introduction of a new process or equipment or its adaption; ▪ the appointment of the risk assessment manager; ▪ injuries. The Health and Safety Policy provides for, inter alia, the “right to intervene” for all employees when there is a doubt that health or safety could be compromised. Employees may also use the whistleblowing system described in the section on “Anti-corruption” to make notifications about health and safety issues or they may use the other available channels at group level (e.g., reporting to their superior) or work site level (e.g., the workers’ representatives, post boxes, grievance mechanisms). The Corporate Safety, Environment and Systems Unit regularly performs specific audits of the safety measures in place at the Group’s work sites and assesses application of the internal health and safety in the workplace regulations. As described in the section on Total reward, the company has a system to assess performance in terms of health and safety for its managers which rewards dedication and the results obtained by the relevant units and units over which they have influence. In 2019, the Group continued its Safety Builders Program as part of its more wide-reaching communication strategy, Valyou Our Health and Safety Way project, launched to encourage a strong corporate safety culture, based on strengthening leadership abilities at all management levels. Specifically, more than 29 workshops and 11 safety intervention (s.a.f.e.r.) training courses were held with the participation of 711 managers, supervisors and workers for a total of roughly 3670 hours of training. 119 As an integral part of the Valyou Our Health and Safety Way, Salini Impregilo adopted and rolled out its “Your Lifesaving Rules” in April 2019, a set of operating and management rules, devised to: • integrate the culture change process commenced with the Safety Builders Program; • foster workers’ active involvement; • strengthen the sense of belonging to the Group; • systematise conduct; • promote the purposive adoption of the Group’s Health & Safety Vision. These rules were prepared using analyses that included injury statistics, rules already applied at the work sites, analyses of accidents and injuries, sector and other benchmarks and risk magnitude. The Company made two videos to be used during the training courses to launch this project. The Company’s main workplaces celebrated the World Day for Safety and Health at Work in April 2019 when it introduced the above Your Lifesaving Rules. This involved more than 200 employees in the Rome and Milan offices in Italy and over 20 group Italian and foreign work sites, which presented projects about the rules and other programmes designed to meet the specific requirements of individual work sites. The entire Valyou Our Health and Safety Way won the prestigious Silver Award at the RoSPA Awards 2019, qualifying as one of the international programmes with the best practices in its sector in 2018. The award was conferred during the official ceremony held in London at the ExCel Exhibition Centre organised by RoSPA Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents on 18 June 2019. This UK institution is one of the most important in its sector and its patron is Queen Elisabeth II. It rewards organisations from around the world each year that stand out for their commitment to accident prevention and the protection of occupational health. Another Salini Impregilo project won the RoSPA Gold Award for the construction of the Cityringen metro line in Copenhagen, Denmark for the following reason: “The RoSPA Gold Award winners have achieved a very high level of performance, demonstrating well developed occupational health and safety management systems and culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss.” At the end of 2018, the Cityringen project, completed during the year by a joint venture led by Salini Impregilo, had achieved one million hours worked without a single accident, which is a very significant result considering the size and complexity of the project. Thousands of people from various countries, including Denmark, Italy, Poland, Ireland and Romania, worked at 22 work sites in central Copenhagen. There has been a large decrease in the number of work-related injuries thanks to the awareness projects about occupational health and safety (ValYou, Safety Builders Program, Your Life Saving Rules, tailored training courses as well as mandatory courses) implemented at the work sites and management’s significant involvement in promoting culture change programmes. The injury rates are set out below, expressed as the number of events for every million hours worked: 120 Injury rates – Direct workforce (GRI 403-9) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Hours worked hours 102,653,961 98,894,201 77,409,119 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate LTIFR 6.20 3.49 2.18 Total Recordable Frequency rate TRFR 15.60 8.37 6.45 Injury rates Subcontractors’ workforce (GRI 403-9) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Hours worked hours 74,461,728 89,579,720 78,270,780 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate LTIFR 2.77 2.03 2.06 Total Recordable Frequency rate TRFR 8.62 6.18 5.01 Total injury rates (GRI 403-9) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Hours worked hours 177,115,689 188,473,922 155,679,899 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate LTIFR 4.75 2.80 2.12 Total Recordable Frequency rate TRFR 12.66 7.33 5.72 Reference should be made to the Methodology for reporting non-financial information for details about the calculation method. The Company’s ongoing commitment to cultural issues (Safety Builders Program) and technical and system aspects resulted in the ongoing improvement of its safety performance, which was confirmed by the roughly 25% decrease in the injury rate. The following graph presents the LTIFR (the ratio of the total number of injuries leading to absence from work in the period to the total number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000) and its ongoing improvement in the last six years. Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 11.1 12.0 10.0 8.3 7.4 8.0 6.0 4.8 4.0 2.8 2.1 2.0 0.0 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 A local investigation takes place for each injury. When the sick leave is for a period of more than 40 days, the Corporate Safety, Environment and Systems Department and senior management from the relevant operating department are involved in the investigation. The objective is to identify the cause of the injury (root cause analysis) to prevent similar events occurring. 121 The Integrity Board is informed of the results of investigations into important injuries pursuant to the provisions of the Organisational Model (Legislative decree no. 231/2001 as subsequently amended). The Company will continue to make occupational health and safety improvements over the coming years to achieve a further reduction in its injury rates (LTIFR and TRFR), an increase in the security training provided for direct employees and as part of the Safety Builders programme and to step up its operating monitoring activities, with on-site security assessments and audits. Salini Impregilo guarantees protection of its workers’ health in the workplace with a special Internal Healthcare Unit, which schedules prevention procedures, health checks and healthcare monitoring programmes. It also performs regular checks of the work sites and makes sure they are provided with the relevant information to ensure that safety conditions are in line with the applicable legislative requirements. When adequate local healthcare units are not available, the Company sets up work site medical clinics which offer 24-hour healthcare and ambulance services to direct and indirect employees as well as their family members residing in the work site accommodation. The Group ensures that the local populations are also provided with healthcare assistance for acute or serious problems in remote areas not served by public healthcare units (reference should be made to the section on social aspects for more information). Employees of the Italian head offices and their families also have private health insurance which covers healthcare services for non-work related issues. The Group runs numerous initiatives at its offices and work sites promoting the importance of good health, flu vaccine programmes, campaigns about the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (e.g. HIV) and campaigns to promote healthy life styles, including the organisation of sporting events for workers. As it is aware of the added value achieved through mutually beneficial relationships between all the relevant parties, Salini Impregilo works with its commercial and financial partners and its vetted suppliers to guarantee high health and safety standards and to protect the environment. In line with the role it takes on during contracts, the Company promotes and/or ensures a Safety in Design approach so that the decisions taken right from the design stage are designed to eliminate/mitigate health and safety risks throughout the contract’s life cycle. In September 2019, the COCIV consortium, led by Salini Impregilo, signed an agreement with the trade unions Feneal-Uil, Filca-Cisl and Fillea-Cgil establishing that the Third Valico Railway Crossing work sites would have specific worker safety representatives to flank the representatives required by law. These new representatives liaise with all the representatives in the various work sites to provide a larger picture of the situation and prevent critical issues from materialising. Salini Impregilo has defined a series of measures to safeguard the health and safety of its employees due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency. These measures are designed to ensure, as far as possible, business continuity in the offices and at the work sites and are coordinated by a special multi-departmental task force based at the parent's headquarters. They are revised as necessary to comply with any new instructions issued by the competent authorities. 122 The Italian group companies have introduced remote work for their office staff and have reviewed their travel policies to limit travel. In line with the specific risks at the Italian and foreign work sites, preventative measures have been introduced to reduce the risk of spreading the virus in the work place, the residences and canteens. This has involved the reorganisation of work spaces and shifts to ensure the safety distance can be maintained, the supply of additional personal safety devices (e.g., masks, gloves, etc.), intensified sanitising and disinfection activities, special information and training courses, more healthcare services at the work sites and the preparation of special areas for the isolation of workers with flu-like symptoms who have returned from areas at risk or who have been in contact with people who may have the virus. The Group has also prepared dedicated methods to liaise with the local authorities to treat any suspected cases. 123 Human rights Human Rights Policy Agreement with the international trade issued in 2019 union BWI in place since 2014 100% of the operating entities Monitoring principles included in the risk assessment of human extended to the supply chain rights Internal policies Salini Impregilo is committed to ensuring respect for the human rights enshrined in the International Charter of Human Rights, the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the UN Global Compact, the UN Guiding principles on business and human rights and the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. In 2019, it issued a specific Human Rights Policy to reaffirm its commitment, already provided for in the Code of Ethics and the Sustainability Policy. The Human Rights Policy establishes the principles that everyone who works with Salini Impregilo around the world shall comply with, in terms of health and safety, child labour, forced labour, freedom of association and collective bargaining, non-discrimination, diversity and inclusion, working conditions, local communities and the rights of indigenous people, the value chain and whistle-blowing systems. The Company’s main undertakings are described below and more information is available in the policy on the website. Salini Impregilo does not tolerate any form of illegal, child labour or forced or compulsory labour. It protects the integrity of its employees, ensuring work conditions that respect the dignity of individuals and are fair and favourable. It offers equal opportunities based on fair and objective criteria. It does not accept any form of discrimination or damaging behaviour. Salini Impregilo respects its employees’ right to freedom of association and collective bargaining in accordance with the legislation applicable in the countries where they work. It does not discriminate against employees who join trade unions nor workers’ representatives. The Company also respects the rights and culture of the communities and indigenous peoples affected by its work and operates in accordance with the applicable requirements. Salini Impregilo encourages respect for human rights in its values chain through specific measures, such as the screening systems, application of the Suppliers Code of Conduct and monitoring systems. 124 It makes whistleblowing systems available to workers and third parties, safeguarding whistleblowers from any retaliatory action. In this respect, in 2014, the Company signed a framework agreement with the national trade unions (FenealUIL, Filca-CISL and Fillea-CGIL) and the international trade union for the construction sector (BWI Building and Wood Workers’ International) to jointly affirm and encourage respect for compliance with the basic principles and rights in employment relationships, encourage social justice and sustainable development by both itself and the consortia of which it is a member and vis-à-vis its contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. The framework agreement covers child labour, forced or compulsory labour, the freedom of association and collective bargaining, non-discrimination, work hours, economic treatment, work conditions, specialised training, the environment, welfare and employment relationships. Main risks and management methods The Company has implemented a due diligence process in line with the UN Guiding principles for business and human rights. This process entailed mapping the potential impact on human rights of the Company’s operations by analysing: human rights enshrined in the international law instruments applicable to the Company; parties potentially at risk; internal processes. The outcome was the Human Rights Impact Matrix, which was then used to measure the risks and prioritise the human rights relevant to the Group. The Company used its findings and the analysis of the applicable standards and market best practices to define its Human Rights Policy, issued in 2019. The principles embedded in this Policy are also referred to in the Suppliers Code of Conduct issued at the start of 2020 to extend the Company’s internal practices to its supply chain. At corporate level, the Corporate Social Responsibility Department coordinates the human rights due diligence, defines the internal standards and guidelines, the reporting, disclosure and training methods and provides specialist assistance to the other internal units. In 2019, all the operating entities included in the scope of this Statement underwent a human rights risk assessment to analyse the risks specific to each entity and the related mitigation measures adopted. 125 Specifically, the indicators used to measure country risk were used for this risk assessment 14. The department developed a risk measurement method based on the Company’s existing project risk assessment tools to measure the risks associated with the work carried out directly or subcontracted. The main risks identified and related management methods are summarised below. The main risks with respect to forced or compulsory labour are tied to the hiring of migrant workers, mainly in the certain states of the Persian Gulf (Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait) where the local labour force is insufficient and/or inadequate for the Group’s needs. Specifically, there are two risk factors: • use of recruitment agencies that may adopt incorrect practices, such as obliging the workers to pay recruitment fees (when hired), employment fees (throughout their employment) and cash deposits which are forms of debt (debt bondage); • labour conditions that may limit the migrant workers’ freedom of movement which are in some cases allowed or facilitated by local regulations, such as the ban on leaving their accommodation outside work hours, limitations on holiday arrangements, resignations and changes of employer. The Group ensures that candidates for work in these countries are provided with exhaustive information about the contractual terms and work conditions in their own language before they leave their country of origin. In addition, the Group fully bears the costs of recruitment, travel, visas, medical visits, etc.. Migrant workers are guaranteed the possibility to change jobs and to leave their destination country without prejudice to the possible notice obligation imposed by the applicable legislation, visa requirements and employment contracts. No workers are deprived of their identity documents unless this has been authorised by them and solely for their safekeeping. The Group requires the recruitment agencies to comply with these principles through specific contractual clauses and non-compliance entails termination of the contracts. With respect to child labour, the potential risk of hiring people under the minimum working age established by the applicable local regulations is minimal as is the risk that workers who are above the legal minimum but are less than 18 years old may be hired. In this respect and irrespective of the local regulations, the Group only agrees employment contracts with people who are 18 years old. In countries, where the presence of false identity documents is rife, the Group has special procedures in place to check the authenticity of the documents, especially driving licences, assisted by the local authorities. With respect to the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the Group ensures its employees have access to “alternative systems” for dialogue in the states of the Persian Gulf where the right to the freedom of association is restricted by law. These systems include worker committees, committees set up in the camps and 14As recommended by the principal regulations on human rights (e.g., Australia Modern Slavery Act), the Company used the Global Slavery Index rates. 126 complaint management procedures (grievance mechanisms). The Company ensures open communications with the workers and management’s availability to discuss any issues that may arise with individual employees. The Group enters into employment contracts with its employees that comply with the applicable local regulations, the principles of the framework agreement signed with BWI and those in any agreements signed with the local trade unions with respect to work conditions, work hours, economic treatment and employment relationships. The Group’s intention is to ensure scrupulous compliance with the applicable regulations in each country to mitigate the risk of non-compliance and, where possible, provide conditions that are better than those envisaged by the local regulations. As part of the integration process of the Rome and Milan offices, commenced in September 2015 and still ongoing, the Company extended the voluntary redundancy procedure introduced in previous years until 31 January 2021, with the relevant trade unions’ agreement. Salini Impregilo extended the agreement with the trade union representatives of the Rome and Milan offices for those employees who are near the legal retirement age for the incentivated early retirement of those employees who meet the legal requirements for retirement before 31 December 2020. The Group may potentially be exposed to the risk that discrimination against an individual employee or specific categories of employees may take place in the workplace. In this respect, the Company’s HR management procedures do not allow the different treatment of employees based on their gender, origin, religion, age, political beliefs, sexual orientation, disability or other characteristics protected by the regulations ruling in the countries where the Group operates during the entire HR management procedure (recruitment, training, assessments and termination of employment). With respect to its local communities, the Group’s activities may generate risks related to its core construction business, such as noise pollution, dust, vibrations, work site vehicles and damage to private property. Risks related to the acquisition of land are immaterial as the client usually acquires the land directly. However, Salini Impregilo scrupulously adheres to the legal and contractual requirements and those set out in the project impact assessments to ensure it complies with them during its work and the activities contracted to third parties (subcontractors). Work sites may be assigned a security unit in specific geographical areas due to the risks identified. The security personnel may be employees and/or personnel provided by third parties, who are usually unarmed and/or by personnel supplied by the army or local police departments through specific contracts, formal agreements or service orders. The security personnel at the operating units receive initial training and periodic refresher courses from the local managers based on training programmes that reflect the applicable standards and regulations and include information on respect for the individual, human rights and the Code of Ethics. When group employees or 127 personnel of private companies are used, the related contract includes service clauses for specific training about respect for human rights and the Code of Ethics. They are provided with appropriate training about their tasks. The training of personnel supplied by public safety forces complies with local regulations and standards and is mainly provided by the relevant bodies. Depending on the nature of the project, the security unit and local management define the best way of involving the local stakeholders, mostly through formal meetings, informal meetings and discussions, training and official events. The Corporate Security Department performs specific assessments of security risks, coordinates the local security units, defines internal standards and guidelines, prepares reports on significant events and carries out regular audits of the operating units. The main risks to which the Company is exposed arise from the potential violation of the above-mentioned human rights by subcontractors and suppliers. The Company has issued internal guidelines for its operating units for the correct management of the activities at risk. These guidelines provide for management and monitoring of human rights and specific reports to be sent to Corporate. During 2019, the Company commenced a training programme on human rights to be provided in the first half of 2020 alongside other courses to raise employee awareness about the issue. In 2019, Salini Impregilo measured the human rights risks of its supply chain by evaluating the contracts agreed since 201815, to check the existence of suppliers based in countries and/or that supply goods considered at risk (based on the source country).16 The evaluation showed that no supplier of goods and materials is based in the countries classified as high risk, while 64% of the suppliers are based in countries with risks ranging from “very low” to “medium to low”. No goods at risk were purchased from a significant supplier during the year 17. In addition to requesting its suppliers accept the Code of Ethics and the Suppliers Code of Conduct, Salini Impregilo recently revised its screening system, tightening up the vetting process for potential suppliers with respect to human rights. It also asks its suppliers to collaborate in a loyal and transparent manner with the Group for the purposes of the checks and audits of the correct compliance of its standards when they sign the related contracts. 15 Subcontracts were excluded from the evaluation as the related risks had been measured with the direct activities, as described earlier. 16 Once again, the Company referred to the Global Slavery Index to assess country risk and the lists of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs to assess the risk that goods have been produced by chlld or forced labour. 17 A significant supplier is a supplier with contracts over €250 thousand. Below this threshold, the only purchases of commodities that could be considered risky, albeit not characteristic of the construction sector, were the purchases of work clothes, electronic products and foodstuffs, equal to 0.06% of total purchases. 128 All relevant persons (direct employees, supplier employees, local communities, etc.) may use the whistleblowing system described in the section on “Anti-corruption” for human right notifications. In addition, when IT channels are difficult to access, the Company has introduced alternative systems such as dedicated telephone numbers and/or personnel (grievance officers), post boxes for the receipt of reports, etc. In January 2019, the non-governmental organisation Business and Human Rights Resource Centre published a report “On Shaky Ground: Migrant Workers’ Rights in Qatar and UAE Construction” on the workers’ rights protection practices adopted by construction companies working in the states of the Persian Gulf. Two years after the issue of the first report, Salini Impregilo was again one of the leaders with respect to worker management thanks to its specific policies and procedures that effectively protect the rights and wellbeing of migrant workers. 129 Climate change -25% 52 thousand t CO2 GHG emissions less emissions thanks to dedicated (Scope 1&2) projects -15 Mt CO2 Leadership annual emissions avoidable by in the fight against climate change, hydropower projects and metro lines according to the CDP rating Internal policies The Group’s Sustainability Strategy (see the related section for more information) defines Salini Impregilo’s contribution to the SDGs established by the United Nations, including SDG 13 Climate action. The Company offers its contribution through the projects it builds and its internal management policies. Its projects in the sustainable mobility, clean hydro energy, clean water and green buildings areas all contribute to the adaption and mitigation of climate change. Specifically with respect to mitigation actions, the hydropower, sustainable mobility (railways and metros) and green building contracts allow a reduction in the output of GHG emissions, in line with the global agenda to transition towards a low-carbon economy. The Group also carries out projects to reduce the impact of climate change. They include the desalination, drinking water and water treatment projects performed by the group company Fisia Italimpianti mainly in areas subject to water stress. The Group also has projects for water storage for drinking and/or irrigation and to make urban wastewater management systems resilient to the increasingly frequent extreme weather events, protecting areas affected by flooding and preventing the pollution of the receiving water bodies. Again with respect to adaption to climate change, the Group leads the field with tailored systems to measure the risk of climate change and its effect on infrastructure projects and the implementation of suitable strategies to improve their resilience in the short, medium and long term. It has applied these systems successfully to projects for metros, railways, hydraulic works, roads and civil buildings. It has received numerous external certifications (e.g., LEED Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, GSAS, Global Sustainability Assessment System and IS) and international accolades for the design (if applicable) and construction of its projects. 130 Salini Impregilo is also actively committed to reducing its carbon footprint by defining and introducing energy efficiency projects and by developing innovation and research projects for the production processes, materials, logistics, etc.. Since 2018, the Group has been one of the Top Ten global construction companies with the highest revenue generated from environmental infrastructure works according to the ranking prepared by Engineering News Record (ENR) once a year. The Group participates in the CDP (former Carbon Disclosure Project), the global platform that measures, compares and shares information about the environmental performance of roughly 8,400 companies around the world. Salini Impregilo has obtained the Arating for the Climate Change questionnaire, up from its previous B rating, achieving leadership level in this project. Main risks and management methods In line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), the Company assesses the risks and opportunities of climate change in two ways: its impact on the climate and the climate change’s impact on it. OPPORTUNITIES created by the Group's ability to contribute to the mitigation of and adaption to climate change through its business RISKS due to the Group's operations (e.g., use of fossil fuels, carbon intensive materials) GROUP CLIMATE RISKS due to the effects of climate change on the Group's operations (e.g., extreme weather events) The business areas in which Salini Impregilo operates have a close link to climate change, in terms of mitigation and adaptation abilities. The ongoing worsening in the climate crisis, which has had follow-on effects that are much more serious and rapid than originally envisaged, is an opportunity for the Group to increase its contribution to fighting climate change and build its business. 131 A significant part of its 2019 revenue was earned on projects that actively contribute to the fight against climate change. The “Salini Impregilo Group: Our vision and performance” section of the Directors’ report provides more information on this. The Group’s contribution to mitigation of climate change The energy and transport sectors are the biggest culprits in terms of GHG emissions. The Group works in both these sectors building infrastructure that allows for a significant reduction in these emissions. The following graphs provide a comparison of the emission levels of the main electricity generation sources18 and transport19, showing the business areas in which the Group operates with energy (hydropower) and sustainable mobility (metros and railways) contracts. These ongoing projects include five hydropower plants and twenty metro and light rail lines, railway lines and high speed lines. They generate environmental benefits in terms of very significantly lower emissions, as summarised below. 18 Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 19 Comparison of Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Various Electricity Generation Sources, World Nuclear Association 132 In 2019, the Group completed the Cityringen metro project, which has a daily capacity of 240 thousand passengers, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Together with the other existing lines, this new line will provide 85% of the city’s population with a metro station less than 600 metres from their doorstep. The hydropower and railway sustainable mobility business areas have huge development potential, as confirmed by the main projections and estimates available, given their ability to contribute to achievement of the Paris Climate Agreement objectives and the SGDs. The next graphs show the planned investments for the hydropower20 and railway21 business areas based on the current scenario (and political policies) and a scenario where the objective of maintaining the increase in the earth’s temperature below 2° C compared to the preindustrial levels is achieved. Another area where the Group is active in the mitigation of climate change is that of green buildings. Most of the civil building works now underway use eco-design and construction systems (e.g., LEEDS and GSAS) to improve the environmental performances of buildings over their entire life cycle compared to similar projects built using standard criteria. The Group applies these systems to metropolitan infrastructure projects as well, like those in Qatar and Australia. For example, the Sydney Metro Northwest project, which has been completed, was built with a carbon footprint of 27% less than the original project envisaged. The Group’s contribution to adaptation to climate change Salini Impregilo’s business model contributes to help geographical areas adapt to climate change. It builds works that contribute to dealing with resource scarcity (e.g., water scarcity) and extreme weather events caused by the global warming. It achieves this mainly through: 20 Source: IEA (2019), “World Energy Outlook 2019”, IEA, Paris https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2019 21 Lefevre, Benoit, Ahmad Iqbal Chaudhary, Deeba Yavrom, and Aman Srivastava. 2016. “The Trillion Dollar Question II: Tracking Investment Needs in Transport.” Working Paper. Washington, DC: World Resources Institute. 133 projects in the clean water area, such as desalination, drinking water and water treatment plants, water storage for drinking and/or irrigation purposes (adaptation to resource scarcity), hydraulic projects in urban areas to reduce flooding and water pollution (adaptation to extreme weather events); utilisation of eco-design and construction systems to improve infrastructures’ resilience to extreme climate events in the short and medium to long term. The ongoing clean water projects respond to the specific requirements of areas affected by increasing water scarcity (such as the desalination plants built in the Middle East and irrigation water storage in Africa), the more frequent extreme weather events (the hydraulic projects carried out in the main urban centres in the US) and the pollution of rivers and water basins (the Riachuelo River in Argentina and the Caloosahatchee West Basin Storage Reservoir in the US). The benefits to the populations affected by the Group’s projects are summarised below: 4 drinking water, desalination ≈ 1 million cubic metres ≈ 8.2 million residents and water treatment plants of water treated a day served (Nigeria, Oman, Peru and Turkey) 6 hydraulic projects to reduce ≈ 4.9 billion cubic flooding and water pollution ≈ 5.9 million residents metres of water (Argentina and USA) affected treated a year CLEAN WATER 2 irrigation/electricity mixed ≈ 1.7 billion cubic ≈ 7 thousand hectares of use reservoirs metres reservoir irrigable surface (Namibia and Nigeria) capacity Investments in water business area infrastructure, as shown in the following graph22 will by necessity continue to be substantial in the next 20 years, driven by two main factors: the growing global population and climate change.

It allows a reduction in GHG emissions of around six times that of thermal desalination plants. A common thread linking all the Group’s business areas is the growing focus on new infrastructure’s resilience to climate change. Alongside the usual studies of the durability and safety of infrastructure, specific studies are increasingly commissioned on the expected climatic situation in the areas where the projects are taking place. They are designed to understand the potential future effects of these climatic factors on the works (e.g., the volume of rainfalls, wind strengths and temperatures) to improve their resilience. This issue is of great importance for works that are heavily exposed to the effects of atmospheric agents, such as roads, bridges and viaducts, as their resilience over time is essential to their users’ safety. The Company has accumulated significant experience in the use of design techniques and studies of materials that reflect future climate projections. Example of this are the award-winning Skytrain Bridge, built as part of the Sydney Metro Northwest project and designed to stand up to rain, flooding and winds forecast after 2100 or the New Genoa Bridge, designed to deal with the expected increase in rainfall over the next 80 years. The Group’s carbon footprint The direct risk to the climate generated by the Group’s activities mostly relates to the use of fossil fuels in operations and materials which involve carbon intensive processes (e.g., cement and steel). Considering the entire life cycle of the Group’s projects, these effects are temporary, as they only take place during the construction period, and should be considered in light of the benefits of using the infrastructure, which has a much longer useful life, usually at least a couple of decades. In fact, many works are designed to be operated over 80 to 100 years if not longer. While the Group’s business is characterised by highly customised processing, techniques and technologies depending on the specific requirements of the works to be built and the characteristics of the areas where they will be located, Salini Impregilo has actively pursued improvement in energy efficiency for some years to decrease its carbon footprint. The following tables show its energy consumption and the related GHG emissions: 23 Source: IEA, Desalinated water affects the energy equation in the Middle East, Molly Walton, 2019. https://www.iea.org/commentaries/desalinated-water-affects-the-energy-equation-in-the-middle-east 135 Energy consumption (GRI 302-1, 302-2, 302-3) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Non-renewable energy sources Diesel GJ 5,959,115 5,455,604 4,788,252 Petrol GJ 646,560 348,456 234,462 Kerosene GJ 42,945 10,405 2,875 Natural gas and LPG GJ 2,033,091 1,200,705 3,905 Electricity GJ 375,059 393,766 308,263 5,337,758 Total consumption from non-renewable energy sources GJ 9,056,769 7,408,937 Renewable energy sources Electricity from renewable sources GJ 254,958 200,415 148,619 Total internal energy consumption GJ 9,311,728 7,609,352 5,486,377 Energy consumption subcontractors GJ 1,964,079 1,667,939 770,806 Total energy consumption GJ 11,275,807 9,277,292 6,257,183 Energy intensity GJ/€m 2,028 1,785 1,220 Direct and indirect GHG emissions Unit 2017 2018 2019 (GRI 305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4) Direct emissions (Scope 1) tCO2e 566,952 467,234 350,593 Indirect emissions (Scope 2) tCO2e 43,388 54,637 43,371 Other indirect emissions (Scope 3) tCO2e 137,577 117,528 61,573 Total GHG emissions t CO2e 747,917 639,399 455,537 Intensity of greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2)* t CO2e/€ M 110 100 77 * The 2017 and 2018 data have been restated to exclude Scope 3 emissions as indicated in the ”Methodology for reporting non-financial information” section. The considerable reduction in natural gas and LPG in 2019 is due to the sale of Lane’s Plants & Paving division in the US as it uses large quantities of these energy sources. The reduction in the consumption of diesel, petrol and electricity is also a result of the above sale. However, the smaller diesel consumption is mostly due to the lesser work carried out on the GERD and Koysha projects in Ethiopia. The large contraction in subcontractors’ consumption, and related Scope 3 GHG emissions, is principally a result of the projects of Salini Polska (Poland), the Rogun project (Tajikistan) and the opening of the Copenhagen Cityringen metro in Denmark. The Group’s main energy rationalisation systems include the use of highly efficient vehicles and equipment, connecting its building site plants to electricity networks rather than diesel generators, carrying out regular maintenance programmes for its vehicles, improving power quality and informing its employees about the importance of energy saving. Significant contributors to the reduction in GHG emissions are the projects to connect to the electricity grid systems, especially when the host country’s energy mix is mostly made up of renewable energy. This is the case in Ethiopia, where the GERD hydropower project work site uses renewable energy generated by other hydropower plants already active in this country, shortly to be joined by the Koysha work site, where a power line to the national grid is currently being laid. 136 The following table shows the Group’s initiatives to reduce its GHG emissions: GHG emission reduction initiatives Unit 2017 2018 2019 Active initiatives no. 13 16 15 Reduction in GHG emissions t CO2e 53,202 42,440 52,253 Over the last three years, initiatives have been rolled out to improve the energy efficiency of industrial processes, to adapt current production processes, to adopt less polluting logistics options and to introduce awareness campaigns for employees. In addition, many of the Company’s innovation, research and development projects (see the relevant section) have a strong environmental factor in terms of their energy efficiency and reduction in GHG emissions. In addition to consumption and direct emissions, which the Group intends to contain over the next few years, Salini Impregilo works to reduce the indirect emissions from its related activities (transportation and travel of its employees) as much as possible. As well as the specific projects described in the section on innovation, research and development, the Company’s procurement policy designed to mostly use local suppliers (94% in 2019) eliminates the need for long transport journeys, reducing the related emissions. When the goods are not available on the local market, the Group prefers to ship materials and machinery by sea as this is the means of transport with the lowest carbon footprint. Over the last few years, the Group has equipped its offices and work sites with video conference systems which have reduced the number of business trips to those essential for operating reasons. Its travel policy favours travelling by train rather than by plane and the use of public transport rather than taxis. When possible, contracts have personnel mobility management programmes designed to optimise transfers between work areas, the canteens and employee accommodation. They include the use of collective transport methods (buses) for blue collars and car-pooling for white collars at the work site offices. Climate change risks Climate change can provoke various types of risk for a business, depending on the nature of its operations and the markets where it operates. The Company is mostly exposed to the risk of an increase in adverse weather events that can affect the normal scheduling and performance of its works leading to delays. This risk is not currently deemed high and is managed using the normal contract scheduling procedures, where the work programme (number of hours that can be worked per day and annual work days) is defined and updated considering weather forecasts, based on historical data available. Exceptional weather events that affect compliance with the timeline agreed with clients can be handled through the contract or by negotiation and usually lead to acceptance of a time extension and/or compensation for the higher costs incurred. The risk of damage to assets by adverse weather conditions is also considered to be low, thanks to the related insurance contracts. 137 In the medium to long term, changes in the annual average rainfall levels are expected in many areas around the world, which could potentially affect the outlook of sectors like the non-pumped storage hydropower sector. The analyses available that have been prepared using probable scenarios include potential reductions in rainfall in certain areas and the concurrent increase in other areas. As a result, investments allocated to these areas could change (either increasing or decreasing) with the related follow-on effects on business. It can be expected that these changes will be gradual, monitored and that any mitigation action necessary will take place using the current strategic and commercial planning tools assisted by the Group’s international presence and market diversification. 138 Environment Circular Economy 73% focus on re-use, recycling and reduction waste not sent to landfills of waste 58% 42% reused excavated materials materials purchased within a 160 km radius of the work sites Internal policies Protection of the environment is a priority for the Group which formalised a specific Environmental Policy in 2002, one of the first European construction companies to do so. In 2007, it introduced an environmental management system which is ISO 14001 certified. In 2017, the certification was upgraded to the 2015 version, which puts greater emphasis on the life cycle perspective, the sustainable supply chain and environmental performance. Salini Impregilo’s Environmental Policy defines ten principles to guarantee: compliance with applicable legal requirements and any other agreed-to requirements; identification and assessment of environmental aspects tied to the Company’s direct and indirect, present and future operations, evaluation of the related significant effects and management of the mitigation and control measures; identification of all the technical and organisational measures designed for the rational use of natural resources and the mitigation of pollution, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, waste generation and inconvenience to the local communities as well as the maximisation of the positive effects for the environment; involvement and participation of all employees or people who work for the Company through actions to make them aware of the issue, the dissemination of information and training courses, dialogue and transparency in action. The Policy also provides that each worker has the right and is obliged to intervene and stop work if the environment could potentially be compromised. During the realisation of awarded projects, the Group ensures compliance with the above-mentioned principles in accordance with the commitments taken on with its clients. More information about Salini Impregilo’s role and 139 responsibilities during the infrastructure project development stage is available in the section entitled “The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role”. Main risks and management methods The main environmental risks arising from the Company’s activities relate to non-compliance with applicable environmental legislation, compromising one or more environmental components (e.g., the soil, water or air) due to a mistaken assessment of the risk or ineffective management/mitigation activities, inefficient use of natural resources and the failure to obtain/maintain environmental certifications and ratings. The main environmental risks facing the Company (generated by external factors) arise from changes in the applicable environmental legislation, the inconsistent interpretation of applicable legislation by the competent local authorities, incomplete and/or insufficient environmental impact assessments for projects (which should be performed by the client) or adverse environmental or geological conditions (e.g., extreme weather events, actual conditions differing from those anticipated during the tender procedure). To monitor these risks, Salini Impregilo has an environmental management system, which complies with the ISO 14001 standard and has been certified by an independent certification body. To ensure that the significant environmental impacts are properly identified, managed and mitigated, the system incorporates a number of environmental management procedures that have to be implemented by the Group’s production companies, after being revised to comply with the applicable regulations or contracts. When contractually provided for, the Group’s contracts may include additional environmental management standards that require special certifications or ratings. They may be: • system standards, which involve reaching specific environmental performance targets during construction activities (e.g., lower emissions, waste recycling); • product standards, which require the completed works to meet specific environmental performance targets (e.g., use of low impact construction materials, energy-efficient buildings). Ongoing projects affected by these standards include the Red line North Underground in Doha and the Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar which use the GSAS (Global Sustainability Assessment System), two stations of Line 3 of the Riyadh metro in Saudi Arabia and Eni’s new offices in Italy which use the LEED standard, the Meydan One Mall, Dubai project which uses the Green Buildings Regulations and Specification standard and the ForrestfieldAirport Link in Perth, Australia which uses the IS (Infrastructure Sustainability) system. During 2019, Salini Impregilo took part in the pilot stage of the “Level(s)” project promoted by the European Commission as the future reference framework for green buildings in the EU. Specifically, the Company trialled the framework’s application in its project to build Eni’s headquarters in Italy as one of the first to use this tool. It 140 was thus able to give a real contribution to the promotion of sustainability principles and the circular economy applied to the construction industry and has gained valuable experience to give it a competitive edge once the framework becomes applicable. In 2019, Line 3 of the Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia garnered great recognition for its environmental results. During the start-up of a new contract and based on the planned work, the plant to be built and the areas to be used for logistics and building work, an environmental risk assessment is performed to identify significant environmental aspects, i.e., those aspects that could have a follow-on significant impact on the environment. Their identification and assessment of the significance of their impact as well as the subsequent definition of impact management and mitigation measures take place in line with specific procedures. The significance of environmental impacts is assessed using a method based on an analysis of well defined criteria, such as the existence of special regulatory or contractual requirements, assessment of the related risk, management of the impact and the area’s sensitivity to the specific environmental aspect. The assessment considers various scenarios: standard operating conditions, irregular conditions (e.g., plant start-up), emergencies (e.g., fire, spills). Once the significant environmental aspects have been identified, the main effects of the contract work and other activities on the different environmental components are analysed: • natural and energy resources; • atmosphere and climate (emissions); • soil, subsoil and water environment; • waste and use of hazardous substances/preparations; • traffic, atmospheric, light and electromagnetic pollution; • noise and vibrations; • ecosystem, cultural heritage and environmental restoration. After the environmental risk assessment, analysis of the contractual obligations and related environmental regulations, the following is prepared for each contract: • environmental plans/procedures setting out guidelines for the management/protection of each specific environmental component; • environmental protection plans defining the specific mitigation and monitoring activities to be adopted in the specific area; • environmental monitoring and control plans defining the specific management and monitoring activities for the environmental components identified in the various areas; • specific instructions for the different method statements applied. In addition and to comply with the client’s instructions, the project’s social-environmental impact assessment and ruling legislation, the contract undergoes environmental monitoring to check any unforeseen variations 141 and/or critical environmental issues affecting the areas outside the work site during the development or roll out of the work. This includes investigating the causes to determine whether they are due to the project and, if so, together with the client, to define mitigation/prevention measures with the client and check their effectiveness. To ensure the correct implementation of the environmental plans, the work sites schedule and provide for information/training to be given to the employees involved in contracts with potential impacts on the environment, including the subcontractors’ employees. It regularly runs campaigns to raise employees’ awareness of specific issues (e.g., energy savings, waste, spills, use of hazardous substances/preparations, etc.). The work site environmental departments carry out the monitoring/supervision procedures provided for in the environmental plan with regular checks and audits of the activities performed directly and indirectly by subcontractors. If any instances of non-compliance are identified, special remedial actions are defined as well as plans to improve the processes and/or performance when deemed appropriate. Contract management regularly reviews environmental performances and the management system’s strengths and weaknesses. It sets objectives for the subsequent period to ensure ongoing improvement. The Company is committed to the optimal use of resources and reduction of its environmental footprint. It will continue to protect the areas where it works to ensure that serious environmental accidents do not take place, that production processes become more efficient, the use of local raw materials is more efficient and effective and that water resources, materials and waste not sent to landfills will be reused (in line with the applicable legislation). It will assess its water management cycle and machinery to define additional measures to reduce its impact on the environment. Finally, it will continue to provide training courses about the environment to its employees to increase the per capita hours provided to direct employees. At corporate level, the Group HR, Organisation and Systems Department defines methodologies, tools and operating methods to manage quality, health, safety and the environment issues. Its Safety, Environment and Systems Unit is in charge of the environmental management system. It provides technical assistance with environmental issues, analyses the Group’s environmental performance and defines the objectives/guidelines for continuous improvement to pursue steadily improved performances. Communications about environmental aspects are made on a hierarchical basis within the Company through the QEHS coordinators (who liaise with the Corporate and contract managers), the company intranet, the website and this Statement. Other internal communication channels (e.g., employees, subcontractors) and external channels (e.g., local communities) are set up at individual production unit level in line with the ruling legislation, contractual requirements and any recommendations in the social and environmental impact assessments approved by the authorities. Employees may use the whistleblowing system described in the section on “Anti-corruption” for environmental notifications. In addition, some work sites have additional notification systems (grievance mechanisms), which 142 can also be used by third parties (e.g., local communities). Typical communications received locally relate to inconveniences caused by the work site equipment (traffic, dust) and construction activities (noise, vibrations) or damage to private property. Reference should be made to the section on “Main risk factors and uncertainties” (“Criminal litigation” paragraph) of the Directors’ report for ongoing environment-related disputes. The methods to manage the main environmental issues are described below. The environmental data are heavily affected by the number and type of works under construction, the client’s design decisions and the stage of completion of the individual projects. Accordingly, a comparison with previous periods may not always be significant, especially in terms of the absolute values. The local area and the circular economy At the end of 2019, the Group’s work sites included in the scope of this Statement included 396 operational sites, of which 60 underground, for a total surface area of 208,194,021 m2. The following table shows the main data by geographical area Surface area of areas Surface area in Geographical area Unit Total surface area adjacent to protected protected areas areas Africa m /% 2 22,390,000 0% 0% Europe m2 / % 9,568,112 2% 10% Americas m2 / % 57,740,085 76% 6% Asia and Oceania m2 / % 118,495,824 0% 0% Total m /% 2 208,194,021 21% 2% The American continent is the geographical area where the Group has the largest surface areas inside protected areas. This is due to the acquisition of the Caloosahatchee (C43) West Basin Storage Reservoir contract in Florida, USA in June 2019. The project is part of a larger plan, The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, a long-term plan approved by the US Congress to restore, protect and preserve the environment of a protected area of great importance to the community, the economy and ecosystem of Florida. The Everglades provide drinking water to more than eight million people, supports the flourishing agricultural and tourist sectors of Florida, has unique natural habitats and is home to two native American tribes. The Group’s share of the project is to build a reservoir as part of the plan to contain wastewater discharges, improve water quality, restore natural habitats and preserve the protected species. The interaction between the Group’s activities and protected areas in other areas around the world is extremely limited. More information is available in the “Biodiversity, cultural heritage and environmental restorations” section. 143 The Group adopts practices that are in line with the principles of the circular and green economy, designed to minimise (when possible) the use of natural resources, including through their reuse, as part of its activities. Similarly, it encourages the recovery of waste materials in the same project or surrounding areas. The Group’s resources for the year are presented in the next chart, showing the “circularity” of its practices. 144 INPUT OUTPUT of of 8.4 Mt 20.7 Mm3 10.0 Mm3 6.0 Mt which 94% which 99.8% of materials of excavated of water of waste excavation non-hazardous used materials withdrawals waste waste products 42% 73% materials of waste not sent to purchased landfills within a 160 km radius of the work sites 58% +17% of reused excavated of waste recycled compared to materials the previous year 20% -42% of recycled of waste core products water compared to the previous year PROTECTION AND RESTORATION 52.5 Mm2 710 thousand m2 188 thousand m3 of soil of areas where of reforested areas protected topsoil was replaced from erosion 145 The following paragraphs describe the elements presented in the above chart. Raw materials Construction of motorways, bridges, dams, railway and metro lines and civil and industrial buildings requires the use of large quantities of water, aggregates, iron, cement and backfill: all raw materials which are mostly not renewable. The environmental assessments made at the start of a new contract consider these aspects and the related mitigation measures are designed to ensure the efficient management of these resources and, when possible, the use of alternative materials, such as recycled materials, without reducing the quality, performance, security and functioning of the asset. The main raw materials used are shown in the following table: Materials used (GRI 301-1) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Aggregates t 23,018,778 15,399,193 4,063,905 Bitumen t 245,468 257,541 77,705 Cement t 558,395 662,052 357,757 Reinforcing bars t 506,843 1,065,914 488,085 Ready-mixed and pre-cast concrete t 5,500,060 4,608,609 2,808,654 Ready-mixed asphalt t 1,083,235 790,547 560,039 Total non-renewable materials t 30,912,780 22,783,854 8,356,146 Water use (GRI 303-1) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Wells m3 2,399,423 2,880,660 3,739,539 Rivers m3 10,640,606 6,793,150 3,810,030 Lakes m 3 383,197 291,623 Sea m 3 5,014 Aqueducts m3 2,864,234 2,259,390 2,417,294 Rainwater and wastewater from other organisations m3 18,762 116,795 158 Total m 3 16,311,237 12,341,619 9,967,021 The main variations on the previous year relate to the sale of Lane’s Plants & Paving Division in the US and the stage of completion of the Group’s projects. Specifically, the reduction in aggregates and bitumen is mostly due to this sale. The decrease in aggregates is also due to progress on the projects of Salini Polska (Poland) and the GERD project in Ethiopia. The reduction in concrete is mainly a result of progress on the Riyadh Metro (Saudi Arabia), Meydan One Mall (UAE) projects and those of Lane (USA) while the decrease in the use of asphalt is due to progress on the projects of Salini Polska (Poland) and the reduction in the utilisation of reinforcing bars reflects the progress on Lane’s projects (USA). With respect to water resources, the increase in withdrawals from wells is due to the greater use by the South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait) and COCIV (Italy) projects while the reduction in withdrawals from rivers is mostly attributable to the progress on the GERD and Koysha projects in Ethiopia. There were no withdrawals from lakes in 2019 which is entirely related to Lane’s projects (USA) and, specifically, the sale of its Plants & Paving Division. 146 With respect to the circular and green economy, 42% of the materials purchased complied with the region-based criterion, as they were purchased within a radius of less than 160 km from the work sites, thus reducing the impact of their transport. During 2019, the Group also used 15.1 thousand tonnes of fly ash (2018: 22.5 thousand tonnes) and water recycled and re-used in production processes of 2.0 million cubic metres (2018: 4.0 million cubic metres). Energy consumption, both in the form of fossil fuels and electric energy, has a strong impact during construction of infrastructure. Reduction of energy consumption and greater energy efficiency allow a decrease in GHG emissions and mitigation of the effects of climate change. The “Climate change” section describes the Group’s actions in this area. Soil, subsoil and water environment The Group’s construction activities may affect the soil and water environment at different levels depending on the works in question and the surrounding environment (e.g., urban or rural environment). Contracts are managed to avoid damaging these environmental components. Specifically, containment tanks, wastewater conveying networks and waterproofing systems for risky logistic areas (e.g., workshops, fuel and chemical depots) are built during the work site start-up phase to prevent contamination of the soil, subsoil and surrounding water bodies. Industrial wastewater is channelled and collected in sedimentation tanks and treatment plants designed to comply with the applicable legal and contractual provisions, using the best technologies available, given the wastewater’s specific characteristics. Construction work also involves movement of large earth quantities to construct embankments, cuttings, tunnels or certain types of dams. In accordance with the policy to reduce waste production, the excavated earth and rocks are classified and stored on the sites for possible re-use within them, where possible and in compliance with the regulations, or transferred to third parties to be re-used externally. In 2019, re-used excavated materials amounted to 12.1 million cubic metres (2018: 18.1 million cubic metres), which is a very significant amount (58% of the total) showing the effectiveness of the Group’s circular economy policies. In order to mitigate the risk of soil erosion due to excavations and aggravated by weather events (rain, wind), the Group takes specific soil protection measures consisting of systems to consolidate excavation fronts and to channel rainwater, as well as covering more exposed areas (e.g., escarpments) and planting trees that mitigate erosion. The mitigation measures are defined considering the natural elements, the environment and features of the local area. In 2019, areas where measures to protect against erosion have been implemented covered 52.5 million square meters (2018: 6.5 million square metres). Waste Waste generated during construction of large-scale infrastructure can be grouped into two separate categories: municipal waste and special waste. Municipal waste is generated by logistics sites where the support activities for the industrial production are carried out such as offices, accommodation for non-resident workers and 147 canteens. Special waste is generated by the actual industrial activities, such as construction, plant operation and the workshops. Waste materials are collected and sorted, and stored in specific enclosed areas, from which they are then taken to be transferred to third parties authorised to recycle/dispose of the waste, preferring recovery where possible. Hazardous waste is a marginal part of the waste generated in the Group’s contracts. Normally it involves paint, additives and solvents, used oil and oil filters from vehicle maintenance, batteries, rechargeable batteries and, in some cases, earth, sludge and other materials containing hazardous substances. Waste produced by activity, type and destination, dealt with in accordance with local regulations, is shown in the following table: Total waste by activity (GRI 306-2) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Construction and demolition waste t 593,188 517,732 291,491 Excavation waste t 7,004,018 6,345,575 5,593,636 Waste from support activities t 172,499 97,558 66,829 Total non-hazardous and hazardous waste t 7,769,705 6,960,865 5,951,955 Total waste by type and destination (GRI 306-2) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Non-hazardous waste Recovery, re-use and recycling t 2,565,843 3,712,507 4,341,435 Incineration t 4,275 3,398 930 Landfill t 5,188,936 3,230,657 1,598,681 Total non-hazardous waste t 7,759,054 6,946,563 5,941,047 Hazardous waste Recovery, re-use and recycling t 4,057 5,283 712 Incineration t 679 324 27 Landfill t 5,914 8,695 10,169 Total hazardous waste t 10,650 14,302 10,908 Total non-hazardous and hazardous waste t 7,769,705 6,960,865 5,951,955 94% of the waste produced is from excavations. It is classified as waste in line with the applicable regulations and its possible internal and/or external reuse, which varies depending on the projects’ characteristics and the material’s geotechnical characteristics which the Group cannot influence. The decrease in total waste in 2019 is mainly due to the progress made on the projects of Salini Polska (Poland) and the Riyadh Metro (Saudi Arabia). The percentage of waste recovered, re-used and recycled increased by 17% on 2018 while the total waste produced decreased. Atmosphere Unlike other industrial sectors, the construction sector does not generate significant atmospheric pollution. The main sources of atmospheric emissions are linked to dust created by the construction activities: excavations, earthwork, movement of heavy vehicles on unpaved roads and crushing excavated stone. 148 Other sources of air pollution are the unloading of site equipment and plant. The methods adopted by the Group to mitigate these impacts are described below: • regular dampening of unpaved roads accessing work sites, aggregates wetting systems at the crushing plants, the use of filters on the cement storage silos and asphalt production plants, covering lorries transporting powdery materials, tyre washing systems at site entrance points and the replacement of road transport with conveyor belt transport; • preventative and regular maintenance schedules for site plant and vehicles, ongoing replacement of the fleet with more efficient models. The “Climate Change” section provides information on the Group’s energy efficiency actions. Noise and vibrations The aspects relating to noise and vibrations are of double significance for the Group: internally, in terms of the health of workers, and externally, in terms of impacts on the environment and local communities. The Group’s QEHS management system includes specific procedures to assess and monitor these aspects, so that each site can adopt the most appropriate measures to ensure protection of the health and safety of workers (use of personal protection equipment, soundproofing, etc.) and of the surrounding environment. With regard to the effects on the environment surrounding the sites, the areas most affected by noise interference are protected by noise barriers, which can be artificial dunes made of backfill material, support structures and absorption panels made of various materials. The noise barriers can also be one or more rows of trees or shrubs which both absorb the noise and reduce the visual impact. The choice of the barrier depends on its effectiveness, the area in which it will be placed and its landscaping effect. Vibration is also a feature of work at civil engineering sites. The effects of pressure waves that propagate in the soil can cause damage to buildings or other structures located in the vicinity of the works. During the works, periodic monitoring of both noise and vibration is carried out. Biodiversity, cultural heritage and environmental restorations The performance of infrastructure projects requires the implementation of special protection measures when the sites are adjacent to or within sites of special natural, cultural or archaeological interest, so that construction activities interfere as little as possible with the existing ecosystem and heritage. The protection measures, which are implemented in accordance with the local authorities’ provisions and the relevant applicable legislation, are designed to protect and preserve the ecosystem, flora and fauna, biodiversity and cultural/landscape and archaeological heritage of the areas around the sites. With respect to biodiversity, 21% (2018: 5%) of the areas managed by the Group was located in protected areas and 2% (2018: 2%) in areas adjacent to protected areas24 in 2019. 24 The sites (not located within protected areas) in which activities with potential impacts on surrounding protected areas are carried out are considered “adjacent to protected areas”. 149 Specifically, 24 work sites (the equivalent of 44.5 sq km) were located in protected areas (mostly in the US, followed by Italy, the United Arab Emirates and France) and 56 (the equivalent of 4.7 sq km) in areas adjacent to protected areas (mostly in the US, followed by Australia, the United Arab Emirates, France, Italy and Poland). Of these sites, 63 are in areas protected by local regulations, ten in areas protected by national regulations, six in “Natura 2000” areas and one in wetlands included in the Ramsar List. There are 11 work sites located in ecosystems that contain water (e.g., lakes, rivers, swamps, etc.), six in urban ecosystems, nine in agricultural ecosystems, 49 in wood ecosystems, four in mountain ecosystems and one in insular ecosystems. In these areas, construction and plant operation activities are mainly carried out. Contracts performed in areas of special natural or cultural interest require specific procedures to manage the protected species (flora and fauna) and/or areas and any archaeological finds. The Group is assisted by independent experts and involves the local authorities. Once construction has been completed, the areas affected by the work, access roads, plants, installations, quarries and deposits are cleaned up to return the areas to their original conditions in line with the contractual terms and current regulations. These restoration activities facilitate natural revegetation, prevent soil erosion and improve soil stability. Any land reclamation activities, if provided for in the contract and necessary due to previous contamination, are agreed with the clients and performed in line with the competent authorities’ instructions. Environmental restoration activities may include reforestation and indigenous species are usually used. The main restoration activities performed by the Group are shown below: Protection and restoration activities (GRI 304-3) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Reforested area m2 293,281 391,144 188,140 Areas where the topsoil was replaced m2 3,304,357 3,674,094 710,295 The reduction in protection and restoration activities is mostly due to progress on Lane’s contracts (USA). In 2019, the Group carried out reforestation activities mainly for the Koysha project (Ethiopia), the projects of Lane (USA) and the Forrestfield-Airport Link (Australia) planting 5,115 trees. 150 Anti-corruption Zero tolerance Anti-corruption system for corruption ISO 37001 certified Continuous training Whistleblowing on anti-corruption a dedicated platform Internal policies Salini Impregilo has a zero tolerance policy for all types of corruption and is committed to complying with the anti-corruption laws ruling in the countries where it operates. It requires its stakeholders to act with honesty and integrity at all times. The Company never condones behaviour designed to improperly influence the decisions taken by representatives of public or private bodies. The Company is committed to adopting preventive protocols to minimise the risk of corruption and to ensure compliance with the principles introduced by anti-corruption laws and international best practices. These principles are enshrined in its Code of Ethics and reiterated in its Anti-corruption Policy, adopted voluntarily and in compliance with international best practices. Main risks and management methods Salini Impregilo has an Anti-corruption System which meets the ISO 37001 requirements and is certified by an independent certification body. In addition to its Anti-corruption Policy described earlier, the system has the following additional elements: • preparation, updating and application of the Anti-corruption Model approved by the Board of Directors on 16 June 2014 and updated on 28 September 2018; • issue of Guidelines and internal procedures and integration of existing ones to define the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved and the operating methods for the processes and controls defined in the above documents. As part of its zero tolerance policy, the Company seeks to align its strategy with the Anti-corruption System, instilling a compliance culture and mitigating the potential risks of non-compliance. The Board of Directors adopts the Anti-corruption System while the Compliance Unit monitors the Anti-corruption System and its correct application. It draws up an annual Compliance Plan, which sets out the Company’s goals to ensure achievement of the general objectives and ISO 37001 recertification. The Control, Risk and 151 Sustainability Committee, the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Director in charge of the Internal Control System all check the Compliance Plan as does the Integrity Board for the aspects related to Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The Anti-corruption System is designed to cover the risks to which the Company could be exposed. With respect to active corruption, the main risks identified relate to interaction with representatives of the Public administration as part of specific activities, such as, for example, those to comply with defined obligations vis-à-vis the public administration or the obtaining of authorisations from it (licences and permits, payment authorisations from works management or approval of design extensions/variations). Other risks may arise from participation in calls to tender by public bodies, inspections and/or checks or disputes. With respect to active corruption in the private sector, this risk is less material and mostly relates to the Group’s participation in tenders called by private bodies or management of partnerships. The main risks facing the Company arise from procurement and subcontracting activities. During the assignment stage, potential suppliers/subcontractors could attempt to corrupt a company employee to obtain the contract (passive corruption). In addition, once the contract has been signed, the suppliers/subcontractors could act unlawfully to obtain approval and, hence, payment for activities they did not actually perform or the non-reporting of non-compliance of their services. The Compliance Unit performs an anti-corruption risk assessment by specific process for the Company as part of the risk assessments necessary to regularly update the 231 model. The assessment is performed for the other group companies (subsidiaries, consortia, joint ventures, etc.) using a scope defined on the basis of the CPI (corruption perception index) assigned to the country where the Group’s companies operate and depending on how long their compliance system has been in place. Roughly 85% of the legal entities making up Salini Impregilo Group were included in the Anti-corruption risk assessment scope in 2019. The procedures specifically designed to monitor the above risks include the Guidelines for the Assessment of Relevant Third Parties, which define valuation procedures applicable to potential counterparties before a contract is signed. The procedures aim to identify the ethics and professional integrity of the Group’s partners and their compliance with its anti-corruption policies. Parties that pass the due diligence are monitored using the internal systems over the entire term of the contract relationship to ensure that they continue to comply with the initially requested requirements. To complete the due diligence, the Group has specific procedures to monitor conflicts of interest with its employees during the recruiting stage and during any internal transfers within the Group. It plans to update its third party assessment procedures in 2020 to extend their scope. With respect to gifts given to third parties, the Company revised its procedures in 2018 to decrease the spending limits and reinforce the authorisation process in place for sponsorships and donations to monitor these activities and ensure their compliance with the Code of Ethics. 152 Contracts agreed by the Company with Third Parties must include specific measures to ensure their compliance with Anti-corruption laws, the Company’s Code of Ethics and Anti-corruption Model. Salini Impregilo also has a whistleblowing system that can be accessed through an external web portal. This allows employees to make anonymous or confidential (at their own discretion) notifications about potential violations while being protected against any form of reprisal, discrimination or unfair treatment. The Anticorruption Model provides that employees are obliged to report any violations of the Model and/or internal or external regulations, the ethical principles and all anti-corruption laws by the Company, a colleague, a consultant or third party. As of 2018, third parties (e.g., suppliers, subcontractors) can also use the whistleblowing system. Alternatively, notifications can be made by post or email. The Company guarantees the protection of the notifying person in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 179/2017 and Regulation (EU) no. 2016/679 on personal data protection. Violations of the Anti-corruption Model’s principles and measures are a serious breach of their contracts by employees and consultants. Salini Impregilo takes all the steps provided for by the existing laws and contracts in the case of these violations, including conservative disciplinary measures, dismissal, termination of the contractual relationship, claims for compensation, etc.. In 2019, the Company received seven notifications through its whistleblowing channels, of which only one for the potential violations of its anti-corruption procedures. In all cases, the Compliance Unit commenced an investigation assisted by either the Internal Audit Unit or the Legal Unit based on the Company’s internal procedures. During the year, corrective actions were taken involving employees and suppliers, which included the termination of relationships with the Company. The Company requires that all new employees receive the mandatory Anti-corruption training as part of a wider programme about Compliance. In 2019, the Company prepared a training course on relationships with multilateral investment banks and export credit agencies as well as practices that they condone and sanction. Italian and foreign employees who carry out activities related to the issues regulated by these bodies attended this course. The Company also promoted courses on ethics and anti-corruption for contracts where it manages the operating activities: in 2019, the employees of Isarco Scarl (Italy), Salini Impregilo-Healy Company-Jose Chediak UTE (Argentina), PerGenova Scpa (Italy) and Fisia Italimpianti S.p.A. (Italy) all received training. Given the importance of training courses to guide its employees’ conduct, the Company plans to launch a new training programme in 2020 covering the understanding of virtuous conduct to foster an ethical culture, especially as regards the encouragement of reporting possible violations. The Compliance Unit also prepares internal reports for the Board of Directors (every six months), which it addresses to the Control, Risk and Sustainability Committee, as well as ad hoc communications and reports to 153 management, either together with or through the Internal Audit and Compliance Manager, on any critical issues it identifies during its work. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” (sub-paragraph “COCIV consortium” in the “Criminal litigation” paragraph) section of the Directors’ report for ongoing disputes about corruption. 154 Supply chain 15 thousand suppliers >230 thousand hours that worked with Salini Impregilo from 70 HSE training provided to subcontractors’ countries employees Innovation Days Average vendor rating index 80/100 to encourage collaboration with confirming the high quality of the supply innovative suppliers and partners base Internal policies Each year, Salini Impregilo works with thousands of suppliers both for its contracts and internal requirements. As defined in its Code of Ethics, its conduct is hinged on principles of correctness and transparency, and it is committed to not exploiting any conditions of dependence or weakness of its suppliers. The Company selects its suppliers using principles of fairness and impartiality and selection criteria which involve checking their quality, technical/professional qualifications, compliance with standards about human rights, labour regulations, including equal opportunities, health, safety and the environment as well as prices. Suppliers are required to formally accept the Code of Ethics, the Anti-corruption Model and, starting from 2020, the Suppliers Code of Conduct, which are integral parts of the contract. Salini Impregilo encourages its suppliers to apply the same criteria when selecting their subcontractors and also to pass on the Group’s principles of integrity, correctness, reliability and sustainability in order to encourage and promote compliance with its principles along the entire supply chain. The Company is committed to protecting the confidentiality of the corporate information and professional knowhow and asks its counterparties to do likewise. When Salini Impregilo manages contracts directly or as the project leader, or there are specific agreements in place, the suppliers are required, to the extent of their involvement, to comply with/adopt the Company’s Quality, Environment, Health and Safety Management Systems. Main risks and management methods In 2019, the Group worked with around 15 thousand suppliers from over 70 countries. The main supply categories related to subcontracts, materials, machinery and equipment and services. An inadequate functioning of the qualification process and/or assessment of the suppliers’ performance or the possible abuse of a strong position vis-à-vis smaller suppliers could possibly expose the Group to various risks as part of its procurement process, such as compliance, reputation and commercial. 155 The main risks arising from external factors include potential risks of non-compliance related to regulation updates that make it necessary to adopt new measures with suppliers, commercial and reputation risks due to possible issues with suppliers (e.g., inadequate performance in technical, qualitative, safety, environmental areas, etc.) after the contract has been signed. The Company has established a number of procedures to manage the procurement of goods and services and monitor these risks. They include definition of the roles, responsibilities and checks to be performed to ensure that the operating activities are performed in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations, the Company’s Code of Ethics, the 231 Model and the Anti-corruption Model. The supplier qualification procedure is an important part of the procurement process. Its aim is to assess whether the potential supplier meets the Company’s criteria so that it can be included in the Vendor List. This qualification procedure also ensures that the Group’s requirements are met for all goods categories and in all relevant geographical areas. The Procurement Department manages the supplier qualification process, which involves a number of preliminary checks of the potential supplier’s reputation, its expertise and that it is not already included in the Reference Lists. Potential suppliers are required to fill in a questionnaire on areas such as: business and production category, organisation and shareholder structure, financial reporting, registration and certifications, quality, the environment and safety, social responsibility (including human rights), specific information about their goods categories (when available). Based on these questionnaires, the Procurement Department may proceed with specific analyses and detailed checks, which can include assessment visits to the supplier’s production units and offices. Other company departments, such as the Technical Services and Safety, Environment and Systems Departments, may also participate in the visits which are designed to assess the supplier’s technical and operating capabilities with special regard to the products and services of interest to the Group. They also investigate those aspects that could affect the potential partner’s ability to comply with its contractual commitments. Additional risk analyses are performed for certain suppliers that fall into the counterparty risk category using the methods and tools defined by the Risk Management Unit. Upon completion of the checks, suppliers found to be suitable for qualification are included in the suppliers register and the relevant Vendor List. Certain contracts require adoption of a specific additional qualification system depending on the applicable regulatory and contractual requirements. For example, suppliers working on projects subject to LEED environmental certification are subjected to additional checks to verify their compliance with specific environmental parameters, while other specific requirements, such as social criteria, are checked for projects acquired in some countries. These may include checking potential suppliers whose workforce mainly consists of employees from special categories (e.g., ethnic minorities). In 2019, the Corporate Procurement Department vetted all the new 4,990 suppliers to verify their integrity, classification of their know-how and reference lists. 156 Contracts with suppliers include provisions requiring them to comply with the applicable regulations, the Code of Ethics, the 231 Model and the Anti-corruption Model as well as quality, health and safety and environment requirements. The contracts have specific termination clauses if the suppliers do not comply therewith. Once the contract has been signed and is effective, the Company monitors the performance of its key suppliers using a special assessment process, involving the head office’s Procurement Department and the contract managers. It assesses suppliers once a year. In 2019, these assessments involved more than 16 contracts selected for their financial relevance. They covered nearly all the suppliers of the analysed contracts (response rate of above 95%) included in the assessment scope, showing average performances (measured using the IVR vendor rating index) of above 80/100, confirming the high quality of the Group’s supply base. The assessment process is flanked by the on-site monitoring of projects by the local QEHS Departments, which mainly cover subcontractors and is designed to check that their activities comply with the Company’s quality standards and applicable requirements for the environment, health and safety. Specifically, the local QEHS Departments regularly audit the subcontractors. Any non-compliance is managed in accordance with the management system procedures and includes the agreement of improvement plans and follow-up checks to ensure that they are implemented. Involvement of the subcontractors in these issues also takes the form of regular coordination meetings and the participation of their employees in classroom and on-site QEHS training courses (230,002 hours in 2019). In addition to involving and monitoring suppliers at the work sites, the Company also interacted with them at central level during the year. This includes the annual supplier meeting attended by the Group’s Italian and international employees and suppliers when the main procurement practices are presented. The Company presented, inter alia, the results of the vetting process and the assessment of suppliers’ performances during the 2019 meeting to emphasise the importance to the Company of developing long-term relationships that allow the suppliers to grow and ensure their constant improvement. The Company continued its Innovation Days in 2019, which are appointments with individual suppliers attended by head office employees. They are an opportunity for the supplier and the Company to discuss their experiences about new technologies, products, innovative processes and other matters of mutual interest. 157 Social 69% 94% direct employees hired locally local procurement 6 >16,000 jobs created for each direct group free healthcare check-ups at work site clinics employee Internal policies It is a well-known fact that the direct relationship between investments in infrastructure and greater domestic demand leverages economic growth. Construction companies engaged in building infrastructure may contribute to this factor by adopting suitable internal policies. Salini Impregilo is committed to contributing to the social and economic development of the areas where it operates in line with its Code of Ethics and Sustainability Policy, through: • employment of workers from the area in which the projects are taking place, when available in the numbers required and who have the necessary skills; • professional training of local personnel; • procurement strategies designed to meet requirements using local supplies as far as possible, depending on the availability of the required goods and services; • initiatives to assist the local communities, after checking the integrity and respectability of the recipients and the projects’ consistency with the Code of Ethics. The Company is also committed to respecting the rights and culture of the local communities which it does by also using appropriate communication channels in line with the relevant regulatory and contractual provisions. Main risks and management methods The Group identifies the risks and defines methods to manage the social aspects described in this section (hiring of local labour and procurement, relations with the local stakeholders) during the start-up stage of its projects. The project start-up process complies with the Project Management principles (ISO 21500) and entails the proactive involvement of the project team and the corporate departments to ensure the integrated management of internal and external factors. 158 Specifically, regulatory and contractual elements applicable to the project are analysed during this process and the Company defines the Mobilisation programme which includes the main activities needed to start the project. They include definition of the work schedule, which comprises, inter alia: • the requirement plan for machinery, plant, subcontractors, third parties, materials and services; • the mobilisation plan for managers, staff and blue collars. The methods of managing relations with local stakeholders are defined in the contracts and the Group is obliged to scrupulously abide by their provisions. Employment created by the Group’s projects The creation of jobs by the Group in the countries where it operates is important as it enables local personnel to improve their skills and expertise and to generate additional wealth for the economy. This approach also creates the opportunity for the Group to create a pool of qualified workers who can be used for future projects. Some projects have special local personnel recruitment plans as provided for contractually, which may include employment targets. Specifically, 69% of the 24,526 direct employees were hired locally. Direct employees hired locally Unit 2017 2018 2019 Africa % 95% 95% 96% Europe % 86% 86% 84% Americas % 97% 96% 96% Asia and Oceania % 14% 21% 26% Average % 70% 65% 69% The Asia and Oceania area increased its average numbers but has the smallest percentage of local workers. This is affected by the projects in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates), where insufficient resources are available to perform the contracts making it necessary to bring in labour from other countries. Reference should be made to the section on “Human rights” for information about the management of migrant workers. In 2019, local managers made up 70% of the total, reaching 88% in Europe and 76% in the Americas. In addition to the direct workforce, the involvement of indirect personnel (mainly employees of subcontractors and service providers) contributes significantly to the employment generated locally. Indirect workers involved in group projects numbered 24,849 at 31 December 2019. Local procurement Purchases from suppliers resident in the countries where the Group operates are the main trigger to developing ancillary industries (which is a direct contributor to GDP, public revenue and disposable income). In 2019, the Group maintained a strong relationship with its local supplier chain, with roughly 94% of its expenditure made with local suppliers. 159 Local procurement (GRI 204-1) Unit 2017 2018 2019 Africa % 40% 38% 42% Europe % 90% 87% 97% Americas % 99% 99% 99% Asia and Oceania % 86% 96% 93% Average % 88% 93% 94% As already noted, the use of local suppliers allows the Group to minimise long-distance transport and, hence, mitigate the related environmental effect. Contributions to local economies Direct contributions made by Salini Impregilo’s projects to local economies include employment and the use of local suppliers. They are only part of the benefits as they do not include the additional indirect and induced effect of the Group’s activities in the countries where it operates. The Group has developed a proprietary calculation model, SEED (Socio-Economic Effects Determination) model, to calculate its total contribution (direct, indirect and induced) to a country’s economic and social growth in terms of employment, GDP, tax revenues and work income distributed to families25. The following graph presents the SEED model. The income provided to local C households generates O N Induced Contribution T The purchases from local suppliers generate R I Indirect B The operational activities carried out at country level Contribution U generate T I Direct O Contribution N Contribution due to Contribution due to the Contribution due to local business operations activation of the supply household expenditures chain If just the Group’s main markets26 are considered, its average contribution to their economies, expressed as a multiple, is as follows: • 6 jobs created for each direct Salini Impregilo employee; 25 The SEED model uses an analysis of the investments made by the Group in the local economy and applies specific multipliers taken from the Social Accounting Matrix published by leading international research bodies. 26 Australia, Ethiopia, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, USA 160 • €3.0 of work income distributed for each Euro paid by the Group; • €2.6 of GDP for each Euro of added value generated by Salini Impregilo; • €4.1 of tax revenues for each Euro paid by the Group to the public administration. These figures confirm that the Group’s local investment policies have a significant knock-on effect on the economies of the countries where it operates. In addition to the economic benefits to the countries, each person involved in a group project benefits in terms of the work income received and the opportunity to advance professionally thanks to the training received. Many studies27 have shown that professional training courses provided by companies generate significant benefits for the participating employees who thus potentially have better employment and career prospects, higher salaries, greater professional satisfaction, more flexibility and interest in receiving additional training. This can also have a positive effect on the employee’s health, social inclusion and their willingness to invest in further education for themselves and their children, triggering intergenerational social mobility mechanisms. In this respect, the Group provided 482,358 hours of training to its direct employees and those of its subcontractors in 2019. Initiatives to assist local areas The Group contributes to developing the areas in which it works through initiatives to assist the local communities, which may include sponsorships, social and philanthropic initiatives. Sponsorships and donations are managed in line with the specific guidelines and internal procedures that are part of the Anti-corruption System, which is ISO 37001 certified. This ensures that any assistance is in line with the approved budgets and is only given after the positive outcome of checks of the potential recipients. The Group Guidelines require that assistance is given locally in five strategic macro-sectors: social, art and culture, education and research, environment, sport and entertainment. The main initiatives carried out can be classified as follows: • direct assistance to design and build infrastructure benefitting the local community such as, for example, schools, healthcare facilities, roads, etc.; • assistance with social programmes, carried out directly or through other organisations in the above macro-sectors; • free access to certain work site facilities such as clinics, water and electricity supply networks for local communities living in rural areas not connected to basic services. The Group carried out 42 initiatives in 2019 for €0.8 million (2018: roughly €4.4 million). The reduction in investments is mainly due to the sale of Lane’s Plants & Paving Division in the US. As it works in a continuous business, it promotes ongoing initiatives to the benefit of its local communities. 27 For example, Vocational education and training is good for you. The social benefits of VET for individuals. European centre for the Development of Vocational Training, 2011. 161 Most of the initiatives took place in Italy, mainly for cultural and educational purposes, and Ethiopia, mostly of a social nature. Other initiatives include the free healthcare provided to local communities by work site clinics in Ethiopia, Tajikistan and Kuwait. Specifically, 10,935 medical check-ups (2018: 9,182) were given and 16,049 health interventions (2018: 11,764). Pursuant to the principles of its Code of Ethics, the Company does not make contributions to political and trade organisations of any kind (parties, movements, committees, etc.) nor their representatives. Stakeholder engagement Salini Impregilo has operations and projects all around the world and handles thousands of contacts with its stakeholders every day. It regularly maps its stakeholders based on engagement with the main stakeholders in the areas where it operates. The following chart lists the stakeholders relevant to the Company, the areas of interest and the key characteristics of the engagement with the Group. Level of Area of interest Relationship length engagement Short-medium term Interest International Anti-corruption Environment Employees and human rights Supply chain Long term Project life Stakeholder Local Social Ad-hoc Employees & Trade unions Shareholders & Investors Clients & Potential clients Suppliers, contractors, subcontractors & partners Local communities & NGO Governments & public administrations Sector associations & media The Group adopts diversified and flexible dialogue and engagement practices depending on the stakeholders’ characteristics and needs. At corporate level, key stakeholders include investors, clients, current and potential employees, national and international trade unions, partners, public administrations, the media and the general public. Dialogue with them mainly relates to development objectives and strategies, results, the acquisition of new contracts, the shareholder structure, career paths and professional development. At operating level, the main engagement activities depend on the individual project’s characteristics. The key stakeholders are partners, employees, local communities, suppliers, contractors and subcontractors, clients, local authorities and organisations like local trade unions and non-governmental organisations. 162 Like in previous years, the Group has engaged regularly in engagement with its stakeholders. Its main initiatives are summarised below: Channel Activity Face to face communication Meetings, presentations, focus >10,300 people involved in more than 260 meetings with the local groups, workshops, interviews, communities and their representatives consultations, career days, public >3,700 people visited the Group’s projects during roughly 200 open events door events >2.2 million people were involved in over 530 information campaigns about the Group’s projects Digital communication Company websites, intranet, 1.5 million visits to the Group’s website magazines, webinars, surveys, social 1.2 million interactions on the Group’s social channels media Given that it mainly operates as a contractor on behalf of public and private clients, the Group is required to scrupulously adhere to the contractual provisions about engagement with local stakeholders. These provisions establish the roles and responsibilities each party is obliged to comply with. In line with these provisions, the Group defines procedures to handle engagement with local stakeholders (such as, for example, the grievance mechanisms) and the communication channels to be used at work sites either physical (e.g., public relations offices) or technological (dedicated phone numbers, websites, email addresses, etc.). The clients are responsible for engagement with the local communities in most of the ongoing contracts while the Group provides technical and operating assistance to manage any issues that arise. Matters discussed by contract personnel and the local communities mostly relate to: • employment and interaction between the work site and surrounding areas; • the characteristics of the work under construction and its possible social and environmental implications. As described in detail in the section “The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role”, the Group’s clients are responsible for planning and developing projects. When required by the applicable regulations, this includes an assessment of the social and environmental impacts, the prior consultation of the stakeholders, definition of the mitigation and compensation actions and receipt of the authorisations. Therefore, the clients have sole responsibility for handling relations with the stakeholders for the second category of topics mentioned earlier, while the Group provides assistance with management of the relationships covering the first category of topics. This is a potential source of risks for the Group as, if the client does not properly and efficiently manage its responsibilities, the local community could oppose the project leading to delays in the works, an increase in 163 costs and damage to the Group’s reputation as well. The Group constantly monitors stakeholder expectations about the projects it is involved in so that it can take the actions necessary to mitigate any risks. Should the Group receive requests for information or other communications from stakeholders, such as international non-profit organisations and SRI analysts, it provides the requested information to guarantee transparency about its work as a contractor engaged to build the works provided for by the relevant contract, with a clear-cut distinction between its role and responsibilities and those of its client. 164 Methodology for reporting non-financial information Salini Impregilo was the first Italian construction company to prepare and publish an Environmental Report in 2002 and similarly it was the first to publish a Sustainability Report drawn up in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines in 2009. Standards applied This 2019 Consolidated Non-financial Statement has been prepared in accordance with Legislative decree no. 254/2016. The Company has used the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (Core option), published by the GRI. This Statement also constitutes the Communication on Progress (COP) to Global Compact. The infrastructure sector and Salini Impregilo’s role The infrastructure market is highly regulated and its numerous operators are involved in planning, assessing, approving, developing, building and operating infrastructure according to their roles and responsibilities assigned by the relevant regulations. The following chart shows the main stages of an infrastructure project’s life cycle: STAGES OPERATIONS & PLANNING DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERING* PROCUREMENT* CONSTRUCTION* MAINTENANCE* ACTIVITIES • Site selection for projects and preliminary design of the layout • Social and • Procurement of environmental impact the production assessments and • Government inputs needed to consultations with • Works planning perform the stakeholders, ifr • Works design • Performance of management (infrastructure contract activities: provided for • Engineering of the construction • Maintenance and master plan, local • Plant and • Drawing up of plans to the construction works provided for upgrading plans, etc.) machinery manage and mitigate processes in the contract • Discontinuation • Private sector • Materials and social and and dismantling investment plans services environmental • Labour impacts • Subcontracts • Acquisitions of the necessary permits and authorizations • Contractor selection procedure PARTIES INVOLVED • Project • Project proponents proponents • Selected • Contractor (if • Project • Public decision• Selected contractors provided for in the proponents • Selected makers contractors (if • Subcontractor tender contract) • Public contractors • Private investors provided for in s • Other parties authorities the tender engaged by the contract) Project proponents * Main stages of the infrastructure’s life cycle in which Salini Impregilo Group is involved 165 An infrastructure project is planned by a public administration or private sector body (the project proponent) that is also involved in the subsequent stages of developing the infrastructure project. This stage involves a number of activities that include identifying the project locations, performing feasibility studies and, based on the type of work and applicable legislation, completing the social and environmental procedures (assessment of potential impacts, consultations with stakeholders, identification of mitigation measures and compensation). The public authorities (usually ministries or state environmental protection agencies, assisted by local bodies of the area where the project is to take place) actively engage in these procedures: assessing the adequacy of the social and environmental impact assessments, the consultation programmes and mitigation plans prepared by the Project proponent. Upon completion of these procedures, the relevant authorities issue the appropriate authorisations, which include any social and environmental requirements the Project proponent has to abide by during the project. Contractors such as Salini Impregilo enter the project development process only after the decision-making stage has been completed as this only involves the client and the public authorities. The Group takes part in selection procedures, organised by public and private clients to award the tenders, which may cover specific project activities (e.g., just construction), the entire engineering, procurement and construction cycle or also the subsequent operations & maintenance activities. Therefore, the contractor does not take part in any activities prior to the assigning of the contract or the prior assessment processes, including the assessment of the project’s social and environmental impacts and consultation of stakeholders. As described earlier, these assessments are the sole responsibility of the Project proponent and of the public authorities, as they are required to meet the relevant obligations under the applicable regulations. They also have the decision-making powers about the findings of the assessment process. It follows that the potential social and environmental impacts of the work itself (e.g., loss of biodiversity due to the infrastructure’s presence, expropriation of land) are the sole responsibility of the Project proponent. The contractor is obliged to comply with the social and environmental requirements of the applicable regulations, the contract and any provisions imposed by the competent authorities when they approve the impact assessments. The social and environmental impacts attributable to the contractor arise solely from the contract activities and are mainly of a temporary nature (e.g., disruptions caused by the work site, health and safety in the workplace). Materiality analysis The Company performed a materiality analysis as set out in the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards to define the individual topics to be disclosed in the Non-financial Statement pursuant to Legislative decree no. 254/2016. The main steps comprising this analysis are set out below: • internal identification of the possible non-financial topics relevant to the Group, by analysing the global situation (megatrends, the Paris Agreement, SGD), the market scenario (peers), the financial context (reports published by analysts and ESG rating agencies) and applicable standards; 166 • internal prioritisation of the identified topics, in line with the Company’s Sustainability Strategy and policies; • engagement with the stakeholders with two separate surveys, one for middle management and one for employees, clients, suppliers, investors, NGOs and ESG experts; • approval of the material topics by management involved in non-financial reporting. The materiality matrix is included in the Introduction sector. The material aspects identified by the materiality analysis, grouped into the macro categories provided for by Legislative decree no. 254/2016 are listed below: Topics as per Materiality outside the Leg. decree no. GRI related material aspects Materiality within the Group Group 254/2016 Materials, Energy, Water, Biodiversity, Direct activities performed Activities performed Environment Emissions, Waste and Environmental at the offices and work by subcontractors and compliance sites service providers Employment, Industrial relations, Health and Direct activities performed Activities performed Employees safety, Training, Diversity and equal at the offices and work by subcontractors and opportunities* and Non-discrimination sites service providers Freedom of association and collective Activities performed bargaining, Child labour, Forced or Direct activities performed Human rights by subcontractors and compulsory labour, Security practices and at the work sites service providers Rights of indigenous peoples Activities performed Direct activities performed by the third parties Anti-corruption Anti-corruption at the offices and work defined in the Antisites corruption Model Direct activities performed Activities performed Supplier environmental assessment, Supply chain at the offices and work by subcontractors and Supplier assessment for impacts on society sites service providers Market presence, Procurement practices, Direct activities performed Activities performed Social Local communities and Indirect economic at the offices and work by clients and impacts sites subcontractors *The equal opportunities topic is material mostly for the corporate offices while it is of less significance at the work sites given the characteristics of the construction sector, which is a predominantly male domain. A new material topic was identified during the procedure to update the materiality analysis, which was not present in the previous Statement: Innovation. It is not included in the previous table as this is not required by Legislative decree no. 254/2016 or the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. However, this Statement includes the topic as required by the latter Standards. 167 Scope of the Statement As established by article 4 of Legislative decree no. 254/2016, this Consolidated Non-financial Statement includes the figures of the parent (Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) and its fully-consolidated subsidiaries. The parent comprises its head offices in Italy (corporate), the directly run work sites, branches and joint operations for which it manages their operations, as per the list provided later in this document. The Company has an internal procedure in place to define and regularly review the scope of the Statement based on its consolidation scope for financial reporting purposes. Specifically, it performs a materiality analysis on the list of entities making up the parent and fully-comprised subsidiaries considering the level of operations of the individual entities, which are classified as: • operational (e.g., ongoing contracts); • limited operations (e.g., contracts being completed); • non-operational (e.g., entity in liquidation). This Statement’s scope includes entities classified as “operational” and “limited operations”. A list of the entities included in the 2019 Statement’s scope for which a non-financial reporting system was implemented is given below: 168 Name Country Name Country Salini Impregilo S.p.A.* Italy Impregilo-Sk E&C-Galfar Al Misnad JV* Qatar Brennero Galleriacque S.c.r.l.* Italy Imprepar S.p.A.* Italy CDE S.c.a.r.l.* Italy Kayi Salini Samsung JV Turkey Cigla Construtora Impregilo y Associados Brazil Lane Industries Incorporated* USA S.A.* COCIV consortium* Italy Mercovia S.A.* Argentina Constructora Ariguani SAS* Colombia Salini Australia PTY L.t.d.* Australia Copenhagen Metro Team I/S* Denmark Salini Impregilo NRW Joint Venture* Australia Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A.

The other entities have been included in the reporting scope of this Statement for the first time. Contracts managed directly by the parent include the Meydan One Mall (United Arab Emirates), the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (Ethiopia), the Koysha Dam (Ethiopia), the Expressway S7 Skomielna (Poland), Bumbuna O&M (Sierra Leone), Urban Roads (Sierra Leone) and the Rogun Dam (Tajikistan). The joint 169 operations for which the Group manages their operations are the Arriyad New Mobility Consortium (Saudi Arabia), Civil Works Joint Ventures (Saudi Arabia), South Al Mutlaa Joint Venture (Kuwait) and Salini Impregilo NGE Genie Civil (France). More information on the in-scope entities is available in the section on the “Consolidation scope” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The information in this Statement refers to the above scope. The data for the joint operations led by the Group are shown at 100%. Exceptions to the scope are listed below: • data about the anti-corruption risk assessment refer to the consolidation scope of the consolidated financial statements; • data about the labour force relate to the consolidation scope of the consolidated financial statements; with respect to the direct workforce, they are calculated in proportion to the Group's investment for the entities that qualify as joint operations or that are measured using the equity method; • the environmental data does not include the offices (Milan, Rome and foreign branches) as they are not material; • data about health and safety of workers and QEHS training include the companies that are not fully consolidated for which the Group manages their operations and exclude joint operations when its partners are responsible for management of the Health and Safety Systems; Any specific limitations to the scope are specified in the text or in the GRI Content Index. The 2017 and 2018 corresponding information relates to the scope of the Group’s 2018 Consolidated Nonfinancial Statement, to which reference should be made. The data relating to the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions of 2017 and 2018 were restated considering just Scope 1 and 2 while the 2018 Statement also included Scope 3 emissions. Calculation method The data and information in this Statement are taken from the Group’s information systems and a special nonfinancial reporting system introduced to meet the requirements of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 and the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards. The data were processed using accurate calculations and, if specified, estimates. The methods used to calculate the main indicators are set out below. Injury rates The injury rates are calculated using the methods established by standard UNI 7249 “Statistics on occupational injuries”. They show the number of injuries leading to lost work days (LTIFR) and the number of recordable injuries for every million hours worked (TRFR). 170 Specifically, the LTIFR (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) is calculated as the ratio of the total number of injuries leading to absence from work in the period (including death) to the total number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000. The TRFR (Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate) is calculated as the ratio of total recordable injuries (calculated considering deaths, injuries leading to absence from work, injuries only requiring medical treatment and injuries leading to assignment of reduced workloads in countries where this is allowed) to the total number of hours worked, multiplied by 1,000,000. Any commuting injuries during the period are not considered. Energy consumption and GHG emissions The calculation of direct energy consumption is based on the conversion factors provided by the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy BEIS (2016 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting). Internal energy consumption refers to the in-scope entities’ direct activities. Indirect energy consumption, like scope 3 emissions, refer to activities performed by subcontractors. The Group monitors its emissions data using an operating control approach. Calculations of the Group’s GHG emissions are based on: • the emission factors defined by the standard parameters of the UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy – BEIS (2016 Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting) for fuel consumption the calculation includes CO2, CH4 and N2O gases; • the emission factors provided by the International Energy Agency (CO2 Emissions from Fuel Combustion, 2013 edition, 2011 data) for electric energy consumption; • the emission factors provided by the IPCC (Fourth Assessment Report AR4 100yr) to convert CH 4 and N2O into CO2 equivalent. The energy intensity rates and the GHG emission rates are calculated by comparing the total data (energy consumption and GHG emissions) to revenue for the period. Specifically, the intensity rate for GHG emissions includes the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Water use Data about water not taken from aqueducts, not obtained from other sources (e.g., water tanks) and not measured using meters are calculated considering the withdrawal systems’ capacity (pump capacity in the average number of working hours) or production activity performed in the period. Waste The data refers to waste generated by the in-scope contracts in line with the locally-applicable regulations. When the data is expressed as a volume, the related weight is calculated using specific conversion factors. Information 171 about the allocation methods for EU projects (i.e., how the waste is treated: recovery or disposal) is based on its legal classification. The methods used for non-EU projects reflect the conditions of the contracts agreed with third party waste management companies. 172 GRI Content Index UN Global Description, page number, reference to other sections of the Report or other documents Disclosure Compact (The page numbers refer to the paragraph that includes the information) Principles GRI 102 General disclosures (2016) Organisational profile 102-1 Name of the organisation: Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services: p. 10 102-3 Location of headquarters: Milan, Italy 102-4 Location of operations: p. 34 Ownership and legal form: Salini Impregilo S.p.A is listed on the Milan stock exchange and is managed and 102-5 coordinated by Salini Costruttori S.p.A.. 102-6 Markets served: p. 34 102-7 Scale of the organisation: p. 68, p.34, p. 109 6 Information on employees and other workers: p.109.

More information about the corporate governance system pursuant to article 123-bis of the Consolidated Finance Act (Legislative decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998, as subsequently amended) is available in the Report on corporate governance and the ownership structure, published on the parent’s website in the governance section (www.salini-impregilo.com). 184 Events after the reporting date New notes successfully priced for €250 million with a seven-year maturity and a 3.625% coupon On 17 January 2020, Salini Impregilo announced the final results of its invitation to the holders of the outstanding notes “€600,000,000 3.75 per cent. Notes due 24 June 2021” (ISIN: XS1435297202) (the “2021 notes”) to exchange their 2021 notes for Euro-dominated senior fixed rate notes to be issued by the parent (the “new notes”) (the “exchange offer”) and their conditions. The average nominal amount of the 2021 notes validly offered for exchange is €120,970,000. The aggregate nominal amount of the new notes to be issued is €250,000,000. The new notes will include notes not issued for exchange of €123,341,000 (the “additional new notes”) and demand was roughly four times higher than the offer. The additional new notes will be issued at identical terms (including their listing on the Euronext Dublin and trading on its regulated market). They will be part of a single series with the other new notes. The new notes’ maturity date is 28 January 2027 and the coupon is 3.625%. The settlement date for the exchange offer, including the additional new notes, is 28 January 2020. The results show the international and national financial community’s strong appreciation of Salini Impregilo and a positive response to its growth strategy, including Progetto Italia. The transaction is part of the parent’s plan to optimise its debt profile, extending its average debt repayment dates and maintaining a low corporate debt cost Banca Akros S.p.A. Gruppo Banco BPM, Banca IMI, BofA Securities, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs International, Natixis and Unicredit Bank were the joint lead managers, while BBVA, Equita SIM amd MPS Capital Services Banca per le Imprese S.p.A. acted as co-managers of the exchange offer. COVID-19 pandemic The Group is closely analysing and monitoring the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic with respect to: (i) changes in its reference context and the measures adopted in the countries where it operates; (ii) relations with clients and partners; (iii) impacts on its projects due to the changed availability of internal and external resources and/or other circumstances and events directly or indirectly related to the pandemic; (iv) triggering of specific contract clauses; and (v) service performance levels and continuity by suppliers, subcontractors and partners. Accordingly, it has set up a crisis unit which assesses the situation daily to define and adapt processes for the prevention and containment of any critical situations at the work sites. The Group has introduced a series of measures at all organisational levels in its head office, abroad and in the work sites to safeguard the health and safety of its employees and consultants in compliance with the guidance provided by the authorities of the various countries. It will guarantee the continuity of its activities, as far as possible, to build those works that are strategic and essential for the community and its clients. 185 Specifically, the Group has introduced all the necessary procedures to safeguard the health and safety of workers with the distribution of appropriate personal protective equipment, intensification of sanitisation activities of the work environments at work sites and the adoption of suitable measures to ensure correct social distancing in the workplace. It has introduced remote work for nearly all its office staff in Italy. All business trips and travel have been cancelled and are only to be undertaken in exceptional circumstances to guarantee operating requirements when this cannot be postponed, in full compliance however with the limitations imposed by the competent authorities. Salini Impregilo has also agreed an insurance policy that includes a daily allowance and professional posthospital care services for all its employees who require hospitalisation as a result of being diagnosed with the Coronavirus. With respect to financial stress scenarios, the parent regularly monitors the Group’s current and expected liquidity. The Group has cash and cash equivalents of over €1,000,000,000 as shown in its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 as well as revolving credit facilities of €550,000,000. The parent does not have to make large debt repayments in 2020 or the first half of 2021 as it recently renegotiated the contract terms of its borrowings with major banks as part of Progetto Italia. Its new repayment plans provide for the final instalments to be repaid in 2025. In addition, in January 2020, the parent placed new notes worth €250,000,000 on the market, part of which were exchanged with the outstanding “€600,000,000 3.75 per cent. Notes due 24 June 2021” issue (the “2021 notes”) for €120,970,000, and part of which were subscribed by new investors (“additional new notes”) for €123,341,000. The new notes’ maturity date is 28 January 2027 and the coupon is 3.625%. The next repayment dates of the parent’s corporate debt for the three note issues outstanding at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements are in June 2021, October 2024 and January 2027. Due to the rapid and continuous changes in the reference context, it is difficult to quantify the duration or impact that the virus’ outbreak may have on the Group’s future commercial and operating activities and, therefore, on its financial position, financial performance and cash flows in 2020. As a result, Salini Impregilo will update its outlook for 2020 when it has more information to hand. As a global provider of engineering solutions and contractor for infrastructure works, Salini Impregilo is affected by the future investment decisions of its clients in its various business areas (Sustainable Mobility, Clean Hydro Energy, Clean Water and Green Buildings): strategic sectors and potential drivers of the economic recovery of many countries. 186 Main risk factors and uncertainties In addition to the areas outlined in the “Business risk management” section above, the following specific situations linked to major outstanding disputes, country risk exposure and situations characterised by risk and/or uncertainty profiles at 31 December 2019, should be added to the universe of risk events that may potentially impact on operations. Civil litigation USW Campania projects The Group became involved in the urban solid waste disposal projects in the Province of Naples and other provinces in Campania at the end of the 1990’s through its subsidiaries Fibe and Fibe Campania. The major issues that have characterised the Group’s activities in service contracts since 1999-2000, which have been discussed in detail and reviewed in all of the reports published by the Group starting from that time, have evolved and became more complex over the years, giving rise to a large range of disputes, some of which are major and in part still ongoing. Even given the positive developments, the general situation in terms of pending disputes is still very complex. A brief overview is provided below, especially in relation to existing risk positions. Since Fibe Campania S.p.A. was merged into Fibe S.p.A. in 2009, unless otherwise stated, reference is made exclusively to Fibe S.p.A. in the rest of this section, even with regard to positions and events that affected the merged company. The USW Campania issue comprises various proceedings in different jurisdictions and pending at different court levels. The main aspects of the key civil, administrative and criminal proceedings are described below. Civil proceedings 1. In May 2005, the government commissioner filed a motion requesting compensation from Fibe S.p.A. (“Fibe”) and FISIA Italimpianti S.p.A. (now FISIA Ambiente S.p.A., “Fisia Ambiente”) for alleged damage of about €43 million. During the hearing, the commissioner increased its claims to approximately €700 million, further to the additional claim for damage to its reputation, calculated to be €1,000 million. The companies appeared before the court and, in addition to disputing the claims made by the government commissioner, filed a counterclaim requesting compensation for damage due to contract default and sundry expenses for over €650 million, plus a further claim for reputation damage quantified at €1.5 billion. In the same proceeding, the banks that issued Fibe and Fibe Campania S.p.A.’s (“Fibe Campania”) performance bonds to the government commissioner also requested the commissioner’s claim be dismissed and, in any case, to be held harmless by Salini Impregilo (at the time, Impregilo), which appeared before the court and disputed the bank’s requests. In ruling no. 4253/2011, the judge declared their lack of jurisdiction referring the case to the administrative judge. The attorney general filed an appeal which was rejected on 14 February 2019 and the first level ruling was upheld. 187 2. On 30 November 2015, the Office of the Prime Minister received a new claim form served by both Fibe and other group companies involved in various ways in the activities performed in Campania for the waste disposal service, containing claims for the damage suffered as a result of termination of the contracts in 2005. The total amount claimed is €2,429 million. Considering that some requests are already included in other proceedings, the net amount is €2,258 million. The Office of the Prime Minister filed a counterclaim for €845 million for reasons already included in other proceedings. The court appointed an expert to appraise the subordinated claim filed by Fibe that prepared two alternative appraisals of the amount due to Fibe of approximately €56 million or approximately €114 million. The competent judge handed down the ruling on 25 October 2019, finding that Fibe was due approximately €114 million and the Office of the Prime Minister approximately €80 million. After offsetting the two amounts, the Office of the Prime Minister was ordered to pay Fibe approximately €34 million plus interest accruing from 4 December 2015. At the date of preparation of this report, Fibe is preparing its appeal to this ruling and is reasonably certain that most of its requests will be accepted. 3. There is another proceeding commenced by the Office of the Prime Minister for the return of the advance of approximately €52 million paid for the construction of the waste-to-energy plants (“WtE plants”). Fibe has claimed that the receivables due from the Office of the Prime Minister, mostly for work performed on its behalf and for the fees due to Fibe, would offset this advance. The first level hearing ended with ruling no. 4658/2019 in which the Naples Court only allowed part of Fibe’s receivables (the fees already collected by the Office of the Prime Minister) for offsetting purposes, ordering the company to return the difference between the advance collected and the receivables allowed for offsetting, with the result that Fibe owed roughly €10 million, plus interest, to the Office of the Prime Minister. This ruling is contrary to the report prepared by the court-appointed expert which found that Fibe was due the entire amount of its receivables. Fibe has filed its appeal. The above amount (approximately €10 million) could be offset against Fibe’s larger receivable of €52,955 million plus interest as per the ruling described in the section on the administrative proceedings the USW Campania projects below. Given the complexity and range of the different disputes disclosed in the previous sections, the Group cannot exclude that events may arise in the future that cannot currently be foreseen which might require changes to these assessments. Panama Canal extension project Certain critical issues arose during the first stage of full-scale production on the project to expand the Panama Canal which, due to their specific characteristics and the materiality of the work to which they relate, made it necessary to significantly negatively revise the estimates made during the early phases of the project. The most critical issues related, inter alia, to the geological characteristics of the excavation areas, specifically with respect to the raw materials required to produce concrete and the processing of such raw materials during normal production activities. Additional problems arose due to the adoption by the customer of operational and management procedures substantially different from those contractually agreed, specifically with regard to the processes for the approval of technical and design solutions suggested by the contractor. These facts, which were the subject of specific disclosures in previous reports published by the Group, continued in 2013 and 2014. 188 Faced with the customer’s persistent unwillingness to reasonably implement appropriate, contractually provided for measures to manage such disputes, the contractor and thus the original contracting partners was forced to acknowledge the resulting impossibility to continue the construction activities needed to complete the project at its full and exclusive risk by undertaking the relevant full financial burden without any guarantee of the commencement of objective negotiations with the counterparty. In this context, at the end of 2013, formal notice was sent to the customer to inform it of the intention to immediately suspend work if the customer refused once again to address this dispute in accordance with a contractual approach based on good faith and the willingness of all parties to reach a reasonable agreement. Negotiations between the parties, supported by the respective consultants and legal experts, were carried out through February 2014 and, on 13 March 2014, an agreement was signed. The essential elements of the agreement provided that the contractor would resume works and functionally complete them by 31 December 2015, while the customer and contracting companies agreed to provide financial support for the works to be finished up to a maximum of about €1.3 billion. The customer met its obligation by granting a moratorium on the refunding of already disbursed contract advances totalling about €729 million and disbursing additional advances amounting to approximately €91 million. The group of contracting companies met their obligation by directly disbursing approximately €91 million and additional financial resources, through the conversion into cash of existing contractual guarantees totalling around €360 million. While the 13 March 2014 agreement provided for financial support to complete the Canal, claims were made by the contractor Grupo Unido Po el Canal (“GUPC”) to the customer during the contract’s execution. After the pre-litigation stage before the Dispute Adjudication Board (“DAB”) to discuss the claims as provided for contractually, there are a number of separate arbitration hearings ongoing before the International Chamber of Commerce between GUPC (with its European partners Sacyr, Salini Impregilo and Jan De Nul) and the Panama Canal Authority (“PCA”) as described below. The following arbitration proceedings are still in place: 1. the arbitration about the DAB’s decisions on the claims presented by GUPC about the inadequate quality of the basalt compared to the quality guaranteed by PCA and the lengthy delays caused by PCA to approve the design formula for the concrete mix. After the stage performed to confirm the arbitration tribunal’s competence to rule which ended with the award that the tribunal was competent to rule on the damages incurred by the individual members of the consortium, the merits proceedings are at a preliminary stage; 2. the arbitration about the extra costs incurred by GUPC due to certain unjustified conditions imposed by ACP for the design of the lock gates and other claims about labour costs. The proceedings are at an initial stage; 3. the arbitration commenced in 2016 involving the sundry claims mentioned in the completion certification; the proceedings are at an initial stage. On 11 March 2020, Salini Impregilo filed its arbitration application with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) against Panama. It has claimed damage for the Central American country’s repeated violations of the bilateral investment treaty agreed by its government with the Italian government in 189 2009 to promote and protect investments. Already in previous years, the Group applied a valuation approach to the project on the basis of which significant losses to complete the contract were recognised, offset in part by the corresponding recognition of the additional consideration claimed from the customer and determined based on the expectation that recognition of such consideration could be reasonably deemed to be highly probable based on the opinions expressed by its legal experts and in light of the damages awarded by the DAB. In 2019, the estimate for the extra costs to complete the project was updated, as well as the additional consideration claimed from the customer (again with the support of the Group’s experts). The Group has reflected this situation in its consolidated financial statements. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. CAVTOMI Consortium (high speed/capacity Turin Milan line) With respect to the contract for the high speed/capacity Turin Milan railway line Novara Milan sub-section, the general contractor Fiat S.p.A. (now FCA N.V., “FCA”) is required to follow the registered claims of the general subcontractor CAVTOMI Consortium (“CAVTOMI” or the “consortium”), in which Salini Impregilo has a share of 74.69%, against the customer Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (“RFI”). Accordingly, in 2008, FCA initiated contractual arbitration proceedings against RFI for the award of damages suffered for delays in the works ascribable to the customer, non-achievement of the early completion bonus also due to the customer and higher consideration. On 9 July 2013, the arbitration tribunal handed down an award in favour of FCA, ordering RFI to pay approximately €187 million (of which about €185 million pertaining to CAVTOMI). RFI appealed against the award before the Rome Appeal Court in 2013 and paid the amount due to FCA, which in turn forwarded the relevant share to CAVTOMI. The ruling of 23 September 2015 of the Rome Appeal Court cancelled a large part of the aforementioned arbitration award. FCA appealed to the Supreme Court. Following the Appeal Court’s ruling, RFI notified FCA of a writ of enforcement of approximately €175 million and subsequently the two parties reached an agreement whereby FCA provided RFI with the following in order to prevent enforcement of the aforementioned ruling, without prejudice to the parties’ substantive rights, which are subject to final judgement: (i) payment of an amount of approximately €66 million, and (ii) issue to RFI of a bank surety of €100 million (€75 million by Salini Impregilo). The consortium is confident that its arguments will be accepted at the end of the dispute supported by the opinion of its legal advisors. A date for the merits hearing has yet to be set. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. In addition, FCA and the consortium have commenced the following actions: 190 • filing of an appeal by FCA with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court on 11 November 2016 for the claims of approximately €18 million presented during the contract’s term and not covered by the previous award of 2013. This proceeding was firstly suspended from the register and then resumed. It is currently pending before the competent administrative judge; • on 12 October 2017, presentation of a claim form to the Rome Court by FCA for claims made during the contract term and not covered by the previous award for €109 million. The court-appointed expert is currently carrying out their appraisal. COCIV Consortium With the claim form notified to the COCIV consortium (“COCIV”) on 18 September 2014, the customer RFI challenged the validity of the inter partes arbitration award of 20-21 June 2013 and also requested the return of about €108 million (approximately €74 million for Salini Impregilo) collected by COCIV as a result of the award. The Appeal Court rejected RFI’s challenge in its ruling of 28 October 2019. Strait of Messina bridge Eurolink In March 2006, as lead contractor of the joint venture created for this project (interest of 45%) (subsequently merged into the SPE Eurolink S.C.p.A., “Eurolink”), Impregilo signed a contract with Stretto di Messina S.p.A. (“SDM”) for its engagement as general contractor for the final and executive designs and construction of the Strait of Messina Bridge and related roadway and railway connectors. A bank syndicate also signed the financial documentation required in the General Specifications after the joint venture won the tender, for the concession of credit lines of €250 million earmarked for this project (subsequently decreased to €20 million in 2010). The customer was also given performance bonds of €239 million, as provided for in the contract. SDM and Eurolink signed a rider in September 2009 which covered, inter alia, suspension of the project works carried out since the contract was signed and until that date. As provided for by the rider, the final designs were delivered to the customer and its board of directors approved them on 29 July 2011. Decree law no. 187 was issued on 2 November 2012 providing for “Urgent measures for the renegotiation of the contracts with Stretto di Messina S.p.A. (the customer) and for local public transport”. Following enactment of this decree and given the potential implications for its position, Eurolink, led by Salini Impregilo, notified the customer of its intention to withdraw from the contract under the contractual terms, also to protect the positions of all the Italian and foreign co-venturers. However, given the immense interest in constructing the works, Eurolink also communicated its willingness to review its position should the customer demonstrate its real intention to carry out the project. To date, the ongoing negotiations have not been successful despite the efforts made. Eurolink has commenced various legal proceedings in Italy and the EU, arguing that the provisions of the above decree are contrary to the Constitution and EU treaties and that they damage Eurolink’s legally acquired rights under the contract. It has also requested that SDM be ordered to pay the amounts requested due to the termination of the contract for reasons not attributable to it. With regard to the actions filed at EU level, in November 2013, the European Commission communicated its decision not to follow up the proceedings, as no treaties were violated, and confirmed this on 7 January 2014, with a communication dismissing the case. As 191 regards the civil action in Italy, Salini Impregilo and all the members of Eurolink have jointly and separately asked that SDM be ordered to pay the amounts due, for various reasons, as a result of the termination of the contract for reasons not attributable to them (€657 million). With its ruling no. 22386/2018 issued on 16 October 2018, the Rome Court rejected the applications filed by the claimants and the counterclaims filed by SDM. Conversely, the Rome Court declared that the customer’s termination of the contract with Parsons Transportation Group Inc., engaged by SDM for the project management services, was legitimate (referring calculation of the compensation for damage to Parsons to the judgment of the Constitutional Court). As the process is joined to that of Eurolink, Salini Impregilo deems that the legal approach which led to the ruling in the latter case is, mutatis mutandis, also applicable to Eurolink. Eurolink and Salini Impregilo filed their appeal against this ruling before the Rome Appeal Court on 28 December 2018. The appeal hearing is at an initial stage. In the meantime, the Constitutional Court found the issue of legitimacy of the Decree law for Parson’s position to be inadmissible as the order for its re-examination by the court was insufficiently documented and not because it found that the amount of the compensation to be irrelevant or unfounded. The Rome Court will now have to review the application and possibly defer it again to the Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court’s ruling does not affect the Appeal Court’s hearing about constitutionality refiled by Eurolink. Given the complexity of the pending proceedings, while the experts assisting Salini Impregilo and the general contractor are confident about the positive outcome of the legal actions and recovery of the outstanding assets (mainly contract assets recognised for this project), they cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise which would require changes to the assessments made to date. Orastie Sibiu motorway In July 2011, Salini Impregilo commenced work on the highway contract to build the Orastie Sibiu section (Lot 3), which included 22.1 km of two lane highway in each direction (in addition to the emergency lanes). The contract was entered into with the Romanian National Road & Highways Company (“CNAIR”) and 85% financed with EU structural funds and 15% by the Romanian government. Progress on the contract has been adversely affected by a number of events outside Salini Impregilo’s control such as unpredictable vast landslides on approximately 6.6 km of the route. Despite this, the lot was delivered to the customer and opened to the traffic on 14 November 2014 while additional work made necessary by the landslides was still under completion. Notwithstanding the first favourable ruling by the DAB and the award of approximately €6 million to the Group, the customer refused to acknowledge the unpredictable nature of the landslides and to pay the amounts due. In June 2015, the Group stopped work due to non-payment of the amounts awarded to it by the DAB. In September 2015, Salini Impregilo presented an application for arbitration and the first partial award of €18 million was issued in March 2017 which it subsequently collected. 192 In January 2016, with works completion at 99.9%, following a number of disputes between the parties, the customer terminated the contract and enforced the contractual guarantees of approximately €13 million on 20 April 2016, motivating such unilateral decision as being due to the alleged non-resolution of non-compliances notified by works management. The parent promptly formally contested the contract termination. With respect to the arbitration proceeding before the Paris International Chamber of Commerce for the delays and additional costs of €57 million, on 17 October 2019, the award was handed down rejecting the Group’s requests and awarding damages to the customer for delays of approximately €19 million. The parent has presented an application for the cancellation of the award to the Romanian courts. The directors are confident that its arguments will be accepted at the end of the dispute supported by the opinion of their legal advisors. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the Group has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of the contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. Contorno Rodoviario Florianópolis (Brazil) On 21 September 2016, the Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Cigla Constructora Impregilo e Associados S.A. (“CCIA”) joint venture signed a contract with Autopista Litoral Sul S.A. worth approximately €75 million for the construction of a new dual carriageway to reduce the large volume of traffic in the Florianópolis metropolitan region. The project immediately ran into critical engineering problems due to the damp soil and the area’s weather conditions, which CCIA attempted to resolve by proposing new solutions to the customer (although it was not contractually obliged to do so). In early 2018, CCIA presented claims to the customer for higher costs and extension of the contract term. Despite the fact that the negotiations were still ongoing and the related memorandum of understanding was supposed to be signed in the near future, in January 2019, the customer informed CCIA of its intention to terminate the contract. CCIA deems that this termination is illegal and contrary to the principle of good faith. Therefore, in 2019, it filed an appeal with the competent local judicial authorities and the proceeding is in its initial stage. On 4 October 2019, CCIA commenced an arbitration proceeding with the Sao Paolo International Chamber of Commerce for claims of approximately €20 million notified before the contract had been terminated. The consortium is confident that its arguments will be accepted supported by the opinion of its legal advisors. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the consortium has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. 193 Rome Metro As part of the contract for the design and construction of the works for the B1 line of the Rome Metro, Salini Impregilo commenced three legal proceedings in its name and as lead contractor of the joint venture against Roma Metropolitane S.r.l. (“Roma Metropolitane”) and Roma Capitale requesting they be ordered to pay the disputed claims recorded during works execution, for which a technical appraisal by a court-appointed expert was provided. 1. Supreme Court claims for the final billing for the Bologna Conca d’Oro section The Rome Court’s ruling of August 2016 settled the first level proceedings involving the claims made for the Bologna Conca d’Oro section and partly accepted the joint venture’s requests, ordering Roma Metropolitane to pay roughly €11 million, plus VAT and related costs. The joint venture commenced the necessary actions to collect the receivable based on this temporary enforceable ruling, which allowed it to collect the accepted amounts. It also presented an appeal for the award of a greater amount. The Rome Appeal Court handed down its ruling of July 2018 rejecting the grounds for the joint venture’s appeal and concurrently partly accepted the counter appeal presented by Roma Metropolitane, finding claim no. 38 to be ungrounded, although it had been partly accepted by the first level court for €4 million (already collected by the joint venture after the court’s ruling). The joint venture has appealed to the Supreme Court against the Appeal Court’s ruling and a hearing date is awaited. 2. Rome Court first set of claims for the Conca d’Oro Jonio section The second proceeding relates to the first set of claims for the Conca d’Oro Jonio section and is at the initial stages and has been deferred with the interim ruling of 2018 issued after the hearing for the conclusions. The judge accepted some claims made by the joint venture and ordered the court-appointed expert to recalculate the amounts due to the joint venture for just the claims rejected. This ruling partly contradicts the findings of the court-appointed expert (which had already been filed) which confirmed the joint venture’s claims for approximately €27.5 million. The interim ruling of January 2018 was challenged solely for the part that rejected some claims already examined by the court-appointed expert earlier. The expert completed their appraisal in December 2018 and filed their additional report which included four possible amounts ranging from approximately €12 million to €23 million in favour of the joint venturers. Roma Metropolitane has requested the appraisal be reperformed by a new expert. A decision has not yet been taken. 3. Rome Court second set of claims for the Conca d’Oro Jonio section The third proceeding refers to the second and last set of claims for the Conca d’Oro Jonio section, was commenced in September 2016 and the court-appointed expert completed their work in November 2018 and 194 filed their definitive report. The expert found that the joint venture’s claims of approximately €3 million were admissible. A decision has not yet been taken. The directors are confident that joint venture’s arguments will be accepted supported by the opinion of their legal advisors. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. Colombia Yuma and Ariguani Yuma Concesionaria S.A. en Reorganización (in which the Group has a 48.3% investment) (“Yuma”) holds the concession for the construction and operation of sector 3 of the Ruta del Sol motorway in Colombia. The construction works were delivered to the EPC contractor Constructora Ariguani S.A.S. en Reorganización, wholly owned by the parent, on 22 December 2011. In November 2017, the customer ANI (Agencia Nacional de Infraestructura) commenced administrative procedures against Yuma to have the contract terminated. Yuma deems that the contract was significantly affected by a series of unexpected events outside its control which led to a significant imbalance in the contract that the customer is obliged to rectify. After more than one year of negotiations, on 20 February 2020, the parties signed a rider to the concession agreement that provided for, inter alia, the interruption of the procedure commenced by ANI for the alleged serious breaches of the concession contract by Yuma and extended the contract term to complete the project by 56 months. The rider settled some claims made as part of the arbitration proceedings in place for the contract variations as part of the national arbitration at the Bogotà Chamber of Commerce and the claims related to construction of the project before the International Chamber of Commerce as part of the international arbitration. Salini Impregilo concurrently withdrew its application for arbitration to the International Chamber of Commerce, presented in November 2017. As a result and with the acceptance by ANI, this international arbitration proceeding has been discontinued. At the same time, two other riders to the EPC contract were signed by Yuma and the EPC contractor Ariguani, covering the new financial terms and timeline agreed by them. Due to the dispute and the difficulties encountered during the project, in 2018, both Yuma and Ariguani commenced their reorganisation (“Reorganización”) pursuant to the local laws (Law no. 1116 of 2006) and this process is still ongoing. The Group had already provided for the higher costs incurred by Ariguani for the contract variations, unexpected events and delays accumulated during the project in previous years to the extent that acceptance thereof is 195 deemed highly probable, supported by the opinion of the Group’s advisors. The directors are confident that its arguments will be accepted during of the ongoing arbitration proceedings supported by the opinion of its legal advisors. However, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. Project S8 (Poland) The Group has a 95% interest in a joint venture in Poland set up in November 2014 for the design and construction of roads. Although the main road section was opened to traffic on 22 December 2017, in May 2018, the customer informed the joint venture that the contract was considered to be terminated due to the latter’s alleged breach of contract and concurrently requested payment of fines of €4.1 million. On 22 May 2018 and 7 June 2018, the joint venture informed the customer that it considered termination of the contract to be null and void and also asked for payment of the outstanding amount of €1.7 million and the contractually provided-for fines. Finally, it noted that the contract terminated due to the customer’s default. The customer has attempted to enforce the performance bonds of approximately €8 million, which the joint venture had provided. The joint venture obtained a court order from the Parma Court preventing this on a precautionary basis. The Group has already commenced appropriate legal measures to protect its rights and, accordingly, filed a claim form with the Warsaw first level court on 31 October 2019 for the recovery of the costs not paid before termination of the contract, claims and compensation for the irregular termination. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. Project A1F (Poland) The Group has a 100% interest in a joint venture in Poland set up in October 2015 for the design and construction of roads. On 29 April 2019, the customer informed the joint venture that the contract was considered to be terminated due to the latter’s alleged breach of contract and concurrently requested payment of fines of roughly €18 million. On 6 May 2019, the joint venture informed the customer that it considered termination of the contract to be null and void. On 14 May 2019, it notified that the contract terminated for reasons attributable to the customer as a result of reported defaults that were not remedied by the customer. The customer obtained enforcement of the performance bonds, retentions and fines of approximately €37 million, which the joint venture had provided. 196 The Group will take all appropriate legal action to protect its rights. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. Project S3 (Poland) The Group has a 99.99% interest in a joint venture in Poland set up in December 2014 for the design and construction of roads. On 29 April 2019, the customer informed the joint venture that the contract was considered to be terminated due to the latter’s alleged breach of contract and concurrently requested payment of fines of roughly €24.7 million. The customer has attempted to enforce the performance bonds of approximately €13 million, which the joint venture had provided. After the filing of an appeal against this enforcement, Salini Impregilo S.p.A. provided for payment. On 6 May 2019, the joint venture informed the customer that it considered termination of the contracts to be null and void and legally ineffective. On 14 May 2019, it noted that the contract terminated attributable to the customer’s default as a result of challenged defaults that were not remedied by the customer. The Group has commenced appropriate legal measures to protect its rights and, accordingly, filed a claim form with the Warsaw first level court on 31 October 2019 for the return of the amounts related to the undue enforcement of the bank guarantees and payment of the fines. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. Copenhagen Cityringen As a result of critical issues about this project related to its specific features and the significance of the works, the Group had to significantly revise the cost estimates for the early stages of this project. They mainly related to the construction of the concrete works, the electromechanical works and the architectural finishings. The negotiations with the customer, assisted by their consultants and technical/legal advisors, led to the signing of an interim agreement on 30 December 2016 (which allowed the Group to collect €145 million) and other agreements (claim settlement agreement no. 7 of 6 April 2017, the additional agreement of 2 May 2017, addendum no. 4 to the CSA no. 7 of 29 June 2018, addendum no. 5 to the CSA no. 7 of 21 January 2019 and addendum no. 6 to the CSA no. 7 of 15 May 2019) which enabled it to collect additional amounts (for a total of €260 million). This settled some claims with the outstanding claims related to the pending arbitration proceeding 197 before the Building and Construction Arbitration Board. On 12 July 2019, the Group delivered the project and the metro was officially opened to the public on 29 September 2019. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the Group has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. North West Rail Link (Australia) This project included the design and building of a 36 km metro line north west of Sydney, of which 4.6 km as a viaduct (the Skytrain bridge). The metro opened in May 2019. The Group participated in the project through a joint venture of Salini Impregilo and Salini Impregilo PTY Limited. After the joint venture presented claims, the DAB issued a decision acknowledging its right to AUD34,530,036.07 (roughly €21.4 million) on 9 December 2019. The contract with Sydney Metro provides for resort to the Australian Centre for International Commercial Arbitration should one or both of the parties be unsatisfied with the DAB’s decision. In fact, on 31 January 2020, both the joint venture and the customer presented the DAB with a notice of dissatisfaction and local arbitration proceedings are expected to be commenced The directors are confident that its arguments will be accepted at the end of the dispute supported by the opinion of their legal advisors. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Considering the uncertainties linked to the dispute stage, the Group cannot exclude that currently unforeseeable events may arise in the future which could require changes to the assessments made to date. Al Bayt Stadium (Qatar) On 25 October 2019, the joint venture comprising Leonardo S.p.A. and PSC S.p.A. commenced an arbitration proceeding before the International Chamber of Commerce against the joint venture consisting of Galfar Al Misnad Engineering and Contracting, Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Cimolai S.p.A. (“GSIC JV” in which the Group has a 40% interest) with respect to the contract to build the Al Bayt Stadium in Doha, Qatar. As subcontrator of the contract to supply mechanical and electrical works, the Leonardo/PSC joint venture claimed damages for the acceptance of variations and other compensation from the contractor GSIC JV. As part of the same arbitration proceedings, GSIC JV presented its counterclaim, which includes, inter alia, acknowledgement of the costs incurred on the subcontractor’s behalf and compensation for the higher costs incurred due to the latter’s delays and negligence. 198 The arbitration proceedings are at an initial stage as the tribunal has only recently been set up. The directors deem the risk of an unfavourable award to be remote, also based on the opinion of their legal advisors. During preparation of the contract budget and the consolidated financial statements, they considered the above costs and compensation for the subcontractor’s delays and negligence to the extent they deem it is highly probable that its counterclaim will be successful, also based on the opinion of their legal advisors. However, they cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change their valuations. Slovakia On 6 March 2019, the joint venture comprising Salini Impregilo and the Slovakian company Duha and the customer signed an agreement to terminate the contract for the design and construction of a major motorway section. This agreement provides for the recognition of the works awaiting certification and also establishes that: • the customer will certify most of the works performed and awaiting approval for bureaucratic reasons in the short term; • a dispute adjudication board (DAB) will be appointed, consisting of international members rather than the Slovakian members provided for in the original contract, to decide on the additional consideration requested by the Group; • should the DAB’s ruling not be agreeable to the parties, they may apply to an international arbitration tribunal (ICC Vienna) rather than a Slovakian tribunal as provided for in the original contract. After the joint venture’s presentation of its claims, on 18 November 2019, the DAB issued its report, finding that the joint venture was due approximately €8 million as part of the extra costs claimed. In December 2019, both the joint venture and the customer sent the DAB a notice of dissatisfaction. Should the parties be unable to come to an agreement, they may apply for arbitration as contractually provided for. Unforeseen costs have been incurred and the joint venture has accordingly presented its request for additional consideration. The costs are included in the measurement of contract assets and liabilities for the part deemed highly probable to be recovered, based also on the opinions of the Group’s advisors. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change its valuations. Administrative litigation This section describes the main administrative proceedings involving the group companies. USW Campania projects The special commissioner tasked by the Regional Administrative Court to collect receivables of the former operators of the waste disposal service performed until 15 December 2005 submitted their final report in 199 November 2014, in which they stated that the administration had already collected directly €46,363,800 of the fee due to Fibe for its services rendered until 15 December 2015 (when the contracts were terminated ope legis), without forwarding it to Fibe, and that total outstanding receivables totalled €74,317,550. In its ruling no. 7323/2016, the Regional Administrative Court decided that the special commissioner should pay the amounts claimed by Fibe only after the assessment is completed and, hence, including amounts already collected by the administration. Fibe challenged this ruling with the Council of State which rejected it with its ruling no. 1759/2018. A petition for the conclusion of the proceedings was then filed. After the resignation of the special commissioner, the Regional Administrative Court appointed a new commissioner on 16 April 2018. As this commissioner did not accept the position, on 10 January 2019, another commissioner was appointed that filed a report on 13 January 2020 confirming the findings reported by the previous commissioner in November 2014. Due to the interim payments made which reduced the total amounts due, the commissioner calculated the amounts outstanding as fees to be €54,841,596 and deferred the definitive calculation of the amounts of €3,146,373 in addition to that already ascertained and the total amount of interest and fines due to Fibe to a second stage. As early as 2009, Fibe filed a complaint with the Lazio Regional Administrative Court about the slackness of the competent authorities in completing the administrative procedures for the recording and recognition of the costs incurred by the former service contractors for activities carried out pursuant to law and the work ordered by the administration and performed by the companies during the years from 2006 to 2008 (i.e., after the contracts had been terminated). As part of the aforementioned ruling, the Regional Administrative Court appointed an inspector who, on 21 December 2017, submitted a final report finding that, in short, the amounts stated by Fibe in its appeal and the supporting documentation were substantially consistent. The company requested a more in-depth review of certain items and the correction of some errors. The Regional Administrative Court ordered an additional inspection. On 28 September 2018, the inspector filed their final report, which addressed the requests made by Fibe for a more in-depth review and corrections. The Lazio Regional Administrative Court with its ruling of 21 March 2019 ordered the Office of the Prime Minister to pay €52,955,353, including VAT and interest, as the fee for services carried out after the contracts were terminated. The Office of the Prime Minister challenged this ruling before the Council of State. In its ruling no. 974 of 7 February 2020, the Council of State identified a logical legal error in the Regional Administrative Court’s ruling were it ordered the Office of the Prime Minister to pay the amounts requested and documented by Fibe (private part) not yet checked by it. The Council of State amended in part the first level ruling finding that Fibe is due the smaller amount of €20,962,224.45, increased by legal interest (instead of the amount of €52,935,352.80 ordered by the Regional Administrative Court). With ruling no. 3886/2011, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court upheld Fibe’s appeal and ordered the administration to pay the undepreciated costs at the termination date for the RDF plants to Fibe, for a total amount of €205 million, plus legal and default interest from 15 December 2005 until settlement. Following the enforcement order filed by Fibe and opposed by the Office of the Prime Minister, Fibe obtained the allocation of €241 million (collected in previous years) as a final payment for the receivables for principal and legal interest and suspended the enforcement procedure for the further amount of default interest claimed. 200 Both parties initiated proceedings about the merits of the case. The judge rejected the request for default interest submitted by Fibe in the ruling of 12 February 2016, which Fibe challenged. As part of the USW Campania projects, the Group was notified of a large number of administrative measures regarding reclamation and the implementation of safety measures at some of the landfills, storage areas and RDF plants. For the proceedings regarding the characterisation and emergency safety measures at the Pontericcio site, the RDF plant in Giugliano and the temporary storage area at Cava Giuliani, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court rejected the appeals filed by Fibe with ruling no. 6033/2012. An appeal against this ruling, based on contamination found at a site different to those subject of the proceedings, was filed with the Council of State. It denied Fibe’s precautionary motion to stay the enforcement of the decision. The Council of State subsequently accepted Fibe’s appeal in its ruling no. 5076/2018, reversing the first level ruling and cancelling the measures challenged by Fibe. With respect to the Cava Giuliani landfill, the Lazio Regional Administrative Court, with ruling no. 5831/2012, found that it lacked jurisdiction in favour of the Superior Court of Public Waters, before which the appeal was summed up and a decision has not yet been taken. Meanwhile, Fibe has completed the characterisation operations for the above sites, but this does not constitute any admission of liability whatsoever. S.a.Bro.M. S.p.A. S.a.Bro.M. S.p.A. (“SABROM”) is the operator for the design, construction and operation of the new regional Broni-Mortara motorway under the terms of the concession contract signed with the customer Infrastrutture Lombarde S.p.A. (“ILSpA”) on 16 September 2010. In July 2016, the Ministry for the Environment, Land and Sea Protection (“MATTM”) issued a measure containing a negative opinion on the project’s environmental compatibility. SABROM asked the customer to protect the project by appealing against the Ministry’s measure and also communicated its willingness to work with the customer to modify the designs so that the project could be reassessed by the Ministry and other competent bodies. As requested by SABROM, the customer appealed against the Ministry’s measure before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Court which rejected the appeal with its ruling published on 30 July 2018. On 14 February 2019, ILSpA filed an appeal with the Council of State and the date of the hearing has not yet been set. The directors deem the risk of an unfavourable ruling is remote and that the assets recognised under intangible assets at 31 December 2019 are recoverable, supported by their legal advisors. However, they cannot exclude that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that could make it necessary to change their valuations. Criminal litigation This section describes the main criminal proceedings involving the group companies. 201 USW Campania projects 1. In September 2006, the public prosecutor at the Naples Court served Impregilo, Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V., Fibe, Fibe Campania (subsequently merged into Fibe), Fisia Italimpiant S.p.A. (now Fisia Ambiente S.p.A.) and Gestione Napoli S.p.A. in liquidation with a “Notice of the conclusion of the preliminary investigations about the administrative liability of companies” related to the alleged administrative offence pursuant to article 24 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001, as part of criminal proceedings against some former directors and employees of the above-mentioned companies, who were being investigated for the crimes covered by article 640.1/2.1, of the Criminal Code in connection with the contracts for management of the urban solid waste disposal cycle in Campania. Following the preliminary hearing of 29 February 2008, the Preliminary Hearing Judge at the Naples Court allowed the motions for indictment presented by the public prosecutor, rejecting all the civil parties’ claims against the companies finding them to be unacceptable. As part of these proceedings, in its ruling of 26 June 2007, the Preliminary Investigations Judge ordered the precautionary seizure of the profit from the alleged crime, estimated to approximate €750 million. The precautionary proceedings continued for nearly five years and finally ended in May 2012, without any action taken against the Group. On 4 November 2013, the Naples Court handed down a decision finding all defendants not guilty on all charges. In March 2014, the public prosecutor of Naples challenged the decision and the Appeal Court disallowed the appeal and confirmed the first level ruling on 22 May 2019. The ruling became res judicata on 17 October 2019 when the timeline for presentation of an appeal to the Supreme Court by the public prosecutor expired. 2. In 2008, as part of a new investigation into waste disposal in the Campania region carried out after the ope legis termination of the relevant contracts (on 15 December 2005), the Preliminary Investigations Judge, upon a request by the public prosecutor, issued personal preventive seizure measures against some managers and employees of Fibe, Fibe Campania (subsequently merged into Fibe) and Fisia Ambiente and managers of the commissioner’s office. As part of this investigation, which in the record is described both as a continuation of an earlier investigation and as separate proceedings based on new charges, the former service providers and Fisia Ambiente are again charged with the administrative liability attributable to companies pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/01 without claims for compensation being made against these companies. In the hearing of 21 March 2013, the Preliminary Hearing Judge ordered that all the defendants and companies involved pursuant to Legislative decree no. 231/2001 be committed for trial for all charges, transferring the proceedings to the Rome Court as a result of an acting judge being listed by the Naples public prosecutor as under investigation. At the hearing of 1 April 2014, the Rome Court acquired the ruling delivered by the Fifth Criminal Chamber of the Naples Court in the aforementioned “parent” proceedings in paragraph 1 above. On 16 June 2016, the Court accepted the public prosecutor’s request and found all the individuals involved in the proceedings not guilty. The hearing will continue for the companies involved and the public prosecutor is currently examining the motions. 202 COCIV consortium On 26 October 2016, some managers and employees of COCIV were arrested as were other persons (including the chairman of Reggio Calabria Scilla S.C.p.A., who promptly resigned) with warrants issued on 7 October 2016 by the Genoa Court and 10 October 2016 by the Rome Court. The above two legal entities were informed that the Genoa and Rome public prosecutors are investigating alleged obstruction of public tender procedures, corruption and, in some cases, criminal organisation. Specifically, the proceeding before the Genoa Court (involving COCIV managers and employees) covers alleged obstruction of public tender procedures for supplies or works on individual lots (for which the public prosecutor also intends to investigate Salini Impregilo’s chief executive officer) as well as two cases of corruption. The proceeding originally before the Rome Court (consisting of two separate investigations), and now joined and transferred to the Alessandria public prosecutor, relates to the alleged bribery of works management by senior management of the contractors (COCIV, Reggio Calabria – Scilla S.C.p.A. and Salerno-Reggio Calabria s.c.p.a.) in order to encourage the works manager (also under investigation) to perform acts contrary to their official duties. On 11 January 2017, as part of the proceedings commenced on 16 November 2016, ANAC sent the Rome Prefecture a proposal for adoption of the extraordinary measures pursuant to article 32 of Decree law no. 90 of 24 June 2014 against COCIV. On 3 March 2017, the Rome Prefecture appointed a special commissioner for the extraordinary and temporary administration of COCIV in accordance with article 32.1.b) of the above Decree law for a six-month period, which was then extended to 15 January 2019. The Rome Prefecture acknowledged termination of the extraordinary and temporary administration of COCIV on 31 October 2018 with its decree of 14 November 2018, given that the set objectives had been met. Specifically, in 2018, the Genoa public prosecutor notified the completion of the preliminary investigations for the criminal proceedings to the parties under investigation, which included COCIV. During 2019, the public prosecutor requested and obtained a hearing of an excerpt of the relevant interceptions, which was followed, on 21 February 2020, by a further notification of the notice of conclusion of the investigations pursuant to article 415-bis of the Italian Criminal Code. Some days later, on 27 February 2020, the public prosecutor requested that the proceeding be filed with respect to COCIV's position, under investigation for the alleged administrative crime as per article 25 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001 given that the consortium had put in place a suitable and appropriate organisation model as per Legislative decree no. 231/2001 before the alleged crimes took place and, moreover, the alleged crimes were not performed to the advantage or in the interests of COCIV. The filing request also covered some parties under investigation in the main proceeding in relation to numerous additional alleged crimes charged to them during the investigation stage and found to be ungrounded (articles 416, 353, 353-bis, 319, 321 and 346-bis of the Italian Procedural Code and article 2635 of the Italian Civil Code). Following the most recent notice as per article 415-bis of the Italian Criminal Code, it has been confirmed that the investigation focuses on assumed collusive bidding and bribery, all of which took place quite some time ago (2012 to 2016). 203 The investigations focused on assumed collusive bidding and most of the challenged events took place quite some time ago (2013 to 2016).The charges refer to alleged conduct that could only be carried out by the individuals in charge of managing the related procedures. This implies that the alleged involvement of key management personnel (the then chairman of the consortium) and the parent’s chief executive officer, would not lead to the identification of any real activities and/or conduct that these persons actually undertook. With respect to the criminal proceedings commenced by the Rome public for the alleged crime of association for criminal purposes, the dismissal of the related criminal proceedings has been applied for and obtained as the related charge cannot be sustained. With respect to all the alleged corruption practices, involving the alleged administrative liability of COCIV and Reggio Calabria Scilla S.C.p.A. for the administrative offence as per articles 5 and 25 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001, the Rome Court declared its lack of jurisdiction and referred all the cases to the Bolzano public prosecutor which joined them in a single case and requested that it be heard. During the preliminary hearing of 26 June 2019, the judge declared its lack of jurisdiction and ordered the case be referred to the Alessandria Court, where it has been again included in the investigation phase. The Alessandra Court has yet to set the date for the preliminary hearing before the Preliminary Hearing Judge. With respect to the alleged bribery, COCIV deems that, as already found by the Genoa public procecutor, the crimes allegedly committed by its personnel (should they be found guilty by the court) were to its detriment and were essentially committed in their own interests by fraudulently circumventing the rules in place to control its activities. Moreover, these alleged offences would not have required RFI to pay a larger or undue amount or create economic benefits for COCIV but rather would have required it to pay higher costs. The consortium’s new structure (senior management and operating personnel) is committed to ensuring that the works can continue while concurrently dealing with the social and employment issues arising from the discontinuity measures that the consortium has had to put in place vis-à-vis the third party companies involved in the legal proceedings. The consortium has carefully checked the quality of the materials used in the works previously carried out although this is not an issue raised by the public prosecutors. Its results are wholly in line with the findings of the expert appointed by the Genoa court, which both found the full compliance of the materials used by COCIV with the quality levels specified in the contracts and relevant legislation. Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. was notified of the commencement of proceedings before the Rimini Court for an alleged administrative offence as per article 25-septies.3 of Legislative decree no. 231/2001. The preliminary investigation is still ongoing. Ministry of the Environment / Autostrade per l’Italia S.p.A. – Todini Construction Generali (now HCE Construction + others) In June 2011, upon conclusion of the investigations commenced in 2005, the Florence public prosecutor charged the CEOs and former employees of Todini with environmental crimes with respect to the management of excavated soil and rocks, water regulation, waste management and damage to environment assets as part of 204 the Tuscan lots of the “Valico variation”. The Ministry of the Environment joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party, sueing Autostrade per l’Italia S.p.A., Todini C.G. S.p.A., Impresa S.p.A. and Toto S.p.A. for their civil liability and quantifying the alleged environmental damage to be compensated as “not less than €810,000,000.00 or any amount that may be established during the proceedings and/or established in an equitable manner”. As evidence of the damage, the Ministry presented a preliminary report prepared by I.S.P.R.A. (a body which is part of the Ministry). The judge held that the I.S.P.R.A. report was not a document that could be used in the proceedings as it had not been prepared inter partes and, moreover, did not include the name of the individual that had physically prepared it. At the date of preparation of this report, the claim for compensation is not supported by proof about its size. On 30 October 2017, the Florence Court found all the defendants not guilty and the public prosecutor appealed the ruling on 20 June 2019. For completeness purposes, after the claim for compensation presented by the Ministry of the Environment, the Group commissioned a report on the possible effect of the criminal proceeding on the consolidated financial statements. The opinion was that the Ministry’s joining the proceedings as a civil party did not require any provision to be made in the separate or consolidated financial statements or the interim financial statements. The Group is confident that the claim for compensation will not be accepted. Other situations characterised by risk and/or uncertainty profiles Condotte Società Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. (“Condotte”), which has investments in group companies, filed a petition as per article 161.6 of the Bankruptcy Law after which, on 17 July 2018, it applied for immediate application of the extraordinary administration procedure pursuant to article 2 of Decree law no. 347/03 to the Ministry of Economic Development. The Ministry issued its decree on 6 August 2018 authorising Condotte to enter extraordinary administration as per Decree law no. 347/2003 converted by Law no. 39 of 18 February 2004 (the “Marzano Law”). The Rome Court declared Condotte insolvent in its ruling of 14 August 2018. On 22 October 2018, the special commissioners invited Condotte’s creditors to file their claims for inclusion in the insolvency proceedings for their receivables originated up to 6 August 2018 before 12 December 2018. The following consortia or consortium companies, in which the Group has investments, filed their claims by the due date: • Consorzio Alta Velocità Torino Milano; • Consorzio Collegamenti Integrati Veloci; • Lybian Expressway Contractors; 205 • Eurolink Scpa; • Reggio Calabria Scilla Scpa; • Salerno Reggio Calabria Scpa; • Consorzio Iricav Due. Their claims were based on the following: a) offsetting their receivables from Condotte that were due before 6 August 2018 against their payables due to Condotte which were also due before 6 August 2018; b) filing of the outstanding balances after the offsetting in the insolvency proceeding; − as a pre-preferential claim as provided for by article 51.3 of Law no. 270/1999 (the “Prodi Law”) and article 74 of the Bankruptcy Law; − alternatively and subject to appeal, as a preferential claim in accordance with article 2761.2 of the Italian Civil Code for the principle and article 2758 of the Italian Civil Code for the VAT collected at source; − as a secured claim as a further alternative and subject to appeal. Specific comments were filed on the proposed claims with the commissioners to be examined. The meetings with the creditors are taking place and a date for the hearing to examine the claims presented by the consortia and/or the consortium companies listed above has not yet been set. Therefore, until the creditors’ claims are examined in court, additional information whether they will be included in the insolvency proceedings and their classification (i.e., pre-preferential, preferential or secured) is not available. The parent has analysed the recoverability of some of the Group's receivables arising on its participation in Italian consortia and due from consortium partners that are currently under extraordinary administration or other court-approved procedures. Supported by its legal advisors, the directors are confident that the SPEs in which Condotte has an investment will recover the amounts due from it (net of offsetting), also because the ongoing strategic works are expected to be continued. However and given the counterparties’ situations, the Group has impaired the receivables by €45.8 million. The group companies are carefully monitoring developments in the situation. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events related to the above-mentioned extraordinary administration procedure may take place in the future. Astaldi Astaldi S.p.A., which has investments in group companies, filed a petition as per article 161.6 of the Bankruptcy Law with the Rome Court. It has also reserved the right to file a plan and deed of arrangement proposal pursuant to article 160 and subsequent articles and article 186-bis of the Bankruptcy Law. 206 Specifically, it filed its petition on 27 September 2018 and it was published the next day (28 September 2018). On 16 October 2018, the Rome Court granted a period of up to 16 December 2018, subsequently deferred to 14 February 2019, for presentation of the above proposal. It appointed special commissioners to monitor the company’s activities until this date, requiring the company to comply with a number of disclosure obligations. On 13 February 2019, Salini Impregilo made a binding offer for Astaldi with terms promptly communicated to the market. The transaction is designed to strengthen Astaldi’s financial position and performance as part of the deed of arrangement. On 14 February 2019, the parent presented an offer to Astaldi for a potential investment therein to be used to support its business continuity proposal underpinning Astaldi’s application for a deed of arrangement. Astaldi filed the plan and deed of arrangement proposal as per the application for a deed of arrangement as a going concern in accordance with articles 160, 161 and 186-bis of the Bankruptcy Law with the Rome Court, with details of how it meant to satisfy its creditors. The Astaldi offer and, accordingly, the plan and deed of arrangement proposal were subsequently updated and confirmed by Salini Impregilo and Astaldi on 15 July and 2 August 2019, respectively, also to reflect the fact that progress had been made on the main conditions precedent that are to be met if the offer is to be effective. They include agreements between Salini Impregilo and institutional and financial partners to obtain the necessary assistance to perform the Astaldi transaction, given its importance to the entire sector: a) the business continuity of just the infrastructure construction unit (the “EPC business unit”), the facility management and complex system management activities (“O&M activities) and certain minor concessions related to the EPC activities; b) liquidation of the other assets, which will be transferred to a separate unit to be set up pursuant to article 2447-bis and following articles of the Italian Civil Code, in line with the financial projections contained in the plan. The Rome Court issued its decree on 5 August 2019 accepting Astaldi’s application for deed of arrangement on a going concern basis. It found that the company’s plan and deed of arrangement proposal, in compliance with the offer, were feasible within the proposed terms and procedures. The Court issued a separate ruling authorising Astaldi to agree a new pre-preferential bridge loan to support its financial requirements until approval and also set the date for the hearing for the creditors’ meeting and related vote for 6 February 2020. The bankruptcy section of the Rome Court postponed the hearing for the creditors’ meeting and related vote to 26 March 2020. Astaldi deems that the Court’s postponement should nonetheless allow for completion of the proceedings within the timeline estimated for the plan’s implementation. As required by the notification pursuant to article 171 of the Bankruptcy Law, the consortia filed their proof of claims (pre-preferential, preferential or secured) before 10 January 2020 indicating any differences to Astaldi’s records. 207 Supported by its legal advisors, the directors are confident that the amounts claimed by the SPEs in which Astaldi has an investment will be confirmed and fully recovered, also given the assumed continuity of the ongoing strategic works. Therefore, they have not been impaired. The group companies are carefully monitoring developments in the situation. Moreover, the Group cannot exclude that events related to the above-mentioned deed of arrangement may take place in the future, which would entail changes to the current assessments. Country risk Libya Salini Impregilo S.p.A. operates in Libya through a permanent establishment and a subsidiary, Impregilo Lidco Libya General Contracting Company (Impregilo Lidco), which has been active in Libya since 2009 and is 60% owned by Salini Impregilo with the other 40% held by a local partner. The directors do not deem that significant risks exist with respect to the permanent establishment’s contracts as work thereon has not started, except for the Koufra Airport project. Moreover, the Group’s exposure for that project is not material. The Group is also involved in the Libyan Coastal Highway project which leads to the Egyptian border for the stretch through Cyrenaica, which had not yet been started at the reporting date. Impregilo Lidco won important contracts for the construction of: • infrastructural works in Tripoli and Misuratah; • university campuses in Misuratah, Tarhunah and Zliten; • a new Conference Hall in Tripoli. Despite the dramatic political and social events in Libya from 2011, Salini Impregilo has always acted in accordance with the contractual terms. This political upheaval has not yet subsided, impeding the subsidiary from developing its business. At present, Salini Impregilo does not expect activities to be resumed in the near future as there are serious security problems. The subsidiary Impregilo Lidco continues to be present in Libya and to maintain contacts with its customers, complying promptly with legal and corporate requirements. It informed its customers immediately of the activation of the force majeure clause (provided for contractually) given the situation in Libya, but the projects covered by the contracts should continue to be a priority for the country. The customers have acknowledged the contractual rights and the validity of the claims presented for the costs, losses and damages incurred as a result of the above-mentioned unrest. Once the local situation has normalised and the country’s institutions are working again, these claims will be discussed with the customers. The impairment losses on net assets and costs incurred starting from the 2012 financial statements are fully included in contract liabilities. The subsidiary has presented claims to the customers for these amounts, which it deems are fully recoverable as they are due to force majeure. 208 In addition, the investments made to date are covered by the contract advances received from the customers. The subsidiary’s legal advisors agree with this approach as can be seen in their reports. No significant risks are deemed to exist for the recovery of the net assets attributable to the subsidiary, thanks in part to actions and claims filed against the customers. As this country’s situation continues to be complex and critical, the Group does not expect that operations can be resumed in the short term. Salini Impregilo will continue to guarantee the subsidiary’s business continuity. However, it cannot be excluded that events which cannot currently be foreseen may take place after the date of preparation of this report that require changes to the assessments made to date. Argentina The severe crisis that has affected Argentina’s economy in the period from 2017 to 2019 has caused a significant depreciation of the Argentinian peso, an over 30% hike in public debt and an increase in accumulated inflation of more than 250%. It was the main factor that caused the previous government to lose the election. The 2019 budget law introduced strong anti-crisis economic measures in line with the IMF’s terms. The new government took office in December 2019. The Group is building a hydraulic tunnel (lot 3) and a wastewater pre-treatment plant (lot 2) as part of a mega project for the environmental restoration project of the Riachuelo River in Buenos Aires for the Argentinian government. Venezuela Salini Impregilo Group has operated in Venezuela for over thirty years and has a stable presence there through its permanent organisation. It carries out important projects to develop the South American country directly or in partnerships with international partners. The work in progress, mainly in the railway and hydroelectric sectors, relates to the following contracts: Railway sector: i) Puerto Cabello La Encrucijada section project; ii) Guarico project, for the San Juan de Los Morros San Fernando de Apure and Chaguaramas Cabruta sections; Hydroelectric sector: i) the Tocoma dam project. The customers for the above projects are all government agencies (the Venezuelan government or related bodies). In the past, the Venezuelan government reconfirmed its intention to complete the railway and hydroelectrical projects, deemed to be of strategic interest for the country’s development. However, these contracts have seen non-payment, temporary suspensions and minimum maintenance activities in the last two years. 209 Given the country’s situation, the Group tested the assets recognised in its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 for impairment again, in line with the considerations and assessments made during preparation of the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018. In line with the analyses presented in the 2018 Annual Report and considering the guidelines of the IFRS, the Group tested its financial assets for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9 by remodelling its payments by date and amount. It also estimated the effective interest rate, which includes Venezuela’s credit risk. In June 2019, Salini Impregilo commenced arbitration proceedings before the International Chamber of Commerce. The Group’s gross exposure amounted to €643.4 million at 31 December 2019, including €120.2 million of loans and approximately €523.2 million of receivables for consideration accrued on work performed (this latter figure comprises €318.7 million already invoiced and recognised as trade receivables and €204.5 million recognised as contract assets net of contract liabilities). The Group estimated total impairment losses on these assets of € 514.7 million. In view of the delicate and complex uncertain situation that has developed at political level, the possibility that events not foreseeable at the reporting date may arise in the future which would require changes to the assessments made to date cannot be excluded. Nigeria Despite the positive oil price trends (USD55/barrel at the start of the year compared to USD65 at 20 December 2019), the economic crisis in place since 2015 has continued although some small signs of an improvement have recently been seen. After the latest depreciation of the Nigerian naira, its exchange rate with the Euro has stabilised at NGN345. The crisis has led to higher unemployment with the related increase in criminality and widespread discontent. The construction sector is struggling to regain vitality, like the country’s other production sectors. Given the limited funding available, the federal government focuses on projects deemed strategic for the country’s development like road infrastructure, hydraulic works and energy generation. The presidential elections took place in March 2019 and the outgoing President and majority party were reelected. Therefore, it can be assumed that the ongoing payment of the amounts due to the main contractors operating in Nigeria, commenced by the previous government, will continue until completion in 2021. Given the country’s situation, the Group tested the assets recognised in its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 for impairment again, in line with the considerations and assessments made during preparation of the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018. It cannot be excluded that events which cannot currently be foreseen may take place after the date of preparation of this report that require changes to the assessments made to date. 210 Ukraine This country’s political and economic situation is still extremely difficult, even after the recent presidential elections, although great change is expected after the forthcoming parliamentary elections. Although there has been a gradual improvement in the local economic situation, the public accounts continue to suffer, mostly as a result of the lack of internal and external investments and reforms that would boost the country’s economy. During the performance of the contract to upgrade the Kiyv – Kharkiv – Dovzhanskiy section of the M03 motorway from 2013 to 2016, there were no significant threats to its activities. The work site, located near Poltava, was far from the areas most affected by the armed conflict between Ukraine and Russia (the Donbass war). From a financial viewpoint, the Group is not exposed to currency depreciation risk since the contractual amounts are paid in Euros and US dollars at rates agreed with the contract was signed. Main contract events and effect of the sale of Todini The parent’s sale in April 2016 of Todini Costruzioni Generali (which had been awarded the M03 contract) was one of the factors that led to the customer’s termination of the contract in August 2016. The Group defended its position and obtained positive rulings from the Dispute Board (DB) with respect to both its financial requests and the principal of the issue, including the illegality of the termination. The customer’s continued refusal to comply with the DB’s rulings, including after the Group has made significant concessions, led to the effective termination of the contract in March 2017, the dismantlement of the work site and commencement of arbitration proceedings before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris. Arbitration proceedings before the Paris International Chamber of Commerce As part of the pending arbitration proceedings, the ICC issued two partial awards substantially confirming the amounts awarded by the DB on a provisional basis and without prejudice to the assessment of the merits of the claims presented. On 26 June 2018, it issued its first partial final award for an amount equivalent to approximately €54 million. On 30 January 2019, it issued the second partial final award for the interest accrued on the amounts awarded with the first award of approximately €7 million. The ICC also established that additional interest is to be charged on the amounts due to the Group up until the date of effective payment of the contractual consideration. The claims presented by the Group to the ICC total UAH1,367 million (the equivalent of approximately €130 million at 31 December 2019), as per the amounts claimed via the Dispute Board plus the additional claims and related financial expense made directly to the ICC. The final award is expected to be issued before the end of 2020. In view of the present critical situation, it cannot be excluded that events not foreseeable at the date of this report may arise in the future requiring changes to the assessments made to date. 211 Outlook As part of the project to relaunch the infrastructure sector in Italy, to consolidate its position and avail of the related investment opportunities, the parent will draw up a three-year business plan in 2020 underpinned by strategic pillars: • Completion of Progetto Italia: creation of a larger group (Webuild) to shore up Italy's large infrastructure works sector. The new player will be more efficient thanks to economies of scale and more competitive as a result of the aggregation of specialist skills and greater financial solidity and flexibility; • Geographical focus: greater share of key geographical areas such as North America, Australia and the Middle East and growth in new high potential areas like Europe and the Scandinavian countries; • Sector focus: concentration of complex infrastructure projects where the Group can capitalise on its best-in-class expertise in the sustainability mobility, clean hydro energy and clean water areas; • Continuation of the cost streamlining process: optimisation of overheads and achievement of greater operating efficiency through the centralisation of internal functions (procurement, plant and machinery, human resources, finance and communications) and cost synergies from these integrations. The plan, which may evolve and change thanks to the internal ethical work practices based on the principles of sustainable development, is designed to create a group that is attractive to all stakeholders, such as its employees, project partners and investors. It is innovative, efficient and structured to generate interest in the industrial and financial markets. In 2020, the Group expects to have a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1x, high-single-digit revenue growth and an EBITDA margin in the range of between 7% to 7.5%. These expectations reflect its current business scope. They do not include the impact that the ongoing development of COVID-19 (described in the “Events after the reporting date” section) may have on business dynamics. The Group will ensure the continuity of operations at its work sites in Italy and abroad as far as possible in line with government measures and prioritising the health of its stakeholders. 212 Alternative performance indicators As required by Consob communication no. 0092543 of 3 December 2015, details of the performance indicators used in this Report and in the Group’s institutional communications are given below. Financial ratios: Debt/equity ratio: this ratio shows net financial position as the numerator and equity as the denominator. The items making up the financial position are presented in a specific table in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The equity items are those included in the relevant section of the statement of financial position. For consolidation purposes, equity used for this ratio also includes that attributable to non-controlling interests. Debt indicators: Liquidity and other financial assets is the sum of the following items: a. Current and non-current financial assets b. Cash and cash equivalents Medium to long-term debt is the sum of the following items: a. Current account facilities and other loans b. Bonds c. Lease liabilities Other financial assets and liabilities is the sum of the following items: a. Derivatives b. The Group’s net amounts due from/to consortia and consortium companies operating under a cost recharging system and not included in the consolidation scope. Performance indicators: 1. Gross operating profit: this indicator shows the sum of the following items included in the statement of profit or loss: a. Total revenue b. Total costs, less amortisation, depreciation, impairment losses and provisions This can also be shown as the ratio of gross operating profit to total revenue. 2. Operating profit: the operating profit given in the statement of profit or loss, being the sum of total revenue and total costs. 3. Return on sales or R.o.S.: given as a percentage, shows the ratio of operating profit (as calculated above) to total revenue. 213 *** Disclosure on the adjusted figures The Group monitors the key figures of Lane Group for management purposes adjusting the IFRS figures prepared for consolidation purposes to present the results of the joint ventures not controlled by Lane which are consolidated on a proportionate basis. These figures (“JV not controlled by Lane”) show the status of contracts managed directly by Lane or through non-controlling investments in joint ventures. In addition, the IFRS figures for 2019 and 2018 have also been adjusted to sterilise the effects of the impairment losses recognised on some assets related to the construction of infrastructure in Venezuela. Finally, the figures for 2018 have been restated to reflect the effects of FTA of IFRS 16 using the best estimates available although this is not required by the new standard as the Group has elected to apply the simplified transition approach (“modified retrospective approach”). 214 Other information Research and development Salini Impregilo carried out industrial research and experimental development activities during the year. These activities enabled the acquisition of new know-how and improvement of production efficiency, which will improve the parent’s competitive edge.

Basis of preparation Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (the “parent” or “Salini Impregilo”) has its registered office in Italy. These consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 include the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries (the “Group”). The Group, created by the reverse merger of the Salini and Impregilo Groups, is a global player in the large-scale infrastructure sector. Salini Impregilo Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 on a going concern basis. The directors have checked that events that could affect the Group’s ability to meet its commitment in the near future and, specifically, in the next 12 months do not exist. Preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements and complex estimates about the Group’s future profitability and financial position, based also on its sector. These complex estimates underpin assumptions about going concern and the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. They do not consider non-recurring events that management cannot foresee at the date of preparation of the consolidated financial statements. In addition, as required by Regulation 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council, implemented in Italy by Legislative decree no. 38/2005, these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union. The format and content of these consolidated financial statements comply with the disclosure requirements of article 154-ter of the Consolidated Finance Act. The accounting policies adopted to draw up these consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 are consistent with those used to prepare the 2018 annual consolidated financial statements, to which reference should be made, except for the changes summarised in note 2. IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies After a lengthy observation period of inflation rates, which have exceeded 100% in the last three years, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy pursuant to the IFRS since 2018. As a result, all the companies operating in Argentina have applied IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies in their financial reports starting from 1 July 2018. These conditions were applicable in 2019 as well. The Group’s results for 2018 included the effects of applying the above standard from 1 January 2018. 2. Changes in standards Changes in standards and effects of new standards This section lists the standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IFRS, endorsed by the European Union and applicable since 1 January 2019: 225 Standard/Interpretation IASB application date IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment features with negative 1 January 2019 compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2019 Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle 1 January 2019 (amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23) Amendments to IAS 19: Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement 1 January 2019 The standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC) but not yet endorsed by the competent EU bodies at the reporting date are set out below: Standard/Interpretation IASB application date IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 1 January 2021 Amendments to References to the conceptual framework in IFRS Standards 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 3 Business combinations 1 January 2020 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of material 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or contribution of assets Application date between an investor and its associate or joint venture deferred indefinitely Adoption of the above standards applicable since 1 January 2019 has not significantly affected the Group’s consolidated financial statements, except for IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23. The IASB issued IFRS 16 in January 2016. It introduced a single method to account for leases in the financial statements of the lessee, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, so that the lessee recognises an asset for the right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability. The standard includes exemptions when the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. IFRS 16 has replaced IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating leases Incentives and SIC 27 Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. The Group has applied IFRS 16 retrospectively by recognising the cumulative effect of the FTA in retained earnings at 1 January 2019 (the date of transition). Therefore, it has not restated the comparative figures at 31 December 2018 which are presented in accordance with IAS 17 and related interpretations. Details of the changes introduced by the new standard are provided below. The Group has elected to use the following practical expedients to restate the opening balances: 226 1. it has applied a single discount rate to portfolios of leases with similar characteristics and a similar remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying assets in a similar economic environment; 2. leases that expire before 31 December 2019 have been classified as short-term; 3. it has excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset; 4. it has used hindsight to determine contract variables (specifically the lease term). In addition to the practical expedients set out above for transition, the Group also elected to use the practical expedients for low-value assets and leases with a term of less than 12 months. Therefore, when the value of the underlying new individual asset is less than €5,000 or the lease term is less than 12 months, it expenses the lease payments on a straight-line basis and when incurred. The Group elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components for vehicles, office furniture and equipment and other assets. It elected to separate non-lease components from lease components for land and buildings, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial equipment. It has estimated the lease liability and the right-of-use asset for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17 and considering the elections made about the transition method and the practical expedients as follows: a) the lease liability at 1 January 2019 has been measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application; b) the right-of-use asset has been estimated using two methods defined on a lease-by-lease basis and, specifically, at: its carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019; an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2018 under IAS 17. The significant judgements made to apply IFRS 16 that had a material impact on the estimate of the assets and liabilities related to the discount rate and the lease term include: a) the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the lease payments, estimated using the lease’s reference currency, economic context and class of underlying asset. The weighted average of the rates applied is 4.4%. b) the lease term was estimated considering the contract clauses to identify the non-cancellable period of the lease; the Group considered the contracts in which the leased assets are used for the termination and renewal options; The captions “Right-of-use assets” and “Lease liabilities” include the effect of applying IFRS 16. The leased assets and the related financial liabilities that, under the previous standard applicable at 31 December 2018, 227 were recognised in the captions “Property, plant and equipment” and “Finance lease liabilities”, respectively, have been reclassified as set out below. The Group is a lessor of right-of-use assets which it accounts for as operating leases. It is not required to reclassify those leases in which it is the lessor under IFRS 16, except for subleases. The Group has assessed its classification of subleases considering the right-of-use asset rather than the underlying asset and has found that they comply with the definition of operating leases as per IFRS 16. The following table shows the effect of application of the new standard on opening equity at 1 January 2019: 228 Equity at 1 January 2019 (€’000) Equity and loss for the year attributable to the owners of the parent 835,709 Non-controlling interests 96,354 Total equity before introduction of the new standard 932,063 Effects of the application of the new standard of which: attributable to the owners of the parent 545 of which: attributable to non-controlling interests (64) Equity and loss after introduction of the new standard Equity and loss for the year attributable to the owners of the parent 836,254 Non-controlling interests 96,290 Total equity before introduction of the new standard 932,544 Lease liabilities presented in the above statement of financial position at the date of initial application amount to €81.9 million. Commitments arising from operating leases presented under IAS 17 at 31 December 2018, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application, amounted to €91.8 million. The decrease is mostly due to the better estimate made of the lease term and the application of the practical expedients for short-term leases (less than 12 months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the determination of taxable profit where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The interpretation establishes that if it is not probable that a particular tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authority, the entity shall reflect this uncertainty in its financial statements. Accordingly, based on past experience of tax assessments performed by the Ethiopian tax authorities, the Group recognised a higher tax liability of €8 million compared to 2017 and 2018 as these years are still open to assessment. The interpretation's transition provisions allow this effect to be recognised under retained earnings at 1 January 2019 and the comparative figures do not have to be restated. The following table shows the effects of the application of the above standard and interpretation: 229 Consolidated financial statements Statement of financial position at 1 January 2019 ASSETS Published 31 IFRS 16 FTA IFRS 16 IFRIC 23 Restated December reclassifications 1 January 2018 2019 (€’000) Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 415,941 (79,665) 336,276 Right-of-use assets 81,087 79,665 160,752 Intangible assets 199,356 199,356 Goodwill 74,713 74,713 Equity investments 538,257 2 538,259 Derivatives and non-current financial assets 235,692 235,692 Deferred tax assets 205,386 19 205,405 Total non-current assets 1,669,345 81,108 1,750,453 Current assets Inventories 192,304 192,304 Contract assets 1,512,866 164 1,513,030 Trade receivables 1,930,639 1,930,639 Derivatives and other current financial assets 135,881 135,881 Current tax assets 112,102 112,102 Other current tax assets 146,166 146,166 Other current assets 640,269 (406) 639,863 Cash and cash equivalents 1,107,340 1,107,340 Total current assets 5,777,567 (242) 5,777,325 Non-current assets held for sale and 5,683 5,683 discontinued operations Total assets 7,452,595 80,866 7,533,461 230 Consolidated financial statements Statement of financial position at 1 January 2019 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Published 31 IFRS 16 FTA IFRS 16 IFRIC 23 Restated December reclassifications 1 January 2018 2019 (€’000) Equity Share capital 544,740 544,740 Share premium reserve 120,798 120,798 Other reserves 124,190 124,190 Other comprehensive expense (105,914) (105,914) Retained earnings and loss for the year 151,895 545 (8,000) 144,440 Equity attributable to the owners of the parent 835,709 545 (8,000) 828,254 Non-controlling interests 96,354 (64) 96,290 Total equity 932,063 481 (8,000) 924,544 Non-current liabilities Bank and other loans and borrowings 617,895 617,895 Bonds 1,088,158 1,088,158 Finance lease liabilities 55,530 (55,530) Lease liabilities 55,976 55,530 111,506 Post-employment benefits and employee benefits 57,025 57,025 Deferred tax liabilities 11,374 227 11,601 Provisions for risks 84,213 84,213 Total non-current liabilities 1,914,195 56,203 1,970,398 Current liabilities Current portion of bank loans and borrowings and current account 499,362 499,362 facilities Current portion of bonds 13,295 13,295 Current portion of finance lease liabilities 43,206 (43,206) Current portion of lease liabilities 25,950 43,206 69,156 Contract liabilities 1,149,588 (2) 1,149,586 Trade payables 2,385,610 (1,771) 2,383,839 Current tax liabilities 144,693 152,693 Other current tax liabilities 48,521 8,000 48,521 Other current liabilities 322,062 5 322,067 Total current liabilities 4,606,337 24,182 8,000 4,638,519 Liabilities directly associated with non-current assets held for sale Total equity and liabilities 7,452,595 80,866 7,533,461 231 3. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations USW Campania At 31 December 2019 and as already noted in previous years, the Group decided that the conditions for application of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations continued to exist for the USW Campania projects. Therefore, it has recognised the USW Campania project net assets and operations separately in the statement of financial position and statement of profit or loss. Due to reasons outside the Group’s control, the period for completion of the sale has extended beyond the year allowed by IFRS 5. Despite this, the Group’s commitment to finalising the sale remains unchanged. Therefore, the directors have not deemed it necessary to change the accounting treatment of the assets in question as provided for in IFRS 5.9. Reference should be made to the section on the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” in the Directors’ report for more information. CONSORCIO AGUA AZUL S.A. At the reporting date, the Group reclassified the investment in Consorcio Agua Azul S.A., held by Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V., to assets held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5. On 7 January 2020, it was sold with the recognition of a gain of roughly €5 million. 4. Basis of presentation The Group’s consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent, Salini Impregilo, and the Italian and foreign operating companies controlled directly or indirectly by Salini Impregilo. The financial statements at 31 December 2019 approved by the internal bodies of the consolidated companies, where applicable, have been used for consolidation purposes. The financial statements are prepared by adopting the parent’s accounting policies. Where necessary, consolidation adjustments are made to make the items affected by different accounting policies consistent. A list of the companies and other Salini Impregilo Group entities included in the consolidation scope is set out in the annexes with the schedules showing changes therein during the year. Consolidated financial statements The Group opted to present its consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 in line with previous years as follows: • Current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial position. Current assets and liabilities are those expected to be realised, sold, used or settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle, which usually exceeds 12 months. Non-current assets and liabilities include non-current assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefits, deferred tax liabilities and other balances expected to be realised, sold, used or settled after the Group’s normal operating cycle, i.e., more than twelve months after the reporting date. 232 • The statement of profit or loss gives a classification of costs by nature and shows the profit or loss before “Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on equity investments” and income taxes. The profit or loss from continuing operations, the profit or loss from discontinued operations and the profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests and that attributable to the owners of the parent are also presented. • The statement of comprehensive income shows all non-owner changes in equity. • The statement of cash flows presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities separately. The indirect method is used. Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared by consolidating the financial statements at 31 December 2019 of Salini Impregilo, the parent, and the Italian and foreign companies which the parent directly or indirectly controls. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern, directly or indirectly, the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. Generally speaking, control is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than half of the voting rights either directly or indirectly. Entities or companies over which Salini Impregilo has joint control, by virtue of an investment therein or specific contractual arrangements, are consolidated as follows pursuant to IFRS 11: • on a line-by-line basis according to the investment percentage, if they are joint operations ; • at equity, if they are joint ventures. In the case of some joint ventures, the financial reporting packages of consortia and/or consortium companies prepared for their inclusion in the consolidated financial statements have not yet been approved by the competent consortium bodies as they are waiting for the court-approved procedures of the consortium members to be defined. When this is the case, the financial reporting packages are prepared using the best information available. Investments in associates are measured using the equity method. The financial statements used for consolidation are modified (made consistent) and reclassified to comply with the Group’s accounting policies in line with the currently applicable IFRS. The financial statements used are expressed in the functional currency, being the local currency or another currency in which most of the economic transactions and assets and liabilities are denominated. Financial statements expressed in currencies other than the Euro are translated into Euros by applying the closing rates to the statement of financial position items and the average annual rates to the statement of profit or loss items, as these approximate the spot rates. Differences arising from the translation of the opening equity using the closing rates and from the translation of assets and liabilities at the spot rate and the statement of profit or loss items at the average annual rate are taken to the translation reserve. 233 The exchange rates used to translate the foreign currency financial statements into Euros are as follows: Closing Closing 2018 2019 rate 31 rate 31 Currency average average December December rate rate 2018 2019 ZAR South African Rand 16.4594 15.6186 15.7773 16.1757 BRL Brazilian Real 4.444 4.3085 4.5157 4.4134 COP Colombian Peso 3,721.81 3,486.74 3,688.66 3,674.52 PEN Nuevo Sol 3.863 3.8793 3.7255 3.7364 AED United Arab Emirates Dirham 4.205 4.3371 4.1257 4.1113 ARS Argentine Peso 43.1593 43.1593 67.2749 67.2749 AUD Australian Dollar 1.622 1.5797 1.5995 1.6109 BGN Bulgarian New Lev 1.9558 1.9558 1.9558 1.9558 DZD Algerian Dinar 135.4881 137.6525 133.8916 133.6757 INR Indian Rupee 79.7298 80.7332 80.187 78.8361 LYD Libyan Dinar 1.5972 1.6102 1.5709 1.5653 MYR Malaysian Ringgit 4.7317 4.7634 4.5953 4.6374 NGN Nigerian Naira 350.9425 360.9013 344.3221 343.0512 PES Chilean Peso 794.37 756.94 844.86 786.89 PLN Polish Zloty 4.3014 4.2615 4.2568 4.2976 RUB Russian Ruble 79.7153 74.0416 69.9563 72.4553 SAR Saudi Riyal 4.2938 4.4286 4.2128 4.198 SGD Singapore Dollar 1.5591 1.5926 1.5111 1.5273 TRY Turkish Lira (new) 6.0588 5.7077 6.6843 6.3578 USD US Dollar 1.145 1.181 1.1234 1.1195 NAM Namibian Dollar 16.4594 15.6188 15.7773 16.1753 CHF Swiss Franc 1.1269 1.155 1.0854 1.1124 GBP British Pound 0.89453 0.88471 0.8508 0.87777 DOP Dominican Peso 57.5242 58.3906 59.4629 57.3487 PKR Pakistani Rupee 160.1149 143.2823 173.9591 168.318 QAR Qatari Riyal 4.1678 4.2987 4.0892 4.0749 DKK Danish Krone 7.467300 7.453200 7.4715 7.4661 OMR Omani Rial 0.440300 0.454100 0.4319 0.4304 BsS Bolivar Soberano (VEF 2017) 729.8027 137.6549 52308.3738 14692.8696 When an investment in a consolidated entity is sold, the accumulated gain or loss recognised in equity is released to profit or loss. The consolidation criteria used to prepare these consolidated financial statements may be summarised as follows: subsidiaries are consolidated on a line-by-line basis, whereby: 234 • assets and liabilities, costs and revenue shown in the subsidiaries’ financial statements are fully recognised, regardless of the size of the investment therein; • the carrying amount of the investment is eliminated against the Group’s share of its equity; • the main transactions between consolidated entities, including dividends distributed among group companies, are eliminated; • non-controlling interests are shown separately under equity and their share of the profit or loss for the year is similarly shown separately in the statement of profit or loss. Investments in associates and joint ventures are measured using the equity method whereby the carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to consider: • standardisation to comply with the group accounting policies, where necessary; • the parent’s share of the profits or losses of the investee realised after the acquisition date; • modifications arising from changes in equity of the investee that are not taken to profit or loss as per the relevant IFRS; • dividends distributed by the investees; • any greater value paid at acquisition (measured using the same criteria set out in the section on “Business combinations”) and managed pursuant to the relevant standard; • the share of the profit or loss deriving from application of the equity method, which is taken to profit or loss. Interests in joint ventures that qualify as joint operations are recognised by the investor to the extent of its share of the rights and obligations held. Dividends, reversals of impairment losses and impairment losses on investments in consolidated companies, gains and losses on the intragroup exchange of investments in consolidated entities and the related tax effects are eliminated. Gains and losses arising from transactions between consolidated companies, which are not realised directly or indirectly through transactions with third parties, are eliminated. Unrealised intragroup losses are recognised when the transaction shows an impairment of the transferred asset. Business combinations Business combinations are recognised using the acquisition method set out in IFRS 3 (revised in 2008). Accordingly, the consideration for a business combination is measured at fair value, being the sum of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed or incurred by the Group at the acquisition date and the equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquired entity. Transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred. 235 The contingent consideration, included as part of the transfer price, is measured at acquisition-date fair value. Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition-date fair value. Goodwill is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests (NCI) and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree and the net fair value of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If the difference is negative, the resulting gain is recognised as a bargain purchase in profit or loss. NCI can be measured at fair value or at its proportionate share of the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. The measurement method is decided on a transaction by transaction basis. Business combination achieved in stages (step acquisition) In the case of step acquisitions, the Group’s existing investment in the acquiree is measured at fair value on the date that control is obtained. Any resulting adjustments to previously recognised assets and liabilities are recognised in profit or loss. Therefore, the previously held investment is treated as if it had been sold and reacquired on the date that control is obtained. Transactions involving NCI Changes to the investment percentage of a subsidiary that does not entail loss of control are treated as equity transactions. Therefore, any differences between the acquisition price and the related share of equity in subsequent acquisitions of investments in entities already controlled by the Group are recognised directly in equity. With respect to partial disposals of an investment in a subsidiary while control is retained, any gain or loss is recognised in equity. Basis of preparation The accounting policies adopted to draw up the Group’s consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019 comply with the IFRS and are consistent with those used to prepare the 2018 consolidated financial statements, except for the amendments enacted after 1 January 2019, summarised in the section on the “Changes in standards”. Accounting policies Property, plant and equipment Salini Impregilo Group has opted to recognise property, plant and equipment at purchase or production cost net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using rates determined based on the assets’ residual possible use. The annual rates are as follows: 236 Category Depreciation rate Land 0% Buildings 3% Plant and machinery from 10% to 20% Industrial and commercial equipment from 25% to 40% Other assets from 12% to 25% Land and buildings, plant and machinery with a carrying amount to be recovered mainly through their sale (rather than the asset’s continuing use) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale shall be available for immediate sale and their sale shall be highly probable (i.e., the related commitments already exist). Their price shall be reasonable compared to their fair value. Assets acquired as a result of business combinations are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date and remeasured within a year. Such amount reflects their purchase cost. After their initial recognition, they are measured at cost, depreciated over their estimated useful lives and shown net of any impairment losses. When an asset consists of different significant components with different useful lives, the significant components are recognised and subsequently measured separately. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances take place indicating that the carrying amount may not be recovered. Reference should be made to the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets” for details on impairment testing. Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition or construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, to the extent of its recoverable amount. As established by IAS 23 Borrowing costs, the Group has applied this method to all qualifying assets. Borrowing costs are capitalised when the costs of the acquisition of the asset and borrowing costs are incurred, and the activities necessary to bring the asset to a condition for its use have been started. The costs provided for but not yet paid related to qualifying assets are excluded from the amount to be capitalised. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted. Moreover, capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are complete. Subsequent expenditure is only capitalised if it increases the future economic benefits of the related asset. All other expenditure is expensed when incurred. Ordinary maintenance costs are fully expensed when incurred. Costs that increase the carrying amount of assets are allocated thereto and depreciated over their residual economic lives. 237 Dismantlement and restoration costs of assets used for contract work in progress are added to the cost of the related asset and depreciated in line with the depreciation pattern of the asset to which they refer when they are foreseeable and objectively determinable. Leasehold improvements are classified in the different items of property, plant and equipment on the basis of their nature. They are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the relevant asset and the residual term of the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognised in accordance with IFRS 16. More information about the application of this standard is available in note 2 “Changes in standards”. Rights to infrastructure under concession These rights are covered by IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements, issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), which regulates the recognition and measurement of concession arrangements between public sector entities and private sector operators. It was endorsed by the European Commission with EC regulation 254/2009 dated 25 March 2009 and its application is mandatory for financial statements drawn up under IFRS beginning from the year after which it was endorsed. Therefore, the Group has applied IFRIC 12 since 2010. The criteria adopted by the Group to apply the interpretation to its concessions are set out below. Scope and measurement Scope: IFRIC 12 is applicable to service concession arrangements when the grantor is a public body and the operator is a private entity, when the following conditions are met: a) the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and b) the grantor controls – through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement. Measurement of the revenue arising from the concession arrangement: the operator acts as the service provider (construction and management of the work) and recognises the revenue for the construction and upgrade services in accordance with IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. The grantor pays the operator a consideration for the construction/upgrade services, to be recognised at fair value, which may consist of rights to: (a) a financial asset (financial asset model); (b) an intangible asset (intangible asset model); (c) both (“mixed” model). The first model is applicable when the operator has an unconditional contractual right to receive a specified or determinable amount of cash. The second is applicable when the operator acquires the right to charge for use 238 of a public sector asset that it constructs or upgrades. The amounts are contingent on the extent to which the public uses the service (demand risk). Finally, the third model is applicable when both of the above situations are present. In this case, the intangible asset is determined as the difference between the fair value of the investment made and the present value of the financial asset obtained by discounting the cash flows from the minimum specified amount. The Group’s concession arrangements (via the operators consolidated on a line-by-line or proportionate basis) fall under the intangible asset model except for two immaterial concessions held by the subsidiaries of HCE Costruzioni Generali S.p.A., wholly owned by the parent, which fall under the “mixed model”. The financial asset model is applicable to certain equity-accounted associates. Recognition of the intangible asset: the intangible asset is recognised during construction of the infrastructure. The main identified cases are as follows: a. Arrangements that cover the construction of a new infrastructure: the operator recognises the intangible asset in line with the stage of completion of the construction project. During construction, the operator recognises revenue and costs in line with IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. b. Arrangements that cover management of an existing infrastructure and its extension or upgrading against which the operator acquires specific additional financial benefits: the operator recognises these construction and/or upgrade services in line with IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Arrangements that cover management of an existing infrastructure and specific obligations to extend or upgrade it against which the operator does not acquire additional specific financial benefits : at initial recognition, the operator recognises a liability equal to the present value of the forecast outlay for the construction services to be provided in the future with, as a balancing item, an additional component of the intangible asset for the contract consideration, which begins to be amortised. Contractual obligations for the infrastructure’s efficiency levels: given that the operator does not meet the requirements for recognition of the infrastructure as “Property, plant and equipment”, the accounting treatment differs depending on the nature of the work carried out and can be spit into two categories: (i) work related to normal maintenance of the infrastructure; (ii) replacement and scheduled maintenance at a future date. The first category relates to normal ordinary maintenance of the infrastructure, the cost of which is recognised in profit or loss when incurred, also under IFRIC 12. Given that the interpretation does not provide for the recognition of the physical asset but of a right, the second category is recognised in line with IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, which requires: (i) recognition of an accrual to a provision in profit or loss; and (ii) recognition of a provision for charges in the statement of financial position. Amortisation of the intangible asset: amortisation of the intangible asset recognised for the rights acquired under the concession arrangement is calculated in line with paragraph 97 of IAS 38 Intangible assets: “The amortisation method used shall reflect the pattern in which the asset’s future economic benefits are expected to be consumed by the entity. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method shall be used”. 239 Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are recognised at cost net of impairment losses. Goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is measured as the difference between the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration considered, the amount of any NCI and the acquisition-date fair value of the acquirer’s previously-held equity interest in the acquiree, and the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill deriving from acquisitions is not amortised. It is tested annually for impairment or whenever conditions arise that presume impairment as per IAS 36 Impairment of assets. For impairment testing purposes, goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date to each of the cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units CGU) that will benefit from the acquisition. The carrying amount of goodwill is monitored at cash-generating unit level for internal management purposes. Impairment is determined by defining the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of units) to which the goodwill is allocated. When the recoverable amount of the CGU (or group of CGUs) is lower than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. When goodwill is allocated to a CGU (or group of CGUs), the asset of which has been partly disposed of, the goodwill allocated to the disposed of asset is considered to determine any gain or loss deriving from the transaction. In this case, the transferred goodwill is measured using the amounts related to the disposed of asset compared to the asset still held by the unit. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired or generated internally are recognised under assets in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Those assets with finite useful lives are measured at acquisition or development cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Recoverability of their carrying amount is checked by using the criteria set out in the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets”. Other non-current assets (recognised in Other assets) Other non-current assets mainly consist of loans and receivables and claims related to completed or nearly completed contracts and companies in liquidation when their liquidation plan provides for the realisation of the assets after twelve months from the reporting date. These assets are measured at their estimated realisable value, by recognising allowances to adjust their carrying amount accordingly. Claims are only recognised for the amounts matured and that part which is held to be reasonably recoverable. The estimated realisable value is discounted if the time value of money is material depending on when settlement is expected to take place. 240 Impairment of non-financial assets If there is any indication that an intangible asset or an item of property, plant and equipment is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If a binding sales agreement does not exist, fair value is estimated using the observable prices of an active market, recent transactions or the best information available to reflect the amount the entity could obtain by disposing of the asset. Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset, net of taxes, and, if reasonably determinable, from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Discounting is applied by using a post-tax discount rate which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The assessment is made for individual assets or the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets from its continuing use (cash-generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment loss are no longer valid, the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill) is reversed and the adjustment is taken to profit or loss as a reversal of impairment losses. A reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent of the lower of the recoverable amount and original carrying amount less depreciation/amortisation that would have been recognised had the impairment loss not been recognised. Inventories of goods Inventories of goods are measured at the lower of average purchase cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the directly related costs and estimated realisable value is determined using the replacement cost of the asset or similar assets. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent years when the reasons therefor are no longer valid. Contract assets and liabilities Contract assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with the guidelines of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised using the five-step model as set out below: 1. Identify the contract with a customer; 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3. Determine the transaction price; 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. IFRS 15 also covers contract costs, contract modifications and financial statements disclosures. 241 The methods used by the Group to apply IFRS 15 are summarised below. 1. Identify the contract with a customer The Group identifies and measures contracts with customers in line with IFRS 15 after they have been signed and are binding, creating enforceable rights and obligations for the Group and the customer. The Group considers the criteria of IFRS 15.9 set out below to identify the contract: a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; d) the contract has commercial substance (i.e., the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and e) it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. 2. Identifying performance obligations and allocating the transaction price IFRS 15 identifies a performance obligation as a promise included in the contract with a customer to transfer: a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. In the Group’s case, its performance obligation is usually the entire project. In fact, although the individual performance obligations provided for in the contract are distinct, they are highly interdependent and integrated as the contract provides for the transfer of the entire infrastructure to the customer. However, certain contractual items include additional services that should be considered as distinct performance obligations. For example, these may be post-completion maintenance services after final inspection and additional or different contract warranties compared to those provided for by law or normal sector practices . When a contract has more than one performance obligation, the appropriate portion of the contract consideration should be allocated to each separate performance obligation pursuant to IFRS 15. The Group's contracts with customers usually specify the price of each contractual item (detailed in the contract). 3. Determining the criteria for satisfaction of the performance obligations and recognition of the revenue IFRS 15 provides that revenue shall be recognised when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied transferring the promised good or service (or asset) to the customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control. The Group’s contracts with customers are usually long-term contracts that include obligations to be satisfied over time based on the progress towards completion and transfer of control of the asset to the customer over time. 242 The reasons why recognition of revenue over time is considered the correct approach are: (i) the customer controls the asset as it is constructed (the asset is built directly in the area made available by the customer); (ii) the asset under construction does not have an alternative use and the company has an enforceable right to payment for its performance completed to date over the contract term. IFRS 15 requires that progress towards satisfaction of a performance obligation be measured using the method that best represents the transfer of control of the asset under construction to the customer. The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer. The Group considers its market sector and the complex mix of goods and services it provides when it selects the appropriate revenue recognition method. IFRS 15 provides for two alternative methods to recognise revenue over time: a) output method; b) input method. Output methods recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to the date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract (e.g., surveys of performance completed to date, milestones reached, units delivered, etc.). Input methods recognise revenue on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (e.g., resources consumed, labour hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed or machine hours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation (cost to cost method). The most appropriate method for measuring revenue is the cost to cost method calculated by applying the percentage of completion (the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs) to contract revenue. The calculation of the ratio of costs incurred to estimated costs only considers costs that contribute to the actual transfer of control of the goods and/or services. This method allows the objective measurement of the transfer of control to the customer as it considers quantitative variables related to the contract as a whole. When choosing the appropriate method for measuring the transfer of control to the customer, the Group did not adopt the output method (e.g., surveys of performance completed to date) for its ongoing contracts as it considered that although this output method would allow a direct measurement of progress, it would also lead to operating difficulties in managing and monitoring progress considering all the resources necessary to satisfy the obligation. In addition, an output method would entail the application of criteria and measurement inputs that are not directly observable and the incurring of excessive costs to obtain useful information. Finally, in the Group’s reference sector, the objective of contractual outputs (milestones) refers to, inter alia, modulation of cash flows to obtain financial resources useful to perform the contract and the definition of technical specifications of the works and related performance timing. 243 4. Determining the transaction price Given the engineering and operating complexities, the size and length of time involved in completing the contracts, in addition to the fixed consideration agreed in the contract, the transaction price also includes additional consideration, whose conditions need to be assessed. A claim is an amount that the contract seeks to collect as reimbursement for costs incurred (and/or to be incurred) due to reasons or events that could not be foreseen and are not attributable to the contractor, for more work performed (and/or to be performed) or variations that were not formalised in riders. The measurement of the additional consideration arising from claims is subject to a high level of uncertainty, given its nature, both in terms of the amounts that the customer will pay and the collection times, which usually depend on the outcome of negotiations between the parties or decisions taken by judicial/arbitration bodies. This type of consideration is regulated by IFRS 15 as “contract modifications”. The standard provides that a contract modification exists if it is approved by the parties to the contract. IFRS 15 provides that a contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices. A contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or price (or both) of the modification. The rights to the consideration shall be provided for contractually generating an enforceable right. Once the enforceable right has been identified, in order to recognise the claims and amount of the additional consideration requested, the company shall apply the guidance about the variable consideration given in IFRS 15. Therefore, in order to adjust the transaction price to include the additional consideration arising from the claims, the company shall decide whether it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in the future. The Group considers all the relevant aspects and circumstances such as the contract terms, business and negotiating practices of the sector or other supporting evidence when taking the above decision. 4.a Optional works The consideration for optional works is additional consideration for future works that have not yet been agreed and/or ordered by the customer when it signs the contract. The consideration for optional works is provided for in the contracts with the customer as it represents potential future work interrelated with the main contract object. However, most of the contracts provide that the additional works shall be specifically defined and approved by the customer before they start. Otherwise, the contractor does not have an enforceable right to payment for this performance. Accordingly and based on sector practices, this type of consideration is a contract modification and, under IFRS 15, shall be considered when measuring the transaction price if approved by both parties to the contract. In this case, the enforceable right can only be identified after specific approval or instructions from the customer in line with its customary business practices or operating methods. 4.b Penalties Contracts with customers may include penalties due to non-compliance with certain contract terms (such as, for example, non-compliance with delivery times). 244 When the contract penalties are “reasonably expected”, the transaction price is reduced accordingly. The company analyses all the indicators available at the reporting date to assess the probability of a contract default that would lead to the application of penalties. 4.c Significant financing component It is normal practice in the construction and large-scale infrastructure sector that the transaction price for the project (which is usually completed over more than one year) is paid in the form of an advance and subsequent progress billing (based on progress reports). This method of allocating cash flows is often defined in the calls for tenders. The customer’s payment flows (advances and subsequent progress billing) are usually organised to make construction of the project by the contractor feasible, limiting its financial exposure. Constructors in the large-scale infrastructure sector build projects for large amounts of money and the initial outlay is usually high. The contract advance is used for the following reasons: • to finance the initial contract investments and pay the related advances to subcontractors; • as a form of guarantee to cover any risks of contractual breach by the customer. The advance is reabsorbed by the subsequent progress billing in line with the stage of completion of the contract. Furthermore, the Group's operating cycle is generally several years. Therefore, it considers the correct timescale of its works to determine whether its contracts include a significant financing component. Based on the above, it has not identified significant financing components in the transaction price for the contracts that include changes in the advances or progress billings in line with sector practices and/or of amounts that are suitable as guarantees and have a timeframe in line with the cash flows required to complete the contract. 5. Losses to complete The new standard does not specifically cover the accounting treatment of loss-making contracts but refers to IAS 15, which regulates the measurement and classification (previously covered by IAS 11) of onerous contracts. IAS 37 provides that an onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The present obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a provision when the loss is probable based on the most recent forecasts prepared by management. The unavoidable costs are all those costs that: • are directly proportionate to the contract and increase the performance obligation transferred to the customer; • do not include those costs that will be incurred regardless of satisfaction of the performance obligation; • cannot be avoided by the company through future actions. 245 Measurement of any loss-making contracts (the onerous test) is performed at individual performance obligation level. This approach best represents the different contract profits or losses depending on the nature of the goods and services transferred to the customer. 6. Contract costs 6.a Incremental costs of obtaining a contract IFRS 15 allows an entity to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an asset if it expects to recover those costs through the future economic benefits of the contract. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer. Costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained shall be recognised as an expense when incurred (costs not explicitly chargeable to the customer). The incremental costs are recognised as an asset (contract costs) and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. 6.b Costs to fulfil a contract Under IFRS 15, an entity shall recognise an asset from the costs incurred to fulfil a contract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria: • the costs relate directly to a contract; • the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and • the costs are expected to be recovered. It is the practice of the Group’s sector that these costs usually consist of pre-operating costs that are recognised by customers and included in precise contract items or are not explicitly recognised and are covered by the contract profit. Formal recognition of these costs implies that, when they are incurred, control of the asset provided for in the contract is transferred. Therefore, they cannot be recognised as assets and contribute to the stage of completion. When the contract provides for their explicit recognition and the above three criteria are met, the pre-operating costs are recognised as assets and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of control of the goods and/or services to the customer. In addition, IFRS 15 defines all those costs that, by their nature, do not contribute to the stage of completion as, although they are referred to in the contract and can be recovered, they do not contribute to generating or enhancing the resources that will be used to satisfy the performance obligations or to transfer of control of the good and/or service to the customer. 7. Presentation in the consolidated financial statements The statement of financial position includes “Contract costs” under intangible assets which includes the costs capitalised under the criteria described in point 6 of this section. Amortisation of these costs is included in the statement of profit or loss item “Amortisation, depreciation and provisions”. 246 Contract assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position items “Contract assets” and “Contract liabilities”, respectively under assets and liabilities. The classification in line with IFRS 15 depends on the relationship between the Group’s performance obligation and payment by the customer. These items show the sum of the following components analysed individually for each customer: (+) Amount of work performed calculated using the cost-to-cost method pursuant to IFRS 15 (-) Progress payments and advances received (-) Contractual advances. When the total is positive, the net balance is recognised as a Contract asset . If it is negative, it is recognised as a Contract liability . When the amounts represent an unconditional right to payment of the consideration, they are recognised as financial assets. The Group’s statement of profit or loss includes a revenue item “Revenue from contracts with customers” to comply with IFRS 15. This revenue is presented and measured in accordance with the new standard. The item “Other income” includes income from transactions other than contracts with customers and is measured in line with other standards or the Group’s specific accounting policy elections. It includes income related to gains on the sale of non-current assets, income on cost recharges, prior year income and income from the recharging of costs of Italian consortia and consortium companies. With respect to the last item, the Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system. Under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11, these entities have been classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As this income does not arise on the performance of the contract obligations or contract negotiations, it is recognised as “Other income”. Real estate projects Closing inventories of real estate projects are those real estate areas developed with a view to selling them. They are measured at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value. Costs incurred consist of the consideration paid for purchasing the areas and related charges, construction costs and borrowing costs related to the project up to and not exceeding its completion. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with a term of less than three months. This item is shown in the statement of cash flows net of bank borrowings at the reporting date. Equity investments Investments in entities other than subsidiaries, associates, joint operations and joint ventures (reference for which should be made to the section on “Consolidation scope”) are classified as “Equity investments” at the time of their acquisition and are included in the financial assets at fair value through profit or loss category required by IFRS 9. 247 Since they mainly relate to consortia and consortium companies of which the Group holds less than 20%, in accordance with IFRS 9, such investments are stated as non-current assets. Dividend income from such financial instruments is recognised in profit or loss under financial income when the group companies holding the investments are given the right to such dividend. Financial instruments Financial assets – Debt instruments Financial assets, which are debt instruments, are classified in the following three categories depending on the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing them: (i) financial assets at amortised cost; (ii) financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); (iii) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price. After initial recognition, financial assets that generate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold them in order to collect contractual cash flows (hold to collect business model). Under the amortised cost method, the financial assets’ amount at initial recognition is decreased by principal repayments, any loss allowance and cumulated amortisation of the difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount. Amortisation is calculated using the effective interest rate that exactly discounts the expected future cash flows to their initial carrying amount. Loans and receivables and other financial assets at amortised cost are recognised net of the related loss allowance. Debt instruments held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets (hold to collect and sell model) are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value gains and losses on these financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The cumulative fair value gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, exchange differences and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Debt instruments that are not measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets that are transferred are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are transferred to third parties. 248 Impairment losses on financial assets The company tests the recoverable amount of debt instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss using the expected credit loss model. This model develops estimates of the impact of changes in economic factors on the expected credit losses using a probability-weighted outcome. The Group found that, given the characteristics of its business sector, credit risk is that deriving from its exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) noncompliance with their obligations. Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of the characteristics of the countries in which the Group's activities should be carried out and the customers, which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer. Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers in relation to contract work in progress as a whole. Loans and borrowings and bonds Loans and borrowings and bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received less transaction costs. After initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost, whereby repayments are determined using the effective interest method with a rate which matches, at initial recognition, the expected cash flows with the initial carrying amount. Loan transaction costs are classified under liabilities decreasing the loan; amortised cost is calculated considering these costs and any discounts or premiums expected at settlement. The effects arising from the recognition at amortised cost are taken to “Financing income (costs)”. Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities (a) Financial assets A financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or parts of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; (ii) the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in full and immediately; (iii) the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the related control. When the Group has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or has retained control, it continues to 249 recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of guaranteeing the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consideration that the Group could be required to pay. (b) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognised when the underlying obligation is extinguished, cancelled or settled. When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another by the same lender at substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, this exchange or modification is treated as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss. Derivatives and hedging transactions Salini Impregilo Group has derivatives recognised at fair value when the related agreement is signed and for subsequent fair value changes. The treatment of the related fair value gains or losses changes depending on whether the conditions for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 are met, as described below. Salini Impregilo Group has derivatives to hedge currency and financial risks. At the inception of the transaction, it documents the hedging relationship, its risk management and strategy objectives in entering into the transaction, the hedging instrument and hedged item or transaction and the nature of the hedged risk. Moreover, at the inception of the transaction and thereafter on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether or not the hedge meets the effectiveness requirements to offset its exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. “Hedging purposes” are assessed considering risk management objectives. When they do not meet the requirements of IFRS 9 for hedge accounting, the derivatives are classified as “Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. Employee benefits • Defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans The Group has pension plans for its employees that are classified either as defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans depending on their characteristics. Defined benefit plans include the benefits the employees will receive when they retire and which are usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and remuneration. The Group recognises a liability for these defined benefits equal to the present value of its obligation at year end, including any adjustments for unrecognised costs related to past service less the fair value of the plan assets. The Group calculates its liability once a year using the projected unit credit method. Present value is calculated by discounting the future outlays using the interest rate applied to high quality corporate bonds with a currency and term consistent with the currency and estimated term of the postemployment benefit obligations. Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans arising from changes in the underlying assumptions or in the plan conditions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service cost is expensed immediately. The Group pays benefits to public and 250 private pension funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis for the defined contribution plans. The contributions are recognised as personnel expense. The Group contributes to multi-employer pension plans via its US subsidiaries. These plans pool the assets contributed by the various entities to provide benefits to the employees of more than one entity determining the contribution and benefit levels without regard to the identity of the entity that employs the employees concerned. The Group recognises these plans as defined contribution plans. • Short-term and long-term benefits Short-term employee benefits, that is, payable within twelve months of the end of the year in which the employees rendered the service, are recognised as a cost and as a liability for the undiscounted amount of benefits expected to be paid in exchange for that service. Long-term benefits, such as remuneration to be paid after twelve months of the end of the year in which the employees rendered the service, are recognised as liabilities for an amount equal to the present value of the benefits at the reporting date. • Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits are recognised at the present value of the Group’s liability determined in line with ruling legislation and national and in-house labour agreements. The valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is carried out by independent actuaries. The gains and losses resulting from the actuarial calculation are recognised in profit or loss if related to service costs and interest expense or in comprehensive income if relating to assets and liabilities. The 2007 Finance Act and related implementing decrees introduced significant changes to legislation governing Italian post-employment benefits, effective as from 1 January 2007. These include the option given to employees, to be exercised before 30 June 2007, of where to allocate their future benefits. Specifically, employees can opt to allocate them to selected pension funds or maintain them with the company, in which case, the latter shall pay the contributions to the treasury fund of INPS (the Italian social security institution). Following these changes, the Italian post-employment benefits accruing after the date of the employees’ decision and, in any case, after 30 June 2007, are considered part of a defined contribution plan and treated like all other social security contributions. • Share-based payments Share-based payments are measured at fair value of the option at the grant date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This treatment is based on an assessment of the stock options that will effectively vest in favour of the qualifying employees. Fair value is determined using the share price at the grant date. Income taxes Current taxes are provided for using the enacted tax rates and laws ruling in Italy and other countries in which the Group operates, based on the best estimate of the taxable profit for the year. Group companies net tax assets and liabilities when this is legally allowed. 251 The parent set up the national tax consolidation system pursuant to article 117 and subsequent articles of Presidential decree no. 917/86 on 1 January 2004. In 2019, 11 of the parent’s Italian subsidiaries joined the system, which is regulated by the specific consolidation mechanisms. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets are recognised when the Group holds their recovery to be probable. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and, to the extent necessary, is decreased when it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to use all or part of the related benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities, respectively, and are netted at company level if related to taxes that may be offset. If the balance is positive, it is recognised as “Deferred tax assets”, if not, as “Deferred tax liabilities”. Taxes that could arise from the transfer of undistributed profits by subsidiaries are only calculated when the subsidiary has the positive intention to transfer such profits. In the case of transactions recognised directly in equity, the related deferred tax asset or liability also affects equity. Provisions for risks and charges In accordance with IAS 37, the Group makes accruals to provisions for risks and charges when the following conditions exist: • the Group or a group company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) at the reporting date as a result of a past event where an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; • it is probable that the obligation (through an outflow of resources) will have to be settled; • a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the time value is material and the obligation payment dates can be estimated reliably, the amount recognised as the provision equals the pre-tax future cash flows (i.e., forecast outflows) discounted at a rate that reflects the present market value and risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to discounting is recognised as a financial expense. When the expected cash flows are included in an estimate range with the same probability of occurrence, the median value is discounted to measure the liability. Provision for restructuring costs is recognised when the parent or relevant group company has approved a detailed formal plan that has been implemented and communicated to the third parties involved. 252 Translation criteria for foreign currency items and translation of financial statements of consolidated companies or companies measured using the equity method expressed in currencies other than the Euro The translation criteria for foreign currency items adopted by the Group are as follows: • foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing spot rate with any exchange rate gains or losses taken to the statement of profit or loss; • non-monetary assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost denominated in the foreign currency and translated using the historical exchange rate; • revenue and costs related to foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction; • any material effects deriving from changes in exchange rates after the reporting date are disclosed in the notes. With respect to the translation of financial statements of consolidated companies or companies measured using the equity method and expressed in currencies other than the presentation currency (functional currency), reference should be made to the section on the “Basis of consolidation”. The Group has applied IAS 29 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies for its subsidiaries and associates that prepare their financial statements in a functional currency of a hyperinflationary economy. This standard requires that the financial statements of an entity, whose functional currency is that of a hyperinflationary economy, be translated at the closing spot rate. The statement of financial position items not yet translated into Euros at the reporting date are redetermined using a general price index. All the statement of profit or loss items are translated into Euros at the exchange rate ruling on the date the revenue and costs were initially recognised. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Assets held for sale are recognised as such when the following events take place: • signing of a binding sales agreement; • approval and communication of a formal sales plan by directors. In order to be correctly measured, the assets shall be: • available for immediate sale in their present condition; • subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and • the sale must be highly probable and expected to take place within twelve months. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 253 A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and that meets any of the following criteria: i) it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; ii) it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or iii) it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a plan to resell. The profit or loss from discontinued operations is disclosed separately in the statement of profit or loss. As required by paragraph 34 of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the corresponding prior year figures are reclassified accordingly. Revenue from contracts with customers Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised using the five-step model: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. More information is available in the “Contract assets and liabilities” paragraph of these notes. Interest income Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis, considering the principal and applicable effective interest rate, i.e., the rate that discounts the estimated future inflows over the expected life of the financial asset to return it to its carrying amount. Dividends Dividends are recognised when the investors’ right to receive payment arises in line with local ruling legislation. Earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings per share are calculated as the ratio of the profit or loss for the year attributable to the holders of the ordinary shares of the parent to the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share are calculated considering the potential diluting effect of exercise of their rights by the holders of rights that potentially have a diluting effect on shares when calculating the number of outstanding shares. Operating segments The operating segments comply with the reporting system provided to group management which is in charge of allocating the resources and assessing the results obtained by the segments. The Group’s management and organisational structure presents the segments according to a geographical breakdown in macro-areas, on the basis of the Italy, Abroad and Lane Group segments. The intrasegment transfer prices related to the exchange of goods and services are agreed at normal market conditions. 254 Complex accounting estimates Preparation of financial statements and the related notes in accordance with the IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and financial statements disclosures. The estimates are used to: • recognise goodwill (see section 5 “Business combinations”); • determine amortisation and depreciation (see the “Property, plant and machinery”, “Leased property, plant and equipment”, “Rights to infrastructure under concession” and “Other intangible assets” paragraphs of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise impairment losses (see the “Impairment of non-financial assets” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise employee benefits (see the “Employee benefits” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise taxes (see the “Income taxes” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise provisions for risks and charges (see the “Provisions for risks and charges” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • determine contract revenue, including claims for additional consideration, total contract costs and the related stage of completion (see the “Contract assets and liabilities” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section). A significant part of the Group’s activities is typically performed on the basis of contracts which provide that a specific consideration is agreed when the contract is awarded. This implies that the profits on these contracts may undergo change compared to the original estimates depending on the recoverability of greater expenses and/or costs the Group may incur during performance of such contracts. Recognition of additional consideration by associates may entail adjustment of their equity due to standardisation with the Group’s accounting policies. The actual results may differ from those estimated due to uncertainties underlying the assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates are based. Fundamental assumptions about the future and other reasons for uncertainty when making the estimates at the reporting date that may lead to material adjustments to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities are described in the specific section of the Directors’ report on the main risk factors and uncertainties. Change in Condotte’s interest in COCIV The COCIV consortium (the “consortium” or “COCIV”) was assigned the project for the definitive and executive design and construction of the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section/Giovi third railway crossing with an agreement signed with TAV S.p.A. on 16 March 1992 (the “agreement”) and subsequent rider signed with Ferroviaria Italiana S.p.A. (“RFI”), which replaced TAV S.p.A. after it merged into RFI, on 11 November 2011 (the “rider”). COCIV’s membership structure varied over time due to a number of events that led to the following structure on 19 December 2019: 255 Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 64% Società Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. (“Condotte”) 31% Civ S.p.A. (“Civ”), in which Salini Impregilo has a 85% investment 5% In 2018 and 2019, Condotte faced a serious financial crisis and applied for extraordinary administration pursuant to Decree law no. 347/2003, converted with amendments by Law no. 39/2004. The application was allowed by the Ministerial decree of 6 August 2018 and the Rome Court resolution of 14 August 2018 declaring Condotte insolvent. Accordingly, Condotte is now operating under the extraordinary administration procedure. During the validity of the extraordinary administration, Condotte failed to fulfil its consortium obligations provided for by COCIV’s by-laws (the “by-laws”), as well as the consortium members’ agreements supplementing the provisions of the by-laws (the “consortium members’ agreements”). Specifically, Condotte failed to provide COCIV with the counter-guarantees necessary to allow COCIV to obtain the guarantees to be provided to RFI when the contracts for the construction lots into which the work was divided by RFI (and before that by the CIPE) were signed due to the need to have the financial resources necessary for the project’s construction. The breach occurred in connection with the fifth and sixth construction lots’ contract execution, following RFI’s notifications of 17 December 2018 and 27 June 2019, respectively. In both cases, the consortium was only able to remedy Condotte’s breaches thanks to the other two members (Salini Impregilo and CIV), which provided the necessary counter-guarantees that Condotte had not given, thereby enabling COCIV to obtain the guarantees from the banks to be provided to RFI. After having formally challenged Condotte’s failure to comply with its counter-guarantee obligations for the fifth construction lot, in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements, on 18 April 2019, COCIV passed a resolution of the board of representatives the competent body under the by-laws (the “first resolution”), whereby: (i) it ordered the reduction in Condotte’s interest to the minimum interest allowed (0.001%); (ii) it allocated the portion so decreased to the other consortium members (specifically to Salini Impregilo, as CIV refused); (iii) it adopted the necessary amendments to the by-laws following the changes in the consortium’s membership structure; (iv) it adopted other necessary measures for the ordered reduction in Condotte’s interest. In order to enforce the reallocation among the other consortium members of the defaulting member’s decreased interest and the consequent amendment to its by-laws vis-a-vis RFI, the by-laws required the latter’s consent. Therefore, anticipating that the customer would have given its consent in a timely manner, in connection with the first resolution, COCIV passed a single resolution to reduce and increase interests and amend its by-laws (unifying the internal and external effects of its resolution into a single act). Taking into account RFI’s position in relation to the first resolution during the interlocutory stage, when Condotte’s second, serious and repeated 256 breach occurred, the consortium modified the structure of its resolutions, progressively and separately dealing firstly with its internal effects (to which RFI is unrelated) and secondly with its external effects and the consequent by-laws amendment, subjecting only the latter resolution to RFI’s consent. Condotte challenged the first resolution pursuant to the arbitration clause in article 27 of the by-laws. It also filed a petition under article 700 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure with the Genoa Court seeking inter alia suspension of the effects of the first resolution. The Genoa Court dismissed the case on 28 June 2019, and the decision was upheld in Condotte’s appeal. The arbitration panel appointed to resolve the dispute on the first resolution commenced by Condotte was formed on 13 January 2020. In the meantime, acknowledging the dispute on the first resolution commenced by Condotte, RFI informed the consortium that it would give its consent to the amendments to the by-laws concerning the modified membership structure resulting from the first resolution only after settlement of the dispute, given the fact that the resolution included both issues and not wanting to take a position on the dispute. As mentioned above, however, Condotte reiterated its breach of contract in connection with the sixth construction lot, again failing to provide its counter-guarantees required by the Consortium (since its interest remained at 31% as the first resolution was ineffective during the period in which the condition had to be satisfied). As a result, COCIV’s board of representatives adopted the consequent resolutions on 19 December 2019, after having issued the required notice to comply, which remained unsuccessful. As indicated above and different to the first resolution, the board of representatives has structured these resolutions differently, in order not to involve RFI directly in the part relating to Condotte’s failure to comply. In particular: • a resolution (the “second resolution” or “reduction resolution”) adopted also with the participation of Condotte (which, however, was precluded from voting under the by-laws), on the basis of the breaches that had occurred, reduced Condotte’s interest to the minimum interest of 0.001%, at the same time excluding Condotte’s representatives from the consortium bodies. This resolution took immediate effect and solely affected the consortium’s internal relationships; • another resolution (the “third resolution” or “reallocation resolution”), passed by the board in its modified composition as per the second resolution: ordered the proportionate allocation of the interest previously held by Condotte (including the rights attached thereto) to the other two members that replaced Condotte when it failed to comply. This resolution took immediate effect and solely affected the consortium members; approved the amendment to the by-laws relating to the new interest percentages in the consortium, subjecting its effectiveness to RFI’s required consent and, hence, to the reallocation resolution’s production of external effects, which is its enforcement vis-a-vis RFI; this enforcement would trigger the enforceability of the amendment to the by-laws. 257 As a result of the content of the third resolution, on 20 December 2019, COCIV requested RFI’s consent which was necessary to enforce the approved by-laws amendment (without prejudice to the immediate enforceability of the second resolution and of the internal effects of the third resolution). In the meantime, the term (31 December 2019) set for the coming into force of the first resolution passed unsuccessfully and, therefore, not only did such resolution not produce any legal effect up to that term, but it can never produce any future effects (with the related consequences on the first arbitration proceeding commenced by Condottee). Condotte lodged a second request for arbitration against the second resolution again under the by-laws. Acknowledging again there was a dispute commenced by Condotte against the second resolution (solely in relation to the amendment to the by-laws for which its consent was required), on 20 February 2020, RFI informed COCIV and its members Salini Impregilo, Condotte and CIV that “it was not in a position to decide on the request for consent made by COCIV”. It also added that “pursuant to the applicable contractual provisions, RFI’s consent would [have] be [been] given only after completion of a specific investigation into the subsequent allocation among the other consortium members, including in order to check that the legal and contractual requirements are still met”. With the support of its legal advisors, Salini Impregilo carried out an analysis of the effects of the resolutions and the arbitration proceedings proposed by Condotte on its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, based on the above analysis, the parent believes that: ▪ the reduction resolution is valid as it was passed in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements as a contractually-obliged result of Condotte’s serious breach. The breach is serious, which is further confirmed by Condotte’s large interest in the consortium before the reduction to the minimum interest (over 30%, on the basis of which the proportional obligation to provide counter-guarantees for COCIV is calculated) and by the fact that, under the structure that the consortium has developed over time in order to perform the contract with RFI (the consortium’s sole object), the provision of counter-guarantees is absolutely the members’ prevailing obligation and is essential to enable the consortium to perform the contract with RFI; ▪ the reduction resolution sets out the consequences of the reduction to the minimum interest of Condotte’s interest in the consortium’s business (and the consortium fund) in accordance with the agreements in force and, hence, it was validly passed; ▪ the reduction resolution was also immediately effective because (a) it could be passed and (b) it was declared to be passed as such. It relates to the internal relationships among consortium members and is, therefore, immediately enforceable and productive of the related effects, including financial (also considering that the provisions of the by-laws and the consortium members’ agreements for the automatic proportional allocation of any interests transferred from other consortium members and that the consortium members’ agreements even states that the takeover is as a precise obligation). 258 The possibility of reducing the defaulting member’s interest in the consortium to the minimum interest with immediate effect complies with the by-laws, which do not subject this decision to RFI’s approval, as such approval is only required for the by-laws amendment relating to a change in the consortium’s membership structure and can be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties; ▪ the reallocation resolution was passed in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements and, as such, is fully valid. On the other hand, it may not be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties, since the former has a real right of veto on the takeover, which is consistent with its role as customer that is entitled to carry out any checks of the consortium’s (ongoing) satisfaction of the legal and contractual requirements, as RFI has reserved the right to do after the end of the arbitration procedure about the reduction resolution. Therefore, summing up the above, with regard to the effectiveness of the reallocation resolution, the following distinction should be made: for the purposes of the internal relationships among consortium members, the resolution is immediately enforceable and productive of effects, including financial, as confirmed by the provisions of the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements for an automatic proportional allocation of the interests transferred from other consortium members and, in the case of the consortium members’ agreement, a takeover obligation; the reallocation resolution, on the other hand, may not be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties, since the former has a real right of veto on the takeover, which is consistent with its role as customer that is entitled to carry out any checks of the consortium’s (ongoing) satisfaction of the legal and contractual requirements, as it has reserved the right to do after the end of the arbitration procedure about the reduction resolution. With regard to the consortium’s ongoing satisfaction of the relevant requirements following the amendment to its by-laws, according to the consortium’s legal advisors, if RFI found that COCIV met all the requirements to carry out the contracted work in compliance with the contract documents, despite its members including an insolvent party (Condotte), it can only confirm such an assessment when evaluating the enforceability of the reallocation of the interest transferred from Condotte, which improves, in every significant way, the requirements that can be met by the consortium (primarily, its ability to fulfil its obligations, including its guarantee obligations). Since RFI has not subordinated its consent to anything else, supported by the opinion of its legal advisors, the company believes that the above resolutions will be maintained by the arbitration proceedings underway and RFI’s subsequent assessments; ▪ on the basis of the opinions of its legal advisors, the Group believes that there are reasonable grounds that the arbitration award will be favourable for COCIV, allowing RFI to express its conclusions on the few issues mentioned above. Further to the resolutions of 19 December 2019, the consortium’s membership structure in relation to the rights and obligations resulting from the contract with RFI is as follows: 259 Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 97.753% Civ S.p.A. (“Civ”), in which Salini Impregilo has a 85% investment 7.246% Società Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. (“Condotte”) 0.001% The increase in the Salini Impregilo Group entities’ ideal interests in the contract (held by COCIV) resulting from the reallocation of Condotte’s interest led to a rise in the carrying amount of contract assets relating to the COCIV contract of €107.5 million recognised as revenue from contracts with customers in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 15 as the conditions for contract variations and variable considerations are met 5. Business combinations Acquisition of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. The Group signed the agreement for the acquisition of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. on 29 March 2019 (more information is available in the “Progetto Italia” paragraph of the “Key events of the year” section in the Directors’ report). It initially provided that the investee’s share capital of €10,000,000, comprising 10,000,000 shares, would be held by Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (80% for 8,000,000 shares) and Banca Popolare di Sondrio Soc. Coop. P.A. (2,000,000 shares). The transaction price was €534, including €500 to Società Italiana Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. and €34 to Ferfina S.p.A. for their investments. As provided for in the agreements with Società Italiana Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A., the parent took over its liability with Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. as per article 1273.1 of the Italian Civil Code by signing sales contracts for assets on 29 March 2019, solely for the part attributable to the seller (€4,601,583). The acquisition agreement also included put and call options for the non-controlling interests to be exercised in 2022 and/or 2024. Salini Impregilo measured these options’ fair value using the forecast data of the subsidiary, which is still undergoing a reorganisation at the date of preparation of this report. Based on this measurement, performed with the assistance of the parent’s consultants, recognition of a contingent consideration at the reporting date was not necessary. On 8 April 2019, in their extraordinary meeting, the shareholders of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. approved a capital increase of €2,598,426 (without a premium) to take place through the issue of 2,598,426 shares. The shareholder Salini Impregilo S.p.A. waived its right and Banca Popolare di Sondrio Soc. Coop. P.A. subscribed the entire increase. Subsequently, the bank sold 2,299,213 Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. shares to Liri S.r.l.. As a result, Salini Impregilo S.p.A. controls Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. with a 63.5% stake. The two non-controlling investors are Banca Popolare di Sondrio Soc. Coop. P.A. and Liri S.r.l. with 18.25% each. Salini Impregilo availed of the option allowed by IFRS 3 (revised) to provisionally allocate the transaction cost to the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed. 260 The following table summarises Salini Impregilo’s share of the assets and liabilities of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. at the acquisition date and their fair value measured on a provisional basis at such date for the PPA procedure: (€’000) Carrying amount Fair value Non-current assets 35,781 27,063 of which: Property, plant and equipment 11,366 11,366 Right-of-use assets 2,088 2,088 Goodwill 3,011 Equity investments 13,609 13,609 Deferred tax assets 5,707 Inventories 3,201 3,201 Trade receivables 19,288 21,704 Cash and cash equivalents 706 706 Contract assets 4,497 10,286 Current financial assets 10,387 10,387 Other current assets 6,306 3,552 Total assets 80,166 76,899 Post-employment benefits and employee benefits 352 352 Non-current bank loans and borrowings 13,127 13,127 Provisions for risks and charges 1,029 1,029 Trade payables 28,142 28,142 Other current liabilities 11,306 10,812 Current bank loans and borrowings 16,190 16,190 Total liabilities 70,146 69,651 Net assets acquired 10,020 7,247 Less non-controlling interests (3,657) (2,645) Net assets acquired (net of non-controlling interests) 6,363 4,602 At the acquisition date, gross trade receivables amounted to €19.6 million and the loss allowance to €0.3 million.

Other changes in the consolidation scope Other than the acquisition of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A., no other changes in the consolidation scope took place during the reporting period.The number of consolidated companies varies due to the set up of new companies to manage contracts acquired during the year. 262 6. Segment reporting Segment reporting is presented according to macro geographical regions, based on the management review approach adopted by senior management, for the ‘“Italy”, “Abroad” and “Lane Group” operating segments. Costs relating to activities which are carried out by the parent, Salini Impregilo, called “Corporate” costs, are attributed to the Italy segment and relate to: • planning of human and financial resources; • coordination and assistance with the group companies’ administrative, tax, legal/corporate and institutional and business communications requirements. These costs amounted to €153.0 million for 2019 compared to €163.6 million for the previous year. Management measures the segments’ results by considering their operating profit. It measures their equity structure using their net invested capital. Disclosures on the Group’s performance by business segment are set out in the Directors’ report. The consolidated financial statements figures are summarised below by operating segment. 263 Statement of profit or loss by operating segment 2018 Italy (*) Abroad LANE Group Total (€’000) Revenue from contracts with customers 358,623 3,720,031 785,488 4,864,142 Other income 133,686 197,414 2,418 333,518 Total revenue 492,309 3,917,445 787,906 5,197,660 Operating expenses Production costs (407,308) (2,868,436) (590,632) (3,866,376) Personnel expenses (168,060) (386,360) (219,996) (774,416) Other operating expenses (39,116) (84,703) (19,784) (143,603) Total operating expenses (614,484) (3,339,499) (830,412) (4,784,395) Gross operating profit (loss) (122,175) 577,946 (42,506) 413,265 Gross operating profit margin % -24.8% 14.8% -5.4% 8.0% Impairment losses (**) (26,632) (167,888) (194,519) Amortisation, depreciation and provisions (21,851) (118,564) (10,236) (150,651) Operating profit (loss) (170,658) 291,494 (52,742) 68,095 Return on Sales 1.3% Net financing costs and net losses on equity investments (102,308) Loss before tax (34,213) Income taxes (39,274) Loss from continuing operations (73,487) Profit from discontinued operations 114,802 Profit for the year 41,315 (*) The operating profit includes the costs of the central units and other general costs of €163.6 million.

These disposals mostly refer to the nearly completed Red Line North Underground project in Doha (Qatar) (€4.5 million), COCIV (€4.3 million) and Lane Group (€4.3 million); • an increase in assets under construction and payments on account, mostly related to the Australian joint venture for the Snowy 2.0 hydropower plant; • the change in consolidation scope mostly refers to the acquisition of Cossi Group and its line-by-line consolidation; • the reclassifications show the effect of the items recognised in “Right-of-use assets”. 8. Right-of-use assets Right-of-use assets amount to €144.2 million and reflect the application of IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach whereby the cumulative effect of the FTA is recognised in retained earnings at 1 January 2019. Therefore, the Group has not restated the figures at 1 December 2018, presented in accordance with IAS 17. More information about the application of the new standard is available in the section on “Changes in standards”.

The item is not amortised as the concession is currently inoperative. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report. On 3 December 2018, the Terni Court ruled that the subconcession for the car park in Terni held by Corso del Popolo S.p.A. was terminated. The operator appealed against this ruling and concurrently formally invited the Terni municipal authorities to rebalance the economic and financial plan commencing arbitration procedures on 15 March 2019. The Terni municipal authorities notified its intention of analysing the identified issues through an expert panel, which should complete its work in the first half of 2020. Should the Terni municipal authorities not agree with the rebalancing proposals made by the expert panel, the group company will take the appropriate legal action to recover its assets. Its legal advisors are confident that the outcome should be in its favour. 271 No indications of impairment were identified during the year and, therefore, the Group did not perform the impairment test. Contract costs of €127.4 million decreased by €13.7 million on 31 December 2018. They comprise contract acquisition costs, the incremental costs of obtaining the contract and costs to fulfil the contract. These costs are amortised in line with the percentage of completion of the related contracts.

With respect to the item “Iricav Due (Verona Padua railway line section)”, amortisation of the acquisition cost will commence when work starts. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract increased by €11.5 million at 31 December 2019 and mainly relate to Lot 2 of the Riachuelo project in Argentina awarded to Fisia Italimpianti in 2019. The costs to fulfil the contract mostly comprise COCIV’s pre-operating costs. There are no indicators of impairment for the contracts to which the costs refer. Other intangible assets amount to €2.0 million, in line with the 31 December 2018 figure.

The main assumptions adopted to calculate value in use are as follows: • long-term growth rate: 1.74%; • post-tax discount rate: 7.4% The Group has adopted the discount rate calculated based on the market cost of money and the asset sector’s specific risk (Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC). Specifically, the Group considered the return rate on long-term government bonds and the average capital structure of a basket of comparable companies. The CGU’s recoverable amount has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the five-year 2020-2024 plan prepared and approved by management. The terminal value is based on a sustainable profit assumption, from which stable long-term operating cash flows have been estimated, on a going concern basis. The Group also performed sensitivity analyses of the recoverable amount, considering the potential effect of changes in the reference parameters of the discount rate (+4.1%) and terminal value (reduction of 49%). The Group tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting date, supported by independent experts who carried out an independent business review, which showed that the CGU’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount (net invested capital). 11. Equity investments Equity investments increased by €104.2 million to €642.5 million.

The overall effect on profit or loss is analysed in note 37 and includes the changes in the provision for risks on equity investments set out in note 28. Dividends from equity-accounted investees mainly refer to the Argentine operators and the non-consolidated joint ventures of Lane Group. Impairment of equity investments The assessments underlying the impairment tests were performed in line with previous years, considering: ▪ internal procedures; ▪ IAS 36; ▪ the guidance and recommendations of the main market regulators. The Group used the actual and forward-looking financial data prepared by the investees' management to: ▪ identify the trigger events (as per IAS 36), such as the distribution of dividends, the actual and expected contract outcome on a whole lifecycle basis and any negative difference between the carrying amount of the equity investment and the Group's share of the investee's equity; ▪ perform valuations with external experts to obtain adequate technical and methodological support once the impairment test process and items to be tested had been approved. ▪ check that no equity investments had been recognised with a carrying amount higher than their amount recoverable through their use or sale. 276 The equity investments subjected to impairment testing after identification of trigger events are described below. Autopistas del Sol S.A The Group tested its investment for impairment using a market approach, assisted by an external expert. The resulting recoverable amount, dertemined by analysing trends in the investee’s share price during the year; was higher than the equity investment’s carrying amount and, therefore, it was not necessary to recognise an impairment loss. Ochre Solutions Holdings Ltd The Group tested its investment for impairment using the English operator’s 2020-2039 business plan assisted by an external expert. Its cash flows were discounted using a cost of equity rate of 8.5% (2018: 5.7%) to calculate the investment’s recoverable amount. The resulting recoverable amount was higher than the equity investment’s carrying amount and, therefore, it was not necessary to recognise an impairment loss. Yuma The Group tested its investment for impairment in 2019 using the Colombian operator’s 2020-2031 business plan assisted by an external expert. Its cash flows were discounted using a cost of equity rate of 9.6% to calculate the investment’s recoverable amount. The resulting recoverable amount was higher than the equity investment’s carrying amount and, therefore, it was not necessary to recognise an impairment loss. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report. Grupo Unido por el Canal Following the amendments to IAS 28 (applicable from 1 January 2019), the loan given to the SPE Grupo Unidos por el Canal S.A. (Panama) was tested for impairment as it was disbursed to financially support the SPE and, therefore, increases the equity investment’s carrying amount. The impairment test was performed by discounting the expected cash flows using the assumed settlement of the claims and other assets recognised by the SPE as the drivers. Specifically, the cash flows comprised the operating expenses (mainly legal fees) and collections expected in line with the estimated payment timeline of the claims. The discount rate (4.2% 4.5%) was defined considering: • the estimated payment timeline; • a country risk component. The Group recognised an impairment loss of €9.7 million as a result of the test. 277 Investments in equity-accounted investees and other equity investments Investments in equity-accounted investees and other equity investments increased to €642.5 million by €104.2 million compared to 31 December 2018: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Investments in associates 135,067 116,267 (18,800) Investments in jointly controlled entities 401,456 525,918 124,462 Investments in other companies 1,734 301 (1,433) Total 538,257 642,486 104,229 With respect to the measurement of certain equity investments using the equity method, the financial statements utilised to measure some of the investments using the equity method include requests for additional consideration as its payment is highly probable, based also on the technical and legal opinions of the Group’s advisors. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report. Investments in associates, jointly controlled entities and other companies with a negative carrying amount, which are recognised in the provision for risks on equity investments (see note 28), increased to €69.3 million by €67.5 million compared to 31 December 2018: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Investments in associates (1,507) (2,185) (679) Investments in jointly controlled entities (59) (63,088) (62,949) Investments in other companies (234) (4,125) (3,878) Total (1,800) (69,319) (67,519) The increase in this provision for jointly controlled entities is mostly due to the Lane group joint ventures and, in particular, the joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate project. It made a loss in 2019 due to the higher costs incurred for the project. The amount recognised in profit or loss is as follows: 278 (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Investments in associates (8,237) (6,003) (2,234) Investments in jointly controlled entities (21,259) (118,312) 97,053 Investments in other companies (107) (3,922) (3,816) Total (29,603) (128,238) 98,635 The classification of Salini Impregilo Group companies in line with the IFRS referred to earlier was based on the following guidelines: (i) Paragraphs 5 and 6 of IFRS 10 were adhered to for assessing the existence of control. Group entities were only classified as subsidiaries when the Group has substantial rights over the investee’s relevant activities, in exchange for the Group’s exposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and the Group can use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the variable returns. These requirements are met when the Group holds sufficient voting rights to obtain the majority required in decisions for the governance bodies of the group entities in question. (ii) Reference was made to paragraphs 4 and 5 of IFRS 11 to assess the existence of joint control. Joint control exists if the majorities required for decision-taking by the governance bodies of the group entities in question require the unanimous vote or qualified majorities that can only be reached with the consent of a specific group of investors. (iii) With reference to the type of joint arrangements, in view of the fact that all joint arrangements in which the Group participates are structured through separate vehicles, reference was made to paragraph B15 of IFRS 11, analysing in particular the legal form of the separate vehicle and the terms of the contractual agreement. With reference to the situation at 31 December 2019 and 2018, only those entities not incorporated into legal entities and structured as separate vehicles that guarantee transparency of the rights and obligations of the parties are classified as joint operations. Salini Impregilo Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system. For the purposes of classification under IFRS 10 and 11, these entities have been classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, according to the guidelines set out above. Although the investments in the associated consortium entities and entities subject to joint control are measured using the equity method, their revenues are nonetheless presented in the consolidated financial statements as the parent recognises the contract work in progress while the costs incurred by the entities are recharged to the parent and shown in a single cost item (classified among service costs). Therefore, in view of the fact that the relevant effects concerning consortium entities are already shown in the tables below, the details are not provided here. 279 Financial highlights of the significant associates The group associates at 31 December 2019 that management considers significant for the Group are presented below. Their share capital consists solely of ordinary shares, which the Group holds directly. These companies primarily conduct their business in the country of their incorporation or registration.

A description of the nature of Salini Impregilo Group’s relationship with the above companies is provided below: (1) the company is held directly by Salini Impregilo S.p.A., and indirectly through Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V., and has a concession contract for the third motorway lot of the Ruta del Sol project in Colombia. The contract expires in 2036. The governance system requires qualified majority resolutions and Salini Impregilo’s investment percentage means it can be classified as an associate. The subsection on “Concessions” in the “Abroad” section and the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report provides details of the concession’s term; (2) the company is held directly by the parent and has a concession contract for the “Metro de Lima 2” project (Peru) for the concession, construction and operation of the infrastructure during the 35-year concession expiring in 2049. The governance system requires majority resolutions and Salini Impregilo’s investment percentage means it can be classified as an associate; (3) the consortium company is held directly by the parent and was set up to design and build the Messina Strait Bridge and railway and road connectors on both sides in Calabria and Sicily. More information about this contract is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report. The governance 280 system requires majority resolutions and Salini Impregilo’s investment percentage means it can be classified as an associate; (4) the company, listed on the Buenos Aires stock market, is held by the sub holding company Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. and has a concession contract for the operation of the Buenos Aires Norte access infrastructure expiring in 2030.

These guarantees are already included in those presented in note 32. Joint operations The Group is involved in the following main joint operations: Civil Work Group (Saudi Arabia), South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait), Arge Tulfes Pfons (Austria), NGE Genie Civil S.a.s. – Salini Impregilo S.p.A.

The above entities are governed by joint control arrangements as resolutions of the governing bodies require a unanimous vote. While they are separate entities, they are structured to guarantee transparency of their rights and obligations with respect to Salini Impregilo. 12. Derivatives and non-current financial assets Derivatives and non-current financial assets of €378.3 million are analysed in the following table: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Loans and receivables third parties 113,045 160,048 47,003 Loans and receivables unconsolidated group companies 111,747 122,535 10,788 and other related parties Other financial assets 10,900 95,689 84,789 Total 235,692 378,272 142,580 Loans and receivables unconsolidated group companies and other related parties of €122.5 million (31 December 2018: €111.7 million) mainly relate to: • €58.6 million due from Yuma Concessionaria and impaired by €9.4 million in the reporting period, tested for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9 (more details are available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report); • €24.0 million (€120.2 million gross at 31 December 2019, net of a loss allowance of €96.2 million) due from OIV Tocoma, decreased by €5.4 million during the year (€117.7 million gross at 31 December 2018 net of an allowance of €88.3 million) due to the impairment test performed at the reporting date to reflect the events described in the “Venezuela” paragraph of the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report and note 16 “Trade receivables, paragraph on Impairment Venezuela”; • loans of €23.0 million granted to the SPE Linea M4 S.p.A.; • loans of €14.2 million granted to the English associate Ochre Holding. Loans and receivables third parties of €160.0 million increased by €47.0 on 31 December 2018 and mainly include: • €66.0 million related to the CAV.TO.MI. consortium paid as a result of the Appeal Court ruling of 23 September 2015. The Group is confident that it will recover this amount, based also on the opinion of its legal advisors assisting it with the dispute. More information is available in the Main risk factors and uncertainties section in the Directors' report; • €39.9 million related to the enforcement of the performance bond for the A1F and S3 Nowa Sol motorway contracts in Poland. The Group is confident that it will recover this amount, based also on the opinion of its 289 legal advisors assisting it with the dispute. More information is available in the Main risk factors and uncertainties section in the Directors' report; • €13.5 million due from the Romanian Ministry for Infrastructure and Transportation related to the surety enforced in 2017 as a result of the disputes with the customer about the Orastie-Sibiu motorway contract. The Group is confident that it will recover this amount, based also on the opinion of its legal advisors assisting it with the disputes. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report provides more information; The other financial assets of €95.7 million include: • securities of €84.6 million related to the bonds issued by Astaldi and subscribed by Beyond S.r.l., a newco set up in 2019 as part of Progetto Italia, maturing on 12 February 2022; they were pledged to secure the financing granted to Beyond S.r.l. by a bank syndicate (see note 23). More information is available in the “Progetto Italia” paragraph of the “Key events of the year” section; • unlisted guaranteed-return securities which mature after one year, amount to €11.0 million and relate to the fund financing Yuma. The Group tested its investment in the Colombian operator for impairment in 2019 assisted by an independent expert using its 2020-2031 business plan. In order to determine its recoverable amount, it discounted the cash flows using a cost of equity of 9.6%. The results showed that the recoverable amount is higher than the carrying amount and therefore there was no need to recognise an impairment loss. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report. 13. Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities amount to €253.5 million and €7.4 million at 31 December 2019, respectively.

Changes in the year are shown in the following table: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Deferred tax assets 205,386 253,453 48,067 Deferred tax liabilities (11,374) (7,399) 3,975 Changes in 2018 and 2019 are as follows: 290 31 Increases Decreases Net Change in Change in ReclassificOther 31 December exchange consolidation tax rate ations changes December (€’000) 2017 gains scope 2018 Deferred tax assets Amortisation and depreciation 5,780 1,670 1 (1,591) 846 6,706 exceeding tax rates Provisions for risks and impairment 105,414 42,759 (5,435) (1,265) 141,473 losses Tax effect of capital increase 301 (301) Fisia Hiatus transaction 4,383 (3,132) 1,251 Excess maintenance 13,189 7,404 (4,771) 15,822 Unrealised exchange losses 23,238 26,568 (23,238) 26,568 Other 46,292 21,917 (14,068) 998 1,591 (15,031) 41,699 Deferred tax assets before 198,597 100,318 (50,945) 999 (15,450) 233,519 offsetting Offsetting (26,197) (1,936) (28,133) Net deferred tax assets 172,400 100,318 (50,945) 999 (17,386) 205,386 Deferred tax liabilities Fiscally-driven amortisation and (24,166) (9,124) (815) (275) 724 17,626 (16,030) depreciation Uncollected default interest (422) (4,827) (5,249) Contract revenue or revenue items 1,385 2,714 136 (184) 4,051 Contract revenue taxable in future (8,946) 4,579 (825) 490 825 (3,877) years Unrealised exchange gains (16,433) (20,052) 16,433 1 (20,051) Other (7,770) (18,935) 2,910 2,728 (27) 3,612 19,131 1,649 Deferred tax liabilities before (55,930) (48,533) 26,636 1,224 (302) 37,398 (39,507) offsetting Offsetting 26,197 1,936 28,133 Net deferred tax liabilities (29,733) (48,533) 26,636 1,224 (302) 39,334 (11,374) 291 31 Increases Decreases Net Change in Change in Reclassific.Other 31 December exchange consolidation tax rate ations changes December (€’000) 2018 losses scope 2019 Deferred tax assets Amortisation and depreciation 6,706 1,136 (1) (332) (837) 6,672 exceeding tax rates Provisions for risks and impairment 141,473 19,851 (4,341) (533) 156,450 losses Tax effect of capital increase (443) 2,216 1,773 Fisia Hiatus transaction 1,251 (1,251) Excess maintenance 15,822 4,595 (6,338) 1,441 15,520 Unrealised exchange losses 26,568 42,352 (27,150) (6) (13) 41,751 Other 41,699 36,250 (6,789) (37) 5,740 17,953 4,091 98,907 Deferred tax assets before 233,519 104,184 (46,313) (43) 5,740 17,621 6,365 321,073 offsetting Offsetting (28,133) (3,132) 70 (21,012) (15,413) (67,620) Net deferred tax assets 205,386 101,052 (46,313) 27 5,740 (3,391) (9,048) 253,453 Deferred tax liabilities Fiscally-driven amortisation and (16,030) (1,392) (295) (165) (17,882) depreciation Uncollected default interest (5,249) (961) (6,210) Contract revenue or revenue items 4,051 (51) 239 72 (379) 384 4,316 Contract revenue taxable in future (3,877) (118) 1,683 (3) (44) (2,359) years Unrealised exchange gains (20,051) (35,822) 20,148 (97) (35,822) Other 1,649 (3,675) 587 (30) 1,070 (16,495) (168) (17,062) Deferred tax liabilities before (39,507) (41,058) 22,657 (256) 691 (17,621) 75 (75,019) offsetting Offsetting 28,133 3,132 (70) 21,012 15,413 67,620 Net deferred tax liabilities (11,374) (37,926) 22,657 (326) 691 3,391 15,488 (7,399) The €48.1 million increase in deferred tax assets is mainly due to impairment losses recognised during the year. “Other” mostly comprises the deferred taxes that arose upon application of the new standards. 292 14. Inventories Inventories total €156.4 million at the reporting date, as shown in the following table: 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 (€’000) Gross amount Allowance Carrying Gross Allowance Carrying Variation amount carrying amount Real estate projects 20,823 (10,334) 10,489 20,823 amount (17,534) 3,289 (7,200) Finished products and goods 5,183 5,183 4,785 4,785 (398) Raw materials, consumables and 179,705 (3,073) 176,632 153,878 (5,584) 148,294 (28,338) supplies Total 205,711 (13,407) 192,304 179,486 (23,118) 156,368 (35,936) Real estate projects Real estate projects amount to €3.3 million and mainly relate to an area zoned for agricultural use on which it was planned to construct a trade point in Lombardy. Given the zoning and legal issues afflicting this area owned by the Group and, in particular, the Council of State’s recent ruling, the Group updated the market value of the area with the assistance of a real estate expert, calculating a value of €1.8 million (net of the related allowance of €17.5 million). Finished products and goods and Raw materials, consumables and supplies The carrying amount of these items totals €4.8 million and €148.3 million, respectively, and mainly relates to materials and goods to be used for foreign contracts, including those in Ethiopia (€79.5 million). The carrying amount of raw materials, consumables and supplies is net of an allowance of €5.6 million, analysed below. 293 Changes in the allowance in 2018 are shown below: (€’000) 31 December Accruals Utilisations Reversals Other changes Net exchange 31 December 2017 losses 2018 Allowance – real estate projects 7,772 2,562 10,334 Allowance raw materials 2,511 1,021 (343) (116) 3,073 Total 10,283 3,583 (343) (116) 13,407 Changes in the allowance in 2019 are shown below: (€’000) 31 December Accruals Utilisations Reversals Other changes Net exchange 31 December 2018 gains 2019 Allowance – real estate projects 10,334 7,200 17,534 Allowance raw materials 3,073 2,923 (493) 81 5,584 Total 13,407 10,123 (493) 81 23,118 15. Contract assets and liabilities Contract assets and liabilities can be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Contract assets 1,512,866 2,040,450 527,584 Contract liabilities 1,149,588 1,186,076 36,488 Contract assets mostly represent the right to consideration for work performed but not invoiced at the reporting date, net of contract advances. They were impaired by €11.5 million at 31 December 2019 (€48.4 million), mainly in relation to the contract assets with the Venezuelan customers (see the Main risk factors and uncertainties section of the Directors' report). Acquisiton of Cossi Costruzioni S.p.A. (see note 5) increased contract assets by €10.3 million. Revenue recognised in 2019 on performance obligations satisfied (or partly satisfied) mostly relates to changes in estimates of the percentage of completion and the variable consideration. Contract liabilities mostly comprise contract advances from customers for projects for which the revenue is recognised over time. 294 Contract assets Contract assets increased by €527.6 million to €2,040.5 million at the reporting date. They include contracts in Italy (€174.8 million), abroad (€1,822.9 million) and Lane’s contracts (€42.8 million). The following table shows contract assets calculated using the stage of completion method, net of losses realised or estimated at the reporting date and progress billings and advances: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Contract work in progress 26,530,643 28,125,008 1,594,365 Progress payments (on approved work) (23,819,827) (25,054,997) (1,235,170) Advances (1,197,950) (1,029,561) 168,389 Total contract assets 1,512,866 2,040,450 527,584 The main contract assets relate to the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) (€292.8 million), the Rogun Hydropower Project for the hydroelectric plant on the Vakhsh River in Tajikistan (€186.2 million), the road projects in Poland (€147.4 million), the Meydan One Mall in Dubai (€138.2 million) and the Doha Metro and the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor City, Qatar (€125.3 million). The advances mainly refer to the contracts in Tajikistan (€266.6 million), the contract for the metro line in Denmark (€259.5 million), the National Guard SANG Villas project in Saudi Arabia (€109.0 million), the GERD contract in Ethiopia (€67.5 million), the Lydco contract in Libya (€53.8 million) and the Sydney Metro Northwest Project in Australia (€50.2 million). The increase is mostly due to the smaller advances for the Meydan One contract in Dubai, the GERD project in Ethiopia and the Al Bayt Stadium in Qater, partly offset by the advances for the Saudi contract reclassified from contract liabilities to contract assets. A breakdown of contract work in progress by geographical segment is as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Italy 147,202 174,794 27,592 EU (excluding Italy) 452,455 468,669 16,214 Non-EU 17,861 21,550 3,689 Asia/Middle East 311,730 615,007 303,277 Africa 295,080 454,546 159,466 Americas 209,557 224,184 14,627 Oceania 78,981 81,700 2,719 Total 1,512,866 2,040,450 527,584 Contract liabilities This item, included in “Current liabilities”, amounts to €1,186.1 million, up slightly by €36.5 million on the figure at 31 December 2018.

The additional consideration recognised in this item is part of the total consideration formally requested of the customers. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report provides information on pending disputes and assets exposed to country risk. The section on the “Performance by geographical area” in the Directors’ report provides more details about the contracts and the progress made on the main contracts. 16. Trade receivables At 31 December 2019, trade receivables amount to €1,827.2 million, a net decrease of €103.5 million compared to 31 December 2018. The item includes receivables of €299.8 million from unconsolidated group companies and other related parties. It is analysed in the following table: 296 (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Third parties 1,792,229 1,527,400 (264,829) Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties 138,410 299,773 161,363 Total 1,930,639 1,827,173 (103,466) Trade receivables from third parties may be broken down as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Third parties 2,125,960 1,937,589 (188,371) Loss allowance (333,731) (410,189) (76,458) Total 1,792,229 1,527,400 (264,829) The balance relates to amounts due from customers for invoices issued and for work performed and approved by customers but still to be invoiced. It decreased by €264.8 million compared to 31 December 2018, principally as a result of the reduction in amounts due from the Ethiopian customer following collections received during the year. This item mainly includes: • €233.7 million for the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section contract; • €137.1 million from Lane Industries; • €127.9 million due to Fibe by the Campania municipalities for its services provided under contract until 15 December 2005 and the subsequent transition period (reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report for more information about this complicated dispute and the directors’ related assessments); • €117.4 million related to HCE, including €68.2 million from Ukravtodor (Ukraine) for fees awarded by the Paris International Court of Arbitration. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report for more information about this complicated dispute and the directors’ related assessments. • €99.1 million for the Salerno-Reggio Calabria S.c.p.a. contract; • €96.5 million from Ethiopian customers, down roughly €347.8 million on 2018 as a result of collections received during the year; • approximately €71.8 million from Nigerian government agencies and €63.7 million from Venezuelan customers for railway works expected to be collected after one year (€318.6 million gross at 31 December 2019, net of a loss allowance of €254.9 million), both tested for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors' report. Retentions amount to €100.1 million at the reporting date compared to €133.8 million at 31 December 2018. The loss allowance increased by €76.5 million to €410.2 million at the reporting date and mainly refers to: 297 • the loss allowance for Venezuelan exposures of €249.5 million, described in more detail in the Impairment Venezuela section; • the loss allowance of €45.8 million related to receivables due to COCIV from the consortium member Condotte given that it is currently under extraordinary administration; • default interest of €60.3 million most refers to Fibe S.p.A. and the Venezuelan branch (due to the impairment losses described in more detail later in this report). Impairment Venezuela Assisted by its independent experts, the Group estimated the impairment losses on the Venezuelan financial assets in line with its approach taken in the 2018 financial statements. The impairment model selected is the discounted cash flow (DCF) model in line with the amortised cost approach of IFRS 9. Estimating amortised cost usually requires the preparation of a possible repayment plan that is economically and financially feasible for the debtor. Given the uncertainty about the expected collection rates and the time involved (i.e., the length of the litigation), the Group prepared 16 scenarios using various combinations of inputs. It then defined the following parameters: • the nominal amount reduction; • the total repayment delay; • the repayment structure (equal or increasing instalments). The interval (50% 73% compared to 37% 51%) for the nominal amount reduction was defined using the default episode samples obtained from last year’s impairment test (2018). This was decided to properly factor in the following considerations: • the stagnant political, social and economic scenario for the third consecutive year; • the negative signals about the current and possible future oil prices and the significant fall in the prices of the Venezuelan government bonds in the second half of 2019; The sample included the “extreme” default episodes of 2018 (i.e., Panama ‘96 and Bolivia ‘88). With respect to the recoverable amount of the Group's exposure to the Venezuelan government agencies, at 31 December 2019, its gross exposure amounts to €643.4 million, of which loan assets of €120.2 million and consideration accrued on work performed of approximately €523.2 million (the latter amount comprises €318.7 million already invoiced and recognised under trade receivables and €204.5 million recognised under contract assets net of contract liabilities). As a result of the assessments made on the basis of that set out above, the Group's net exposure to the Venezuelan government agencies amounts to €128.7 million, of which loan assets of €24.0 million and consideration accrued on work performed of approximately €104.7 million (the latter amount comprises €63.8 million already invoiced and recognised under trade receivables and €40.9 million recognised under contract assets net of contract liabilities). 298 Given the high level of uncertainty implicit in this type of valuation, the Group engaged a second independent expert to assess the reasonableness of the results obtained from the use of the above model and its reasonableness was confirmed. Changes in the loss allowance are as follows: 31 December Impairment Utilisations Reversals Change in Other Net 31 December 2017 losses scope changes exchange 2018 (€’000) losses Trade receivables 186,871 85,307 (679) (2,503) (9) 5,018 (791) 273,214 Default interest 59,594 1,071 (35) (171) 58 60,517 Total 246,465 86,378 (714) (2,674) (9) 5,018 (733) 333,731 31 December Impairment Utilisations Reversals Change in Reclass. and Net 31 December 2018 losses scope other exchange 2019 (€’000) changes gains Trade receivables 273,214 78,759 (1,697) (1,328) (24) 839 154 349,917 Default interest 60,517 (319) 64 10 60,272 Total 333,731 78,759 (1,697) (1,647) (24) 903 164 410,189 Trade receivables from unconsolidated group companies and other related parties increased by €161.4 million to €299.8 million at 31 December 2019. This variation relates to the consortium companies Metro Blu S c.r.l., PerGenova S.c.p.a. and the Hirpinia AV consortium. The item mainly comprises trade receivables from unconsolidated SPEs for work carried out by them under contracts with Italian and foreign public administrations. The balance includes €0.7 million related to the Group’s liabilities with consortia and consortium companies (SPEs) that operate by recharging costs and are not included in the consolidation scope. It is equal to the Group’s share of the SPEs’ cash and cash equivalents. A complete list of the intragroup transactions is provided in the annexes. 17. Derivatives and other current financial assets At 31 December 2019, this item of €241.5 million (31 December 2018: €135.9 million) includes the following: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Loans and receivables third parties 96,213 193,932 97,719 Loans and receivables unconsolidated group companies 31,385 42,712 11,327 and other related parties Government bonds and insurance shares 7,681 4,605 (3,076) Derivatives 602 268 (334) Total 135,881 241,517 105,636 299 Loans and receivables third parties increased by €97.7 million and mainly consist of: • approximately €95.6 million disbursed to non-controlling investors of the group companies, mainly active in Australia, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia; • €50.6 million related to the net investment in leases by COCIV for assets given to the subcontractors; • €22.1 million related to an interest-bearing loan granted to Seli Overseas S.p.A.. (over which the parent has usufruct rights granted by the Rome Court in 2018); • €11.2 million related to an arbitration proceeding commenced by the Ariguani consortium against Grodco and the insurance companies (SBS) for the default of the performance bond. Loans and receivables with unconsolidated group companies and other related parties mainly consist of €18.0 million due from the related party G.A.B.I.RE. s.r.l.. The government bonds and insurance shares amount to €4.6 million compared to €7.7 million at 31 December 2018. The item principally comprises securities held by the Group’s Argentine companies. Derivatives include the reporting-date fair value of currency hedges that did not meet the criteria for application of hedge accounting for cash flow hedges under the IFRS. Their fair value was a positive €0.3 million at the reporting date as shown below: 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 (€’000) Currency swaps FVTPL 602 268 Total current derivatives shown in net financial indebtedness 602 268 18. Current tax assets and other current tax assets Current tax assets amount to €90.5 million as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Direct taxes 48,973 34,233 (14,740) IRAP 2,046 2,105 59 Foreign direct taxes 61,083 54,175 (6,908) Total 112,102 90,513 (21,589) The 31 December 2019 balance mainly consists of: • direct tax assets for excess taxes paid in previous years, which the Group has correctly claimed for reimbursement and which bear interest; 300 • foreign direct tax assets for excess taxes paid abroad by the foreign group companies which will be recovered as per the relevant legislation. Other current tax assets decreased by €14.1 million to €132.1 million at the reporting date as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation VAT 132,114 118,380 (13,734) Other indirect taxes 14,052 13,729 (323) Total 146,166 132,109 (14,057) 19. Other current assets Other current assets of €685.0 million show an increase of €44.7 million on the previous year end and may be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Other 235,737 229,317 (6,420) Advances to suppliers 281,806 309,652 27,846 Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties 22,216 31,280 9,064 Prepayments and accrued income 100,510 114,746 14,236 Total 640,269 684,995 44,726 Specifically, “Other” includes: • €71 million mostly due from the former consortium member to the Cossi LGV consortium related to works for the Monte Ceneri tunnel in Switzerland. The Group has a liability of €70.2 million to the consortium member recognised under other liabilities against this receivable; • €47.6 million from the public bodies involved in managing the waste emergency in Campania to Fibe. The €23.8 million decrease in this item is due to changes in the legal proceedings during the year after which the Group reclassified amounts due from public bodies to other current liabilities given the above legal situation. Based on the information available at the date of preparation of these consolidated financial statements, the Group believes that the other current assets related to the USW Campania projects will be collected within 12 months, given also that the outcome of the related disputes will be made known in the near future. This classification is the best estimate, based also on the assessments provided by independent experts. The section on the “USW Campania projects” and related assessments in the section of the Directors’ report on the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” provides more information about these projects; • €29.4 million due from the Argentine Republic as compensation for damage following the favourable award issued on 21 June 2011 and confirmed by the Buenos Aires Arbitration Tribunal on 24 January 2014. This award settled the proceedings commenced by the shareholders of the investee Aguas del Buenos Aires S.A. in liquidation (operator) against the Argentine Republic. Given that the country's 301 significant economic crisis has not abated, management tested its exposure for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9. As the recoverable amount is substantially in line with than the exposure’s carrying amount, additional impairment losses were not recognised (more information is available in the“Main risk factors and uncertainties section in the Directors report); • €35.8 million due from some of the Group’s partners of joint ventures around the world, mainly for the works for the housing project in South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait). Advances to suppliers increased by €27.8 million. This increase is mainly due to the advances made during the year, mostly for the high speed Milan Genoa contracts, the contract to build the hospital in Turkey and a housing and urbanisation project commissioned by Saudi Arabia National Guard (SANG Villas). The item was partly offset by the absorption of advances made in previous years for the projects in Qatar, the project to build a section of a transit way across two islands in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and works in Colombia. At year end, the largest advances paid to suppliers were mainly for the high speed/high capacity Milan Genoa railway line section (€124.5 million), the contract in Saudi Arabia (€51.5 million), the works in Turkey (€34.5 million) and the projects in Qatar (€26.6 million). The item “Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties” increased by €9.1 million to €31.3 million at the reporting date, mainly as a result of the rise in amounts due from the Hirpinia A.V. consortium for the Apice – Hirpinia section of the high speed Naples Bari railway line section Prepayments and accrued income of €114.7 million show an increase of €14.2 million on 31 December 2018. The item mainly consists of insurance premiums, commissions on sureties and other contract costs which will be recognised in profit or loss in future periods based on the stage of completion of the related contracts. The increase, shown in the following table, is mainly due to the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section contract, following commencement of Lot 5.

Liquidity management is designed to ensure the financial independence of ongoing contracts, considering the structure of the consortia and SPEs, which may limit the availability of financial resources to achievement of the related projects. Liquidity management also considers the existence of constraints to the transfer of currency imposed by certain countries. In this respect, the liquidity in Africa mainly comprises local currency that cannot be exported and is used for the Ethiopian projects. The statement of cash flows shows the reason for the decrease in the item and changes in current account facilities (note 23). At the reporting date, the cash and cash equivalents attributable to non-controlling interests of the consolidated SPEs amount to €71.4 million and mainly refer to the entities carrying out the work on the Snowy 2.0 hydropower stations in Australia and Lane Group entities. The item comprises tied-up amounts of approximately €24.7 million, which includes a deposit of €9.5 million that can be freed after a notice period of 31 days related to the Dutch group company Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V.. 21.

Its new share capital amounts to €600,000,000 and comprises 892,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares, all without a nominal amount. The parent has solely issued ordinary shares for the capital increase and did not issue savings shares as the assumptions for their issue pursuant to article 36 of the by-laws approved by the shareholders in their extraordinary meeting of 4 October 2019 were not met. The capital increase of €600 million has been allocated to share capital (€55,260 thousand), the share premium reserve (€533,688 thousand) and the legal reserve (€11,052 thousand). The related charges of €7,018 thousand increased the related reserve. In accordance with article 2444 of the Italian Civil Code, certification of the execution of the capital increase was filed with the Milan Company Registrar on 14 November 2019. Changes of the year in the different equity items are summarised in the relevant schedule of the consolidated financial statements. 306 Specifically, in their meeting held on 24 April 2019, the parent’s shareholders resolved the following: • to allocate €2,396,680.92 to the legal reserve; • to distribute €840,055.32 as a dividend to each share, equal to €0.52 per share, as per article 33.b) of the by-laws, including the legal withholding; • to allocate €106,313,678.94 to retained earnings. At the reporting date, the parent had 1,330,845 treasury shares for €3,291,089.72. The reserve for treasury shares is unchanged from 31 December 2018. The parent does not have a share repurchase plan at 31 December 2019. The inflation reserve was set up following application of IAS 29 to the Argentine group companies (more information is available in note 1 and the Directors’ report in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section). The main variation in other comprehensive expense items relates to the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates (mostly the Argentine peso’s depreciation versus the Euro) as shown below: (€’000) 2018 2019 Opening balance (68,835) (100,768) Reclassification to profit or loss (11,380) Equity-accounted investees (32,862) 12,737 Increase (decrease) 929 (26,582) Total changes (31,933) (25,225) Closing balance (100,768) (125,993) At the reporting date, the hedging reserve referred to the equity-accounted Turkish associate Gaziantep Hastane Saglik.

Post-employment benefits and employee benefits At 31 December 2019, the Group’s liability due to its employees determined using the criteria set out in IAS 19 is €61.9 million. The liability for post-employment benefits is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting date. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. The valuation, performed with the assistance of an independent expert, was based on the following rates: − turnover rate: 7.25%; − advance payment rate: 3%; − inflation rate: 1.2%. The Group has used the Eurocomposite AA index, which has an average financial duration in line with the fund being valued, to calculate the discount rate. The balance mainly consists of the liability for Lane Group’s defined benefit plan for its full-time employees. This liability is calculated on the basis of the employees’ years of service and remuneration and is subjected to an actuarial valuation. Lane Group also provides healthcare cover to retired employees, hired before 31 December 1992 with at least 20 years of service. The item also includes the Italian post-employment benefits (TFR) related to Salini Impregilo and its Italian subsidiaries. The liability is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting dates. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation.

Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan Through its US subsidiary Lane Industries Inc., the Group contributes to a pension plan that qualifies as a defined benefit plan, The Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan, which pays benefits to employees or former employees who met the related vesting conditions when they retire. The subsidiary also pays benefits to a supplementary pension plan for some senior executives. In addition, it provides employees who have reached retirement age with healthcare benefits. These employees were hired before 31 December 1992 and reached retirement age after at least 20 years’ service and are also beneficiaries of The Lane Construction Corporation Defined Benefit Pension Plan.

The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report includes a description of the litigation and risks related to the USW Campania projects. 328 The provisions set up by Imprepar and its subsidiaries include accruals made for probable future charges related to the closing of contracts and potential developments in ongoing litigation. “Other” refers to pending tax and social security litigations and legal disputes mostly for the parent (€9.0 million) and Lane Group (€5.7 million). Changes during 2018 are shown in the following table: 31 December Accruals Utilisations / ReclassificExchange gains 31 December 2017 Releases ations and other 2018 (€’000) changes Total 90,260 8,027 (21,853) 1,927 4,052 82,413 Changes in the item in the year are summarised below: 31 December Accruals Utilisations / ReclassificExchange gains 31 December 2018 Releases and other 2019 (€’000) ations changes Total 82,413 6,912 (7,624) (14,222) 1,124 68,603 The main change relates to the reclassifications of €14.2 million to the provision for risks on equity investments to cover the losses on the Ferroviario Milanese consortium by Imprepar S.p.A..

Trade payables Trade payables amount to €2,612.7 million at the reporting date, an increase of €227.1 million on 31 December 2018. They are made up as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Third parties 2,247,988 2,319,738 71,750 Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties 137,622 292,999 155,377 Total 2,385,610 2,612,737 227,127 The increase is the result of the rise in trade payables to third parties, mainly for the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section (€148.3 million), partly offset by the reduction for the projects in Ethiopia, and higher 329 trade payables to group companies mostly related to the consortium companies PerGenova (€64.4 million) and Napoli Cancello Alta Velocità S.c.r.l. (€49.3 million). Trade payables to unconsolidated group companies and other related parties increased by €155.4 million to € 293.0 million at the reporting date. The item mostly consists of payables from unconsolidated SPEs accrued on work performed by them for contracts with public administrations. The balance includes €23.9 million (€22.2 million) related to the Group’s liabilities with consortia and consortium companies (SPEs) that operate by recharging costs and are not included in the consolidation scope. It is shown in the item “Net financial position with unconsolidated SPEs” as part of net financial indebtedness. A complete list of the intragroup transactions is provided in the annexes. 30. Current tax liabilities and other current tax liabilities Current tax liabilities amount to €87.1 million as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation IRES 603 4,881 4,278 IRAP 877 995 118 Foreign taxes 143,213 81,261 (61,952) Total 144,693 87,137 (57,556) “Foreign taxes” of €81.3 million show a €61.9 million decrease on the previous year end, mainly related to taxes of €57.2 million paid on the sale of its Plants & Paving division by Lane Group on 12 December 2018. Other current tax liabilities of €48.2 million decreased by €0.3 million over 31 December 2018.

As a result of changes in the legal proceedings during the year, the Group reclassified €82.3 million to trade receivables and specifically €59.7 million to “Third parties” and the remainder to “Other” under other current assets, based on the above legal situation. Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report for more information about the complicated situation surrounding the USW Campania projects. “Other liabilities” of €158.2 million (€73.2 million) increased by roughly €84.9 million, mostly in relation to the acquisition of Cossi Group in March 2019 and the higher liabilities for the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section contract and the Riachuelo environmental restoration contract in the Buenos Aires area for normal contract activities. At the reporting date, the item mainly refers to the consolidation of Cossi Group (see note 19 “Other current assets”), the high speed/high capacity projects, Lane’s American projects and some foreign projects in Argentina, Venezuela and France. Amounts due to employees and social security institutions relate to accrued unpaid remuneration. “Unconsolidated group companies and other related parties” amount to €23.4 million and increased by €3.5 million. The year-end balance and changes in the item principally refer to the Argentine group companies involved in the environmental remediation project in the Buenos Aires province and the Churchill Hospital joint venture active in the UK hospital sector. Accrued expenses and deferred income decreased by €1.4 million to €17.4 million, mainly attributable to the works for the Koysha Dam in Ethiopia and Lane Group’s projects as shown in the following table: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Accrued expenses: Commissions on sureties 3,669 3,577 (92) Other 12,523 11,240 (1,283) Total accrued expenses 16,192 14,817 (1,375) Deferred income: Provision of services 2,677 2,632 (45) Total deferred income 2,677 2,632 (45) Total 18,869 17,449 (1,420) 331 32. Guarantees, commitments, risks and contingent liabilities Guarantees and commitments The key guarantees given by the Group are set out below: contractual sureties: these total €13,078.2 million (including €6,489.3 million issued directly by Lane Group) and are given to customers as performance bonds, to guarantee advances, retentions and involvement in tenders for all ongoing contracts. In turn, the group companies have guarantees given by its subcontractors; sureties for bank loans: they amount to €166.9 million; sureties granted for export credit: €157.4 million; other guarantees: they amount to €1,111.1 million and comprise guarantees related to customs and tax obligations (€73.1 million) and other commitments (such as environmental clean-ups and export credit) (€1,038.0 million); collateral related to a lien on the shares of the SPE M4 (€5.7 million). Tax disputes Salini Impregilo S.p.A. With respect to the principal dispute with the tax authorities: • the dispute about the assessment notice challenging the tax treatment of impairment losses and losses on the sale of assets recognised by the parent in 2003 has been settled. The main issue related to the sale by Impregilo S.p.A. (now Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) of its investment in the Chilean operator Costanera Norte SA to Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. had been cancelled by the Milan Regional Tax Commission on 11 September 2009 (higher assessed tax base of €70 million). After the hearing held on 24 April 2018 and the filing of a motion for the suspension of the trial on 14 November 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the case be placed on the court calendar again. The parent applied the procedure for the out-of-court settlement of tax disputes introduced by article 6 of Decree law no. 119 of 23 October 2018, converted into Law no. 136 of 17 December 2018. On 28 May 2019, it presented its application for the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes (payment of €1.2 million) and opted for payment by instalment; • the parent’s appeal about reimbursement of tax assets with a nominal amount of €12.3 million acquired from third parties as part of previous non-recurring transactions is still pending before the Supreme Court. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; • a dispute related to 2005 about the technique used to “realign” the carrying amount of equity investments as per article 128 of Presidential decree no. 917/86 (greater assessed tax base of €4.2 million) is still pending before the first level court while with respect to another dispute with the same subject but for 2004 (greater assessed tax base of €380,000), the Supreme Court accepted the parent’s grounds and ordered the case be sent to the Lombardy Regional Tax Commission which fully accepted the parent’s 332 appeal in the hearing of 14 January 2019 with its ruling of 12 February 2019. The tax authorities appealed this ruling on 11 September 2019 and the appeal still has to be allocated to the relevant section of the court; • with respect to another dispute again related to 2005 and the costs of a joint venture set up in Venezuela for which the greater assessed tax base is €6.6 million, the Regional Tax Commission filed its ruling entirely in the parent’s favour on 19 May 2015; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 28 December 2015 challenging the procedure while stating that the findings do not relate to the appeal. The parent has filed its defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; • the parent was notified of: (i) a payment order from the tax authorities for Icelandic taxes of €4.6 million, which was cancelled after the first and second level sentences in its favour; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 11 May 2017 and the parent presented its defence brief, and (ii) a payment bill for the same taxes which the parent appealed. It won again both at first and second level. On 18 January 2016, the tax authorities presented their appeal to the Supreme Court and the parent filed its defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; • on 12 December 2017, the parent and the subsidiary Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on the sale of a business unit to Imprepar (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion due to Imprepar’s know how in managing this type of business. The parent deems that the tax authorities’ allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed against the notices to the competent tax commission. The dispute was settled with a court-ordered settlement procedure as per article 48 of Legislative decree no. 546/1992 as proposed by the tax authorities. This included a reduction in the registration tax and the fine from €1.3 million to €204 thousand and from €1.3 million to €82 thousand, respectively; • in August 2019, the Ethiopian branch’s tax assessment of 2014, 2015 and 2016 was completed. During the preliminary stage of the assessment procedure, the branch met the tax authorities and agreed to settle all the assessed taxes for the three years by paying an amount in local currency equal to roughly €32.5 million (taxes, interest and fines) and the tax authorities cancelled the administrative sanctions; • on 23 December 2019, the parent received an assessment notice for assessed IRES tax for 2014 of €1.2 million (plus fines and interest). The notice refers to: (i) for a minimum part, the alleged incorrect application of transfer pricing rules to sureties provided free of charge on behalf of foreign subsidiaries, on which it should allegedly have charged commissions of €741 thousand; (ii) the alleged undue deduction of the “ACE relief” (Aid for Economic Growth) of €3,450 thousand contrary to the provisions of article 10 of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance’s decree of 14 March 2012. At the date of preparation of this Annual Report, the deadline for presentation of an appeal has not expired. 333 With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the parent believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions assigned to the tax collection agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed settlement procedure. Imprepar After the Milan Regional Tax Commission filed a ruling at the end of March 2015 on the IRES assessment notices for 2006/2007/2008 received by the subsidiary Imprepar cancelling all the main findings notified by the tax authorities for a higher taxable amount of €12 million and the tax authorities’ appeal to the Supreme Court made in November 2015 followed by the defence brief filed by the subsidiary, the subsidiary paid the first instalment and applied the procedure for the out-of-court settlement of tax disputes introduced by article 6 of Decree law no. 119 of 23 October 2018 converted into Law no. 136 of 17 December 2018. On 30 May 2019, it presented its application for the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes (payment of €384 thousand) and opted for payment by instalment. On 12 December 2017, as described above, Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on the parent’s sale of a business unit to it (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion transferred due to Imprepar’s know how in managing this type of company. The subsidiary deems that the tax authorities’ allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed to the competent tax court. The dispute was settled with a court-ordered settlement procedure as per article 48 of Legislative decree no. 546/1992 as proposed by the tax authorities. This included a reduction in the registration tax and the fine from €1.3 million to €204 thousand and from €1.3 million to €82 thousand, respectively. On 18 June 2018, Imprepar received a notice to pay assessed registration tax of approximately €748,000. The subsidiary has appealed promptly against the applicability of this notice to the competent tax commission which accepted the subsidiary’s appeal and cancelled the notice to pay. Notification that the tax authorities have appealed this ruling has not yet been received. With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions assigned to the tax collection agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed settlement procedure. 334 Fisia Ambiente After the 2013 IRES tax assessment and the 2013, 2014 and 2015 VAT audit, the Genoa tax office inspectors identified findings for IRES purposes for 2013 related to alleged undue deductions of €1.5 million for the use of the loss allowance and the alleged undue deduction of VAT of €332 thousand on costs incurred for the defence of managers and other employees in criminal court proceedings in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Fisia Ambiente appealed against these assessments in fact and in law with its comments and applications filed in accordance with article 12.7 of Law no. 212/2000. The tax authorities fully accepted the inspectors’ findings and notified two assessment notices for 2013, one for IRES and one for VAT. In turn, the subsidiary has filed reasoned requests for a mitigation hearing as per article 6 and following articles of Legislative decree no. 218/1997. The mutually-agreed settlement procedure for the VAT was not successful and, in June 2019, the company appealed to the competent tax commission commencing the relevant legal proceedings. At the date of preparation of this Annual Report, the competent tax commission has issued its ruling (i) partly accepting the company’s appeal for 2013, (ii) rejecting the appeal for 2014, and (iii) fully accepting its appeal for 2015 thereby cancelling the assessment notice. The term for presentation of an appeal in all cases has not yet expired. Negotiations for settlement of the assessed IRES were successful and the subsidiary paid the first of four instalments on 27 May 2019. With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions assigned to the tax collection agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed settlement procedure. Fibe FIBE has a pending dispute about the local property tax (ICI) on the Acerra waste-to-energy plant. In January 2013, the subsidiary received tax assessment notices from the Acerra municipality with respect to the waste-to-energy plant, which requested payment of local property tax and related penalties for approximately €14.3 million for the years 2009-2011. The amount requested by the municipality and challenged by Fibe was confirmed as far as its applicability but reduced in terms of its amount and penalties by the Naples Regional Tax Commission. The subsidiary appealed against the second level ruling with the Supreme Court and the case is still pending. However, in 2015, the subsidiary set aside a provision for an amount equal to the assessed tax plus accrued interest on a prudent basis. On 7 March 2018, Fibe applied for the procedure for the out-of-court settlement of the positions assigned to the collection agency as per article 1 of Decree law no. 148/2017 converted with modifications into Law no. 172/2017. The disputes about the following are still pending: 335 1) Assessment notice for 2003 IREPG, IRAP and VAT issued by the Casoria tax office about assessed taxes of €6.5 million. The company has been challenged for the following violations: (i) undue deduction of costs of €3.1 million contrary to the principle of pertinence/accruals basis; and (ii) undue deduction of VAT of €2.0 million as a result of the application of a higher-than-allowed rate. The Naples Provincial Tax Commission accepted the company’s appeal in its ruling no. 497 filed on 25 June 2009, which the tax office appealed. The company presented its defence brief and counter-appeal. The Naples Regional Tax Commission confirmed that costs of €2,771,179.66 were to be taxed, due to their non-compliance with the pertinence/accruals basis principle in its ruling no. 27/1/12 filed on 12 January 2012 while also confirming the deductibility of VAT of €1,839,943.61. The tax office has appealed to the Supreme Court. The company in turn has presented its defence brief and appeal. A date for the court hearing has not yet been set. 2) Assessment notice for 2004 VAT issued by the Casoria tax office about assessed VAT of €5.2 million. It alleges the company unduly deducted VAT based on the assumption that all the services received by it should have been invoiced with the lower rate of 10% instead of the ordinary rate (20%). The Naples Provincial Tax Commission accepted the company’s appeal in its ruling no. 498/01/09 filed on 25 June 2009 and cancelled the assessment notice, which the tax office appealed. The company presented its defence brief and counter-appeal. The Naples Regional Tax Commission handed down its ruling no. 26/1/2012 filed on 23 January 2020, which (i) after having decided in favour of the company, fully in line with its defence grounds, which was the “quaestio iuris”, whose resolution was essential to confirm or cancel the tax assessment; and (ii) nonetheless confirmed the tax office’s assessed taxes and related fines (i.e., as recalculated by the tax office in its appeal). The company has appealed to the Supreme Court and the hearing date was set as 23 March 2020. 3) Assessment notice for the 2012 IMU property tax, issued by the Acerra municipal authorities for the assessed tax of €551 thousand for the WtE plant. The company promptly presented its appeal which was filed on 20 April 2017. The Provincial Tax Commission rejected the appeal with ruling no. 17386 filed on 14 December 2017 which the company appealed on 5 July 2019. The Regional Tax Commission handed down its ruling on 13 January 2020, which was not in the company’s favour. The term for filing an appeal with the Supreme Court has not yet expired. With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the subsidiary believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions assigned to the tax collection agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed settlement procedure. 336 33. Financial instruments and risk management Classes of financial instruments The Group’s financial instruments are broken down by class in the following table, which also shows their fair value: 31 December 2018 Note Financial Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value assets at assets at fair derivatives assets at amortised value fair value cost through through profit or loss profit or loss (€’000) Financial assets Derivatives and non-current financial assets 12 235,692 235,692 235,692 Trade receivables 16 1,930,639 1,930,639 1,930,639 Other current financial assets 17 135,881 135,881 135,881 Cash and cash equivalents 20 1,107,340 1,107,340 1,107,340 Total 3,409,552 3,409,552 3,409,552 31 December 2018 Note Other Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value liabilities at liabilities at derivatives liabilities at amortised fair value fair value cost through through profit or loss profit or loss (€’000) Financial liabilities Bank and other loans and borrowings 23 1,117,257 1,117,257 1,120,438 Bonds 24 1,101,453 1,101,453 839,000 Lease liabilities 25 98,736 98,736 98,736 Derivatives and other current financial 26 liabilities Trade payables 30 2,385,610 2,385,610 2,385,610 Total 4,703,056 4,703,056 4,443,784 337 31 December 2019 Note Financial Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value assets at assets at fair derivatives assets at fair amortised cost value through value through profit or loss profit or loss (€’000) Financial assets Derivatives and non-current 12 378,272 378,272 378,272 financial assets Trade receivables 16 1,827,173 1,827,173 1,827,173 Other current financial assets 17 241,249 268 241,517 241,517 Cash and cash equivalents 20 1,020,858 1,020,858 1,020,858 Total 3,467,552 268 3,467,820 3,467,820 31 December 2019 Note Other liabilities Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value at amortised liabilities at derivatives liabilities at cost fair value fair value through profit through profit or loss or loss (€’000) Financial liabilities Bank and other loans and 23 982,896 982,896 985,716 borrowings Bonds 24 1,105,185 1,105,185 1,081,060 Lease liabilities 25 160,382 160,382 160,382 Derivatives and other current 26 2,012 2,012 2,012 financial liabilities Trade payables 30 2,612,737 2,612,737 2,612,737 Total 4,861,200 2,012 4,863,212 4,841,907 The note column gives the section in which the relevant item is described. Reference should be made to the section on the accounting policies for information on the fair value measurement of these items. Specifically, the fair value of the items is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. 338 Risk management The Group is exposed to financial risks which encompass all the risks related to capital availability, affected by credit and liquidity management and/or the volatility of market factors such as interest and exchange rates. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises currency risk and interest rate risk. Currency risk The Group’s international presence entails its exposure to currency risk arising from fluctuations in the value of trade and financial transactions in currencies other than the individual group companies’ functional currencies. The Group has adopted a currency risk management strategy to mitigate this risk based on the guidelines described in the “Risk management system” section of the Directors’ report to which reference is made. Currency risk at 31 December 2019 mainly related to the following currencies: • US dollar (USD) • Ethiopian Birr (BIRR) • Australian dollar (AUD) • Colombian peso (COP) • Tajikistani somoni (TJS) • South African rand (ZAR) The Group considers each group company’s assets and liabilities in currencies other than its functional currency, net of derivatives agreed to hedge the above trade and financial transactions, when assessing the potential effects of fluctuations in the above currencies. The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis, which considers a 5% increase or decrease in the exchange rates compared to the actual exchange rates at 31 December 2019 and 2018 to reflect the potential effects on profit (loss) and equity. 339 2018 2019 (€m) -5% +5% -5% +5% US dollar 21.15 (21.15) 8.33 (8.33) Birr 9.75 (9.75) 5.19 (5.19) Australian dollar 3.39 (3.39) 0.18 (0.18) Peso 2.36 (2.36) 2.93 (2.93) Somoni (0.94) 0.94 (0.11) 0.11 Rand (1.04) 1.04 (1.15) 1.15 This analysis excludes the effects of the translation of the equity of group entities with a currency other than the Euro. Interest rate risk Considering the Group’s predominantly fixed rate debt structure in 2019, had interest rates increased or decreased by an average 75 basis points in 2019, the profit before tax would have been respectively smaller or greater by a maximum of €6.2 million (2018: €5.7 million), assuming that all other variables remained constant and without considering cash and cash equivalents. Credit risk Credit risk is that deriving from the Group’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations. Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of the characteristics of the countries in which the Group’s activities should be carried out and the customers, which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer. Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers (contract assets and liabilities) in relation to contract work in progress as a whole.

Liquidity risk Liquidity risk derives from the risk that the financial resources necessary to meet obligations may not be available to the Group at the agreed terms and deadlines. The Group’s strategy aims at ensuring that each ongoing contract is financially independent, considering the structure of the consortia and SPEs, which may limit the availability of financial resources to achievement of 341 the related projects. Liquidity management also considers the existence of constraints to the transfer of currency imposed by certain countries.

The “After” balance for bonds relates to the bonds issued in the second half of 2017 for redemption in 2024 (see note 24). Liquidity risk management is mainly based on maintaining a balanced financial position. This strategy is pursued by each of the Group’s operating companies. Loans and borrowings and trade payables (net of advances) falling due before 31 March 2020 are compared with the cash and cash equivalents that can be used to meet such obligations in the table below: 342 Total financial commitments Cash and cash Difference (€’000) due before 31 March 2020 equivalents (*) Salini Impregilo (head office and branches) 268,647 214,907 (53,740) Subsidiaries 193,254 235,763 42,509 SPEs 286,334 358,262 71,928 Joint operations 141,209 187,222 46,014 Total 889,444 996,155 106,711 Fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position be classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair value.

The transaction price of ongoing contracts allocated to the unsatisfied performance obligations amounts to € 26,704.3 million at the reporting date. The Group will recognise this amount as revenue in future periods in line with the available forecasts. 344 Revenue related to unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) of which: from 2020 to performance obligations which will be recognised in future (€m) 2022 of which: after years Total 15,212.5 10,720.8 Ongoing contracts include contracts with customers if they meet the criteria of IFRS 15.928. The item includes variable consideration when its realisation is highly probable.

The increase of €25.8 million is mainly due to the cost recharges to non-controlling consortium members (other income in the consortium’s financial statements), mostly related to COCIV. Salini Impregilo Group’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system whereby the costs incurred by the SPE are invoiced to the consortium members in line with their investment percentages. As this income does not arise on the performance of the contract obligations or contract negotiations, it is recognised as “Other income”. On 19 December 2019, Condotte’s interest in COCIV was reduced to the minimum (the paragraph “Change in Condotte’s interest in COCIV“ in note 4 provides more information about this). 35. Operating expenses Operating expenses for the year amount to €4,873.2 million compared to €5,129.6 million for 2018. The item may be broken down as follows: 28 a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; d) the contract has commercial substance (i.e., the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and e) it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. 345 (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Purchases 861,756 571,283 (290,473) Subcontracts 1,658,505 1,773,965 115,460 Services 1,346,115 1,282,093 (64,022) Personnel expenses 774,416 791,210 16,794 Other operating expenses 143,603 180,252 36,649 Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and impairment losses 345,170 274,360 (70,810) Total 5,129,565 4,873,163 (256,402) The variations in the individual items compared to 2018 are due to the different cost structures that vary from contract to contract and may, in some cases, entail changes in the industrial operating model from one year to another. Moreover, as these are large-scale infrastructural works that take several years to complete, resort to normal production factors depends on the stage of completion of each contract in any given year. These changes may generate significant variations in the percentage of the related cost categories depending on the contract and the year, while not affecting the total percentage of costs of total revenue. 35.1 Purchases The cost of raw materials and consumables incurred in 2019 decreased by €290.5 million to €571.3 million compared to the previous year. (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Purchases of raw materials and consumables 831,940 542,136 (289,804) Change in raw materials and consumables 29,816 29,147 (669) Total 861,756 571,283 (290,473) The decrease in the cost of raw materials and consumables is mainly related to the progress on the projects in Dubai, Ethiopia and Poland. 35.2 Subcontracts Costs of subcontracts increased to €1,774.0 million, up €115.5 million on 2018 as shown in the following table. (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Subcontracts 1,658,505 1,773,965 115,460 Total 1,658,505 1,773,965 115,460 The increase is mostly due to Lane Group’s contracts and the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section, partly offset by the smaller subcontracting costs of the contracts in Qatar which are nearly finished. 346 35.3 Services This item decreased to €1,282.1 million, down €64.0 million on the previous year, as shown in the following table: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Consultancy and technical services 648,746 559,300 (89,446) Recharging of costs by consortia 196,648 279,769 83,121 Leases 204,196 165,913 (38,283) Transport and customs 89,179 72,601 (16,578) Insurance 54,223 67,969 13,746 Maintenance 28,406 22,879 (5,527) Fees to directors, statutory auditors and independent 11,080 12,973 1,893 Other auditors 113,637 100,689 (12,948) Total 1,346,115 1,282,093 (64,022) Leases include rent and leases with variable payments or that are covered by the practical expedients of IFRS 16 in 2019 (see note 2). The Group elected to use the practical expedient for assets of a low value and leases with a term of less than 12 months and the related payments are recognised in profit or loss immediately. The leases in 2018 also included the costs of rent and leases that have required the recognition of a lease liability and a right-of-use asset since 1 January 2019. The €38.3 million decrease in “Leases” is due to the Group’s application of IFRS 16 starting from 1 January 2019. “Other” decreased by €12.9 million over 2018 principally due to the Danish contract (Cityringen project) which is nearing completion. “Consultancy and technical services” decreased by €89.4 million and mainly consist of the design and construction costs incurred by the SPEs and legal and administrative consultancy fees. A breakdown of this item is as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Design and engineering services 346,632 326,791 (19,841) Legal, administrative and other services 128,501 122,871 (5,630) Construction 172,323 108,937 (63,386) Testing 1,290 701 (589) Total 648,746 559,300 (89,446) 35.4 Personnel expenses Personnel expenses for the year amount to €791.2 million, up €16.8 million on 2018.

It may be analysed as follows: 348 (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Total impairment losses 194,519 102,423 (92,096) Depreciation of property, plant and equipment 131,992 92,924 (39,068) Depreciation of right-of-use assets 51,052 51,052 Amortisation of contract costs 21,987 25,232 3,245 Amortisation of rights to infrastructure under concession 1,148 1,135 (13) Amortisation of intangible assets 922 593 (329) Amortisation and depreciation 156,049 170,936 14,887 Provisions (5,398) 1,001 6,399 Total amortisation, depreciation and provisions 150,651 171,937 21,286 Total 345,170 274,360 (70,810) Impairment losses of €102.4 million mainly relate to: the impairment losses of €45.8 million related to receivables due to COCIV from the consortium member Condotte given that it is currently under extraordinary administration; the impairment losses on assets in Venezuela (€35.7 million) as a result of the impairment test performed at the reporting date (reference should be made to the “Venezuela” paragraph of the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report and the paragraph on “Impairment Venezuela” in note 16). The impairment losses recognised on the Venezuelan contracts amounted to €165.5 million in 2018. The item also includes the impairment losses recognised on trade receivables for the road contracts in Poland (€6.8 million), the USW projects in Campania following the Naples Court’s first level hearing (€4.7 million) and the Al Bayt Stadium in Qatar (€4.0 million). On 1 January 2019, the Group adopted IFRS 16 which introduced new guidelines for the accounting treatment of leased assets and their depreciation. As a result, it introduced a new item “Depreciation of right-of-use assets”. In 2018, depreciation of leased assets was included under depreciation of property, plant and equipment. 36. Net financing costs Net financing costs amount to €73.2 million compared to €72.9 million for 2018. The item may be broken down as follows: 349 (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Financial income 55,754 69,587 13,833 Financial expense (141,918) (147,061) (5,143) Net exchange gains 13,306 4,288 (9,018) Net financing costs (72,858) (73,186) (328) 36.1 Financial income Financial income totals €69.6 million (€55.8 million) and is made up as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Income from inflation adjustment 141 3,718 3,577 Gains on securities 1,794 426 (1,368) Interest and other income from unconsolidated group 12,630 9,022 (3,608) companies and other related parties Interest income 12,626 9,022 (3,604) Financial income 4 (4) Interest and other financial income 41,189 56,421 15,232 Interest on receivables 15,014 5,736 (9,278) Bank interest 17,348 15,579 (1,769) Other 8,827 35,106 26,279 Total 55,754 69,587 13,833 The €13.8 million increase is mostly due to rise in “Other” of €26.3 million, principally related to interest income of €17.0 million related to the Ariguani consortium accrued as compensation on the recovery of the advance following settlement of the dispute with the former partner/subcontractor Conalvias in September 2019. 36.2 Financial expense Financial expense totals €147.1 million (€141.9 million) and is made up as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Intragroup interest and other expense (8,225) (10,523) (2,298) Interest and other financial expense (133,693) (136,538) (2,845) Other (46,110) (34,987) 11,123 Interest on bonds (45,703) (34,982) 10,721 Bank interest on accounts and financing (30,086) (37,254) (7,168) Interest on tax liabilities (1,725) (13,913) (12,188) Leases (4,027) (6,456) (2,429) Expense for inflation adjustments (1,333) (5,122) (3,789) Bank fees (4,709) (3,824) 885 Total (141,918) (147,061) (5,143) The rise in financial expense is mostly due to the effect of the measurement of loan assets recognised at 31 December 2019 in accordance with IFRS 9 and payment of interest of €13.7 million by the Ethiopian branch for 350 the years from 2014 to 2016 as part of a tax assessment. This increase is partly offset by the reduction in financial expense on the bonds of approximately €10.7 million compared to the previous year following the redemption of the unsecured senior bonds in August 2018. 36.3 Net exchange gains Net exchange gains amount to €4.3 million compared to €13.3 million for the previous year and arose on the performance of the Ethiopian Birr and the US dollar against the Euro. 37. Net losses on equity investments Net losses on equity investments increased to €127.7 million (€29.5 million) mostly due to the joint venture working on the I-4 Ultimate contract.

Diluted earnings per share are calculated considering the weighted average of the outstanding shares adjusted by assuming the conversion of all the shares with potentially diluting effects. The following table summarises the calculation. At the reporting date, the parent’s share capital consists of 892,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares. The Group has 1,330,845 treasury shares in portfolio.

Basis of preparation Salini Impregilo S.p.A. has prepared its separate financial statements at 31 December 2019 on a going concern basis. The directors have checked that events that could affect the company’s ability to meet its commitment in the near future and, specifically, in the next 12 months do not exist. Preparation of separate financial statements requires management to make judgements and complex estimates about the company’s future profitability and financial position, based also on its sector. These complex estimates underpin assumptions about going concern and the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and costs. They do not consider non-recurring events that management cannot foresee at the date of preparation of the separate financial statements. As required by Regulation no. 1606/2002 issued by the European Parliament and Council, implemented in Italy by Legislative decree no. 38/2005, these separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and endorsed by the European Union at 31 December 2019. They comprise a statement of financial position, a statement of profit or loss, a statement of comprehensive income, a statement of cash flows, a statement of changes in equity and these notes. The separate financial statements have been prepared using the historical cost principle, except for those items which are recognised at fair value in accordance with IFRS, as described in the section on “Accounting policies”. The statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss are presented in Euros, whereas the amounts in the statement of comprehensive income, the statement of cash flows, the statement of changes in equity and these notes are shown in thousands of Euros, unless stated otherwise. 2. Changes in standards Changes in standards and effects of new standards This section lists the standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IFRS, endorsed by the European Union and applicable since 1 January 2019: 400 IASB application date Standard/Interpretation IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019 IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over income tax treatments 1 January 2019 Amendments to IFRS 9 – Prepayment features with negative 1 January 2019 compensation Amendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2019 Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle 1 January 2019 (amendments to IFRS 3, IFRS 11, IAS 12 and IAS 23) Amendments to IAS 19: Plan amendment, curtailment or settlement 1 January 2019 The standards, amendments and interpretations published by the IASB and the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee (IFRS-IC) but not yet endorsed by the competent EU bodies at the reporting date are set out below: Standard/Interpretation IASB application date IFRS 17 Insurance contracts 1 January 2021 Amendments to References to the conceptual framework in IFRS Standards 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 3 Business combinations 1 January 2020 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8: Definition of material 1 January 2020 Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or contribution of assets Application date between an investor and its associate or joint venture deferred indefinitely Adoption of the above standards applicable since 1 January 2019 has not significantly affected the company’s separate financial statements, except for IFRS 16 and IFRIC 23. The IASB issued IFRS 16 in January 2016. It introduced a single method to account for leases in the financial statements of the lessee, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases, so that the lessee recognises an asset for the right to use an underlying asset and a lease liability. The standard includes exemptions when the lease term is 12 months or less or the underlying asset has a low value. IFRS 16 has replaced IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease, SIC 15 Operating leases Incentives and SIC 27 Evaluating the substance of transactions in the legal form of a lease. The company has applied IFRS 16 retrospectively by recognising the cumulative effect of the FTA in retained earnings at 1 January 2019 (the date of transition). Therefore, it has not restated the comparative figures at 31 401 December 2018 which are presented in accordance with IAS 17 and related interpretations. Details of the changes introduced by the new standard are provided below. The company has elected to use the following practical expedients to restate the opening balances: a) it has applied a single discount rate to portfolios of leases with similar characteristics and a similar remaining lease term for a similar class of underlying assets in a similar economic environment; b) leases that expire before 31 December 2019 have been classified as short-term; c) it has excluded initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset; d) it has used hindsight to determine contract variables (specifically the lease term). In addition to the practical expedients set out above for transition, the company also elected to use the practical expedients for low-value assets and leases with a term of less than 12 months. Therefore, when the value of the underlying new individual asset is less than €5,000 or the lease term is less than 12 months, it expenses the lease payments on a straight-line basis and when incurred. The company elected not to separate non-lease components from lease components for vehicles, office furniture and equipment and other assets. It elected to separate non-lease components from lease components for land and buildings, plant and machinery and industrial and commercial equipment. It has estimated the lease liability and the right-of-use asset for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17 and considering the elections made about the transition method and the practical expedients as follows: ▪ the lease liability at 1 January 2019 has been measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application; ▪ the right-of-use asset has been estimated using two methods defined on a lease-by-lease basis and, specifically, at: ▪ its carrying amount as if the standard had been applied since the commencement date, but discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate at 1 January 2019; ▪ an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2018 under IAS 17. The significant judgements made to apply IFRS 16 that had a material impact on the estimate of the assets and liabilities related to the discount rate and the lease term include: a) the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate was used to discount the lease payments, estimated using the lease’s reference currency, economic context and class of underlying asset. The weighted average of the rates applied is 4.4%. 402 b) the lease term was estimated based on the contract clauses to identify the non-cancellable period of the lease; the company considered the contracts in which the leased assets are used for the termination and renewal options; The captions “Right-of-use assets” and “Lease liabilities” include the effect of applying IFRS 16. The leased assets and the related financial liabilities that, under the previous standard applicable at 31 December 2018, were recognised in the captions “Property, plant and equipment” and “Finance lease liabilities”, respectively, have been reclassified as set out below. The company is a lessor of right-of-use assets which it accounts for as operating leases. It is not required to reclassify those leases in which it is the lessor under IFRS 16, except for subleases. The company has assessed its classification of subleases considering the right-of-use asset rather than the underlying asset and has found that they comply with the definition of operating leases as per IFRS 16. The following table shows the effect of application of the new standard on opening equity at 1 January 2019: Equity at 1 January 2019 (€’000) Equity and profit 845,199 Total equity before introduction of the new standard 845,199 Effects of the application of the new standard 828 Equity after introduction of the new standard Equity and profit 846,027 Total equity before introduction of the new standard 846,027 Lease liabilities presented in the above statement of financial position at the date of initial application amount to €41.1 million. Commitments arising from operating leases presented under IAS 17 at 31 December 2018, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate at the date of initial application, amounted to €51.2 million. The decrease is mostly due to the better estimate made of the lease term and the application of the practical expedients for short-term leases (less than 12 months) and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. IFRIC 23 provides guidance on the determination of taxable profit where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. The interpretation establishes that if it is not probable that a particular tax treatment will be accepted by the tax authority, the entity shall reflect this uncertainty in its financial statements. Accordingly, based on past experience of tax assessments performed by the Ethiopian tax authorities, the company recognised a higher tax liability of €8 million compared to 2017 and 2018 as these years are still open to assessment. The interpretation’s transition provisions allow this effect to be recognised under retained earnings at 1 January 2019 and the comparative figures do not have to be restated. 403 The following table shows the effects of the application of the above standard and interpretation: Separate financial statements Statement of financial position as at 1 January 2019 ASSETS Published 31 IFRS 16 FTA IFRS 16 IFRIC 23 FTA Restated December 2018 reclassifications 1 January 2019 (€’000) Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment 169,527 (37,160) 132,367 Right-of-use assets 41,220 37,160 78,380 Intangible assets 123,755 123,755 Equity investments 1,324,130 1,324,130 Derivatives and non-current financial assets 116,394 116,394 Deferred tax assets 195,001 3 195,004 Total non-current assets 1,928,807 41,223 1,970,030 Current assets Inventories 143,268 143,268 Contract assets 717,157 139 717,296 Trade receivables 1,420,387 1,420,387 Derivatives and other current financial assets 710,943 710,943 Current tax assets 94,302 94,302 Other current tax assets 62,652 62,652 Other current assets 290,089 (360) 289,729 Cash and cash equivalents 547,730 547,730 Total current assets 3,986,528 (221) 3,986,307 Total assets 5,915,335 41,002 5,956,337 404 Separate financial statements Statement of financial position as at 1 January 2019 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Published 31 IFRS 16 FTA IFRS 16 IFRIC 23 FTA Restated December 2018 reclassifications 1 January 2019 (€’000) Equity Share capital 544,740 544,740 Share premium reserve 120,798 120,798 Other reserves 188,891 188,891 Other comprehensive income 343 343 Losses carried forward and profit for the year (9,573) 828 (8,000) (16,745) Equity 845,199 828 (8,000) 838,027 Non-current liabilities Bank and other loans and borrowings 552,180 552,180 Bonds 1,088,158 1,088,158 Finance lease liabilities 16,596 (16,596) Lease liabilities 30,596 16,596 47,192 Post-employment benefits and employee 11,667 11,667 benefits Deferred tax liabilities 18,994 215 19,209 Provisions for risks 48,605 48,605 Total non-current liabilities 1,736,200 30,811 1,767,011 Current liabilities Current portion of bank loans and borrowings 931,775 931,775 and current account facilities Current portion of bonds 13,295 13,295 Current portion of finance lease liabilities 17,113 (17,113) Current portion of lease liabilities 10,535 17,113 27,648 Contract liabilities 626,681 626,681 Trade payables 1,514,680 (1,172) 1,513,508 Current tax liabilities 76,887 8,000 84,887 Other current tax liabilities 15,897 15,897 Other current liabilities 137,608 137,608 Total current liabilities 3,333,936 9,363 8,000 3,351,299 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Total equity and liabilities 5,915,335 41,002 5,956,337 405 3. Basis of presentation Separate financial statements Salini Impregilo opted to present its separate financial statements at 31 December 2019 as follows: Current and non-current assets and current and non-current liabilities are presented separately in the statement of financial position. Current assets and liabilities are those expected to be realised, sold, used or settled in the company’s normal operating cycle, which usually exceeds 12 months. Non-current assets and liabilities include non-current assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefits, deferred tax liabilities and other balances expected to be realised, sold, used or settled after the company’s normal operating cycle, i.e., more than twelve months after the reporting date. The statement of profit or loss gives a classification of costs by nature and shows the profit or loss before “Financing income (costs) and gains (losses) on investments” and income taxes. The statement of comprehensive income shows all non-owner changes in equity. The statement of cash flows presents the cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities separately. The indirect method is used. Accounting policies The accounting policies adopted to draw up the company’s separate financial statements at 31 December 2019 comply with the IFRS and are consistent with those used to prepare the 2018 separate financial statements, except for the standards enacted after 1 January 2019, summarised in the section on the “Changes in standards”. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are recognised at purchase or production cost, net of accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis using rates determined based on the assets’ residual possible use. The annual rates are as follows: Category Depreciation rate Land 0% Buildings 3% Plant and machinery from 10% to 20% Industrial and commercial equipment from 25% to 40% Other assets from 12% to 25% Land and buildings, plant and machinery with a carrying amount to be recovered mainly through their sale (rather than the asset’s continuing use) are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale shall be available for immediate sale and their sale shall be highly probable (i.e., the related commitments already exist). Their price shall be reasonable compared to their fair value. 406 The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances take place indicating that the carrying amount may not be recovered. Reference should be made to the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets” for details on impairment testing. Borrowing costs directly related to the acquisition or construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset, to the extent of its recoverable amount. As established by IAS 23 Borrowing costs, the company has applied this method to all qualifying assets. Borrowing costs are capitalised when the costs of the acquisition of the asset and borrowing costs are incurred, and the activities necessary to bring the asset to a condition for its use have been started. The costs provided for but not yet paid related to qualifying assets are excluded from the amount to be capitalised. Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted. Subsequent expenditure is only capitalised if it increases the future economic benefits of the related asset. All other expenditure is expensed when incurred. Ordinary maintenance costs are fully expensed when incurred. Costs that increase the carrying amount of assets are allocated thereto and depreciated over their residual economic lives. Dismantlement and restoration costs of assets used for contract work in progress are added to the cost of the related asset and depreciated in line with the depreciation pattern of the asset to which they refer when they are foreseeable and objectively determinable. Leasehold improvements are classified in the different items of property, plant and equipment on the basis of their nature. They are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the relevant asset and the residual term of the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognised in accordance with IFRS 16. More information about the application of this standard is available in note 2 “Changes in standards”. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets acquired or generated internally are recognised under assets in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible assets when it is probable that the use of the asset will generate future economic benefits and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Those assets with finite useful lives are measured at acquisition or development cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Recoverability of their carrying amount is checked by using the criteria set out in the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets”. Equity investments Investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint ventures are measured at cost and tested regularly for impairment. This test is carried out whenever there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. The method used is described in the section on “Impairment of non-financial assets”. When an 407 impairment loss is required, this is recognised immediately in profit or loss. When the reasons for a previous impairment loss no longer exist, the carrying amount of the investment is restated to the extent of its original cost. Reversals of impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment of non-financial assets If there is any indication that an intangible asset or an item of property, plant and equipment is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If a binding sales agreement does not exist, fair value is estimated using the observable prices of an active market, recent transactions or the best information available to reflect the amount the entity could obtain by disposing of the asset. Value in use is determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset, net of taxes, and, if reasonably determinable, from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Discounting is applied by using a post-tax discount rate which reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The assessment is made for individual assets or the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets from its continuing use (cash-generating unit). An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. If the reasons for the impairment loss are no longer valid, the impairment loss (except in the case of goodwill) is reversed and the adjustment is taken to profit or loss as a reversal of impairment losses. A reversal of impairment losses is recognised to the extent of the lower of the recoverable amount and original carrying amount less depreciation/amortisation that would have been recognised had the impairment loss not been recognised. Inventories of goods Inventories of goods are measured at the lower of average purchase cost and net realisable value. Cost includes the directly related costs and estimated realisable value is determined using the replacement cost of the assets or similar assets. Any write-downs are eliminated in subsequent years when the reasons therefor are no longer valid. Contract assets and liabilities Contract assets and liabilities are recognised and measured in accordance with the guidelines of IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised using the five-step model as set out below: 1. Identify the contract with a customer; 2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3. Determine the transaction price; 408 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. IFRS 15 also covers contract costs, contract modifications and financial statements disclosures. The methods used by the company to apply IFRS 15 are summarised below. 1. Identify the contract with a customer The company identifies and measures contracts with customers in line with IFRS 15 after they have been signed and are binding, creating enforceable rights and obligations for the company and the customer. The company considers the criteria of IFRS 15.9 set out below to identify the contract: a) the parties to the contract have approved the contract (in writing, orally or in accordance with other customary business practices) and are committed to perform their respective obligations; b) the entity can identify each party’s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred; c) the entity can identify the payment terms for the goods or services to be transferred; d) the contract has commercial substance (i.e., the risk, timing or amount of the entity’s future cash flows is expected to change as a result of the contract); and e) it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. 2. Identifying performance obligations and allocating the transaction price IFRS 15 identifies a performance obligation as a promise included in the contract with a customer to transfer: a) a good or service (or a bundle of goods or services) that is distinct; or b) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. In the company’s case, its performance obligation is usually the entire project. In fact, although the individual performance obligations provided for in the contract are distinct, they are highly interdependent and integrated as the contract provides for the transfer of the entire infrastructure to the customer. However, certain contractual items include additional services that should be considered as distinct performance obligations. For example, these may be post-completion maintenance services after final inspection and additional or different contract warranties compared to those provided for by law or normal sector practices . When a contract has more than one performance obligation, the appropriate portion of the contract consideration should be allocated to each separate performance obligation pursuant to IFRS 15. The company’s contracts with customers usually specify the price of each contractual item (detailed in the contract). 3. Determining the criteria for satisfaction of the performance obligations and recognition of the revenue IFRS 15 provides that revenue shall be recognised when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied transferring the promised good or service (or asset) to the customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control. 409 The company’s contracts with customers are usually long-term contracts that include obligations to be satisfied over time based on the progress towards completion and transfer of control of the asset to the customer over time. The reasons why recognition of revenue over time is considered the correct approach are: • the customer controls the asset as it is constructed (the asset is built directly in the area made available by the customer); • the asset under construction does not have an alternative use and the company has an enforceable right to payment for its performance completed to date over the contract term. IFRS 15 requires that progress towards satisfaction of a performance obligation be measured using the method that best represents the transfer of control of the asset under construction to the customer. The objective when measuring progress is to depict an entity’s performance in transferring control of goods or services promised to a customer. The company considers its market sector and the complex mix of goods and services it provides when it selects the appropriate revenue recognition method. IFRS 15 provides for two alternative methods to recognise revenue over time: a) output method; b) input method. Output methods recognise revenue on the basis of direct measurements of the value to the customer of the goods or services transferred to the date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract (e.g., surveys of performance completed to date, milestones reached, units delivered, etc.). Input methods recognise revenue on the basis of the entity’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation (e.g., resources consumed, labour hours expended, costs incurred, time elapsed or machine hours used) relative to the total expected inputs to the satisfaction of that performance obligation (cost to cost method). The most appropriate method for measuring revenue is the cost to cost method calculated by applying the percentage of completion (the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs) to contract revenue. The calculation of the ratio of costs incurred to estimated costs only considers costs that contribute to the actual transfer of control of the goods and/or services. This method allows the objective measurement of the transfer of control to the customer as it considers quantitative variables related to the contract as a whole. When choosing the appropriate method for measuring the transfer of control to the customer, the company did not adopt the output method (e.g., surveys of performance completed to date) for its ongoing contracts as it considered that although this output method would allow a direct measurement of progress, it would also lead to operating difficulties in managing and monitoring progress considering all the resources necessary to satisfy the obligation. In addition, an output method would entail the application of criteria and measurement inputs that are not directly observable and the incurring of excessive costs to obtain useful information. 410 Finally, in the company’s reference sector, the objective of contractual outputs (milestones) refers to, inter alia, modulation of cash flows to obtain financial resources useful to perform the contract and the definition of technical specifications of the works and related performance timing. 4. Determining the transaction price Given the engineering and operating complexities, the size and length of time involved in completing the contracts, in addition to the fixed consideration agreed in the contract, the transaction price also includes additional consideration, whose conditions need to be assessed. A claim is an amount that the contract seeks to collect as reimbursement for costs incurred (and/or to be incurred) due to reasons or events that could not be foreseen and are not attributable to the contractor, for more work performed (and/or to be performed) or variations that were not formalised in riders. The measurement of the additional consideration arising from claims is subject to a high level of uncertainty, given its nature, both in terms of the amounts that the customer will pay and the collection times, which usually depend on the outcome of negotiations between the parties or decisions taken by judicial/arbitration bodies. This type of consideration is regulated by IFRS 15 as “contract modifications”. The standard provides that a contract modification exists if it is approved by the parties to the contract. IFRS 15 provides that a contract modification could be approved in writing, by oral agreement or implied by customary business practices. A contract modification may exist even though the parties to the contract have a dispute about the scope or price (or both) of the modification. The rights to the consideration shall be provided for contractually generating an enforceable right. Once the enforceable right has been identified, in order to recognise the claims and amount of the additional consideration requested, the company shall apply the guidance about the variable consideration given in IFRS 15. Therefore, in order to adjust the transaction price to include the additional consideration arising from the claims, the company shall decide whether it is highly probable that the revenue will not be reversed in the future. The company considers all the relevant aspects and circumstances such as the contract terms, business and negotiating practices of the sector or other supporting evidence when taking the above decision. 4.a Optional works The consideration for optional works is additional consideration for future works that have not yet been agreed and/or ordered by the customer when it signs the contract. The consideration for optional works is provided for in the contracts with the customer as it represents potential future work interrelated with the main contract object. However, most of the contracts provide that the additional works shall be specifically defined and approved by the customer before they start. Otherwise, the contractor does not have an enforceable right to payment for this performance. Accordingly and based on sector practices, this type of consideration is a contract modification and, under IFRS 15, shall be considered when measuring the transaction price if approved by both parties to the contract. In this case, the enforceable right can only be identified after specific approval or instructions from the customer in line with its customary business practices or operating methods. 411 4.b Penalties Contracts with customers may include penalties due to non-compliance with certain contract terms (such as, for example, non-compliance with delivery times). When the contract penalties are “reasonably expected”, the transaction price is reduced accordingly. The company analyses all the indicators available at the reporting date to assess the probability of a contract default that would lead to the application of penalties. 4.c Significant financing component It is normal practice in the construction and large-scale infrastructure sector that the transaction price for the project (which is usually completed over more than one year) is paid in the form of an advance and subsequent progress billing (based on progress reports). This method of allocating cash flows is often defined in the calls for tenders. The customer’s payment flows (advances and subsequent progress billing) are usually organised to make construction of the project by the contractor feasible, limiting its financial exposure. Constructors in the large-scale infrastructure sector build projects for large amounts of money and the initial outlay is usually high. The contract advance is used for the following reasons: • to finance the initial contract investments and pay the related advances to subcontractors; • as a form of guarantee to cover any risks of contractual breach by the customer. The advance is reabsorbed by the subsequent progress billing in line with the stage of completion of the contract. Furthermore, the company’s operating cycle is generally several years. Therefore, it considers the correct timescale of its works to determine whether its contracts include a significant financing component. Based on the above, it has not identified significant financing components in the transaction price for the contracts that include changes in the advances or progress billings in line with sector practices and/or of amounts that are suitable as guarantees and have a timeframe in line with the cash flows required to complete the contract. 5. Losses to complete The new standard does not specifically cover the accounting treatment of loss-making contracts but refers to IAS 15, which regulates the measurement and classification (previously covered by IAS 11) of onerous contracts. IAS 37 provides that an onerous contract is one in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The present obligation under the contract shall be recognised and measured as a provision when the loss is probable based on the most recent forecasts prepared by management. The unavoidable costs are all those costs that: 412 • are directly proportionate to the contract and increase the performance obligation transferred to the customer; • do not include those costs that will be incurred regardless of satisfaction of the performance obligation; • cannot be avoided by the company through future actions. Measurement of any loss-making contracts (the onerous test) is performed at individual performance obligation level. This approach best represents the different contract profits or losses depending on the nature of the goods and services transferred to the customer. 6. Contract costs 6.a Incremental costs of obtaining a contract IFRS 15 allows an entity to recognise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an asset if it expects to recover those costs through the future economic benefits of the contract. The incremental costs of obtaining a contract are those costs that an entity incurs to obtain a contract with a customer. Costs to obtain a contract that would have been incurred regardless of whether the contract was obtained shall be recognised as an expense when incurred (costs not explicitly chargeable to the customer). The incremental costs are recognised as an asset (contract costs) and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. 6.b Costs to fulfil a contract Under IFRS 15, an entity shall recognise an asset from the costs incurred to fulfil a contract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria: • the costs relate directly to a contract; • the costs generate or enhance resources of the entity that will be used in satisfying (or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and • the costs are expected to be recovered. It is the practice of the company’s sector that these costs usually consist of pre-operating costs that are recognised by customers and included in precise contract items or are not explicitly recognised and are covered by the contract profit. Formal recognition of these costs implies that, when they are incurred, control of the asset provided for in the contract is transferred. Therefore, they cannot be recognised as assets and contribute to the stage of completion. When the contract provides for their explicit recognition and the above three criteria are met, the pre-operating costs are recognised as assets and amortised on a systematic basis that is consistent with the pattern of transfer of control of the goods and/or services to the customer. In addition, IFRS 15 defines all those costs that, by their nature, do not contribute to the stage of completion as, although they are referred to in the contract and can be recovered, they do not contribute to generating or enhancing the resources that will be used to satisfy the performance obligations or to transfer of control of the good and/or service to the customer. 413 7. Presentation in the separate financial statements The statement of financial position includes “Contract costs” under intangible assets which includes the costs capitalised under the criteria described in point 6 of this section. Amortisation of these costs is included in the statement of profit or loss item “Amortisation, depreciation and provisions”. Contract assets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position items “Contract assets” and “Contract liabilities”, respectively under assets and liabilities. The classification in line with IFRS 15 depends on the relationship between the company’s performance obligation and payment by the customer. These items show the sum of the following components analysed individually for each customer: (+) Amount of work performed calculated using the cost-to-cost method pursuant to IFRS 15 (-) Progress payments and advances received (-) Contractual advances. When the total is positive, the net balance is recognised as a Contract asset . If it is negative, it is recognised as a Contract liability . When the amounts represent an unconditional right to payment of the consideration, they are recognised as financial assets. The company’s statement of profit or loss includes a revenue item “Revenue from contracts with customers” to comply with IFRS 15. This revenue is presented and measured in accordance with the new standard. The item “Other income” includes income from transactions other than contracts with customers and is measured in line with other standards or the company’s specific accounting policy elections. It includes income related to gains on the sale of non-current assets, income on cost recharges, prior year income and income from the recharging of costs of Italian consortia and consortium companies. With respect to the last item, the company’s activities involve its participation in numerous SPEs that, especially in Italy, use the consortium structure, which works using a cost recharging system. Under IFRS 10 and IFRS 11, these entities have been classified as subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As this income does not arise on the performance of the contract obligations or contract negotiations, it is recognised as “Other income”. Real estate projects Closing inventories of real estate projects are those real estate areas developed with a view to selling them. They are measured at the lower of cost and estimated realisable value. Costs incurred consist of the consideration paid for purchasing the areas and related charges, construction costs and borrowing costs related to the project up to and not exceeding its completion. Financial instruments Financial assets – Debt instruments Financial assets, which are debt instruments, are classified in the following three categories depending on the instruments’ contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing them: • financial assets at amortised cost; 414 • financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); • financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value. Trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price. After initial recognition, financial assets that generate contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold them in order to collect contractual cash flows (hold to collect business model). Under the amortised cost method, the financial assets’ amount at initial recognition is decreased by principal repayments, any loss allowance and cumulated amortisation of the difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount. Amortisation is calculated using the effective interest rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset at initial recognition. Loans and receivables and other financial assets at amortised cost are recognised net of the related loss allowance. Debt instruments held within a business model whose objective is to collect contractual cash flows and sell financial assets (hold to collect and sell model) are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value gains and losses on these financial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income (OCI). The cumulative fair value gains and losses previously recognised in OCI are reclassified to profit or loss when the financial asset is derecognised. Interest income calculated using the effective interest method, exchange differences and impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Debt instruments that are not measured at amortised cost or FVTOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Financial assets that are transferred are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or are transferred to third parties. Impairment losses on financial assets The company tests the recoverable amount of debt instruments not measured at fair value through profit or loss using the expected credit loss model. The new model entails development of judgement about the impact of changes in economic factors on the expected credit losses, which are weighted by probability of occurrence. Credit risk is that deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations. Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of the characteristics of the countries in which the company’s activities should be carried out and the customers, which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer. 415 Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables should be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers in relation to contract work in progress as a whole. Loans and borrowings and bonds Loans and borrowings and bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received less transaction costs. After initial recognition, loans are measured at amortised cost, whereby repayments are determined using the effective interest method with a rate which matches, at initial recognition, the expected cash flows with the initial carrying amount. Loan transaction costs are classified under liabilities decreasing the loan; amortised cost is calculated considering these costs and any discounts or premiums expected at settlement. The effects arising from the recognition at amortised cost are taken to “Financing income (costs)”. Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities (a) Financial assets A financial asset (or, where applicable, part of a financial asset or parts of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised when: • the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire; • the company retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients in full and immediately; • the company transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the asset and has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset and the related control. When the company has transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset and has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards or has retained control, it continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement in the asset. Continuing involvement that takes the form of guaranteeing the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the initial carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of the consideration that the company could be required to pay. (b) Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are derecognised when the underlying obligation is extinguished, cancelled or settled. When an existing financial liability is exchanged with another by the same lender at substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, this exchange or modification is treated as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss. 416 Impairment of financial assets If there is any indication that a financial asset is impaired, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Derivatives and hedging transactions Salini Impregilo has derivatives recognised at fair value when the related agreement is signed and for subsequent fair value changes. The treatment of the related fair value gains or losses changes depending on whether the conditions for hedge accounting are met, as described below. The company has derivatives to hedge currency and financial risks. At the inception of the transaction, it documents the hedging relationship, its risk management and strategy objectives in entering into the transaction, the hedging instrument and hedged item or transaction and the nature of the hedged risk. Moreover, at the inception of the transaction, and thereafter on an ongoing basis, the company documents whether or not the hedge meets the effectiveness requirements to offset its exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. “Hedging purposes” are assessed considering risk management objectives. When they do not meet the requirements of IFRS 9 for hedge accounting, the derivatives are classified as “Financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss”. Employee benefits Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits are recognised at the present value of the company’s liability determined in line with ruling legislation and national and in-house labour agreements. The valuation, based on demographic, financial and turnover assumptions, is carried out by independent actuaries. The gains and losses resulting from the actuarial calculation are recognised in profit or loss if related to service costs and interest expense or in comprehensive income if relating to assets and liabilities. The 2007 Finance Act and related implementing decrees introduced significant changes to legislation governing Italian post-employment benefits, effective as from 1 January 2007. These include the option given to employees, to be exercised before 30 June 2007, of where to allocate their future benefits. Specifically, employees can opt to allocate them to selected pension funds or maintain them with the company, in which case, the latter shall pay the contributions to the treasury fund of INPS (the Italian social security institution). Following these changes, the Italian post-employment benefits accruing after the date of the employees’ decision and, in any case, after 30 June 2007, are considered part of a defined contribution plan and treated like all other social security contributions. Share-based payments Share-based payments are measured at fair value of the option at the grant date. This amount is recognised in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. This treatment is based on an 417 assessment of the stock options that will effectively vest in favour of the qualifying employees. Fair value is determined using the share price at the grant date. Income taxes Current taxes are provided for using the enacted tax rates and laws ruling in Italy and other countries in which the company operates, including through its branches, based on the best estimate of the taxable profit for the year. Beginning from 2004, the company has joined the national tax consolidation system, as the consolidating party, which is regulated by the conditions set out in agreements drawn up by the participating companies. The agreements provide that tax losses transferred by the subsidiaries give rise to a benefit for them if and to the extent that they will be offset as part of the national tax consolidation system, considering any losses of the parent and/or other companies participating in the system. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated on the basis of the temporary differences between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in the statement of financial position. Deferred tax assets are recognised when the company holds their recovery to be probable. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and, to the extent necessary, is decreased when it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to use all or part of the related benefit. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities, respectively. In the case of transactions recognised directly in equity, the related deferred tax asset or liability also affects equity. Provisions for risks and charges In accordance with IAS 37, the company makes accruals to provisions for risks and charges when the following conditions exist: • the company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) at the reporting date as a result of a past event where an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; • it is probable that the obligation (through an outflow of resources) will have to be settled; • a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the time value is material and the obligation payment dates can be estimated reliably, the amount recognised as the provision equals the pre-tax future cash flows (i.e., forecast outflows) discounted at a rate that reflects the present market value and risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to discounting is recognised as a financial expense. 418 When the expected cash flows are included in an estimate range with the same probability of occurrence, the median value is discounted to measure the liability. Provision for restructuring costs is recognised when the company has approved a detailed formal plan that has been implemented and communicated to the third parties involved. Translation criteria for foreign currency items The translation criteria for foreign currency items adopted by the company are as follows: • foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities, excluding property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and equity investments measured at cost, are translated at the closing spot rate with any exchange rate gains or losses taken to profit or loss; • non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities are recognised at historical cost denominated in the foreign currency and translated using the historical exchange rate; • revenue and costs related to foreign currency transactions are recognised in profit or loss at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction; • any material effects deriving from changes in exchange rates after the reporting date are disclosed in the notes. The foreign branches’ functional currency is the Euro, as it is the primary currency they use in their operations. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets (and disposal groups) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Assets held for sale are recognised as such when the following events take place: • signing of a binding sales agreement; • approval and communication of a formal sales plan by directors. In order to be correctly measured, the assets shall be: • available for immediate sale in their present condition, • subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets, and • the sale must be highly probable and expected to take place within twelve months. Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or classified as held for sale and that meets any of the following criteria: i) it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; ii) it is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or iii) it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a plan to resell. 419 The profit or loss from discontinued operations is disclosed separately in the statement of profit or loss. As required by paragraph 34 of IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, the corresponding prior year figures are reclassified accordingly. Revenue from contracts with customers Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised using the five-step model: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (v) recognise revenue when (or as) the company satisfies a performance obligation. More information is available in the “Contract assets and liabilities” paragraph of these notes. Interest income Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis, considering the principal and applicable effective interest rate, i.e., the rate that discounts the estimated future inflows over the expected life of the financial asset to return it to its carrying amount. Dividends Dividends are recognised when the investors’ right to receive payment arises in line with local ruling legislation. Complex accounting estimates Preparation of financial statements and the related notes in accordance with the IFRS requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and financial statements disclosures. The estimates are used to: • determine amortisation and depreciation (see the “Property, plant and machinery”, “Leased property, plant and equipment”, and “Other intangible assets” paragraphs of the “ Accounting policies” section); • recognise impairment losses (see the “Impairment of non-financial assets” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise employee benefits (see the “Employee benefits” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise taxes (see the “Income taxes” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • recognise provisions for risks and charges (see the “Provisions for risks and charges” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section); • determine total contract costs and the related stage of completion (see the “Contract assets and liabilities” paragraph of the “Accounting policies” section). A significant part of the company’s activities is typically performed on the basis of contracts which provide that a specific consideration is agreed when the contract is awarded. This implies that the profits on these contracts may undergo change compared to the original estimates depending on the recoverability of greater expenses and/or costs the company may incur during performance of such contracts. 420 The actual results may differ from those estimated due to uncertainties underlying the assumptions and the conditions on which the estimates are based. Fundamental assumptions about the future and other reasons for uncertainty when making the estimates at the reporting date that may lead to material adjustments to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities are described in the specific section of the Directors’ report on the main risk factors and uncertainties. Scope of the separate financial statements Joint operations The company is involved in the following main joint operations: Civil Work Group (Saudi Arabia), Arge Tulfes Pfons (Austria), South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait), NGE Genie Civil S.a.s. Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Salini Impregilo NGE Genie Civil S.a.s.. Salini Impregilo has a 52% interest in the first joint operation, which is engaged in the civil works for the Riyadh metro. The second joint operation is 49% held by the company and is engaged in the construction of the last section of the Brenner-Innsbruck tunnel. South Al Mutlaa was incorporated in 2016 and is 55% held by Salini Impregilo. It is constructing primary urbanisation works to build a new residential area in a 12 thousand hectares site as part of the South Al Mutlaa Housing Project. NGE Genie Civil S.a.s. Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (France) is 50% held by Salini Impregilo and is engaged in the civil works for the Paris Metro as part of the Gran Paris Express project (Line 14, Lot 4). Salini Impregilo NGE Genie Civil S.a.s (France) is 65% held by Salini Impregilo and is engaged in the civil works for the Paris Metro as part of the Gran Paris Express project (Line 16, lot 2). The above operations are governed by joint control arrangements as resolutions of the governing bodies require a unanimous vote. Despite being separate vehicles, they are structured in a way that ensures ensure transparency of their rights and obligations with respect to Salini Impregilo. Change in Condotte’s interest in COCIV The COCIV consortium (the “consortium” or “COCIV”) was assigned the project for the definitive and executive design and construction of the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section/Giovi third railway crossing with an agreement signed with TAV S.p.A. on 16 March 1992 (the “agreement”) and subsequent rider signed with Ferroviaria Italiana S.p.A. (“RFI”), which replaced TAV S.p.A. after it merged into RFI, on 11 November 2011 (the “rider”). COCIV’s membership structure varied over time due to a number of events that led to the following structure on 19 December 2019: 421 Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 64% Società Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. (“Condotte”) 31% Civ S.p.A. (“Civ”), in which Salini Impregilo has a 85% investment 5% In 2018 and 2019, Condotte faced a serious financial crisis and applied for extraordinary administration pursuant to Decree law no. 347 of 2003, converted with amendments by Law no. 39/2004. The application was allowed by the Ministerial decree nof 6 August 2018 and the Rome Court resolution of 14 August 2018 declaring Condotte insolvent. Accordingly, Condotte is now operating under the extraordinary administration procedure. During the validity of the extraordinary administration, Condotte failed to fulfil its consortium obligations provided for by COCIV’s by-laws (the “by-laws”), as well as the consortium members’ agreements supplementing the provisions of the by-laws (the “consortium members’ agreements”). Specifically, Condotte failed to provide COCIV with the counter-guarantees necessary to allow COCIV to obtain the guarantees to be provided to RFI when the contracts for the construction lots into which the work was divided by RFI (and before that by the CIPE) were signed due to the need to have the financial resources necessary for the work construction. The breach occurred in connection with the fifth and sixth construction lots’ contract execution, following RFI’s notifications of 17 December 2018 and 27 June 2019, respectively. In both cases, the consortium was only able to remedy Condotte’s breaches thanks to the other two members (Salini Impregilo and Civ), which provided the necessary counter-guarantees that Condotte had not given, thereby enabling COCIV to obtain the guarantees from the banks to be provided to RFI. After having formally challenged Condotte’s failure to comply with its counter-guarantee obligations for the fifth construction lot, in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements, on 18 April 2019, COCIV passed a resolution of the board of representatives the competent body under the by-laws (the “first resolution”), whereby: (i) it ordered the reduction in Condotte under extraordinary administration’s interest to the minimum interest allowed (0.001%); (ii) it allocated the portion so decreased to the other consortium members (specifically to Salini Impregilo, as CIV refused); (iii) it adopted the necessary amendments to the by-laws following the changes in the consortium’s membership structure; (iv) it adopted other necessary measures for the ordered reduction in Condotte’s interest. In order to enforce the reallocation among the other consortium members of the defaulting member’s decreased interest and the consequent amendment to its by-laws vis-a-vis RFI, the by-laws required the latter’s consent. Therefore, anticipating that the customer would have given its consent in a timely manner, in connection with the first resolution, COCIV passed a single resolution to reduce and increase interests and amend its by-laws (unifying the internal and external effects of its resolution into a single act). Taking into account RFI’s position in 422 relation to the first resolution during the interlocutory stage, when Condotte’s second, serious and repeated breach occurred, the consortium modified the structure of its resolutions, progressively and separately dealing firstly with its internal effects (to which RFI is unrelated) and secondly with its external effects and the consequent by-laws amendment, subjecting only the latter resolution to RFI’s consent. Condotte challenged the first resolution pursuant to the arbitration clause in article 27 of the by-laws. It also filed a petition under article 700 of the Italian Code of Civil Procedure with the Genoa Court seeking inter alia suspension of the effects of the first resolution. The Genoa Court dismissed the case on 28 June 2019, and the decision was upheld in Condotte’s appeal. The arbitration panel appointed to resolve the dispute on the first resolution commenced by Condotte was formed on 13 January 2020. In the meantime, acknowledging the dispute about the first resolution commenced by Condotte, RFI informed the consortium that it would give its consent to the amendments to the by-laws concerning the modified membership structure resulting from the first resolution only after settlement of the dispute, given that the fact that the resolution included both issues and not wanting to take a position on the dispute. As mentioned above, however, Condotte reiterated its breach of contract in connection with the sixth construction lot, again failing to provide its counter-guarantees required by the Consortium (since its interest remained at 31% as the first resolution was ineffective during the period in which the condition had to be satisfied). As a result, COCIV’s board of representatives adopted the consequent resolutions on 19 December 2019, after having issued the required notice to comply, which remained unsuccessful. As indicated above, as an amendment to the first resolution, the board of representatives has structured these resolutions differently, in order not to involve RFI directly in the part relating to Condotte’s failure to comply. In particular: • a resolution (the “second resolution” or “reduction resolution”) adopted also with the participation of Condotte (which, however, was precluded from voting under the by-laws), on the basis of the breaches that had occurred, reduced Condotte’s interest to the minimum interest of 0.001%, at the same time excluding Condotte’s representatives from the consortium bodies. This resolution took immediate effect and solely affected the consortium’s internal relationships; • another resolution (the “third resolution” or “reallocation resolution”), passed by the board in its modified composition as per the second resolution: ordered the proportionate allocation of the interest previously held by Condotte (including the rights attached thereto) to the other two members that replaced Condotte when it failed to comply. This resolution took immediate effect and solely affected the consortium members; approved the amendment to the by-laws relating to the new interest percentages in the consortium, subjecting its effectiveness to RFI’s required consent and, hence, to the reallocation resolution’s production of external effects, which is its enforcement vis-a-vis RFI; this enforcement would trigger the enforceability of the amendment to the by-laws. 423 As a result of the content of the third resolution, on 20 December 2019, COCIV requested RFI’s consent which was necessary to enforce the approved by-laws amendment (without prejudice to the immediate enforceability of the second resolution and of the internal effects of the third resolution). In the meantime, the term (31 December 2019) set for the coming into force of the first resolution passed unsuccessfully and, therefore, not only did such resolution not produce any legal effect up to that term, but it can never produce any future effects (with the related consequences on the first arbitration proceeding commenced by Condotte). Condotte lodged a second request for arbitration against the second resolution again under the by-laws. Acknowledging again there was a dispute commenced by Condotte against the second resolution (solely in relation to the amendment to the by-laws for which its consent was required), on 20 February 2020, RFI informed the COCIV and its members Salini Impregilo, Condotte and Civ that “it was not in a position to decide on the request for consent made by COCIV”. It also added that “pursuant to the applicable contractual provisions, RFI’s consent would [have] be [been] given only after completion of a specific investigation into the subsequent allocation among the other consortium members, including in order to check that the legal and contractual requirements are still met ”. With the support of its legal advisors, Salini Impregilo carried out an analysis of the effects of the resolutions and the arbitration proceedings proposed by Condotte on its consolidated financial statements. Specifically, based on the above analysis, the company believes that: ▪ the reduction resolution is valid as it was passed in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements as a contractually-obliged result of Condotte’s serious breach. The breach is serious, which is further confirmed by Condotte’s large interest in the consortium before the reduction to the minimum interest (over 30%, on the basis of which the proportional obligation to provide counter-guarantees for COCIV is calculated) and by the fact that, under the structure that the consortium has developed over time in order to perform the contract with RFI (the consortium’s sole object), the provision of counter-guarantees is absolutely the members’ prevailing obligation and is essential to enable the consortium to perform the contract with RFI; ▪ the reduction resolution sets out the consequences of the reduction to the minimum interest of Condotte’s interest in the consortium’s business (and the consortium fund) in accordance with the agreements in force and, hence, it was validly passed; ▪ the reduction resolution was also immediately effective because (a) it could be passed and (b) it was declared to be passed as such. It relates to the internal relationships among consortium members and is, therefore, immediately enforceable and productive of the related effects, including financial (also considering that the provisions of the by-laws and the consortium members’ agreements for the automatic proportional allocation of any interests transferred from other consortium members and that the consortium members’ agreements even states that the takeover is as a precise obligation). 424 The possibility of reducing the defaulting member’s interest in the consortium to the minimum interest with immediate effect complies with the by-laws, which do not subject this decision to RFI’s approval, as such approval is only required for the by-laws amendment relating to a change in the consortium’s membership structure and can be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties; ▪ the reallocation resolution was passed in accordance with the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements and, as such, is fully valid. On the other hand, it may not be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties, since the former has a real right of veto on the takeover, which is consistent with its role as customer that is entitled to carry out any checks of the consortium’s (ongoing) satisfaction of the legal and contractual requirements, as RFI has reserved the right to do after the end of the arbitration procedure about the reduction resolution. Therefore, summing up the above, with regard to the effectiveness of the reallocation resolution, the following distinction should be made: • for the purposes of the internal relationships among consortium members, the resolution is immediately enforceable and productive of effects, including financial, as confirmed by the provisions of the by-laws and consortium members’ agreements for an automatic proportional allocation of the interests transferred from other consortium members and, in the case of the consortium members’ agreement, a takeover obligation; • the reallocation resolution, on the other hand, may not be enforced vis-a-vis RFI and third parties, since the former has a real right of veto on the takeover, which is consistent with its role as customer that is entitled to carry out any checks of the consortium’s (ongoing) satisfaction of the legal and contractual requirements, as it has reserved the right to do after the end of the arbitration procedure about the reduction resolution. With regard to the consortium’s ongoing satisfaction of the relevant requirements following the amendment to its by-laws, according to the consortium’s legal advisors, if RFI found that COCIV met all the requirements to carry out the contracted work in compliance with the contract documents, despite its members including an insolvent party (Condotte), it can only confirm such an assessment when evaluating the enforceability of the reallocation of the interest transferred from Condotte, which improves, in every significant way, the requirements that can be met by the consortium (primarily, its ability to fulfil its obligations, including its guarantee obligations). Since RFI has not subordinated its consent to anything else, supported by the opinion of its legal advisors, the parent believes that the above resolutions will be maintained by the arbitration proceedings underway and RFI’s subsequent assessments; ▪ on the basis of the opinions of its legal advisors, the parent believes that there are reasonable grounds that the arbitration award will be favourable for COCIV, allowing RFI to express its conclusions on the few issues mentioned above. 425 Further to the resolutions of 19 December 2019, the consortium’s membership structure in relation to the rights and obligations resulting from the contract with RFI is as follows: Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 97.753% Civ S.p.A. (“Civ”), in which Salini Impregilo has a 85% investment 7.246% Società Italiana per Condotte d’Acqua S.p.A. (“Condotte”) 0.001% The increase in Salini Impregilo’s ideal interests in the contract (held by COCIV) resulting from the reallocation of Condotte’s interest led to a rise in the carrying amount of contract assets relating to the COCIV contract of €99.7 million recognised as revenue from contracts with customers in profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 15. 426 Revenue by operating segment 2018 (€’000) Italy Abroad Total Revenue from contracts with customers 349,050 2,567,389 2,916,439 Other income 14,440 137,420 151,860 Total revenue 363,490 2,704,809 3,068,299 Revenue by operating segment 2019 (€’000) Italy Abroad Total Revenue from contracts with customers 670,794 1,926,701 2,597,495 Other income 18,142 125,353 143,495 Total revenue 688,936 2,052,054 2,740,990 Statement of financial position by operating segment 31 December 2018 (€’000) Italy Abroad Total Net non-current assets 751,239 866,173 1,617,412 Provision for risks (10,944) (37,661) (48,605) Post-employment benefits and employee benefits (6,424) (5,243) (11,667) Net tax assets (liabilities) 279,874 (39,696) 240,178 Working capital 85,067 227,961 313,028 Net invested capital 1,098,812 1,011,534 2,110,346 Equity 845,200 Net financial indebtedness 1,265,146 Total financial resources 2,110,346 Statement of financial position by operating segment 31 December 2019 (€’000) Italy Abroad Total Net non-current assets 871,992 730,924 1,602,916 Provision for risks (57,866) (29,493) (87,359) Post-employment benefits and employee benefits (6,228) (6,039) (12,267) Net tax assets (liabilities) 243,083 (35,384) 207,699 Working capital (149,035) 819,487 670,452 Net invested capital 901,946 1,479,495 2,381,441 Equity 1,492,767 Net financial indebtedness 888,674 Total financial resources 2,381,441 427 Statement of financial position 4.

They comprise contract acquisition costs, the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil the contract. 430 In 2018, the company adopted IFRS 15, which introduced new guidance for the recognition of contract costs with the recognition of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract and the costs to fulfil the contract under assets. These costs are amortised in line with the percentage of completion of the related contracts.

With respect to the Verona Padua section, amortisation of the acquisition cost will commence when work starts. 431 The costs to fulfil the contract mostly comprise COCIV’s pre-operating costs. There are no indicators of impairment for the contracts to which the acquisition costs refer. 7. Equity investments Equity investments decreased by €10.8 million to €1,313.3 million.

The carrying amount of the investment in Grupo Unido por el Canal comprises the injections for the same company made during the current and previous years. “Acquisitions and capital injections” show the acquisition of an investment in Cossi Costruzioni for €4.6 million. “Disinvestments and liquidations” principally relate to the sale of the investment in the Dutch subsidiary Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. to Lane Group for €133.1 million. The item “Reclassifications” principally refers to the offsetting of the provision relating to certain investees classified under liabilities. “Net impairment losses” mainly include the impairment losses on the investments in the subsidiary Fibe (€8.2 million), the SPE Grupo Unidos por el Canal (€9.7 million), CMT Copenhagen Metro (€5.3 million) and Impregilo Arabia Ltd (€4.8 million). 432 The impairment test of the item “Equity investments”, carried out also to assess the need for any reversals of previously recognised impairment losses, has been performed on an individual basis, considering each investee’s specific operating objectives. Based on such approach, the item can be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Investments in SPEs 481,699 615,973 134,274 Other investments 842,431 697,366 (145,065) Total 1,324,130 1,313,339 (10,791) Special purpose entities (SPEs) are legal entities set up specifically and solely to carry out construction contracts that Salini Impregilo is not expected to carry out directly and in which it has an interest equal to its share of the tender. These entities have a corporate structure compliant with the customers’ requirements as communicated during the tender procedure and considering the specific legal context of the country in which the contract will be performed. They are classified depending on whether they are: (i) SPEs, the profit or loss of which are allocated to their venturers in line with their interests as provided for by law (i.e., Italian-based consortia and consortium companies which operate on a “recharges of costs” basis), and (ii) other SPEs for which this allocation is not provided for by law. Due to the periodic allocation of the contract profit or loss to the venturers, the SPEs in item (i) always substantially reach breakeven point. Any losses recorded in the contracts performed by these entities are recognised by the venturers upon allocation of the contract profits and losses. For the SPEs in item (ii), the existence of any losses should be considered in the separate financial statements of Salini Impregilo as their contract profit or loss is included in the consolidated financial statements only. The contracts performed by these SPEs are therefore considered when testing the company’s investment for impairment. Specifically, the SPEs’ financial statements, which include the estimated contract profit or loss and are prepared in accordance with the IFRS as interpreted by the company’s accounting policies, are considered as they show the entity’s estimated cash flows. The company adjusted the impairment losses in 2019 through the provision for risks on equity investments related to the SPEs CMT Copenaghen Metro (€5.3 million), Grupo ICT II (€0.9 million) and Salini Australia Pty (€2.3 million). Following the amendments to IAS 28 (applicable from 1 January 2019), the loan given to the SPE Grupo Unidos por el Canal S.A. (Panama) was tested for impairment as it was disbursed to financially support the SPE and, therefore, increases the equity investment’s carrying amount. The impairment test was performed by discounting the expected cash flows using the assumed settlement of the claims and other assets recognised by the SPE as the drivers. Specifically, the cash flows comprised the operating expenses (mainly legal fees) and collections expected in line with the estimated payment timeline of the claims. The discount rate (4.2% 4.5%) was defined considering: 433 • the estimated payment timeline; • a country risk component. The company recognised an impairment loss of €9.7 million as a result of the test. In 2019, the company recognised an additional impairment loss on the investment in HCE Costruzioni S.p.A. (€13.0 million, including its loss for the year). Fisia Italimpianti recorded a loss of €11.3 million for 2019 and deficit of €1.6 million, compared to the investment’s carrying amount of €46.2 million. Its order backlog approximated €178 million at the reporting date and principally relates to contracts for water treatment plants in Argentina and Turkey. Supported by independent experts who carried out an independent business review, the company tested its investment in Fisia Italimpianti for impairment on the basis of the 2020-2024 business plan approved by the subsidiary’s board of directors on 5 March 2020. No indicators of impairment were found. Salini Impregilo used the unlevered version of the discounted cash flow method to calculate the investment’s equity value. The main valuation parameters used were: • long-term growth rate: 0% (0% in 2018); • discount rate (WACC): 12.9% including 400 basis points as additional risk premium (2018: 11.8%, including 200 basis points as additional risk premium). The company also performed sensitivity analyses considering the possible effect of changes in the discount rate (+/-0.5%). They did not identify any elements that would have required recognition of an impairment loss. The directors adopted the following hypothetical assumptions in the 2020-2024 business plan, used to extrapolate the expected future cash flows for impairment testing purposes: assumption about development of demand for projects: the subsidiary mainly operates in two business segments, the desalination and water treatment plant segments. A programme for the construction of new plants and partial replacement of the existing plants is underway worldwide, which makes the overall market outlook and, therefore, the company’s development very promising. Large investment programmes have already been approved confirming this trend, especially in the main market, the Middle East, and Saudi Arabia in particular; thanks to its global sales network, Salini Impregilo helped Fisia to identify its targets, especially in South America, where it historically carries out its operations. Moreover, it may also support Fisia financially, providing suitable guarantees where necessary. 434 It cannot be excluded that events may take place in the future that cannot currently be foreseen and that would require changes to the valuations made. The subsidiary Fibe recorded a loss of €8.2 million for 2019, while its equity was €27.6 million at the reporting date. Given that the subsidiary is inactive and only manages the outstanding disputes related to the USW Campania projects, its assets and liabilities are the main drivers of the value generation process. Accordingly, its carrying amount was aligned with its equity at the reporting date, recognising an impairment loss of €8.2 million. The subsidiary Salini Impregilo US Holding INC made a loss of €2.1 million in 2019, with equity of approximately €251.2 million at the reporting date, while the investment’s carrying amount is €468.4 million. Its equity value has been calculated using the cash flow projections set out in the 2020-2024 five-year plan prepared and approved by the subsidiary’s management. The main valuation parameters used were: • long-term growth rate: 1.74%; • post-tax discount rate: 7.4% The company has adopted the discount rate calculated based on the market cost of money and the asset sector’s specific risk (Weighted Average Cost of Capital, WACC). Specifically, the company considered the return rate on long-term government bonds and the average capital structure of a basket of comparable companies. The terminal value is based on a sustainable profit assumption, from which stable long-term operating cash flows have been estimated, on a going concern basis. The company tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting date, supported by independent experts who carried out an independent business review, which showed that the investment’s recoverable amount exceeds its carrying amount. The company also performed sensitivity analyses of the recoverable amount, considering the potential effect of changes in the reference parameters of the discount rate (+4.1%) and terminal value (reduction of 49%). The company tested its investment in Yuma for impairment in 2019 using the Colombian operator’s 2020-2031 business plan assisted by an external expert. Its cash flows were discounted using a cost of equity rate of 9.6% to calculate the investment’s recoverable amount. The resulting recoverable amount was higher than the equity investment’s carrying amount and, therefore, it was not necessary to recognise an impairment loss. As regards the other investments in smaller companies, their carrying amount has been adjusted to Salini Impregilo’s share of the investees’ net assets as recognised in their financial statements at 31 December 2019 when impairment losses have been identified. These impairment losses, totalling €9.4 million, specifically affected Impregilo Arabia Ltd (€5.0 million) and Salini Polska SP Zoo Ltd (€2.9 million), the latter recognised in the provision for risks on equity investments. 435 In certain cases, the financial statements utilised to measure some of the investments using the equity method include requests for additional consideration as its payment is highly probable, based also on the technical and legal opinions of the company’s advisors. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report. 8. Non-current financial assets This item and related changes may be broken down as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Loans and receivables group companies 93,163 105,691 12,528 Loans and receivables third parties 13,567 13,538 (29) Other financial assets 9,664 9,751 87 Total 116,394 128,980 12,586 The other financial assets amount to €9.8 million at the reporting date and are substantially in line with the previous year end. They are made up of unlisted guaranteed-return securities which mature after one year. They comprise units in the fund financing Yuma (Colombia). More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report. Loans and receivables group companies increased by €12.5 million and mainly comprise: • €23.0 million, up €3.6 million on 31 December 2018, related to a loan granted to the SPE M4 S.p.A. which is building Line 4 of the Milan Metro; • €24.0 million due to the Venezuelan branch from OIV Tocoma (€120.2 million gross at 31 December 2019, net of a loss allowance of €96.2 million) decreased by €5.4 million during the year (€117.7 million gross at 31 December 2018 net of an allowance of €88.3 million) due to the impairment test performed at the reporting date to reflect the events described in the “Venezuela” paragraph of the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report and note 12 “Trade receivables, paragraph “Impairment Venezuela”; • €58.6 million due from Yuma Concessionaria. More information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report. At 31 December 2019, loans and receivables third parties of €13.5 million are in line with the previous year end and include €13.5 million due from the Romanian Ministry for Infrastructure and Transportation related to the surety enforced in 2017 as a result of the disputes with the customer about the Orastie-Sibiu motorway contract. The company is confident that it will recover this amount, based also on the opinion of its legal advisors assisting it with the disputes. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report provides more information. 436 9. Deferred tax assets and liabilities Deferred tax assets and liabilities amount to €215.1 million and €18.9 million at 31 December 2019, respectively.

Deferred tax liabilities of €18.9 million include €18.7 million for the provision for the national tax consolidation scheme. The provision represents the company’s liability with its subsidiaries that have transferred their losses as part of the IRES national tax consolidation scheme as per article 117 and subsequent articles of the Consolidated Income Tax Act as per the regulations signed when they joined the scheme. “Other” mostly comprises the deferred taxes that arose upon application of the new standards. 438 10.

They were impaired by €11.5 million at 31 December 2019 (€48.4 million), mainly in relation to the contract assets with the Venezuelan customers (see the Main risk factors and uncertainties section of the Directors' report). Revenue recognised in 2019 on performance obligations satisfied (or partly satisfied) mostly relates to changes in estimates of the percentage of completion and the variable consideration. Contract liabilities mostly comprise contract advances from customers for projects for which the revenue is recognised over time. Contract assets Contract assets amount to €1,230.1 million at year end, up on the previous year-end figure of €717.2 million. The following table shows contract assets calculated using the stage of completion method, net of losses realised or estimated at the reporting date and progress billings and advances: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Contract work in progress 14,126,631 16,450,649 2,324,018 Progress payments (on approved work) (12,802,122) (14,661,646) (1,859,524) Advances (607,353) (558,892) 48,461 Total contract assets 717,156 1,230,111 512,955 The item shows an increase of €513.0 million over 31 December 2018.

Trade receivables Trade receivables amount to €1,505.7 million (€1,420.4 million), of which €1,117.9 million (€715.3 million) from group companies and other related parties. This item may be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Third parties 705,086 387,773 (317,314) Group companies and other related parties 715,301 1,117,884 402,583 Total 1,420,387 1,505,657 85,270 Trade receivables from third parties may be broken down as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Third parties 965,003 662,856 (302,148) Loss allowance (259,917) (275,083) (15,166) Total 705,086 387,773 (317,314) Trade receivables from third parties of €387.8 million, net of the loss allowance (€275.1 million), show a net decrease of €317.3 million, almost entirely due to the reduction in amounts due from the Ethiopian customer following collections received during the year. The balance includes amounts mainly due from Italian, Ethiopian, Venezuelan and Slovakian customers for invoices issued and for work performed and approved by customers but still to be invoiced. The following notes and the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report provide more information. 442 Impairment Venezuela Assisted by its independent experts, the company estimated the impairment losses on its Venezuelan financial assets in line with the approach taken in the 2018 financial statements. The impairment model selected is the discounted cash flow (DCF) model in line with the amortised cost approach of IFRS 9. Estimating amortised cost usually requires the preparation of a possible repayment plan that is economically and financially feasible for the debtor. Given the uncertainty about the expected collection rates and the time involved (i.e., the length of the litigation), the company prepared 16 scenarios using various combinations of inputs. It then defined the following parameters: • the nominal amount reduction; • the total repayment delay; • the repayment structure (equal or increasing instalments). The interval (50% 73% compared to 37% 51% in 2018) for the nominal amount reduction was defined using the default episode sample obtained from last year’s impairment test (2018). This was decided to properly factor in the following considerations: • the stagnant political, social and economic scenario for the third consecutive year; • the negative signals about the current and possible future oil prices and the significant fall in the prices of the Venezuelan government bonds in the second half of 2019. The sample included the “extreme” default episodes of 2018 (i.e., Panama ‘96 and Bolivia ‘88). With respect to the recoverable amount of the company’s exposure to the Venezuelan government agencies, at 31 December 2019, its gross exposure amounts to €643.4 million, of which loan assets of €120.2 million and consideration accrued on work performed of approximately €523.2 million (the latter amount comprises €318.7 million already invoiced and recognised under trade receivables and €204.5 million recognised under contract assets net of contract liabilities). As a result of the assessments made on the basis of that set out above, the company’s net exposure to the Venezuelan government agencies amounts to €128.7 million, of which loan assets of €24.0 million and consideration accrued on work performed of approximately €104.7 million (the latter amount comprises €63.8 million already invoiced and recognised under trade receivables and €40.9 million recognised under contract assets net of contract liabilities). Given the high level of uncertainty implicit in this type of valuation, the company engaged a second independent expert to assess the reasonableness of the results obtained from the use of the above model and its reasonableness was confirmed. 443 Changes during 2018 are shown in the following table: 31 December Impairment Utilisations Reversals Change in Reclass./Other Net 31 December 2017 losses consolidation changes exchange 2018 scope gains (€’000) (losses) Trade receivables 171,328 79,674 (286) (1,925) 5,623 (922) 253,492 Default interest 5,331 1,071 (35) 58 6,425 Total 176,659 80,745 (321) (1,925) 5,623 (864) 259,917 Changes in the loss allowance are shown in the following table: 31 December Impairment Utilisations Reversals Mergers Reclass./ Net 31 December 2018 losses Other exchange 2019 (€’000) changes gains Trade receivables 253,492 16,636 (1,219) 184 23 269,116 Default interest 6,425 (319) (148) 9 5,967 Total 259,917 16,636 (1,538) 36 32 275,083 Trade receivables group companies and other related parties amount to €1,117.9 million at the reporting date compared to €715.3 million at 31 December 2018.

The item includes: • €29.4 million due from the Argentine Republic as compensation for damage following the favourable award issued on 21 June 2011 and confirmed by the Buenos Aires Arbitration Tribunal on 24 January 2014. This award settled the proceedings commenced by the shareholders of the investee Aguas del Buenos Aires S.A. in liquidation (operator) against the Argentine Republic. Given that the significant economic crisis has not abated, management tested its exposure for impairment in accordance with IFRS 9 assisted by independent experts. As the recoverable amount is substantially in line with the exposure’s carrying amount, additional impairment losses were not recognised. Based on the information available at the date of preparation of these separate financial statements, management expects to collect the receivable within 12 months This classification is the best estimate and considers 446 the status of the negotiations with the Argentine government (more information is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section in the Directors’ report); • €30.3 million due from some of the company’s partners of joint ventures around the world, mainly for the works for the housing project in South Al Mutlaa (Kuwait). Advances to suppliers decreased by €3.7 million to €51.8 million. The most significant amounts relate to the works at Riyadh in Saudi Arabia (€17.4 million), the contracts for the construction of hydroelectrical plants in Ethiopia and Tajikistan (€4.2 million and €6.4 million, respectively), projects in the United Arab Emirates (€5.7 million) and works for the Paris Metro (€3.5 million). The item “Group companies and other related parties” increased by €8.9 million to €85.3 million at the reporting date and mainly refer to the environmental restoration in the Buenos Aires area, the construction of Line 3 of the Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia and the high speed Naples Bari railway line section. Prepayments and accrued income of €48.9 million show an increase of €6.5 million on the previous year end, mainly as a result of the cost of the loans given to Beyond, set up for Progetto Italia, and the debt restructuring.

Share capital On 12 November 2019, the company completed its issue of 400,000,000 new ordinary shares for € 600,000,000.00 (including the premium). At 31 December 2019, the company’s new fully paid-up share capital amounts to €600,000,000. It comprises 893,788,182 shares, including 892,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares, all without a nominal amount. The company has solely issued ordinary shares for the capital increase and did not issue savings shares as the assumptions for their issue pursuant to article 36 of the by-laws approved by the shareholders in their extraordinary meeting of 4 October 2019 were not met. The capital increase of €600 million has been allocated to share capital (€55,260 thousand), the share premium reserve (€533,688 thousand) and the legal reserve (€11,052 thousand). The related charges of €7,018 thousand increased the related reserve In accordance with article 2444 of the Italian Civil Code, certification of the execution of the capital increase was filed with the Milan Company Registrar on 14 November 2019. Savings shares issued pursuant to the law do not carry voting rights, have preference dividend and capital repayment rights and can be bearer shares, subject to the provisions of article 2354.2 of the Italian Civil Code. Upon the shareholder’s requests and at their own expense, they can be converted into registered shares and vice versa. Savings shares held by directors, statutory auditors and CEOs are registered. Except when the company’s by-laws or relevant legislation provide for otherwise, savings shares give the holders the same rights as those of ordinary shares. Holders of savings shares do not have the right to attend the company’s shareholders’ meetings or to request that they are called. The special savings shareholders’ meeting is regulated by law. When reserves are distributed, the savings shares have the same rights as ordinary shares. Upon dissolution of the company, savings shares bear preference rights to capital repayment, up to €5.2 per share. When shares are grouped or split (as well as when capital transactions are carried out and as necessary 449 in order to protect the savings shareholders’ rights in the case the shares have a nominal amount, the above fixed amount is adjusted accordingly. Profit for the year as per the separate financial statements is allocated as follows: a) 5% to the legal reserve, up to the legally-required amount; b) to savings shares, to the extent of 5% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.26 per share). If a dividend lower than 5% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.26 per share) is paid one year, the difference is taken as an increase in the preferred dividend of the following two years; c) the residual amount, to all shareholders in such a way as to allocate to savings shares a total dividend which is 2% of €5.2 per share (i.e., €0.104 per share) greater than that distributed to ordinary shares, except when the shareholders decide to allocate an amount to the extraordinary reserves or for other uses.

The decrease in corporate loans during the year is mostly due to repayment of the loan from Banca Popolare di Bergamo (€40.3 million at 31 December 2018) partly offset by the increase in the use of revolving credit facilities provided by banks. The contractual terms of loan agreements with the major banks were modified as part of Progetto Italia with repayment of the last instalments in 2025.

On 17 January 2020, the company placed new notes on the market for €250,000,000, part of which were to be used to exchange the outstanding “€600,000,000 3.75 per cent. Notes due 24 June 2021” (the “2021 notes”) for €120,970,000 while another part (the “additional new notes”) were offered to new investors for €123,341,000. The new notes’ maturity date is 28 January 2027 and the coupon is 3.625%. The transaction is part of the company’s plan to optimise its debt profile, extending its average debt repayment dates and maintaining a low corporate debt cost. 456 20. Lease liabilities Lease liabilities may be broken down as follows at 31 December 2019: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Non-current portion 16,596 39,147 22,551 Current portion 17,113 18,547 1,434 Total 33,709 57,694 23,985 This item, previously called “Finance lease liabilities” amounted to €33.7 million at 31 December 2018. It was renamed “Lease liabilities” with the introduction of IFRS 16 (more information is available in note 2 “Changes in standards”). This item includes the principal of minimum lease payments at the reporting date. Liabilities for these leases are guaranteed to the lessor via rights to the leased assets. The present value of the minimum lease payments is €57.7 million (31 December 2018: €33.7 million) as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Minimum lease payments: Due within one year 17,402 19,689 Due between one and five years 17,215 38,328 Due after five years 6,675 Total 34,617 64,692 Future interest expense (908) (6,998) Net present value 33,709 57,694 The net present value is as follows: Due within one year 17,113 18,547 Due between one and five years 16,596 33,918 Due after five years 5,229 Total 33,709 57,694 21. Derivatives and other current financial liabilities At the reporting date, the balance of the item “Derivatives” was €2.0 million and includes the negative fair value of the currency hedges that do not meet the IFRS hedge accounting requirements for cash flow hedges. 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 (€’000) Forward currency purchases and sales FVTPL 2,012 Total derivatives presented in net financial 2,012 indebtedness 457 Forward currency purchases and sales FVTPL Agreement Expiry date Currency Notional amount Fair value (€/000) date Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 26/11/2019 27/01/2020 USD 18,008,251 (232) Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 19/12/2019 30/06/2020 USD 66,567,555 (558) Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 29/11/2019 31/01/2020 USD 5,289,092 (92) Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 29/11/2019 31/01/2020 USD 31,643,281 (542) Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 29/11/2019 31/01/2020 USD 29,139,731 (506) Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 17/12/2019 21/01/2020 USD 13,949,121 (81) Salini Impregilo S.p.A. 30/09/2019 31/03/2020 CHF 3,228,336 (1) Total (2,012) Forward currency purchases and sales include currency hedges that do not meet the IFRS hedge accounting requirements for cash flow hedges. 22. Post-employment benefits and employee benefits At 31 December 2019, the company’s liability due to all its employees determined using the criteria set out in IAS 19 is €12.3 million. The balance mainly consists of the Italian post-employment benefits (TFR). At 31 December 2019 and 2018, the liability for post-employment benefits is the outstanding amount at the reform effective date, net of benefits paid up to the reporting dates. The liability is considered part of a defined benefit plan under IAS 19 and has, therefore, been subjected to actuarial valuation. The valuation, performed with the assistance of an independent expert, was based on the following rates: • turnover rate: 7.25%; • advance payment rate: 3%; • inflation rate: 1.2%. The company has used the Eurocomposite AA index, which has an average financial duration in line with the fund being valued, to calculate the discount rate. Changes in the item are as follows: 458 31 December Accruals Payments Contributions Net Other changes 31 December 2017 paid to INPS actuarial and change in 2018 treasury and gains consolidation (€’000) other funds scope Post-employment benefits 11,432 9,136 (3,748) (5,561) (115) 523 11,667 and employee benefits 31 December Accruals Payments Contributions Net Other changes 31 December 2018 paid to INPS actuarial and change in 2019 treasury and gains consolidation (€’000) other funds scope Post-employment benefits 11,667 8,609 (6,963) (904) (60) (82) 12,267 and employee benefits The net increase in post-employment benefits in 2019 is due to both payments made during the year and contributions transferred to the INPS treasury and other funds, as well as the accrual for the year and the actuarial gains and losses recognised in the specific equity reserve, as required by IAS 19. Other changes are mainly due to exchange differences. An increase or decrease of 0.25% in the discount rate used to calculate the liability at 31 December 2019 would have had a negative or positive effect of around €27 thousand or approximately €24 thousand, respectively. A similar increase or decrease at 31 December 2018 would have had a negative or positive effect of approximately €36 thousand or €37 thousand, respectively. 23. Provisions for risks At 31 December 2019, these provisions amount to €87.4 million as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Provisions for risks on equity investments 36,204 29,500 (6,704) Other provisions 12,401 57,859 45,458 Total 48,605 87,359 38,754 459 The main changes in the provision for risks on equity investments are detailed below: (€’000) 31 December 2019 Capital transactions 16,756 Impairment losses (21,750) Reclassifications 11,699 Total 6,704 Specifically and as disclosed in note 7 (to which reference should be made), the provision for risks on equity investments includes the impairment losses on investments in certain SPEs for the part that exceeds their carrying amounts. Changes are due to: capital transactions of €16.7 million mainly relating to Salini Polska L.t.d. Liability Co, Salini Australia Pty Ltd and Salini Impregilo Salini Insaat Jv; impairment losses of €21.7 million chiefly attributable to HCE Costruzioni (€13 million), Salini Polska L.t.d. Liability Co (€2.9 million), Salini Australia PTY L.t.d. (€2.3 million), Construtora Impregilo y Associados S.A.-CIGLA S.A (€1.1 million) and INC Il Nuovo Castoro Algerie S.a.r.l (€1.0 million); reclassifications of €11.7 million relating to HCE, since, in 2019, the company recognised an additional impairment loss on its investment in HCE Costruzioni S.p.A. (€13.0 million, including its loss for the year). Other provisions comprise: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Ongoing litigation 9,852 9,698 154 Building segment litigation 190 190 Tax and social security litigation 143 90 53 Provision for risks relating to COCIV 45,750 (45,750) Other 2,216 2,321 (105) Total 12,401 57,859 (45,458) Changes during 2018 are shown in the following table: 31 December Accruals Utilisations Change in Other changes 31 December 2017 consolidation 2018 (€’000) scope Total 13,122 2,431 (3,039) (113) 12,401 Changes of the year are as follows: 31 December Accruals Utilisations Change in Other changes 31 December (€’000) 2018 consolidation 2019 scope Total 12,401 45,838 (191) (189) 57,859 460 The increase in the provision is mainly due to the accrual made as a result of the company’s assessment of the recoverable amount of Salini Impregilo’s receivables due, through its involvement in COCIV, from Condotte. Given that this consortium member is currently under extraordinary administration, the directors deemed it appropriate to make an accrual of €45.8 million. Title to the amounts due from the consortium members lies with the consortium. As it is a transparent vehicle, in the case of non-collection of the receivable, the liability is recognised in the company’s financial statements using the cost recharging mechanism. Therefore, the company makes an accrual in its provisions for risks. More information about the main disputes is available in the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report. 24. Trade payables Trade payables amount to €1,792.1 million (31 December 2018: €1,514.7 million) and include payables of €1,128.5 million to group companies and other related parties. The increase of €277.5 million in this item is analysed in the following table: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Third parties 805,954 663,637 (142,317) Group companies and other related parties 708,726 1,128,508 419,782 Total 1,514,680 1,792,145 277,465 The decrease of €142.3 million in trade payables is principally related to the works in Ethiopia. Trade payables to group companies and other related parties increased by €419.8 million to €1,128.5 million. The most significant changes relate to COCIV (€252.2 million), the construction of the Genoa Bridge (€63.9 million), the Naples Cancello section of the Naples Bari railway line (€49.3 million) and works of Salini Polska L.t.d. in Poland (€48.8 million). A complete list of intragroup transactions is included in the annexes. 25.

They may be analysed as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Withholdings 69 89 20 VAT 9,935 8,217 (1,718) Other indirect taxes 5,893 6,460 567 Total 15,897 14,766 (1,131) 26. Other current liabilities Other current liabilities of €126.7 million (31 December 2018: €137.6 million) decreased by €10.9 million. The composition of this item and changes during the year are shown below: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Employees 39,793 35,825 (3,968) Social security institutions 6,758 7,040 282 Group companies and other related parties 55,202 53,453 (1,749) Other liabilities 27,085 25,769 (1,316) Accrued expenses and deferred income 8,771 4,640 (4,131) Total 137,609 126,727 (10,882) These liabilities include: • amounts due to employees of €35.8 million, relating to accrued unpaid remuneration; • Group companies and other related party liabilities of €53.5 million, down by €1.8 million on the previous year end. The balance at the reporting date mostly includes amounts due to the investee Galfar Salini Impregilo Cimolai JV (€19.7 million), involved in the Al Bayt Stadium project in Qatar, the joint ventures in Argentina (€10.8 million) and the investee IS JV in Australia (€14.0 million); • “Other liabilities” of €25.8 million (€27.1 million), down by €1.3 million. The year-end balance mainly relates to foreign projects in Venezuela, France and Saudi Arabia; • accrued expenses and deferred income of €4.6 million, as follows: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Variation Accrued expenses: Other 5,829 4,060 (1,769) Total accrued expenses 5,829 4,060 (1,769) Deferred income: Provision of services 2,942 580 (2,362) Total deferred income 2,942 580 (2,362) Total 8,771 4,640 (4,131) 462 Accrued expenses and deferred income mostly consist of portions of costs not yet paid for contract work in progress. The €4.1 million decrease is principally attributable to works in Ethiopia and Namibia. 27. Guarantees, commitments, risks and contingent liabilities Guarantees and commitments The key guarantees given by the company are set out below: • contractual sureties: these total €6,503.0 million and are given to customers as performance bonds, to guarantee advances, withholdings and involvement in tenders for all ongoing contracts. In turn, the company has guarantees given by its subcontractors; • sureties for bank loans: they amount to €693.2 million and relate to subsidiaries (€458.4 million), associates (€140.4 million) and other group companies (€21.5 million). The residual amount of €72.9 million relates to the company; • sureties granted for export credit: €154.4 million; • other personal guarantees of €59.0 million consisting of guarantees related to customs and tax obligations and other commitments (€5,752.5 million); • collateral related to a lien on the remaining shares of the SPE M4 (€5.7 million). Litigation and contingent liabilities The company is involved in civil and administrative proceedings that are not expected to have a significant negative effect on its separate financial statements, based on the information currently available and the existing provisions for risks. The “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report provides information about the main disputes. Tax disputes With respect to the principal dispute with the tax authorities: • the dispute about the assessment notice challenging the tax treatment of impairment losses and losses on the sale of assets recognised by the company in 2003 has been settled. The main issue related to the sale by Impregilo S.p.A. (now Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) of its investment in the Chilean operator Costanera Norte SA to Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. had been cancelled by the Milan Regional Tax Commission on 11 September 2009 (higher assessed tax base of €70 million). After the hearing held on 24 April 2018 and the filing of a motion for the suspension of the trial on 14 November 2018, the Supreme Court ordered the case be placed on the court calendar again. The company applied the procedure for the out-of-court settlement of tax disputes introduced by article 6 of Decree law no. 119 of 23 October 2018, converted into Law no. 136 of 17 December 2018. On 28 May 2019, it presented its application for the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes (payment of €1.2 million) and opted for payment by instalment; 463 • the company’s appeal about reimbursement of tax assets with a nominal amount of €12.3 million acquired from third parties as part of previous non-recurring transactions is still pending before the Supreme Court. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; • a dispute related to 2005 about the technique used to “realign” the carrying amount of equity investments as per article 128 of Presidential decree no. 917/86 (greater assessed tax base of €4.2 million) is still pending before the first level court while with respect to another dispute with the same subject but for 2004 (greater assessed tax base of €380,000), the Supreme Court accepted the company’s grounds and ordered the case be sent to the Lombardy Regional Tax Commission which fully accepted the company’s appeal in the hearing of 14 January 2019 with its ruling of 12 February 2019. The tax authorities appealed this ruling on 11 September 2019 and the appeal still has to be allocated to the relevant section of the court; • with respect to another dispute again related to 2005 and the costs of a joint venture set up in Venezuela for which the greater assessed tax base is €6.6 million, the Regional Tax Commission filed its ruling entirely in the company’s favour on 19 May 2015; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 28 December 2015 challenging the procedure while stating that the findings do not relate to the appeal. The company has filed its defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; • the company was notified of: (i) a payment order from the tax authorities for Icelandic taxes of €4.6 million, which was cancelled after the first and second level sentences in its favour; the tax authorities appealed to the Supreme Court on 11 May 2017 and the company presented its defence brief, and (ii) a payment bill for the same taxes which the parent appealed. It won again both at first and second level. On 18 January 2016, the tax authorities presented their appeal to the Supreme Court and the company filed its defence brief. The hearing was held on 17 January 2020 and the ruling has not yet been filed; • on 12 December 2017, the company and its subsidiary Imprepar received an adjustment notice from the tax authorities requesting payment of registration tax of approximately €1.3 million in addition to a fine of the same amount on the sale of a business unit to Imprepar (which also received an identical adjustment notice). This business unit had no future profits and held investments in consortium companies in liquidation or inactive and the related assets and liabilities related to contracts that have been completed or are nearing completion due to Imprepar’s know how in managing this type of business. The company deems that the tax authorities’ allegations are ungrounded and has promptly appealed against the notices to the competent tax commission. The dispute was settled with a court-ordered settlement procedure as per article 48 of Legislative decree no. 546/1992 as proposed by the tax authorities. This included a reduction in the registration tax and the fine from €1.3 million to €204 thousand and from €1.3 million to €82 thousand, respectively; • in August 2019, the Ethiopian branch’s tax audit of 2014, 2015 and 2016 was completed. During the preliminary stage of the assessment procedure, the branch met the tax authorities and agreed to settle all the assessed taxes for the three years by paying an amount in local currency equal to roughly €32.5 million (taxes, fines and interest) in order that the tax authorities cancelled the administrative sanctions; 464 • on 23 December 2019, the parent received an assessment notice for an assessed IRES tax for 2014 of €1.2 million (plus fines and interest). The notice refers to: (i) for a minimum part, the alleged incorrect application of transfer pricing rules to sureties provided free of charge on behalf of foreign subsidiaries, on which it should allegedly have charged commissions of €741 thousand; (ii) the alleged undue deduction of the “ACE relief” (Aid for Economic Growth) of €3,450 thousand contrary to the provisions of article 10 of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance’s decree of 14 March 2012. At the date of preparation of this report, the deadline for presentation of an appeal has not expired. With respect to the above pending disputes, after consulting its legal advisors, the company believes that it has acted correctly and deems that the risk of an adverse ruling is not probable. When it deemed it appropriate to settle the dispute, as explained earlier in more detail, it did so to avail of the various options provided for by the relevant legislation, such as the voluntary settlement procedure for the pending tax disputes or the positions assigned to the tax collection agency, the court-ordered settlement procedure and the mutually-agreed settlement procedure. 28. Financial instruments and risk management Reference should be made to the “Main risk factors and uncertainties” section of the Directors’ report for information on the main risk factors and uncertainties identified by management. Classes of financial instruments The company’s financial instruments are broken down by class in the following table, which also shows their fair value: 465 31 December 2018 (€’000) Note Financial Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value assets at assets at derivatives assets at fair amortised cost fair value value through through profit or loss profit or loss Financial assets Non-current financial assets 8 116,394 116,394 116,394 Trade receivables 12 1,420,387 1,420,387 1,420,387 Other current financial assets 13 710,341 710,341 710,341 Derivatives 13 602 602 602 Cash and cash equivalents 16 547,730 547,730 547,730 Total 2,795,454 2,795,454 2,795,454 31 December 2018 (€’000) NoteOther liabilities Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value at amortised liabilities at derivatives liabilities at fair cost fair value value through through profit or loss profit or loss Financial liabilities Bank and other loans and 18 1,483,955 1,483,955 1,487,084 borrowings Bonds 19 1,101,453 1,101,453 839,000 Lease liabilities 20 33,709 33,709 33,709 Derivatives 21 Trade payables 24 1,514,680 1,514,680 1,514,680 Total 4,133,797 4,133,797 3,874,473 466 31 December 2019 (€’000) Note Financial assets Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value at amortised assets at fair derivatives assets at fair cost value through value profit or loss through profit or loss Financial assets Non-current financial assets 8 128,980 128,980 128,980 Trade receivables 12 1,505,656 1,505,656 1,505,656 Other current financial assets 13 916,439 268 916,707 916,707 Derivatives 13 Cash and cash equivalents 16 388,615 388,615 388,615 Total 2,939,690 268 2,939,958 2,939,958 31 December 2019 (€’000) Note Other liabilities Financial Hedging Financial Total Fair value at amortised liabilities at derivatives liabilities at cost fair value fair value through profit through profit or loss or loss Financial liabilities Bank and other loans and 18 1,136,490 1,136,490 1,137,881 borrowings Bonds 19 1,105,185 1,105,185 1,081,060 Lease liabilities 20 57,694 57,694 57,694 Derivatives 21 2,012 2,012 2,012 Trade payables 24 1,792,145 1,792,145 1,896,069 Total 4,091,514 2,012 4,093,526 4,174,716 The note column gives the section in which the relevant item is described. Reference should be made to the section on accounting policies for information on the fair value measurement of these items. Specifically, the fair value of the items is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. 467 Risk management Salini Impregilo is exposed to financial risks, including the following: • market risk deriving from the company’s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate fluctuations; • credit risk deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ noncompliance with their obligations; • liquidity risk deriving from the risk that the financial resources necessary to meet obligations may not be available at the agreed terms and deadlines. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk comprises currency risk and interest rate risk. Currency risk Salini Impregilo’s international presence entails its exposure to currency risk arising from fluctuations in the value of trade and financial transactions in currencies other than the functional currencies of the individual companies, branches or joint operations. The company has adopted a currency risk management strategy to mitigate this risk based on the guidelines described in the “Risk management system” section of the Directors’ report to which reference is made. Currency risk at 31 December 2019 mainly related to the following currencies: • US dollar (USD) • Ethiopian Birr (BIRR) • Australian dollar (AUD) • Colombian peso (COP) • United Arab Emirates dirham (AED) • Tajikistani somoni (TJS) The company considers assets and liabilities of the companies, branches or joint operations in currencies other than its functional currency, net of derivatives agreed to hedge the above trade and financial transactions, when assessing the potential effects of fluctuations in the above currencies. The following table shows the results of the sensitivity analysis, which considers a 5% increase or decrease in the exchange rates compared to the actual exchange rates at 31 December 2018 and 2017 to reflect the potential effects on profit (loss) and equity. 468 2018 2019 (€m) -5% +5% -5% +5% US dollar (0.35) 0.35 (2.24) 2.24 Birr 9.75 (9.75) 5.18 (5.18) Australian dollar 3.39 (3.39) 0.18 (0.18) Peso 2.30 (2.30) 2.87 (2.87) Dirham 1.31 (1.31) (0.35) 0.35 Somoni (0.94) 0.94 (0.11) 0.11 This analysis excludes the effects of the translation of the equity of companies or joint operations with a currency other than the Euro. Interest rate risk The company has revised its debt structure significantly, increasing its fixed rate exposure. For this reason, had interest rates increased or decreased by an average 75 basis points in 2019, the profit before tax for the year would have been respectively smaller or greater by €4.9 million (€4.8 million for 2018), assuming that all other variables remained constant. Credit risk Credit risk is that deriving from the company’s exposure to potential losses arising from the customers’ (which are mostly governments or state bodies) non-compliance with their obligations. Management of this risk is complex, starting as early as the assessment of offers, through a careful analysis of the characteristics of the countries in which the company’s activities should be carried out and the customers, which are usually state or similar bodies, requesting an offer. Therefore, this risk can be essentially assimilated to the country risk. An analysis of this risk based on the age of the outstanding amounts is not very meaningful, since the receivables (mostly due from state bodies) should be assessed together with the related working capital items, especially those reflecting the net exposure to customers (contract assets and liabilities) in relation to contract work in progress as a whole. 469 A breakdown of working capital by geographical segment is set out below: (€’000) 31 December 2018 31 December 2019 Italy 85,066 (149,035) Other EU countries 67,161 252,793 Other non-EU countries 17,922 8,783 Americas 101,013 152,286 Asia/Middle East (166,279) 63,487 Africa 117,132 250,270 Australia 91,012 91,868 Total 313,027 670,452 The reconciliation of the reclassified statement of financial position details the items included in working capital.

The company’s strategy aims at ensuring that each ongoing contract is financially independent. A breakdown of financial liabilities by composition and due date (based on undiscounted future cash flows) is set out below: (€’000) 31/12/2019 31/12/2020 31/12/2021 After Total Current account facilities 112,335 112,335 Bonds 31,250 31,336 631,250 526,274 1,220,110 Bank and other loans and borrowings 204,728 161,772 70,407 386,623 823,530 Lease liabilities 17,401 8,919 5,171 3,126 34,617 Gross financial liabilities 365,714 202,027 706,828 916,023 2,190,592 Trade payables 1,514,680 1,514,680 Total 1,880,394 202,027 706,828 916,023 3,705,272 (€’000) 31/12/2020 31/12/2021 31/12/2022 After Total Current account facilities 60,638 60,638 Bonds 31,336 631,250 8,750 517,524 1,188,860 Bank and other loans and borrowings 94,317 67,937 461,282 100,159 723,695 Lease liabilities 19,689 15,933 10,888 18,182 64,692 Interest rate derivatives 2,012 2,012 Gross financial liabilities 207,992 715,120 480,920 635,865 2,039,897 Trade payables 1,792,145 1,792,145 Total 2,000,137 715,120 480,920 635,865 3,832,042 Future interest has been estimated based on the market interest rates at the date of preparation of these separate financial statements, summarised in the notes. Liquidity risk management is mainly based on maintaining a balanced financial position. The “After” balance for bonds relates to the bonds issued in the second half of 2017 for redemption in 2024 (see note 19). Loans and borrowings (principal) and trade payables (net of advances) falling due before 31 March 2020 are compared with the cash and cash equivalents that can be used to meet such obligations in the table below: 471 (€’000) Trade payables and financial liabilities: due before 31 March 2020 (*) 400,954 Cash and cash equivalents (**) 381,260 Difference (19,694) (*) Excluding amounts due to group companies. (**) Net of tied-up liquidity. At the reporting date, the company had unused credit lines of €550 million. Fair value measurement hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position be classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine fair value. There are three different levels: • Level 1 Fair values measured using quoted prices in active markets; • Level 2 Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value measurement are based on observable market data; • Level 3 Fair values measured using valuation techniques for which inputs significant to the fair value measurement are based on unobservable market data. Financial instruments recognised by the company at fair value are classified as follows: (€’000) Note Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Derivative assets 13 268 Derivative liabilities 21 (2,012) Total (1,744) There were no movements from Level 1 to Level 2 during the year or vice versa. 472 Statement of profit or loss 29. Revenue Revenue for 2019 amounts to €2,741.0 million, down 10.7% on the previous year, and was earned in Italy (€688.9 million; 2018: €363.5 million) and abroad (€2,052.1 million; 2018: €2,704.8 million). (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Revenue from contracts with customers 2,916,439 2,597,495 (318,944) Other income 151,860 143,496 (8,364) Total revenue 3,068,299 2,740,990 (327,308) The principal contributors to revenue are some large projects and, specifically, the high speed/capacity railway works for the Milan Genoa railway line section, the Ethiopian contracts and the works for the design and building of the new Riyadh Metro. On 19 December 2019, Condotte’s interest in COCIV was reduced to the minimum (the paragraph “Change in Condotte’s interest in COCIV” in note 3 provides more information about this). A breakdown of revenue from contracts with customers is given in the following table. (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Works invoiced to customers 2,786,494 2,476,143 (310,351) Services 114,802 105,397 (9,405) Sales 17,705 23,155 5,450 Real estate projects (2,562) (7,200) (4,638) Total revenue 2,916,439 2,597,495 (318,944) Works invoiced to customers include contractual revenue deriving from production carried out during the year, measured using the stage of completion method. Services mainly relate to services provided to support group companies. Variable consideration was equal to 8.7% of revenue from contracts with customers during the year and was recognised using the guidance set out in note 2. 473 A breakdown of other income is given in the following table: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Recharged costs 80,722 105,158 24,436 Other 62,633 32,058 (30,575) Gains on the disposal of non-current assets and equity 6,714 4,434 (2,280) investments Rent and leases 1,791 1,846 55 Total 151,860 143,496 (8,364) 30. Operating expenses Operating expenses for the year amount to €2,484.0 million compared to €2,935.8 million for 2018. The item may be broken down as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Purchases 391,830 202,477 (189,353) Subcontracts 507,680 522,063 14,383 Services 1,383,906 1,241,377 (142,529) Personnel expenses 319,624 294,928 (24,696) Other operating expenses 62,641 66,663 4,022 Amortisation, depreciation, provisions and impairment losses 270,113 156,510 (113,603) Total 2,935,794 2,484,018 (451,776) The variations in the individual items compared to 2018 are due to the different cost structures that vary from contract to contract and may, in some cases, entail changes in the industrial operating model from one year to another. Moreover, as these are large-scale infrastructural works that take several years to complete, resort to normal production factors depends on the stage of completion of each contract in any given year. These changes may generate significant variations in the percentage of the related cost categories depending on the contract and the year, while not affecting the total percentage of costs of total revenue. 474 30.1 Purchases The cost of raw materials and consumables incurred in 2019 decreased by €189.4 million to €202.5 million compared to the previous year: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Purchases of raw materials and consumables 369,075 180,459 (188,616) Change in raw materials and consumables 22,755 22,018 (737) Total 391,830 202,477 (189,353) The decrease in the cost of raw materials and consumables is mainly related to the progress on the projects in Dubai and Ethiopia. 30.2 Subcontracts Costs of subcontracts increased to €522.1 million, up €14.4 million on 2018 as summarised in the following table: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Subcontracts 507,680 522,063 14,383 Total 507,680 522,063 14,383 The increase is mostly due to the South Al Mutlaa project in Kuwait, partially offset by the reduction in costs for Line 3 of the Riyadh Metro in Saudi Arabia mainly related to the progress on the project. 30.3 Services This item decreased to €1,241.4 million, down €142.5 million on the previous year, as shown in the following table. 2018 2019 Variation (€’000) Recharging of costs by consortia 814,492 790,875 (23,617) Consultancy and technical services 346,892 259,061 (87,831) Leases 93,267 68,824 (24,443) Transport and customs 47,966 35,100 (12,866) Insurance 26,794 32,448 5,654 Fees to directors, statutory auditors and independent auditors 7,520 9,875 2,355 Maintenance 8,566 5,578 (2,988) Other 38,409 39,616 1,207 Total 1,383,906 1,241,377 (142,529) 475 Leases include rent and leases with variable payments or that are covered by the practical expedients of IFRS 16 in 2019 (see note 2). The company elected to use the practical expedient for assets of a low value and leases with a term of less than 12 months and the related payments are recognised in profit or loss immediately. The leases in 2018 also included the costs of rent and leases that have required the recognition of a lease liability and a right-of-use asset since 1 January 2019. The €24.4 million decrease in “Leases” is due to the company’s application of IFRS 16 starting from 1 January 2019. “Recharging of costs by consortia” of roughly €790.9 million relates to Italian consortia and consortium companies, especially the high speed/capacity Milan Genoa railway line section. “Consultancy and technical services” decreased by €87.8 million and mainly consist of the design and construction costs incurred by the SPEs and legal and administrative consultancy fees. A breakdown of this item is as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Design and engineering services 197,240 166,875 (30,365) Construction 101,579 49,948 (51,631) Legal, administrative and other services 47,630 42,164 (5,466) Testing 443 74 (369) Total 346,892 259,061 (87,831) Fees to the independent auditors, KPMG S.p.A., and other companies of its network for 2019 are detailed as follows: Services Fees (€’000) Audit Salini Impregilo 1,366 Audit Subsidiaries S.p.A. 1,400 Total audit 2,766 Other services Salini Impregilo 1,102 Other services Subsidiaries S.p.A. 65 Total other services 1,167 Total Group 3,933 476 30.4 Personnel expenses Personnel expenses for the year amount to €294.9 million, down by €24.7 million on 2018.

The impairment losses recognised on the Venezuelan contracts amounted to €165.5 million in 2018. On 1 January 2019, following the transition to IFRS 16, which introduced new guidelines for the accounting treatment of leased assets and their depreciation, the company introduced a new item “Depreciation of right-ofuse assets”. In 2018, depreciation of leased assets was included under depreciation of property, plant and equipment. Amortisation and depreciation of €74.6 million decreased by €5.2 million on the previous year. They are in line with the progress made on the related contracts. The decreases mainly refer to contracts in Ethiopia, whereas the increases relate to the construction of the Rogun Dam in Tajikistan. Provisions include the €45.8 million accrual made during the year to reflect the situation of the consortium member Condotte (see note 23). 478 31. Net financing costs Net financing costs amount to €65.0 million compared to €5.8 million for the previous year. The item may be broken down as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Financial income 58,472 48,594 (9,878) Financial expense (95,601) (119,043) (23,442) Net exchange gains 31,343 5,432 (25,911) Net financing costs (5,787) (65,017) (59,230) 31.1 Financial income Financial income totals €48.6 million (€58.5 million) and is made up as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Gains on securities 1,291 3 (1,288) Intragroup interest and other income 28,071 26,402 (1,669) Interest and other financial income 29,110 22,189 (6,921) Bank interest 15,713 12,760 (2,953) Other 5,015 6,623 1,608 Default interest 8,303 2,395 (5,908) Interest on financing 30 352 322 Financial discounts and allowances 49 59 10 Total 58,472 48,594 (9,878) The decrease on the previous year is mainly due to: the decrease in default interest on receivables from mostly foreign customers (€5.9 million); the decrease in interest income from banks, mainly related to the Ethiopian branch (€3.0 million). Interest from group companies amounts to €26.4 million, in line with the previous year, and relates to the following companies: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Gupc 9,995 (9,995) HCE Costruzioni S.p.A. 5,327 4,973 (354) Yuma 4,965 4,965 Salini Nigeria Ltd 3,026 3,436 410 Salini Namibia 896 680 (216) Salini Polska 1,681 3,579 1,898 ICT II 1,655 1,933 278 CMT 1,461 1,345 (116) Eriday 636 636 Other 4,030 4,855 825 Total 28,071 26,402 (1,669) 479 31.2 Financial expense 2019 financial expense increased by €23.4 million to €119.0 million as follows: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Intragroup interest and other expense (14,089) (28,506) (14,417) Interest and other financial expense (81,512) (90,538) (9,026) Interest on bonds (45,703) (34,982) 10,721 Bank interest on accounts and financing (18,924) (26,089) (7,165) Other (11,176) (10,589) 587 Interest on tax liabilities (1,605) (13,724) (12,119) Bank fees (2,881) (3,071) (190) Leases (1,223) (2,083) (860) Total (95,601) (119,044) (23,443) The rise in financial expense is mostly due to the assessment of loan assets at the reporting date, pursuant to IFRS 9, payment of interest of €13.7 million by the Ethiopian branch for the years from 2014 to 2016 as part of a tax assessment and the increase in bank interest on accounts and financing of €7.2 million. This increase is partly offset by the reduction in financial expense on the bonds of approximately €10.7 million compared to the previous year following the redemption of the unsecured senior bonds in August 2018. In addition: interest on bank accounts and financing of €26.1 million includes the effect of the amortised cost method of €1.1 million (2018: €2.0 million) that did not give rise to cash outlays; interest on bonds of €35.0 million includes the effect of the amortised cost method of €3.7 million (2018: €4.3 million) that did not give rise to cash outlays. Intragroup interest and other expense of €28.5 million on intragroup transactions increased by €14.4 million and relate to the following companies: (€’000) 2018 2019 Variation Lane Construction Corporation (706) (12,650) (11,944) Yuma (8,001) (9,400) (1,399) COCIV (2,847) (3,217) (370) SLC Snowy Hydro Joint Venure (897) (897) Other (2,535) (2,342) 193 Total (14,089) (28,506) (14,417) 31.3 Net exchange gains Net exchange gains decreased from €31.3 million in 2018 to €5.4 million in 2019. The 2019 decrease of €25.9 million is due to fluctuations in the exchange rate with certain currencies, especially the Ethiopian Birr. 480 32.

The SPEs carry out the related contracts on behalf of its partners. The other transactions refer to costs for design and similar activities, incurred when presenting bids and for recently started contracts. They are also governed by specific agreements and carried out on an arm’s length basis and, where applicable, in line with the contract terms. Their effects on the statements of financial position and profit or loss are shown together with the related contract, when appropriate. The company completed the sale of its investment in the Dutch subsidiary Impregilo International Infrastructures N.V. to Lane Group during the year.

In many cases, they have corporate structures that directly and continuously allocate the profits and losses on contracts to their investors, including by “reallocating costs and fees”. They can be considered to be “transparent” considering the original contractual relationship whereby Salini Impregilo, together with the other investors, depending on the type of organisation selected during the tender stage, is the direct counterparty of the customer and the SPE acts in its own name but on behalf of its investors, including vis-à-vis third party suppliers. Accordingly, transactions between Salini Impregilo and the SPEs, in which it has an investment, are not presented in this section but are summarised with other transactions with subsidiaries and associates in the annex “Intragroup transactions Salini Impregilo S.p.A.”. 484 Management and coordination In relation to the requirements of article 2.6.2.11 of the Rules of the Markets organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A., the company states that all requirements listed in article 16 of the Consob Regulation on Markets, have been met, as regards the quotation of shares of subsidiaries managed and coordinated by other companies.

(the “company”) on 27 April 2017. Its term of office ends with the shareholders’ meeting called to approve the separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019. Pursuant to article 153.1 of Legislative decree no. 58 of 24 February 1998 (the “Consolidated Finance Act” or the “TUF”), we note that we performed our supervisory and control duties prescribed by the current regulations during the year, with specific reference to the Italian Civil Code, article 148 and subsequent articles of the TUF, Legislative decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010 as amended by Legislative decree no. 135 of 17 July 2016 and Legislative decree no. 254/2016. We also considered the guidelines set out in the Consob (the Italian Commission for Listed Companies and the Stock Exchange) communications about the duties of statutory auditors, the guidance of the Code of Conduct for Listed Companies and the ethical standards recommended by the Italian Accounting Profession (Consiglio Nazionale dei Dottori Commercialisti e degli Esperti Contabili). We have prepared this report for the shareholders’ meeting called to meet on 4 May 2020 on single call to approve the separate financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 (as well as on the other matters listed in the call notice, to which reference should be made). That being said, we describe below our activities performed during the year and up to the date of this report, including as required by Consob communication no. DEM/1025564 of 6 April 2001 as subsequently amended. 1. Significant financial or capital transactions We note the following key events and transactions which took place in 2019: On 14 February 2019, the company as is public knowledge presented an offer for a potential investment in Astaldi S.p.A. to support its business continuity proposal underpinning its application for a deed of arrangement procedure subject to the court’s approval of this application. On 2 August 2019, the company announced the commencement of a project to relaunch the Italian large works sector (“Progetto Italia”). To this end, it entered into two investment agreements on the same date: the first with the controlling shareholder Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and CDP Equity S.p.A. (“CDPE”), a subsidiary of Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A.; and the second with three major Italian banks to establish, inter alia, (i) the terms and conditions for the subscription of part of the capital increase to serve Progetto Italia by CDPE and Salini Costruttori, and (ii) the related introduction of certain corporate governance rules.The key terms of the investment agreement were published on the company’s website and filed with the Company Registrar on 7 August 2019 as required by the ruling regulations. On 4 October 2019, as provided for by the investment agreements, the shareholders met in an extraordinary meeting to (a) authorise the board of directors to increase the share capital; and (b) resolve on the related amendments to the by-laws. On 12 November 2019, the company executed its capital increase to serve Progetto Italia. As a result, at 31 December 2019, the company’s share capital amounted to €600,000,000.00, comprising 893,788,182 shares, of which 892,172,691 ordinary shares and 1,615,491 savings shares, all without a nominal amount. 527 The directors and management informed us periodically about the operations and key transactions undertaken by the company and its subsidiaries. They also described such operations and transactions in their report, to which reference is made, with details of their characteristics and effects. We obtained adequate information about them in order to be in a position to reasonably believe that they comply with the law, the by-laws and principles of correct administration and that they are not imprudent, risky or contrary to the resolutions taken by the shareholders or such that would compromise the company’s assets. Transactions in which the directors or other related parties have an interest are subjected to the transparency procedures required by the ruling legislation. 2. Atypical and/or unusual transactions carried out with third parties, intragroup transactions or related party transactions We did not identify nor were we informed by the directors, independent auditors or internal audit supervisor about any atypical and/or unusual transactions (as per the definition in Consob communication no. DEM/6064293 of 28 July 2006) carried out with third parties, related parties or other group companies. The directors described the day-to-day transactions carried out during the year with group companies and related parties in the notes to the separate financial statements to which reference should be made, also for details about their characteristics and financial effects. They did not identify any critical issues with respect to their suitability and compliance with the company’s interests. We checked that the procedure for related party transactions adopted by the company is applied, including the regular reporting by the board of directors on any such transactions. 3. Comments on and proposals about the findings and disclosures in the independent auditors’ report On 10 April 2019, the independent auditors, KPMG S.p.A., issued its report pursuant to article 14 of Legislative decree no. 39 of 27 January 2010 and article 10 of Regulation (EU) no. 537 of 16 April 2014. KPMG S.p.A. states that, in its opinion: the separate and consolidated financial statements of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company and the Group as at 31 December 2019 and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union and the Italian regulations implementing article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/05; the directors’ report and specific information presented in the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure are consistent with the separate and consolidated financial statements of the company and the Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 and have been prepared in compliance with the law; there is nothing to report with reference to the statement required by article 14.2.e) of Legislative decree no. 39/10 based on KPMG S.p.A.’s knowledge and understanding of the entity and its environment obtained through its audit. On 10 April 2020, KPMG S.p.A. also issued its additional report pursuant to article 11 of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 confirming, inter alia, that based on the procedures performed, no significant deficiencies in internal control were identified. KPMG S.p.A.’s reports detail the key audit matters with respect to which reference should be made thereto. 528 4. Complaints as per article 2408 of the Italian Civil Code, actions taken by the board of statutory auditors and related outcome We did not receive any complaints as per article 2408 or other complaints from third parties during the year. The company has a whistleblowing procedure and information channels suitable to ensure the receipt, analysis and processing of reports about internal control, corporate information, the company’s administrative liability, fraud or other issues by employees, members of the company bodies or third parties, which can also be made confidentially or anonymously. 5. Engagement of independent auditors and related fees We confirm that the fees received by KPMG S.p.A. for its attestation services amount to €1,101,500. This amount consists of €1,035,000 for engagements approved by us in advance and €66,500 for engagements not approved in advance as they were either for amounts below the threshold established in the Procedure for the conferral of engagements to audit companies or related to long-term services approved in previous years.

During the period from 31 December 2019 and up until the date of preparation of this report, we also: examined and found in favour of the 2020 audit plan prepared by the internal audit supervisor approved by the board of directors; reference should be made to the Final assessment of the supervisory activities and proposal to the shareholders for information on our activities carried on the separate and consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2019. 529 7. Frequency of attendance at company body meetings In 2019, we attended all 21 meetings of the board of directors during which we were informed about the operations and key transactions performed by the company and its subsidiaries. We also received information about the exercise of his powers from the chief executive officer. We met 15 times during 2019 and during our meetings we exchanged information with the independent auditors to ensure that no transactions took place that were imprudent or risky, could give rise to potential conflicts of interest, are not compliant with the law or the company’s by-laws or the shareholders’ resolutions or that could prejudice the company’s assets. We attended 10 meetings of the control and risk committee (now the “control, risk and sustainability committee”), seven meetings of the compensation and nominating committee and three meetings of the committee for related-party transactions, obtaining information on the work they performed during the year. We also participated in the ordinary shareholders’ meeting held on 24 April 2019, the special meeting of the holders of savings shares of 27 June 2019 and the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of 4 October 2019. During 2020 and up to the date of this report, we attended all the meetings of the company bodies and, specifically, seven meetings of the board of directors, four meetings of the control, risk and sustainability committee, six meetings of the compensation and nominating committee and two meetings of the committee for related-party transactions. We have met eight times so far this year. 8. Compliance with correct administration standards We have no comments to make about compliance with such standards based on our work. We checked that the directors are aware of the riskiness and effects of the transactions performed. Specifically, we checked that management decisions were taken in the company’s interests, in line with its resources and assets and that they were adequately supported by information, analysis and checking processes, including by resort to the committees and external professionals, when necessary. 9. Adequacy of the organisational structure. We obtained information about the company’s organisational structure and any modifications thereto on a regular basis, including through meetings with the competent company managers. As a result, we believe that the company’s organisational structure, procedures, duties and responsibilities are adequate given its size and type of activities. We also checked the adequacy of the organisation structure of the company and its key subsidiaries, focusing on their internal controls and risk management. 10. Adequacy of internal controls and risk management We supervised the adequacy of the internal controls and risk management of the company and its key subsidiaries as follows: a. we regularly obtained information from the director in charge of the internal control and risk management system, the competent manager, the internal audit supervisor, the compliance supervisor, the group risk officer and the heads of the other departments involved from time to time about the activities carried out, the mapping of risks related to ongoing activities, test programmes and projects to implement internal controls; we also obtained the related documentation; b. we participated regularly in the activities of the control, risk and sustainability committee set up in line with the Code of Conduct for Listed Companies as well as the board of directors’ meetings; 530 c. we reviewed the reports of the control, risk and sustainability committee periodically; d. we reviewed the internal audit reports on the internal units of both the branches and head office and the working of the Group’s internal controls and risk management; we also monitored the implementation of remedial actions identified as a result of the internal audit; we reviewed the internal audit report prepared every six months by the internal audit supervisor on the activities performed during the period, the methods applied to manage risks inside the company, compliance with risk containment plans, the strategic containment and efficiency objectives and the internal audit supervisor’s positive assessment of the internal controls and risk management given the company’s and its key subsidiaries’ characteristics and risk profile. Specifically, we expressed our favourable opinion on the organisational, administrative and accounting structure and the internal control and risk management system of the company and its key subsidiaries; e. we reviewed the reports of the compliance department on the prevention, monitoring and management of the risk of non-compliance with the law and anti-corruption regulations. We also: checked that the company has an organisational, management and control model which complies with the provisions of Legislative decree no. 231/01 and the guidelines issued by the sector associations, most recently updated by the board of directors on 14 November 2018; checked that the company has an anti-corruption model, which the board of directors last updated on 26 September 2018; examined the supervisory body’s regular reports as required by Legislative decree no. 231/2001, which summarise its activities of the year; we also met with the body’s members; met the statutory auditors of the wholly-controlled subsidiaries Fisia Italimpianti S.p.A. and Imprepar S.p.A. to exchange information about, inter alia, the subsidiaries’ operations and compliance with instructions received from the company, their internal controls and organisation, the composition and activities performed by the supervisory bodies, committees and internal audit department. During our work, we: a) did not identify any critical situations or facts that would have led us to believe that the company’s internal controls or risk management were inadequate during the year; b) to the extent of our duties, we deem that the above model is suitable to prevent the crimes covered by the aforesaid regulations and has been implemented properly, based also on the information provided by the chairperson of the supervisory body and the reports referred to above which stated that no censurable events or violations or the model took place in 2019; c) acknowledged the board of directors’ positive assessment of the adequacy and effective working of internal controls and risk management in 2019. 11. Adequacy of the administrative-accounting system and its reliability To the extent of our duties, we monitored the adequacy of the administrative and accounting system and its ability to correctly show the company’s operations and the activities undertaken as coordinated by the manager in charge of financial reporting to comply with Law no. 262/05 on guidelines for the protection of savings and regulation of financial markets as subsequently amended and integrated by: a) obtaining information from the manager in charge of financial reporting and the different department heads, including through participation in the activities carried out by the control, risk and sustainability committee; b) obtaining information about the procedures adopted and instructions issued by the company for the 531 preparation of the 2019 Annual Report and the 2019 Interim Financial Report; c) obtaining information about the existence of the conditions required by article 15 of the Market Regulation adopted with Consob resolution no. 20249 of 28 December 2017 (formerly article 36 of the Market Regulation adopted with Consob resolution no. 16191 of 29 October 2007) for significant subsidiaries set up in and regulated by laws of non-EU states. We also checked that circumstances entailing non-compliance with the conditions did not exist as they would have required reporting to Consob and Borsa Italiana S.p.A. pursuant to article 15.1.c.ii; d) reviewing the reports prepared by the manager in charge of financial reporting and the internal audit supervisor on the adequacy of the administrative and accounting procedures pursuant to Law no. 262/05 and the results of the related tests as per the annual mandate assigned by the manager in charge of financial reporting; e) meeting the independent auditors and analysing the findings of their work; f) reviewing internal documents. We also acknowledged that, independently and before the approval of the separate financial statements, on 11 March 2020, the board of directors approved the impairment test applied by the company during preparation of the financial statements at 31 December 2019 and the impairment test procedures to be applied to the financial statements of the group companies, after receiving the favourable opinion of the control, risk and sustainability committee and pursuant to the recommendations issued by the ESMA on 21 January 2013, the joint Bank of Italy/Consob/Isvap document no. 4 of 3 March 2010 and Consob communication no. 3907 of 19 January 2015. We did not identify any critical situations or facts during the above activities that would have led us to believe that the company’s administrative and accounting system was inadequate and/or unreliable during the year. 12. Adequacy of the instructions given to subsidiaries The company regulates the information provided by the subsidiaries, especially that related to more important transactions, with specific procedures. We believe that the instructions issued by the company to its subsidiaries pursuant to article 114.2 of the TUF are adequate to ensure compliance with the legal disclosure requirements. 13. Issues which arose during meetings with the independent auditors During our activities related to the 2019 Annual Report, we met the independent auditors: to exchange information about the checks performed in accordance with Legislative decree no. 39/2010 and article 150.3 of the TUF to ensure the company’s accounts were kept properly and that the accounting entries accurately reflected its operations. No issues arose as a result of these meetings; to examine and assess the procedures used to prepare the 2019 Interim Financial Report and the 2019 Annual Report, including the assessment of the correct application of the accounting policies and their consistency; we also reviewed the audit findings and assessment of these reports; Specifically, we: analysed the audit procedures performed by the auditors and, in particular, their methodology, the audit approach to key audit matters and audit planning; discussed issues related to the company’s risks with the auditors and were favourably impressed by the adequacy of their planned approach to the structural and risk profiles of the company and the Group. 532 In addition to that set out in paragraph 3, we also: a) received the additional report from the independent auditors pursuant to article 11.2 of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 on key audit matters and any significant deficiencies identified in the internal controls over financial reporting stating that no significant deficiencies were identified; b) acknowledged KPMG’s statement of its independence pursuant to article 6 of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014 attached to the additional report, which did not report situations that could have compromised its independence; c) discussed the risks related to the independent auditors’ independence and the measures adopted to limit these risks in accordance with article 6.2.b) of Regulation (EU) no. 537/2014. 14. Compliance with the Code of Conduct of the Corporate Governance Committee of Listed companies We checked that the company complies with the Code of Conduct of Listed Companies approved in March 2006 and most recently amended in July 2018 (the “Code”). In accordance with article 149.1.c-bis) of the TUF, we checked that the corporate governance rules provided for in the Code were effectively applied and specifically: the correct application of the criteria and procedures used by the board of directors to assess the independence of its members; the company’s corporate governance structure. Specifically, we agreed with the board of directors’ decision not to perform the 2019 self-assessment, after the preliminary checks performed by the compensation and nominating committee given the significant changes made to the company’s shareholder structure and the board of directors in November and December 2019 as a result of the investment agreement which led to the co-optation of five new directors on 6 December 2019. The board of directors presented its decision and reasons in the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure, to which reference should be made. We examined (i) the 2019 remuneration policy and checked that it complied with the provisions of article 6 of the Code of Conduct and (ii) the remuneration report approved by the board of directors in its meeting of 13 March 2020. We checked that the latter report included the disclosure required by article 123-ter of the TUF and article 84-quater of Consob regulation no. 11971/1999 and compliance with the most recent regulatory and legislative requirements following enactment of the Shareholder Rights Directive II. We note that the board of directors examined the recommendations made by the Corporate Governance Committee in its letter dated 19 December 2019 from the committee chairperson, Patrizia Grieco, to the chairpersons of the boards of directors of Italian listed companies and copied to the chief executive officers and chairpersons of the boards of statutory auditors in order to take the necessary resolutions. In turn, we examined the recommendations in so far as they extended to the board of statutory auditors. We monitored the activities of the control, risk and sustainability committee, the compensation and nominating committee, the committee for related-party transactions and the strategic committee by attending their meetings. **** In addition to that set out above, we: checked the compliance of the board’s composition with the law in terms of gender and its adequacy 533 with respect to age diversity and professional experience and background of its members; assessed that the board had carried out its duties correctly and efficiently, considering the professionalism, experience and competence of its members and compliance with the regulations about the number of positions that can be held, the time dedicated to carry out their activities and the functionality and quality of the information exchanged with the board of directors, the control, risk and sustainability committee, the independent auditors and other control functions; checked that the board of statutory auditors met the independence criteria as required by the Code of Conduct; the outcome of these checks was positive. The results of these checks are presented in the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure for 2019; monitored compliance with the election regulations for the appointment of directors and statutory auditors pursuant to article 149 of the TUF and Consob communication no. DEM79017893 of 26 February 2009 and the correct presentation of the lists and appointment of the control bodies; prepared the reports summarising our control activities performed in 2019 as required by Consob communication no. 1025564 of 6 April 2001; we checked the report on corporate governance and the ownership structure approved by the board of directors in its meeting of 11 March 2020 and that it included the disclosures required by article 123-bis of the TUF, complied with the format established by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. and met the related disclosure requirements, including with respect to explanations of any non-compliance with requirements of the Code of Conduct. 15. Comments on COVID-19 We exchanged information constantly with the independent auditors despite the objective operating difficulties during the final stages of the audit due to the worsening of the public health emergency caused by COVID-19. Specifically, we monitored the impacts of the “remote” work methods implemented by the independent auditors, assisted by the company’s structures, in order to check the audit progress. We noted that the shareholders’ meeting was called in accordance with the exceptional circumstances rules set out in Decree law no. 18 of 17 March 2020 given the COVID-19 epidemiological emergency. We also acknowledged that, as required by the ESMA statement of 11 March 2020, the directors specified the actions taken and considerations made about the possible outcome of the crisis triggered by the outbreak of COVID-19 in the “Events after the reporting period” section of their report. Specifically, the directors noted that, given the extraordinary nature of the circumstances related to the spread of COVID19 and the general uncertainty, it will update its outlook for 2020 should the crisis have a material impact on the Group’s financial and economic indicators. At the date of this report, we note that the directors’ considerations are reasonable as the circumstances related to COVID-19 and the measures introduced by the competent authorities to contain the pandemic, which are extraordinary in nature and scope, will have significant repercussions on all economic activities in Italy and the other countries where the Group operates, with potentially significant follow-on effects, whose development and impact cannot currently be measured either in general terms or with specific reference to the Group. 534 Final assessment of the supervisory activities and proposal to the shareholders Based on that set out above, during the year: − we monitored compliance with the law and bylaws, the principles of correct administration and, specifically, the adequacy of the organisational, administrative and accounting models adopted by the company and their correct working; − we monitored compliance with the disclosure requirements about confidential information; − we monitored the working and efficiency of the internal controls and administrative-accounting system in order to assess their compliance with the company’s requirements and reliability in presenting its operations; − we monitored compliance with the laws about the preparation, checks, approval and publication of the company’s separate financial statements and the preparation, checks and publication of the Group’s consolidated financial statements and the directors’ reports for 2019, including through direct checks and information obtained from the independent auditors, assessing the appropriateness of the impairment method; − we checked that, pursuant to Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 and Legislative decree no. 38/2005, the separate financial statements of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and the consolidated financial statements of Salini Impregilo Group as at and for the year ended 31 December 2019 were prepared in compliance with the IFRS endorsed by the European Commission and integrated by the interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); − we monitored compliance with the procedure for preparation and presentation of the separate financial statements to the shareholders; − we monitored the financial reporting process, the effectiveness of internal controls, internal audit and risk management pursuant to article 19.1 of Legislative decree no. 39/2010 and informed the board of directors of the findings of the statutory audit; − we monitored compliance with the measures of Legislative decree no. 254/2016 and Consob regulation no. 20267/2018, checking, inter alia, the Consolidated Non-financial Statement and compliance with the instructions for its preparation pursuant to the above decree and its preparation in accordance with the measures.
