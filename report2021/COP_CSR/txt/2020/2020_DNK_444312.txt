Therefore, the final numbers disclosed in this report vary from GE's aggregated environmental reporting. *** We only include our operational footprint in our carbon neutrality pledge. However, because the emissions from our purchased goods and services are significant, we disclose it for transparency reasons. The calculation of carbon emissions from purchased goods and services is based on key commodities used in blade manufacturing, but not an exhaustive list of materials purchased by our company. It should therefore be seen as an indication of emissions only and not as an exact disclosure. The sharp increase in emissions can be explained by the rise in manufacturing output. 6 | L M W I ND POWER SUSTA INA B ILIT Y P ER FORMA NCE 20 19 Environment (continued) 2019 2019 2018 2017 2016 target (change) (change) (change) (change) Waste Total production waste (tons)  57,392  45,520 42,530 37,688 N/A (+29%) (+6%) (+12%) (+44%) Total waste for landfill (tons)  15,861  15,178 14,924 13,473 N/A (+5%) (+2%) (+11%) (+46%) Hazardous waste for landfill (tons) N/A 7 27 119 63 Non-hazardous waste for landfill (tons) N/A 15,855 15,151 14,805 13,411 Total waste for incineration (tons)  27,247  19,166 16,989 13,517 N/A (+42%) (+13%) (+26%) (+23%) Hazardous waste for incineration (tons) N/A 11,845 6,164 6,409 4,417 Non-hazardous waste for incineration (tons) N/A 15,403 13,003 10,581 9,100 Total waste for recycling (tons)  14282  11,175 10,616 10,696 N/A (+28%) (+5%) (-1%) (+82%) Hazardous waste for recycling (tons) N/A 219 143 187 226 Non-hazardous waste for recycling (tons) N/A 14,063 11,033 10,430 10,470 Total waste for recycling (% of total N/A  25  25 25 28 production waste) (+0%) (-2%) (-12%) (+26%) Waste reduction Waste reduction savings ($) * 18.5mln 12.0mln 17.8mln 3.0mln 5.5mln (-32%) (+482%) (-45%) (-7%) * The waste reduction savings prior to 2017 are expressed in €.

Carbon emissions reporting The pathway to carbon neutrality Depending on the extent of control a company has on the emissions, carbon emissions are commonly reported in the form of scope 1, scope 2, or scope 3. Scope 1 emissions refer to the emissions that are a direct consequence of a company’s own operations. For example, emissions generated from fuel combustion in company-owned vehicles or facilities are considered scope 1 emissions. Scope 2 emissions cover indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heating, cooling or steam. The emissions are considered to be indirect emissions because the actual generation of the emissions physically occurs outside of Reductions the company-owned site and takes place at power plants. Offsets Scope 3 emissions include other indirect emissions, such as business travel and waste disposal.
