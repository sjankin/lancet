CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 5 102-11 Precautionary The EU policy on the environment states that it shall “aim at principle or a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of approach situations in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay”. Within this understanding, the company applies where practical the same precautionary principle in seeking not to generate significant environmental impact, and where there is impact of any nature the company seeks to address this quickly and clearly. 102-12 External The most impressive initiative during the year was the company initiatives winning the prestigious 6th Euroheat & Power ‘Global District Energy Climate Award for Modernisation’, with the awards ceremony in Reykjavik, Iceland on October 23-25. This biennial event rewards systems or projects that illustrate the importance of district energy resource efficiency and heat delivery. Kaunas Energy was judged by an international panel of experts to have made the most impressive impact on efficiency and reduction of CO2 emissions through its transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. (LT www.kaunoenergija.lt/ naujienos/ab-kauno-energija-pelne-pasaulini-apdovanojima-uzkauno-silumos-ukio-modernizavima-ir-co2-emisiju-mazinima/; ENG www.euroheat.org/news/6th-global-district-energy-climateawards-revealed/). Further highlights from the year include: April May: Following some pipeline drainage works carried out by the company near to the historic Kaunas Fortress, some accidental flooding occurred. This flooding was quite substantial and had threatened the cancellation of a large outdoor public event. However, the company took the initiative to clean up the site with around 20 employees helping to ensure that the public event could go ahead as planned.The clean-up was a substantial amount of work that included the removal of long accumulated sludge soil, and various debris. Because the site was a national heritage site, the works were monitored by the representatives of Kaunas Fortress Association and the Department of Cultural Heritage who praised the results and achievements of the company’s employees. May: The company joined the campaign “Workplace Open to the Family”, organized by Kaunas Family Council and Kaunas Region Industrialists and Employers Association to commemorate International Family Day. The essence of this campaign is to introduce a parent’s workplace to family members. Approximately 30 people, including the children of 12 employees, took part in an excursion around the company, during which they were invited to ask questions, take photos and share them on social networks. June: In partnership with “Laisvės TV” and Kaunas University of Technology (KTU) the company created a promotional video for the TV show ‘Antanas Wants to Be…’ about the profession of a Thermal Engineer. This was widely promoted by KTU, and as of December 2019 there had been almost 20,000 hits for this video. (www.youtube.com/ watch?time_continue=3&v=bYGK4JfX_pw&feature=emb_logo). November: Twelve students and a professor from Vytautas Magnus University Faculty of Economics and Management selected Kaunas Energy for an educational excursion to study more about how it operates. The company was chosen because of its high level of socially responsible activities and regular and transparent public reporting. The educational tour included heat production and supply methods, calculation of cost and environmental benefits for the consumers (including emission controls in place), and network management. (www.kaunoenergija.lt/naujienos/vdu-ekonomikos-ir-vadybosfakulteto-studentai-domejosi-kauno-energijos-veiklos-organizavimu/). Throughout the year, the trade union organised a number of activities including inviting company employees to take part in the ‘Employees of Lithuanian Industry’ family sports games 2019. In addition, the trade union and a number of internal departments organised canoeing activities in the summer. As part of Christmas celebrations, the children of employees received presents as well as free tickets to puppet theatre performances. 6 GRI 102: General Disclosures (2016) 102-13 Membership of The company is a member of the following associations: associations • Responsible Business Association of Lithuania • Lithuanian District Heating Association • Lithuanian Electricity Association • Kaunas Region Industrialists and Employers Association • Lithuanian Thermal Technology Engineers Association In addition, the company is a member of the United Nations Global Compact. Strategy 102-14 Statement from The year 2019 was one of change as we revised and updated our senior decisioncompany strategy to set new development goals. In order to achieve maker these new goals, the structure of our company changed. During this process, new structural units were created, and some were removed meaning that the number of our employees decreased slightly. The introduction of new technologies and services for consumers, further digitalisation of processes, the reduction of heat transfer costs and the creation of better working conditions for employees are all areas in which we will seek to continue to improve upon. The company compensated consumers for the additional return on investment earned in 2013-2017. In total in 2019, consumers were compensated in the form of lower heat prices; this was equal to as much as 3.3 million of this additional investment return. With the support of European Union Structural Funds, the company reconstructed a record 15 km of heat supply pipelines. In addition we built a new biofuel boiler in the city district of Noreikiškės, and carried out a high number of modernisation works. All of this has resulted in even greater resource savings, which in turn lowered the cost of heat to consumers and helped towards reducing environmental pollution. In October 2019, and in recognition of our progress to date, the company was awarded the Euroheat & Power 6th Global District Energy Climate Award for its efficient system modernization and pollution reduction. To further reduce our environmental impact, the company installed an electric car charging point near the main office building, where part of the electricity consumed is generated by a solar power plant installed on the same building. Electric vehicles can be charged at this point by employees or members of the public for free. This overall company commitment to continual improvement is reflected in this GRI Standards report – our fourth in succession. 102-15 Key impacts, Not required for Core reporting risks, and opportunities CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 7 Ethics and Integrity 102-16 Values, Full information is provided on the company website under mission principles, and vision, and values and strategic objectives: www.kaunoenergija.lt/ standards, bendroves-veikla/apie-bendrove/misija-ir-vertybes/. and norms of The Code of Ethics is publicly disclosed within the company and is applicable to all employees, agents, brokers, contractors, subcontractors behaviour or suppliers of the Company.

CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 11 GRI 103: Management Approach (2016) The GRI 103: Management Approach applied to GRI 204: Procurement Practices 103-1 Explanation of The monthly procurement of heating services from independent the material heat producers represents the main services procurement for the company, and is a substantial amount representing approx. 62% of topic and its consumers heat demand. boundary The boundary is with all of the business and residential customers who receive heating using these sources, and it is here where any potential impacts will be felt. The company seeks to minimise boundary impacts through close management and quality control of these relationships on a regular basis. If serious impacts are likely to occur, we can correct through improved procurement procedure month by month if necessary. 103-2 The management The company’s procurement policy expired as the Law on Procurement approach and its of Contracting Entities in the Field of Water Management, Energy, Transport or Postal Services came into force. Now, the company needs only to follow components the provisions of this law, according to which, the company provides a Description of The Procedure For Low Value Purchases, which is publicly available on the company’s website: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendrovesveikla/viesieji-pirkimai/mazos-vertes-pirkimu-tvarkos-aprasas/. The company also approved its Gift Policy in 2019, which is publicly available on its website: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendroves-veikla/apiebendrove/dovanu-politika/ and its Anticorruption Policy which is available here: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendroves-veikla/korupcijos-prevencija/. Also, the company publicises on its website a Notice of Restrictive Practices, issued by The Competition Council of the Republic of Lithuania: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendroves-veikla/apie-bendrove/atmintine-apiekonkurencijos-ribojima/. 12 GRI 103: Management Approach (2016) Company goals and targets for procurement practices are defined in law as we are obliged to provide for the lowest price. All heat providers have technical measurements made of their service delivery to make sure it satisfies the conditions of the procurement contract. The company’s procurement procedures are organised by the Procurement Commission constituted by the order of General Manager or Procurement Organiser, subject to the procurement amount. All announcements and winning contracts are published on the national central procurement portal: https://cvpp.eviesiejipirkimai.lt/. A large majority of the company’s procurement consists of the purchase of heat from independent heat producers. As such, the amendments to the Law on the Energy Resources Market (which came into force in May 2018) had a bearing on how the company procures its heat. The Operator of the Energy Exchange ‘UAB Baltpool’ was now entrusted with organising heat auctions in accordance with the procedure established by the law on heat, and the company started to purchase all of its heat through these electronic auctions. For all heat providers in Lithuania, procurement procedures are governed by national regulations based on legislation. 103-3 Evaluation of Evaluation of the management approach is not formally carried the management out. However, the management approach is systematically linked approach to the procurement process and adjustments can be made through employee or client feedback. The GRI: 103 Management Approach applied to GRI 205: Anti-Corruption 103-1 Explanation of The company and its subsidiaries are guided by our anticorruption the material policy which identifies the main principles and requirements for the prevention of corruption in the company and its subsidiaries. The policy topic and its includes guidelines for ensuring compliance and for implementation. boundary This anticorruption policy is in harmony with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania, and the company constantly works hard to minimize any risk of corruption through a range of management and quality control measures. CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 13 103-2 The management The Corruption Prevention Policy is approved by the company and approach and its publicised on the company’s website: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendrovesveikla/korupcijos-prevencija/. components To prevent corruption, a system has been created within the company in which named or anonymous cases of abusive or corrupt practices can be reported. This system encourages all company employees, suppliers, and customers to report on any incidents that they feel are abusive or corrupt, such as personal gain in working relationships, exceeding powers granted, assimilating or disposing of company assets, disclosing official or commercial secrets, and any acts of bribery or bribe-taking. The information can be submitted by e-mail: pasitikejimo.linija@ kaunoenergija.lt or by filling out the notification form published on the company website (www.kaunoenergija.lt/korupcijos-prevencijoskontaktu-forma). Full confidentiality and assurance of anonymity of the data is guaranteed (although, applicants are invited but not forced to provide contact information). Compliance with corruption prevention requirements and standards is an integral part of the company’s business ethics, and the Corruption Prevention Policy is applicable to all company representatives, subsidiaries, contractors, subcontractors, suppliers and intermediaries. 103-3 Evaluation of Evaluation of the management approach is not formally carried out, the management but improvements are considered whenever issues are raised by users of approach this process. For this category of 103-3 disclosure reporting, the company remains committed to developing a more effective method of encouraging and collecting evaluation feedback. The GRI: 103 Management Approach applied to GRI 302: Energy; GRI 305: Emissions; and GRI 307: Environmental Compliance. 103-1 Explanation of Three GRI 300 Environmental material topics have been combined the material for this disclosure (as per GRI 103 general guidance clause 1.1). Due to the particularity of activities the company uses a lot of topic and its electricity and water and has high emissions into the air. The saving boundary of energy and its resources is very important for the company’s economic performance. Environmental compliance is crucial if the company wants to maintain its commitment to the environment, to stay compliant, and to continue its high level of transparency in reporting such actions. 14 GRI 103: Management Approach (2016) Emissions and environmental compliance have an impact wider than local company sites. Therefore, the boundary for impacts for these material topics is within all company sites as well as throughout the whole country. 103-2 The management Although the company does a good job of managing the environmental approach and its material topic within the company, it could still improve its management approach in relationships with clients / service providers outside the components company. Internally the management systems in place to record and report on environmental impact are very strong. There is a special certified environmental laboratory installed to manage, collect, and process all relevant environmental data on company activities. Links to all decision making for these material topics are referred to in disclosure 102-18 (Governance Structure) and all links to the principles that make up the company policies are in disclosure 102-16 (Values, Principles, Standards and Norms of Behaviour). For targets and issues related to emissions, the company is guided by the following: • Kyoto Protocol • Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) and environmental constraints of Helsinki Convention • European Parliament and Council Directive 2001/80/EB of regulating energy emissions • Lithuanian environmental normative document LAND 43-2013 for the use of natural resources, and emissions from air pollutants into the environment • Lithuanian special requirements for large combustion plants • Lithuanian emissions rates from average combustion plants The company pays taxes for atmospheric and water pollution and if allowable emission rate limits or annual limits are exceeded, the company must pay the relevant fines under Lithuanian laws. The company’s laboratory for measurement of its stationary air pollution sources has a permit issued by the Lithuanian Environmental Protection Agency. This allows the laboratory, on behalf of the company and its group subsidiaries, to continuously monitor emissions into the atmosphere from stationary sources, and to make sure they do not exceed the permissible limits established within the integrated pollution prevention and control permits. Six of our suppliers’ boiler-houses use biofuels which contributes towards reducing atmospheric pollution. Small internal improvements, such as using recycled or environmentally friendly paper to print the company’s annual report and financial statement on, are easy to implement. The company chooses to not print its sustainability report and instead, encourages e-downloads (unless events we attend require handout copies for participants). Improvements to our relationships with larger technical service providers, whose contracts are regulated based on national guidelines, are more difficult to make. 103-3 Evaluation Evaluation of the management approach is not formally carried out. of the However, the management approach is systematically linked to the company’s commitment to non-financial reporting. The company does management encourage feedback and suggestions through employee or client feedback. approach For this category of 103-3 disclosure reporting, the company remains committed to developing a more effective method of encouraging and collecting evaluation feedback. CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 15 The GRI: 103 Management Approach applied to all nine GRI 400: Social material topics. 103-1 Explanation of Nine GRI 400: Social material topics (see 102-47 above) have the material been combined for this disclosure (as per GRI 103 general guidance clause 1.1). topic and its The company is strong on employee relations and wants to boundary provide regular reports on progress made in the health and safety issues for the company and its employees. Qualification and technical improvement of employee skills is equally important to the company, and in support of this, the company promotes and supports an annual programme of different types of courses and trainings, seminars and conferences for employees to participate in. The company respects the principles of gender equality, nondiscrimination, and freedom of association and collective bargaining agreements are automatically part of company policy (as is the outlawing of child labour and forced labour in the company). Public policy is important because we provide a public service and are part of the city municipality services offered to the public, and therefore our public policies need to reflect our public profile. The company follows a strict regime of compliance to health and safety regulations because it is tantamount to the services we provide, the people who provide them, and those who use them. The boundary for impacts remains mainly focused on local and regional sites, along with all stakeholders within these areas. 16 GRI 103: Management Approach (2016) 103-2 The management Internally the company has a strong management approach for approach and its social and health and safety issues related to employees. This includes a collective agreement for all employees, an employee’s health and safety components service, a Health and Safety Committee and established procedures for employees to voice their concerns, suggestions, or grievances. Links to all decision making for these material topics are referred to in disclosure 102-18 (Governance Structure) and all links to the principles that make up the company policies are in disclosure 102-16 (Values, Principles, Standards and Norms of Behaviour). The Work Safety Department has three staff: two for safety issues and one for medical issues. They follow and implement regulations as laid down by national state institutions and there are regular articles and campaign notices related to health and safety issues posted on the company intranet and notice boards for employees. Regular workplace inspections are carried out on company sites where employees are working, as well as company sites where non-employees are working. New employees are provided with instructions on basic health and safety company policies. Those working in manual roles are provided with a safety supervisor during the initial employment starting period. Special emphasis is paid to improving the qualifications of employees through their placement on specialist work-related training programmes run by either government institutions or professional associations and these take place annually. A trade union operates in the company and there were 130 members as of 31 December 2019. Both the trade union and individual employees are free to enter associations and negotiate collectively for better working conditions or pay. In 2019 and in previous years, the company did not record any violation of the principles of gender equality and non-discrimination. There were no cases of child or forced labour in 2019 nor the previous years in the company. With our policy on this issue, we can be sure of not having any cases in future reports. 103-3 Evaluation Evaluation of the management approach is not formally carried out. However, the management approach is systematically linked to the of the company’s commitment to non-financial reporting. The company does management encourage feedback and suggestions through employee or client feedback. approach For this category of 103-3 disclosure reporting, the company remains committed to developing a more effective method of encouraging and collecting evaluation feedback.

Although the company has a proven anticorruption policy that includes a mechanism for assessing corruption risk factors, risks related to defining all types of corruption, responsibilities and roles, the specific corruption number and percentage of corruption-related risk factors has not been assessed so far. As no specific corruption risk assessment has been carried out so far, no significant dangers related to corruption have been identified. The company is working to define a clear corruption risk assessment procedure. 18 Topic Specific Standards: GRI 200 Economic 205-2 Communication The company has a Corruption Prevention Policy, approved in and training February 2017 and published on its website: www.kaunoenergija.lt/wpcontent/uploads/AB-Kauno-energija-ir-jos-dukteriniu-imoniu-korupcijosabout antiprevencijos-politi.pdf. It also provides a clear statement of its position on corruption corruption and what it is doing to help prevent it happening; this is also on policies and the company website: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendroves-veikla/korupcijosprocedures prevencija. All 100% of the governance bodies (19 members) have been notified of the organization’s anticorruption policies and procedures, as has 100% of the workforce (all 402 employees) across all work categories. In addition, all contractors and suppliers participating in public procurement procedures are made fully aware of the company’s anticorruption policy and procedures on a compulsory basis. In total, 100% of our suppliers (11 major suppliers and 757 smaller suppliers detailed in disclosure 102-9) are informed of the company’s anticorruption policy. Compliance with the Corruption Prevention Policy is an integral part of our business ethics, and as such, it is fully applied to representatives (intermediaries) of the company. The regions covered by all of the above are as described in disclosure 102-4. In 2019 the company adopted a ‘Gift Policy’ covering the procedure of receiving, giving and dealing with Gifts. It must be respected by all employees of the company, regardless of position. In order to avoid possible conflicts of interest or possible misunderstandings, a description of procedures for receiving, giving and dealing with gifts is provided on the company’s website: www.kaunoenergija.lt/bendroves-veikla/apiebendrove/dovanu-politika/. 205-3 Confirmed No cases of corruption were identified in, or reported to, the company incidents of during 2019. corruption and action taken CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 19 Topic Specific Standards: GRI 300 Environmental GRI 302: Energy (2016) 302-1 Energy consumed The company is a producer of heat energy, so the largest part of within the electricity is consumed for the production and supply of this. Information on total fuel consumption from renewable and nonorganisation renewable sources is available in full in section 6.1 of the company’s annual report. Solid biofuel and natural gas account for 99.75% of fuel consumption. The company purchased and consumed 13,617,942 kWh of electricity internally in 2019. Total internal energy consumption within the company and its subsidiaries in 2019 was 12,911,916 kWh with the remainder – 706,026 kWh – resold and used under a utilization contract. The electricity consumption internally was distributed as follows: Internal needs For heat production and supply 2 107 994 kWh 11 509 948 kWh In 2019 the company did not produce steam and its cooling sales represent zero kWh and is therefore not included in this report. 20 Topic Specific Standards: GRI 300 Environmental 302-2 Energy consumed outside the organisation 302-3 Energy intensity Omission of full disclosure as allowed under GRI Standard 101: 302-4 Reduction clause 3.2.

From this data, we can report that the total direct emissions from the company’s heat production sources in 2019 was 12,644 metric tonnes CO2 equivalent, with gases included in these calculations being CO2 only (the biological emissions of CO2 in metric tonnes are not counted in CO2 equivalents). The base year of the calculation is applied based on the individual production sources and is chosen due to the higher median of activity data (reports and justifications are available from the Lithuanian Environmental Protection Agency (http://oras.gamta.lt/cms/index). According to the law, only the emissions of boiler houses that are more than 20 MW capacity are calculated. The company owns five boiler houses that are more than 20 MW capacity. The baseline year of calculation of 2005-2008 is used for Petrašiūnai power plant (5,947 tonnes of CO2), the boiler houses at Pergalė (2,038 tonnes of CO2) and Garliava (112 tonnes of CO2). For the boiler houses at Šilkas (3,227 tonnes of CO2) and Jurbarkas (1,320 tonnes of CO2), the baseline year of calculation of 2009-2010 is used. CONSOLIDATED SUSTAINABILITY REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GRI STANDARDS 2019 21 The source of the emission factors and the reference to the global warming potential (GWP) rates used (as well as standards, methodologies, and calculating tools) are all taken from within the following articles and regulations: • Directive 2003/87 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council • Commission Regulation No 600/2012 • Commission Regulation No 601/2012 • Standard ISO 14065 Actual total GHG emissions/t CO2 equivalent from the company’s heat production facilities from 2013 to 2019 are as follows: Year 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 GHG Emissions 36 042 32 711 8 607 8 480 8 918 21 008 12 644 Currently, no other scope 1 emissions data is collected by the company. 305-2 Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions Omission of full disclosure as allowed under GRI Standard 101: 305-3 Other indirect clause 3.2. Currently, the company does not have the methodologies, assumptions and/or calculation tools in place to collect and fully (Scope 3) GHG report on these disclosures, but it is endeavouring to improve the emissions necessary procedures. 305-4 GHG emissions intensity 305-5 Reduction of GHG Greenhouse gas emissions decreased significantly from 21,008t emissions CO2 in 2018 to 12,644t CO2 in 2019. The reason for this decrease was due mainly to a reduction in demand at the Petrašiūnai power plant, and competition between heat producers. In addition our Jurbarkas boiler-house burned more biofuel instead of natural gas, so it also affected the total emissions figure. The gas included in the calculation is CO2 only. The company’s air pollution abatement initiatives involve public awareness campaigns to raise awareness of energy-saving measures. However, if the air temperature drops drastically, the company can do little and must produce more heat. Information on key numbers, standards, methodologies, or computational tools is provided in section 305-1 above. 305-6 Emissions of Omission of full disclosure allowed under GRI Standard 101: ozone-depleting clause 3.2.
