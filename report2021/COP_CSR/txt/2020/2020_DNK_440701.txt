Managing Director Oriental China Henrik Poulsen SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 MADE BY 4 ORIENTAL INTRODUCTION ABOUT ORIENTAL GROUP Oriental is a Danish founded garment company that has assisted retail customers in Europe in their design and production process since 1994. We operate from our offices in Aarhus, Denmark and Suzhou near Shanghai in China, and since 2011 we have also operated from our fully-owned manufacturing factory in China. Besides our own factory, Great Garment, we also work with subfactories in China and India. At Oriental we strive to offer the best services for our clients. This is done through our in-house design team with inspiration from European latest fashion trends.

Oriental is committed to operate as a responsible corporate citizen and Corporate Social Responsibility is firmly rooted in our business approach and values. We believe that our CSR activities are examples of how we impact the world around us in a positive way. All of our CSR activities related to our supply chain in China and India are managed from our office in Suzhou, China and all CSR activities fall under the responsibilities of our Chief of HR, Finance and CSR. We have experienced an increasing level of interest and requirements from our customers towards CSR and specific requests and certifications through the last year. We find this very positive and are happy to guide and help our customers. CSR ACTIVITIES UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT The United Nations Global Compact tackles human rights, labour conditions, the impact on the environment and ethical business practices. Their ten principles are universally recognized. We at Oriental aim to embrace, support and follow this framework of core values within our sphere of influence. By September 2015 UN determined 17 new word goals concerning sustainable development. The new world goals has a broad perspective which covers issues such as ending poverty and hunger, improving health and education, protecting the oceans and forests. The 17 new world goals are directed towards both rich and underdevelopment countries and aims to have everybody join forces to create a better future for both people, animals and planet. 8 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 MADE BY ORIENTAL OUR COMMITMENT The journey towards a more sustainable future is well on it’s way for Oriental. As a company we support all 17 world goals, but have chosen to highlight and primarily focus on three goals, through which we believe we can influence and differ the most. The three goals are: We believe that a good health is the key to having happy and efficient employees. We had all our staff in our Denmark office participate in a first aid course. All employees at our China office had first aid training. Furthermore we offer all Danish and Chinese employees health insurance and do our best to offer fresh fruit and a good working climate for all. At Oriental we are happy to say that the average payment has increased from 2014 and to 2019. Besides our own factory, which is located in China, we are working with several other factories. These factories are selected on the basis of a wish to establish a partnership between them and Oriental. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 MADE BY 9 ORIENTAL OUR COMMITMENT BSCI – BUSINESS SOCIAL COMPLIANCE INITIATIVE As a member of the European organization BSCI, we are dedicated to improve social compliance across our supply chain in line with the BSCI Code of Conduct to ensure our suppliers take social responsibility seriously. We do this through a comprehensive monitoring and QC system. The BSCI Code of Conduct is built on the most important international labour standards protecting workers’ rights taken from the International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises and the UN Global Compact. We strive to have our producers improve from audit to audit, but even though we support them in their work none of our producers have improved between the last audit and the audit before that. All our producers are currently audited with a C. The rating C is an acceptable rating and cannot be given if more than 2 performance areas are rated as D’s. Looking at the overall representation for BSCI audited producers in China more than 80% is audited with a C. The main cause of our producers “C” rating is to be found in performance area 6 concerning decent working hours. Statistics made on all Chinese BSCI audited producers show that it is performance area 6 which has the overall lowest rating. This can to some extent be explained by the Chinese working culture. This is not being said to minimize or neglect the importance of having decent working hours or to disregard the responsibility Oriental has towards our employees at our own factory and the partners we work with. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 MADE BY 10 ORIENTAL OUR COMMITMENT SUSTAINABLE MINDSET At Oriental and in the world the awareness and respect of sustainable fabrics grows. Therefore we strive in Oriental to do our utmost in making nice fabrics and products with the lowest level of enviromental impact by working with below sustainable fabrics Recycled polyester Recycled polyester is made out of recycled PET plastic helps reducing the plastic waste. PET is the material you find in clean plastic bottles. Organic cotton Organic cotton is without the use of any synthetic chemicals as pesticides and fertilisers. The production sustains the health of soils, ecosystems and people by using natural processes rather than artificial inputs. GOTS certified cotton Global Organic Textile Standard is the most comprehensive international textile certification and stands for the leading textile processing of organic cotton fibres. Compliance to that is a multileveled process including manufacturing, packaging, labeling, trade, and distribution within ecological and social criteria.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 MADE BY 11 ORIENTAL OUR COMMITMENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT CHEMICAL TESTING The production of fabrics and accessories in the garment industry requires the use of chemicals, some of which can be harmful to our health and the environment. Therefore it is absolutely necessary to take a responsible approach to handling chemicals. • At Oriental we work in accordance with the European REACH specifications and legislation and conduct random chemical testing validated by internationally recognized third party testing organizations such as Intertek, SGS and Bureau Veritas. • We pay special attention to the selection of dyes and chemical auxiliaries and ensure that products are free of hazardous substances such as azo dyes, formaldehydes, pesticides and toxic heavy metals. • We have updated our Supplier Manual to include the newest REACH specifications and our suppliers are educated to meet these standards, we follow a detailed random testing of fabrics and accessories schedule. • We are proud to be able to provide our customers with the option to purchase OEKO-TEX100 products from us and as a result avoiding the use of harmful substances in the garment production. ENVIRONMENT In Oriental we acknowledge the importance of environmental concerns. We put constant focus on integrating environmental friendly procedures and progress in our own production and in our supply chain. We promote: • Responsible purchasing: We only work with suppliers that use environmentally friendly chemicals and observe environmentally friendly processes, including how they dispose of wastewater. • Reuse and recycle: We reuse and recycle wherever possible to minimize our waste. We purchased a cutter to minimize fabric waste and use both sides of paper when we print. We collect cartons, papers, PET bottles, aluminum cans and fabric and send them to be recycled. These values are incorporated in both our Chinese and Danish office. • We strive to use the minimum of electricity, so therefore we have changed all our office light to LED lights. • We strive to run a punctual production so we can send garments by sea freight and there by keep the CO2 emission at the lowest possible level. • Clean work environment: Oriental ensures a clean, hygienic working environment for all employees. SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2020 MADE BY 12 ORIENTAL OUR COMMITMENT ORIENTAL STAFF In Oriental we acknowledge that one of our main strengths is a dedicated and highly resourceful staff, whom we strive to support and advance in all the ways we can. We provide an employee handbook to make company policies transparent to all. Furthermore we provide a daily lunch meal based on healthy and nutritious food and we provide air-condition both in summer and winter to assure a comfortable work climate in our China office. Oriental seeks to take action to provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified employees and we are open to all ethnic groups. We have also managed to complete 5S program. This program is being represented with below 5 Japanese words to describe the steps of a workplace organization process: 1. Seiri (Sort), 2. Seiton (Straighten, Set), 3. Seiso (Shine,Sweep), 4. Seiketsu (Standardize), 5. Shitsuke (Sustain) In simple terms, the 5S methodology helps a workplace remove items that are no longer needed (sort), organize the items to optimize efficiency and flow (straighten), clean the area in order to more easily identify problems (shine), implement color coding and labels to stay consistent with other areas (standardize) and develop behaviors that keep the workplace organized over the long term (sustain). HEALTH & SAFETY The OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises lists health and safety as one of their focus areas under which it is stated that the multinational enterprise should promote the workers’ awareness of and compliance with health and safety policies through dissemination and training programmes. In line with this we in Oriental had all employees in our Danish office in Aarhus go trough a first aid course to ensure that all employees are capable of giving help if any form of accident should accrue or if any member of staff should suffer from sudden illness. All members of our Chinese staff had first aid training. Our concern for our employees health is a high priority which also involves the daily lunch meal and indoor working climate in our China office. We provide all employees with health insurance and in 2016 we moved to a new and bigger office in China. This has created much better space and conditions for our employees. To accommodate the difficulties some of our employees experienced with the move, we offer transportation back and forth from the office. Health and safety is also a high priority in our Danish office as well with focus on a good indoor climate, ergonomic work positions and free fruit. Also we have established and organized Annual Fire Drill in Suzhou to ensure everyone have the common senses to deal with the fire. ANTI CORRUPTION In Oriental we do not engage in business relations with customers or suppliers where corruption, bribe or personal relations and gifts are necessary to drive business. No employee is allowed to take bribe, we have zero tolerance to fraud, bribe and theft and if such is detected it will lead to immediate termination of the employment. The anti-corruption guidelines have been incorporated in our management guidelines.
