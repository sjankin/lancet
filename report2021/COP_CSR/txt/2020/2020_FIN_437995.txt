For sustainability and environmental improvement, we run the policy through an Environmental Roadmap (shown on page 51). Our aim is to use energy, as well as other utilities, as efficiently as possible. Energy efficiency plays a key role particularly in our production and logistics. As part of our renewed strategy, we aim to reduce the carbon footprint of Neste’s production ahead of the EU’s climate and energy targets. In October, we announced a new long-term agreement on wind power with Fortum. The total capacity of the agreement is more than 60 MW, and the energy produced will correspond to around 20% of the electricity consumption at the Neste Porvoo and Naantali sites. The wind power deliveries are expected to begin in early 2021.

First, we discuss our approach and developments in human rights. Second, we cover key developments related to human resources, leadership, and our employees. Human rights In 2019, our human rights gap assessments continued. One of the key development areas for our sustainability in recent years has been strengthening our human rights approach. We respect the human rights of our employees, the workers in our value chains, and those affected by our operations. In 2019, we continued implementing our key human rights activities in alignment with the Neste Human Rights Commitment and Principles, which was first introduced in 2015. In July 2018, we initiated human rights due diligence (HRDD) workshops and gap assessments of three internal units and departments, based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). The gap assessments were concluded in 2019. Based on the gap assessments and analyses, an action plan was created for each business unit with focus areas for improvements. Implementation of the action plans began in 2019.

Comparable operating profit eliminates both the inventory valuation gains/losses generated by the volatility in raw material prices and changes in open derivatives, and better reflects the company’s underlying operational performance. Also, it reflects Neste’s operational cash flow, where the change in operating profit caused by inventory valuation is mostly compensated by changing net working capital. Items affecting comparability are linked to unpredictability events of a significant nature that do not form part of normal day-to-day business. They include among others impairment losses and reversals, gains and losses associated with the combination or termination of businesses, restructuring costs, and gains and losses on the sales of assets. Only items having an impact of more than EUR 1 million on Neste’s result will be classified as items affecting comparability.
