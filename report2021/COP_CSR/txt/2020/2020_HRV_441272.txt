Individual companies within KONČAR Group have contracted hedge exposure to interest rate risk in contractual relations with foreign currency payments. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a counterparty defaulting on contractual obligations resulting in financial loss. KONČAR Group has adopted a policy of dealing exclusively with creditworthy organisations thus mitigating risks of financial loss arising from defaults. KONČAR Group uses data and opinions obtained from credit rating agencies, the Chamber of Commerce and other publicly available financial information on companies’ financial status and uses its own data base to rate major customers. KONČAR Group risk exposure and changes in credit ratings of partners are continuously being monitored. As a principle, contracts are entered into only with creditworthy partners when appropriate payment insurance instruments are obtained (L/C, guarantee, etc.). Exposure to credit risk is affected mainly by individual characteristics of each customer. KONČAR has established impairment loss allowance as an estimation of incurred losses in respect of expected losses from receivables and investments. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk reflects the inability to meet financial obligations as they mature. Risk management is a responsibility of the individual Management Boards of KONČAR Group companies. KONČAR Group has managed this risk by continuously monitoring estimated cash flow, comparing and adjusting it to the actual revenue and expenses. Overall, there has been no significant exposure of the KONČAR Group to liquidity risk.

The project is being developed under the Horizon 2020 program, and its aim is to provide a safe interaction between humans and robots in flexible logistics centres. For this purpose, hardware and software are being developed for safety vests designed to protect the wearer from any injuries when entering a Remote meter and sensor reading SenzoriKA project warehouse or from any other unacceptable interaction with robots. KONČAR – Electronics and Informatics in partnership with Transmitters and Communications Ltd and the Town of Karlovac have entered into a pilot project “Remote meter and sensor reading SenzoriKA project”. The project will include the implementation of a smart city test system with data visualization and distribution for city operated companies, which will allow the collection of data on the consumption of all energy sources and water, as well as the The SafeTRAM project information about air quality and temperature, waste collections and parking space availability.

This is especially important as our GRI 304-2 products and facilities are often delivered to areas of high biodiversity (rivers, lakes). There have been no incidents of the loss of biodiversity due to our products thus far. In accordance with the Precautionary Principle, when intervening in the environment, components of environment should be used sparingly and managed in such a way so as to take into consideration possible reuse of natural and material resources, preventing any environmental pollution, preventing waste generation and possible adverse effects on the environment, to the greatest extent possible. In addition, any intervention in the environment must be planned and carried out with the minimal possible environmental impact, taking into consideration prudent use of natural resources and energy. In order to prevent any risks and harm to the environment, when planning and implementing any project, all defined environmental protection measures should be adhered to, such as: use of good practices, use of products, equipment and devices, production processes and systems of maintaining designed parameters of the facility, which have the least adverse impact on the environment.
