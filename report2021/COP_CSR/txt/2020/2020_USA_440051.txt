This year’s report is titled One Company, One Purpose, One  ABOUT OWENS CORNING World, which reflects Owens Corning’s unified commitment to leading the way in sustainable practices in our industry and the communities in  SUSTAINABILITY: OUR APPROACH. which we serve. This report not only covers the continued progress we OUR ASPIRATIONS. have made toward our 2020 goals, but it also allows us an opportunity to discuss our ambitious slate of 2030 goals and the strategies we will use to achieve them. As our work to prepare this report comes to its conclusion, people everywhere are contending with the spread of COVID-19. The challenges we are facing in these uncertain times serve as a reminder that we are all connected, our actions matter, and the need to care for the people around us and the planet that sustains us has never been greater. We are releasing our report as planned, not because we have all the answers, but because we are committed to our aspirations and to delivering the long-term global impact of our goals. We believe that the work needed to achieve our goals is urgent for all our stakeholders, and we need to keep the future in focus even while we work through the needs of the present. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 1 INTRODUCTION The goals we have set to achieve by 2030 are built on three key pillars:  Expanding our product handprint. Increasing the positive impacts that our products have on the world.  Reducing our environmental footprint. Limiting the negative impact our operations have on the environment.  Increasing our social handprint. Ensuring that people are safe and live with health, happiness, and human dignity. We believe that focusing our efforts through the lens of these three pillars, guiding our operations and policies, we will achieve our vision of being a net-positive force in the world. This sustainability report is structured around 16 Sustainability Materiality Topics that our stakeholders have indicated are most meaningful to them, and we have arranged the topics based on their relevance to these pillars. We have prepared our report in accordance with the GRI Standards: Comprehensive option. This is the more extensive option for GRI reporting, requiring additional disclosures on our strategy, ethics and integrity, and governance. This report features independently verified data and descriptions of our efforts to uphold our commitments to sustainability. Narrative information is included in the chapters, while select supporting data is found in appendices at the end of the report. In Appendix J, we have included an index for the GRI Standards that are addressed in the report. New this year, readers will also find indices reflecting information we’ve included in response to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) reporting requirements. We hope you find this report to be a valuable resource as you discover the many ways Owens Corning is working hard to make sustainability central to everything we do, and our determination to be guided by the needs of present and future generations. We only have one planet, and we are acting as one company to make its protection our one purpose. Thank you for your interest in our progress on this sustainability journey.

That puts sustainability right at the heart of our company and core to our business success. It’s our guiding aspiration to be a net-positive company, where our handprint (the positive impacts of our people and products) exceeds our footprint. In these pages, we present data and examples that describe our approach to fulfilling that aspiration. Owens Corning began its sustainability journey nearly two decades ago and reporting each year on our progress is an important part of our commitment. This year, we report on our 2020 sustainability goals, which we set in 2010. We are also introducing our 2030 goals, which will guide our work over the next decade and beyond. During 2019, our executive team worked hard to develop and align on these ambitious goals, informed by the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals and with attention to current and future needs. The intent was not to set targets we know we can reach; instead, the emphasis is on key areas where work is needed to ensure a sustainable future for the world. In some cases, this has led us to adjust our approach going forward. For example, we’ve made significant improvements around primary energy, greenhouse gas, toxic air emissions, particulate matter, and water use, all of which are included in our 2020 goals. However, reducing our waste-to-landfill is an ongoing challenge and priority, from which we are not retreating. We continue to believe the right goal for us is to send zero waste to landfill. Our new long-term goals require us to do more and look beyond our own operations. Some address growing concerns, such as the need to ensure responsible use of water at all our facilities – especially those that are in areas where water is limited in quantity or quality. We’ve also set rigorous targets, such as reducing our greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with scientific guidance on what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5° Celsius. We will focus on learning and identifying needed innovations, like establishing growthenabling circular economy business models for our products, designing for reuse and recycling, and understanding the full impact of our operations and supply chain on biodiversity.

We will expand our product handprint and succeed as a sustainable enterprise by offering recognized and preferred products for sustainability. Our products and systems address trends in energy efficiency, product safety and sustainability, renewable energy, durable infrastructure, and labor productivity and efficiency. These are areas where the world needs innovation, and we are well positioned to grow our company by providing solutions to these critical, global challenges. For the first time, we’ve incorporated focused inclusion and diversity goals to ensure an environment where all employees at Owens Corning are valued and appreciated for the distinct voices they bring to the team. Our social sustainability goals also include community engagement, safety, and healthy living – all vital to helping people thrive. We are very proud of the progress we’ve made through the efforts of our 19,000 employees around the world. Throughout the year, we have received many accolades for our sustainability commitment and results, which reaffirm that we are on the right path. While we appreciate the recognition, most important to us is our continued progress toward achieving our longterm goals. Our employees are energized by each step forward, inspired by our aspirations, and excited by work that challenges the status quo. We invite you to learn more about our progress and our aspirations through this report and our website. We are grateful for the support and encouragement of our stakeholders as we continue our sustainability journey.

OUR ASPIRATIONS. Photo submitted by: Michele Mazza | Texas, U.S. For millennia, our planet has sustained human life. As our technological Multnomah Falls, Columbia River Gorge, capacities have seemed to increase exponentially with each recent decade, Oregon, U.S. and the abundance of natural resources has diminished dramatically, it is now incumbent upon humans to develop strategies to sustain our planet. As a worldwide leader in engineered materials for insulation, roofing, and composites, Owens Corning also seeks to lead the way in corporate sustainability efforts. Each step forward we have made on our sustainability journey has led us to realize how much more there is to do; at the same time, each accomplishment has encouraged us to keep striving, because no matter how ambitious the goals we set for ourselves seem, even greater progress is possible. Expanding the Parameters of Sustainability The need to minimize our overall environmental footprint has been central to our mission from the beginning of our sustainability journey. In the years since, we have also recognized that simply minimizing our footprint is no longer sufficient; we also need to maximize our handprint — developing products, processes, and initiatives that contribute to the well-being of the planet and all people. Over time, our definition of sustainability has also come to include expanding our social handprint, in which we seek to foster a spirit of inclusion and an appreciation of diversity in our workplaces and our communities. We want to see a society where people feel valued not despite their differences, but because of their differences. Above all, we understand that achieving these ambitions will depend on the actions we take today. Each time we build on our approach to sustainability, we do so with the expectation that these advances will be measured against a set of quantifiable metrics and specific goals. This provides us with the necessary accountability to ourselves and the stakeholders who place value on these efforts. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OVERVIEW 11 2030 GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS This year, we began the next leg of our TOP AREAS OF FOCUS sustainability journey, one that places us on the Our 2030 sustainability goals are described in more detail in the path to our 2030 sustainability goals.

Owens Corning is a global leader in insulation, roofing, and fiberglass composite materials. We provide innovative products and solutions that deliver a material difference to our customers. Our insulation products conserve energy and improve acoustics, fire resistance, and air quality in the spaces where people live, work, and play. Our roofing products and systems enhance curb appeal as they protect homes and commercial buildings. Our fiberglass composites make Our Materiality efforts align with thousands of products lighter, stronger, and more durable. With operations in 33 the following UN SDGs: countries, Owens Corning is global in scope. At the same time, we are human in scale, with 19,000 employees cultivating local and long-standing relationships with customers. Based in Toledo, Ohio, U.S., the company posted 2019 sales of $7.2 billion. Founded in 1938, we have been a Fortune 500® company for 65 consecutive years. At a time when organizations everywhere are expected to increase the sustainability of their operations, Owens Corning is committed to understanding our impacts and contextualizing what sustainability means for our company. Only then can we effectively set goals around sustainability and have confidence that these goals are aligned with what the world needs and with what our stakeholders expect from Owens Corning. As part of our sustainability efforts, this year Owens Corning completed an updated Materiality Assessment. Through this assessment, we identified our sustainability priorities at the global and regional levels, allowing us to set goals aligned with impact, prioritize the investments we are making in our future sustainability efforts, connect our organizational strategy with the stakeholder voice, and facilitate informed decision-making as we develop new ways to meet and exceed our goals for sustainability. As we look to 2030 and beyond, Owens Corning will use this assessment to ask: What kind of company does the world need us to be? It is important to consider this question in all that we do, and this assessment will provide an updated foundation for a continuous, nuanced, and informed approach to sustainability for our company. Owens Corning’s materiality assessment process, including methodology and implementation, was independently assured to a moderate level by SCS Global Services. For more information on the assurance process see About the Report, and for our verification statement please see Appendix F. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 14 OVERVIEW OF MATERIALITY A company uses a materiality assessment to determine and prioritize the specific topics that define its unique relationship with and approach to sustainability. The goal of any materiality assessment is to understand, through stakeholder engagement and company analysis, which sustainability areas are relevant to the company. This final relationship between a company and the specific areas of sustainability which are important (“material”) to the company is usually represented visually in a grid. There are many ways to approach a materiality assessment, but for Owens Corning’s materiality assessment, the approach was structured around the following actions: Assess previous Material Topics from past assessments and update them through research and stakeholder engagement to create the 2019 Material Topics. Identify internal and external stakeholders to engage regarding the 2019 Material Topics, and design inclusive and flexible engagement strategies. Engage with identified internal, external, indirect, and direct stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and research-based approaches. Build a model. Using data and stakeholder input on the 2019 Material Topics, create Materiality Matrices for the company’s global operations, as well as regionally specific Materiality Matrices.

We are committed to continuously identifying Owens Corning’s Material Issues and understanding the aspects of sustainability that are relevant across our value chain, so we can remain well positioned to drive a relevant and impactful sustainability strategy for the company. We conducted this Materiality Assessment in accordance with GRI principles for Materiality and Stakeholder Inclusiveness, as well as the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 2018 for Materiality, which was externally verified through an auditor. For more detail on what this entails, see the Assurance Statement from SCS Global Services in Appendix F. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 15 SUMMARY OF RESULTS Owens Corning’s 2019 Material Topics After reviewing the company’s prior work on sustainability and materiality, researching best practices, examining peer companies within our industry, and interviewing subject matter experts, the following Material Topics and their defined scopes were determined to represent Owens Corning’s 2019 Material Topics for Sustainability: Air Quality Management As a manufacturer, we have the opportunity to improve our processes and, in doing so, reduce our impact on air quality in the areas where we operate.

These material topics, which represent the priorities of Owens Corning’s stakeholders with consideration to the company’s impacts, are informed by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. The content of this report is organized by these topics to show the alignment between our efforts, our goals, and our stakeholders’ priorities. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 17 Owens Corning’s 2019 Materiality Grids The foundational assumption when structuring engagement for this Materiality Assessment was the need for the final visual products, the Materiality Matrices, to adhere to GRI standards. That means our Materiality Assessment considers the significance of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) impacts to the company, and the influence a Material Topic has on stakeholders in their assessments and decision-making. This type of matrix, where stakeholder influence and Environmental, Social, and Governance impact are the determinants to the axes, was selected because traditional matrices, which contrast internal and external stakeholders on the two axes, can oversimplify the result. In addition, such matrices are not as effective at communicating impact or influence, since both terms are present in both axes. Owens Corning elected to use the GRI Impact/Influence axes, as they allow us to check for alignment between the impact a Material Topic has for our company, and the priority our internal and external stakeholders place on that Material Topic in their organizational decision-making and personal expectations.

This decision needed to be one of the first ones considered in undertaking this assessment, as the regions needed to be considered in the resultant designs and techniques implemented.

Employees from the plant in Gous-Khroustalny, Russia, gave back to for our global workforce. One of the most interesting results of engaging the community with a landscaping project. stakeholders on Material Topics was the ability to gain tailored insights for our employee base. For example, we were able to see how our employees rated their priorities as individuals, and contrast that with their perception of which topics Owens Corning should prioritize. These differences in priorities provide valuable insight into our employees’ perceptions of the company, as well as their own values. In many cases, the observed differences fit with what one might expect between an individual and a company. For example, our employees saw Sustainable Growth as an area the company should be more focused on than they as individuals would be in their private lives. Similarly, while employees expect the company to prioritize innovative and sustainable products, this topic was not as directly relevant in the context of personal priorities. Because we were also able to analyze data by segment, we were able to derive insights about the sustainability priorities of different groups within our workforce. For example, it is notable that leadership’s broader view of the company’s operations affords them a potentially more holistic view of the company’s impact, reflected in priorities that differ somewhat from those of the general employee base. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 21 BREAKING DOWN THE PROCESS Topic and Scope Determination Over the course of the 2019 Materiality Assessment, Owens Corning identified 16 Material Topics for the company’s ESG and sustainability impacts. The 16 Material Topics for this assessment differ from the 15 topics previously considered, with different scopes (descriptions that provide more context of how the company engages with the Material Topic), names, and sometimes entirely new topics. A summary of the changes can be seen in the table below. 2018 REPORT’S MATERIAL TOPICS 2019 MATERIAL TOPICS SUMMARY OF CHANGE Community Impact Community Engagement Scope change Living Safely New scope, now distinct Topic Safety and Wellness Health & Wellness New scope, now distinct Topic Employee Experience New scope, now distinct Topic Employee Experience Inclusion & Diversity New scope, now distinct Topic Human Rights Human Rights Consistent Energy Efficiency & Sourcing Energy Efficiency Scope change Renewable Energy Greenhouse Gases and Toxic Air Air Quality Management New scope, now distinct Topic Emissions Combating Climate Change New scope, now distinct Topic Waste Management Waste Management Consistent Responsible Water Sourcing & Water Scope change Consumption Supply Chain Sustainability Supply Chain Sustainability Consistent Represented as component of Product Building Science Innovation & Stewardship Product Innovation Product Innovation & Stewardship Scope change New area, combining previous topics Recycled Material Circular Economy with designing for reuse & efficient use Product Sustainability of resources Growth Strategy & Prosperity Sustainable Growth Scope change Represented as component of Customer Experience Sustainable Growth Biodiversity New Material Topic Some noteworthy changes include the creation of new Material Topics for Inclusion & Diversity and Circular Economy, and discrete topics dedicated to Combating Climate Change, Health & Wellness, and Living Safely. Each of the new topics more accurately reflects the areas which define Owens Corning’s priority areas as they relate to sustainability, and they were decided upon as the result of research and internal stakeholder engagement. At this stage, we also developed scopes for the topics, so that we could ensure alignment across our stakeholders regarding the specific relationship and approach Owens Corning has with each Material Topic. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 22 Identifying and Grouping Stakeholders Using the 2019 Material Topics as our basis for engagement, the company identified internal and external stakeholders, seeking their input. After researching our previous assessment’s external stakeholder types, the company identified seven types of external stakeholder. The company engaged 42 external stakeholders across these seven types, with consideration of balance of stakeholders in varying global regions: EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS # OF STAKEHOLDERS SPECIFIC DESIGNATIONS Builders Customers 14 Business-to-Business Chemicals Minerals Suppliers 11 Services Direct Materials Transportation Universities Science & Academia 3 Research Groups Nonprofits global scale Community Groups 6 Nonprofits local groups Insulation Industry Industry Associations 3 Roofing Industry Composites Industry ESG Reporting and Data Groups Sustainability NGOs 2 ESG Tools and Guideline Groups ESG Ratings Agencies ESG and Sustainability Investor Groups 3 ESG Investment Groups For this Materiality Assessment, we took a wide and inclusive approach to involving internal stakeholders, allowing LOCATIONS employees in all roles to provide input to the process if they 1.

Over 360 Owens Corning employees from around the world responded, including a DEPARTMENT significant portion of leadership (identified as vice president Sustainability, Environmental, Health, and Safety and above). Combined with the external stakeholders engaged, this assessment incorporated the input of over 400 Finance individuals and organizations. Human Resources Information Services Legal Manufacturing Marketing Sales Science & Technology (aka R&D) Sourcing & Supply Chain Other 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 23 Designing Survey-Based Engagement To fit the GRI Materiality axes, survey questions were designed and approved by our sustainability team, as well as by Datamaran in their capacity as materiality subject matter experts. Surveys were planned to be administered online, to encourage replicable data and quick response times, which in turn would encourage a higher level of responses compared to an intensive type of outreach that would have the potential to push stakeholders away. Three types of survey were designed, based on the type of stakeholder the survey was reaching. For each question in each survey, the stipulation was that, of the 16 Materiality Topics to choose from, a stakeholder could select up to five. This allowed stakeholders to identify multiple areas they thought were accurate in responding to the question, but also forced stakeholders to prioritize. If a stakeholder could select everything that mattered to them, it would be difficult for us to assess the relative importance of the topics, and many stakeholders would select all 16, or a large proportion. Additionally, choosing up to five allowed for stakeholders who thought only one or two Topics were relevant to their answer to make that decision on their own, rather than choosing additional Topics that they did not feel fit their answer to meet the quota for Topic selection. Building the Final Models for Materiality Matrices As a global company, we wanted to understand how our stakeholders in different regions characterized their priorities and their expectations of Owens Corning. The results of our engagements with stakeholders were then categorized and organized to yield data in four contexts: data for our Overall (Global) operations, data for the Americas region, data for Asia Pacific, and data for Europe. These regional views were developed to allow for regional matrices. The survey and interview data were then merged with data from Datamaran, an online materiality analysis tool that allows for effective consideration of indirect stakeholder data, such as news media, social media, regulations, and peer companies. This data was collected for the four regions of our analysis as well, and combined with relevant regional data from the survey. The combined data was then applied to a grid that conforms to the recommended GRI axes for materiality grids: horizontal being “Significance of economic, environmental, & social impacts,” vertical being “Influence on stakeholder assessments & decisions”1 (see Summary of Results above). As a final step, an analysis of company impacts as they relate to the new Material Topics was carried out, to ensure alignment between current and potential future company impacts and the model.

In doing so, we can demonstrate that the company’s Material Topics are correctly assessing the impact of a topic in line with stakeholder influence and expectations, allowing the company’s goals to be assessed and ensuring that they are informed by the topics identified in the Materiality Assessment. The 2019 Materiality Assessment also more accurately reflects focus areas that we had not previously considered as stand-alone Material Topics, such as Inclusion & Diversity and the Circular Economy. While these areas have historically been important to Owens Corning, in this assessment both areas became distinct Material Topics. Both also have significant presence in the 2030 goals, which were finalized after the internal materiality results were communicated. This kind of alignment allows the goals to focus our efforts in proven impact areas. As we develop more Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and specific targets around our 2030 goals, the lessons provided in the Materiality Assessment (e.g., regional variances, comparative relevance, priorities by stakeholder type) can serve as an input to those processes as well.

Certain aspects of this Materiality Assessment were designed to be easily updated, which will help keep the assessment relevant. Additionally, the relevance and identified company impacts for Topics and their scopes will be periodically reviewed by our Sustainability team and subject matter experts to ensure that the scopes and terms still accurately reflect the company’s Material Topics for Sustainability. Another step toward keeping this assessment relevant, informed by AA1000 AccountAbility Stakeholder Engagement Standard (2015), is to identify internal and external stakeholders to whom we can communicate the results of this assessment, and seek feedback on Material Topics, as a cyclical stakeholder re-engagement model. To stay aligned and on track in the longer term, we are committed to conducting a completely new Materiality Assessment at least every five years.

We have identified specific areas of alignment between our material topics, our 2030 sustainability goals, and the SDGs, shown in the table that follows. Our approach to the 17 SDGs focuses on seven on which we have a direct impact or influence and which we have found to be highly material to our business. For an additional five SDGs, we have determined that we have direct or indirect influence, but they are not ranked as highly on our materiality matrix. Finally, for the five remaining goals, we have no notable influence or impact and they do not rank high on our materiality matrix, although we do still measure and report on some of the indicators. #6, #11, and #16 are areas in which we believe we have a lesser, and less direct, impact but which nonetheless reflect our values, policies, and outreach work — and may also have a significant impact on stakeholders’ decisions and perceptions about our company. Highlights on progress toward the seven SDGs where we believe we have the most direct impact are shown here, and discussed more fully in the report.

As stated in the Directors’ Code of Conduct, the term “sustainability” includes the concepts of personal safety, environmental compliance, product stewardship, and the environmental and social impact of our global operations and the products we make and sell. Directors are expected to provide oversight, guidance and direction on sustainability issues and opportunities that have potential impact on the reputation and long-term economic viability. We have a sustainability governance structure to discuss and make decisions on all issues related to economic, environmental and social aspects. The complete board of directors monitors Owens Corning’s progress regarding sustainability issues and assigns tasks to senior management. Specific responsibility for climate change and sustainability in general lies with the audit committee of the board of directors. According to the Audit Committee Charter: The committee is responsible to review the impact of significant regulatory changes, proposed regulatory changes and accounting or reporting developments, including significant reporting developments related to the principles of sustainability. The audit committee was chosen to be responsible for climate-related issues due to their additional responsibilities overseeing risk for Owens Corning. More about risk oversight can be found in the next section. Because sustainability is essential to our overall operations, Owens Corning created a chief sustainability officer role in 2007, reporting directly to the CEO. The CSO is accountable for our compliance with both legal and company environmental, safety, health, and sustainability requirements. Reporting directly to the CSO within Owens Corning is a sustainability organization with approximately 40 employees. These employees are accountable for product and supply sustainability, sustainability and reporting analytics, corporate toxicology, product stewardship, operations sustainability, and Environmental Health and Safety.

Vernon, Ohio, U.S. Optimal risk management and disclosure are high priorities for Owens CJ (at left) with Mt. Vernon colleagues Scott Corning. We identify and manage risks through a robust framework that Lance, Samer Yousef, and Jerry Statzer (left to comprehensively assesses risk across economic, environmental, and social right) at a volunteer event domains. We take a forward-looking and holistic approach to enable business decisions, and through calculated risks, we build long-term financial goals and shape a successful future. The audit committee of the board has primary responsibility for facilitating board oversight and management of key risks and financial exposures. Pursuant to its charter, the audit committee’s responsibilities include:  Reviewing annually, and receiving periodic updates on, our company’s identification of its key risks, major financial exposures, and related mitigation plans.  Overseeing our company’s management of key risks and major financial exposures that fall within the audit committee’s specific purview.  Ensuring that the board and its committees oversee our company’s management of key risks and major financial exposures within their respective purviews.  Evaluating periodically the effectiveness of the above-referenced process of oversight. Three board committees — compensation, finance, and governance and nominating — all review and evaluate risks associated with their respective areas. Each board committee provides reports concerning its respective risk management activities to the board, and the board considers and discusses such reports. Owens Corning also has a risk committee that is responsible for overseeing and monitoring our company’s risk assessment and mitigation-related actions. The risk committee is not a board committee; instead, it is a cross-functional corporate committee that includes members from the corporate audit, finance, legal, security, treasury, corporate development, IT, and business functions. It is the internal mechanism for identifying risks and mitigation strategies, as well as providing key updates to executive officers and the audit committee of the board. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 40 The risk committee’s responsibilities and activities include Review and Alignment of Risk the following: Mitigation Plan  Reviewing the Owens Corning Risk Register, which To identify new risks and update risks no longer considered is developed by the business functions.

The risk committee also reviews the mitigation actions and outputs for the annual cycle.  Providing at least an annual update to the audit committee of the board. Owens Corning follows several integrated and multidisciplinary processes for managing risks. PRIORITIZING Identification and Assessment RISKS Owens Corning’s business units use risk maps to proactively analyze risks and create business-specific risk registers. The risk registers are, in turn, used by the risk committee to create the corporate-level risk register. This enables business units and the risk committee to facilitate strategic and operational planning processes, while mitigating sustainability risks. Prioritization Our company prioritizes risks based on their placement ALIGNING in the risk register. The Y-axis of the risk map within the AND register is a measure of potential financial impact, and the REVIEWING X-axis represents the measure of probability of occurrence.

When it comes Kentucky Lake, Smithland, Kentucky, U.S. to issues of sustainability, though, the need to mitigate risk is even greater, as the stakes are especially high. Owens Corning’s commitment to optimal risk management also means we are working to serve as a net-positive force in the world, one in which our handprint far exceeds our footprint. Preserving the environment, combating climate change, and safeguarding human rights are all part of our strategy, one that helps provide a more secure future for generations to come. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 44 COMPLIANCE Owens Corning has set highly ambitious goals, because we believe the best way to make the world a better place is by striving to do more. That means embracing a “beyond compliance” mindset in our environmental, social, and governance efforts. Local, national, and international regulations and laws are all part of our framework, enhanced by guidance from relevant international organizations. The high value that we place on integrity is reflected in everything from the products we make, to the way we make them, to how we interact with our business partners and others. Photo submitted by: William K. Cook | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. (retired) Sunrise at Swiftcurrent Lake in Glacier National Park, Montana, U.S. CODE OF CONDUCT Our code of conduct is an extension of our corporate values and guides how we conduct business. It contains 10 guiding principles for ethical business conduct, which are designed to ensure that employees act with integrity and in an ethical manner, avoiding even the appearance of illegality or impropriety. Each principle is supported by one or more business conduct policies that detail compliance expectations. Our code of conduct and guiding principles are inspired by and aligned with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Anti-Bribery Convention. Owens Corning’s business conduct council and compliance committee have oversight and responsibility for worldwide compliance with these policies. Owens Corning’s general counsel and corporate secretary sit on both the business conduct council and the compliance committee. The assistant secretary to the board sits on the compliance committee. Both groups report results to the audit committee of the board, which provides oversight. Areas covered by the code of conduct and business conduct policies include, but are not limited to, the following:  Corruption and bribery.  Discrimination, including non-harassment.  Confidential information.  Data privacy.  Antitrust/anticompetitive practices.  Insider trading/dealing.  Environment, health, and safety.  Whistleblowing.  Human rights. In addition, the code of conduct includes expectations for integrity in business dealings, including gifts and entertainment, business travel, computer use, and social media, as well as the use of company assets. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 45 DATA PRIVACY Photo submitted by: Rafał Leśniewski | Trzemeszno, Poland We view data privacy as an element of personal safety and comply with global privacy Korakonissi, Zakynthos, Greece laws. To help ensure personal safety, we are committed to collecting, processing, and transferring personal data in a trustworthy manner worldwide. This commitment extends to all Owens Corning employees and our stakeholders. Owens Corning addresses data privacy by:  Minimizing data collection.  Protecting collected data.  Limiting access to personal information to personnel that need it (our systems owners and data handlers).  Providing system owners and data handlers with extensive training on the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Ensuring processes are in place to respond to personal data requests and to mitigate or address any privacy breach or other issues. We also continuously strive to strengthen our data privacy program. In the past two years, we worked on several fronts:  We expanded the reach of GDPR safeguards.  We raised data privacy awareness within our organization.  We developed our own global data protection standard.  We adapted our IT systems and platforms to reflect a “privacy by design” perspective.  When we acquire a company, we also assess that company’s IT environment and technical security systems to ensure that, going forward, data collection and processing comply with Owens Corning’s data protection policy. We have also implemented enhanced security measures designed to protect against the misappropriation or corruption of our systems, intentional or unintentional disclosure of confidential information, or disruption of our operations. Owens Corning received zero substantiated complaints of customer data breaches in 2019. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 46 ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE Owens Corning has policies and procedures in place to ensure that its operations are conducted in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, and that enable the company to meet its high standards for corporate sustainability and environmental stewardship. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous country-specific, regional, and local laws and regulations relating to the presence of hazardous materials, pollution, and protection of the environment, including emissions to air, discharges to water, management of hazardous materials, handling and disposal of solid wastes, and remediation of contaminated sites. Owens Corning applies an environmental management system (EMS) that helps us ensure compliance with environmental regulations. The EMS is based on the principles of ISO to all manufacturing facilities and helps us track progress toward our long-term sustainability goals, which require significant global reductions in environmental impacts beyond compliance. In 2019, our EMS for approximately 35% of our locations was certified to ISO 14001, which accounts for 50% of our employees. Additionally, approximately 42% of our locations were certified to the ISO 9001 standard for a QMS (Quality Management System) in 2019, representing approximately 61% of our employees. Environmental Control Owens Corning defines significant environmental actions as the total cost of fines or penalties equal to $100,000 or greater. There was one significant environmental action to report for 2019, in the amount of $1.5 million to resolve Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) liability associated with a Superfund site located outside Portland, Oregon, which we owned for three years in the 1980s. The company has not experienced a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures or competitive position as a result of environmental control legislation and regulations. Operating costs associated with environmental compliance were approximately $42 million in 2019. We continue to invest in equipment and process modifications to remain in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations worldwide. Regulatory activities of particular importance to our operations include those addressing air pollution, water pollution, waste disposal, and chemical control. The company expects passage and implementation of new laws and regulations specifically addressing climate change, toxic air emissions, ozone-forming emissions, and fine particulate matter during the next two to five years. New air pollution regulations could impact our ability to expand production or construct new facilities in certain regions of North America and around the globe. We continue to monitor these potential impacts on our manufacturing operations and ensure we have evaluated any new laws, regulations, and/or activities that could potentially have a material adverse effect on our results of current operations, financial condition, or long-term strategy. In support of these efforts, we continue to make progress in the reduction of our footprint globally.

As part of Storm Water Pollution Prevention and Spill Prevention Countermeasure and Control in the U.S., and according to local legal requirements, we train our employees on best practices for avoiding and addressing spills. Response procedures for managing spills, as well as other emergencies, are in place in our facilities. In the event of an incident, we recognize our responsibility to complete environmental remediation, maintain remediated sites, and provide funding support at multiparty disposal facilities. Since 2013, Owens Corning has had zero significant spills.

We know that in many cases, laws and regulations only mandate minimum requirements, and we are determined not to wait. We will continue to raise the bar for ourselves, based on what the world needs. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 49 TOTAL PRODUCTIVE MAINTENANCE Photo submitted by: Jennifer Payne | Memphis, Tennessee, U.S. TPM — Total Productive Maintenance — is the Owens Corning Edwin Luke explains the Training & management system for manufacturing productivity improvement and Development Pillar board during a TPM audit at the facility in Houston, Texas, U.S. a mindset that empowers all employees to proactively address issues that could cause losses. TPM works hand-in-hand with advanced manufacturing and process excellence initiatives to deliver world-class manufacturing performance in support of our growth strategy. Since about 2012, Owens Corning facilities have been working to implement TPM to improve the business as a whole. TPM is not simply a maintenance program, but rather a way of thinking and approaching work that engages all employees in maintaining, operating, and improving production and processes during their regular work. When everyone shares the responsibility for preventing injuries, defects, and losses, it benefits the company, our customers, and our workforce. Through TPM’s eight pillars, every Owens Corning employee can approach work with the TPM mindset, based on constant attention to abnormalities that could lead to issues. TPM is a continuation of the techniques we already use, like 5S and Standard Work. Through the TPM system, workers are trained to recognize when something needs to be corrected — and why — and empowered to take the necessary measures to correct it. This kind of thinking and proactive attention to potential problems often becomes a mindset that carries over into employees’ personal lives as well. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 50 STRATEGY AND APPROACH Photo: Focused Improvement workshop in Jackson, Tennessee, U.S. At Owens Corning, we are on a “march to zero” – zero accidents, zero defects, zero losses. We are striving to achieve perfect production at all our global manufacturing plants. As a comprehensive management system, one that encourages employees to be proactive and take preventive action, TPM goes a long way toward helping us achieve this ambitious goal. TPM includes eight pillars:  Training and development. Skills assessments identify gaps, and training and sharing of best practices improve skills in a practical and safe way.  Autonomous maintenance. By empowering teams to prevent or fix problems, we slow the deterioration of equipment and processes, and drive cultural and behavioral change.  Focused improvement. By identifying and quantifying losses throughout the plant, we can focus on prioritizing how the losses will be eliminated and assign the right resources to these tasks.  Planned maintenance. Combined with autonomous maintenance, planned maintenance enables us to be more proactive.  Early management. Eliminating losses and abnormalities in the design and development of new equipment, processes, and products reduces the time between development and launch and lowers life cycle costs.  Quality maintenance. Establishing and maintaining optimal equipment conditions helps prevent quality defects.  Office and administration. Activities that increase the quality, usefulness, and timeliness of information for internal and external customers lead to real improvements and align administrative resources with performance needs.  Environment, health, and safety. Combining corporate environmental, health, and safety (EHS) programs with TPM activities furthers the culture of safety among all employees. TPM is much more than a way to keep machines running smoothly. It is a way of thinking and approaching work that engages all employees in maintaining, operating, and improving production and processes. TPM is a total team effort, which we believe creates added value for our employees and our customers. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | OUR APPROACH 51 OUR TPM JOURNEY Since committing to TPM in 2016, we have made great strides in launching and implementing the approach throughout our global operations. Across all three businesses, our plants have declared their commitment to TPM. Every plant is at a different point on the journey, but each is moving with purpose and sharing TPM lessons across the network. All plants follow a strategic approach, starting with a preparation plan that focuses on daily management — the foundation of TPM. An analysis of baseline key performance indicators is incorporated in the preparation plan. This analysis is centered on safety, quality, delivery, cost, production, and morale, including management indicators that drive accountability and results. We survey employees to help plant leaders understand their teams’ readiness for TPM and to identify opportunities to enhance knowledge and improve skills. Based on this information and best practice examples, plants create training workshops and team-building opportunities appropriate to their stage in the journey.

It is also imperative that our handprint — the positive STEWARDSHIP impacts of our people and products — is larger than our footprint. To expand our products’ overall handprint, Owens Corning has several goals that we will pursue over the next decade.  SUSTAINABLE GROWTH We are committed to the principles of circular economy throughout the life cycle  SUPPLY CHAIN SUSTAINABILITY of our products. By 2030, we intend not only to increase the use of recycled and renewable materials in our products, but to design products that can themselves be recycled, reused, or repurposed instead of being landfilled. We also are committed to collaborating with our suppliers and customers to establish viable circular economy business models involving our materials, and increase transparency around the raw materials we use in our products. In addition, we will collaborate with these suppliers to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to purchased materials and services by 30% over the next ten years. Through these initiatives, we can help ensure our products’ sustainability as part of expanding our handprint. Our product stewardship process plays an important role in our development of sustainable products and solutions. We have conducted product stewardship reviews to evaluate the sustainability aspects of research and development projects, new products, and new processes. In 2019, a cross-functional team was chartered to expand on these efforts, and to propel action in the area of product sustainability in support of our 2030 goals. The team has two main objectives:  In 2020, the team is expected to integrate the principles of design for sustainability into Owens Corning innovation processes. It will benchmark tools used by best-in-class companies and align the principles to internal processes to allow for environmental and potential cost benefits, as well as an advantage in the market.  Beyond 2020, the team will expand on our current sustainability mapping tool and develop a process for evaluating current product impacts (baseline), while identifying the hot spots for improvement, setting goals for future product developments, and measuring the impact of future products on our 2030 sustainability goals.

We also worked to find outlets for our waste and byproducts, extending the value of our materials through secondary uses and supporting industry efforts to recycle our products, and the applications that use our products, at the end of their useful life. Product innovation is another aspect of our approach. From the outset of our sustainability efforts, Owens Corning has sought to increase the recycled content in our products whenever possible. Our fiberglass insulation typically contains anywhere from 53% to 73% recycled content. We also have a high level of post-consumer content in our light-density building insulation. Photo submitted by: Joshua Lyle | Memphis, Tennessee, U.S. Over time, it has become increasingly clear that these approaches won’t be Kentucky Lake, Smithland, Kentucky, U.S. enough, by themselves, to achieve the level of sustainability we intend. To achieve true sustainability in our products, everything about product design and manufacturing must be done with an eye toward anticipating its eventual end of life, so that it never ends up as waste. While this had not been explicit in our previous sustainability goals, it has become a centerpiece of our goals going forward – we must discover new business strategies, invent scalable Our Circular Economy efforts technologies, and create viable business models that deliver both environmental align with the following UN SDGs: and economic wins. 2030 GOALS FOR CIRCULAR ECONOMY Sustainability Materiality Definition: A circular economy is one in which By 2030: Establish viable circular economy business models involving our virgin raw materials waste, energy materials and how they are used by collaborating up and down the supply and emissions are minimized through chain, with customers, suppliers, communities, academics, policy makers, intelligent design, renewable and government entities, and other organizations. recyclable input, energy-efficient Increase recycled content and decrease virgin raw materials used in our production, and enabling the recycling products. of products at the end of their life cycles.

We acknowledge just how ambitious these goals are, and we realize they will require the participation of every stakeholder in our value chain, from suppliers to customers and end-users. However, we also recognize that to offer products that are selected for sustainable attributes, we must commit to a different approach. While there may be sustainability, cost, or legislative thresholds that reinforce the need to develop circular economy solutions, there can also be an economic value to these developments. It presents Owens Corning with significant innovation opportunities as we meet our ambition for materials to remain in the economy indefinitely. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT HANDPRINT 56 STRATEGY AND APPROACH PUTTING WASTE TO USE Relying less on raw materials is essential.

Another aspect of the circular economy model is for Looking at the component parts of a shingle, we see manufacturers to proactively accept more responsibility that there is value in each of them — its granules, glass, for customer waste. This can include waste created during sand, and filler. By deconstructing the shingle product, construction, subsequent fabrication, or installation, not we can extract the value from those components. Owens just at end-of-life.

This circular economy model has been in place for over 30 years, and it is an example we can look to as we develop our processes. At its peak in 2015, two million U.S. tons of recycled asphalt shingles were being used in paving, and although that number is down considerably, we are confident that with the right technical expertise, processes and products, it can be an important contributor to the circular economy. Of course, this 11 million U.S. tons of waste represents an industry-wide problem, which is why Owens Corning is working with the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association (ARMA) and the Asphalt Institute Foundation (AIF) to fund research and work towards solutions that benefit our company, our industry, and ultimately the planet. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT HANDPRINT 58 OUR 2030 ASPIRATION Every raw material or resource we extract for our products or processes will remain in the economy indefinitely. It starts immediately. It lasts far beyond 2030. MANUFACTURE USE RECYCLE GOING FORWARD We need to establish, expand, and scale viable business models, and develop the products and processes that will enable the circular economy. We are enhancing our product stewardship process, described in the next chapter, to help ensure that our innovations drive sustainability. Designing for recyclability and indefinite reuse is a critical step, and collaborating – and innovating – across the value chain is required. Owens Corning has committed to being part of this transformation, knowing that we can’t achieve our goals in this area without partnering effectively with everyone who interacts with our products.

Innovation means more than simply bringing new products to market; it means we are using the principles of product stewardship to develop products that are fundamentally safe and sustainable throughout their life cycle. From their design, creation, use, and eventual disposal, the products that we introduce must adhere to our guiding principles of sustainability. We also seek to continually improve the products we offer, both in their creation and in their contributions to the overall sustainability of the planet. Product sustainability and stewardship must shape our innovations to enable the circular economy. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT HANDPRINT 60 2019 PROGRESS 0N 2020 GOALS As we consider the work needed in the year 2020 and beyond, we are pleased to report consistent progress on the 2020 goals we have set.

As we develop new Milos, Greece products and processes, we provide value for our customers and shareholders. Every innovation we bring to market, furthermore, is an opportunity to address global environmental challenges while enhancing the quality of life for people everywhere. Innovation begins with our core businesses — Composites, Insulation, and Roofing — and continues through the development of new products across a growing range of key market segments. As we move forward, we listen to the needs of our customers and address growing global trends. It is this close collaboration that enables us to create solutions that drive our customers’ success and meet the changing demands of the marketplace. Increasingly, those demands include the need to address our human impact on the environment worldwide. To that end, our approach to innovation is rooted in our commitment to sustainability, which includes these goals:  To evaluate 100% of our new and significantly modified products for environmental, health, and safety impacts through our stringent stewardship process.  To evaluate potential life cycle impacts using our sustainability mapping tool within our gated innovation process. Our eleven Science & Technology Centers, located in key markets around the world, play a vital role in the development of solutions that meet customer needs and address global concerns regarding sustainability. Our annual Innovation Week, hosted at our Science & Technology Center in Granville, Ohio, brings together members of our global technical community for collaboration and learning. This year, the theme of “Accelerate” was applied to the week’s events, linking innovation to Owens Corning’s growth agenda. In addition to our annual poster session, where innovation teams present their projects in a “science fair” format to senior executives and employees, attendees met for an interactive two-day summit focused on defining the value proposition for innovation. The group discussed current strategic projects, product differentiation techniques and control points, and participated in skill-building workshops. The company’s top executives also attend an annual ceremony to honor the winners of the Innovation Awards. Teams win these awards in several categories, including sustainability. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT HANDPRINT 62 PRODUCTS THAT MAKE A MATERIAL DIFFERENCE Our commitment to delivering innovation that also provides sustainability advantages for customers extends across all our businesses. We achieve this by evaluating our products’ environmental and material health. Many of our insulation products are GREENGUARD® Gold Certified, meeting the most stringent standards on indoor volatile organic compound (VOC) emission levels. We are increasing the number of Health Product Declaration® (HPD) and Declare “nutrition labels” for our products, and are participants in and sponsors of the Embodied Carbon in Construction Calculator (EC3) tool. This tool is designed to help designers, and specifiers to make more informative choice when it comes to product selection. Roofing  Shingles that reflect the sun. Using a highly reflective granule technology that reflects the sun’s rays, “cool roof” shingles help reduce energy use by keeping roofs cooler and reducing air conditioning energy levels. Some of our cool roof solutions meet ENERGY STAR® requirements for solar reflectance. In 2019, we introduced eight new shingle colors with a minimum solar reflectance index of 20. The new colors provide options for darker colors and higher solar reflectance with the potential for cooling cost savings.  A more resilient roof system. Duration FLEX® is the only modified-asphalt shingle with SureNail® Technology, with nearly 1.5x the nail-pull strength and 10% better tear strength than standard shingles. It also features improved granule adhesion and meets the highest impact resistance rating. In 2019, we expanded manufacturing production to an additional facility.  Recyclable protective packaging. The European Union’s policy requires all plastic packaging in the EU market to be recyclable or reusable by 2030 to support the transition to a circular economy. Owens Corning is partnering with key players in lumber and steel to develop solutions through our expertise in polymer streams, with a goal of achieving these solutions by 2025. Insulation  Formaldehyde-free ceiling board. Working with a key customer, we changed to a formaldehyde-free formulation for the glass-reinforced material they use to make technical insulation for ceilings. The new chemistry delivers technical insulation products that are formaldehyde-free without compromising mechanical performance in hot and humid climates, where better insulation reduces energy spent on cooling. Additionally, the improved chemistry uses fewer chemicals and creates a stronger product.  Lighter-weight mineral wool products with higher performance. In 2019, we expanded our Thermafiber® mineral wool portfolio. Patent-pending technology enables lighter-weight products to deliver mechanical performance exceeding that of higher-weight/higher-density products. The innovation was inspired by building science that shows greater density does not necessarily correlate to improved mechanical performance. Reduced shipping weight saves fuel, and the lighter product is easier for contractors to handle safely.  More insulation per truckload. We reformulated some of our Thermafiber® batt insulation to enable more insulation to be packed in the same amount of space. Batt insulation is compressed when it is packaged, and expands when the Photos: Duration FLEX® shingles in black packaging is opened. That ability to recover its shape is an important performance sable (Top) Fiberglass insulation (Middle) feature of insulation. To fit more bags on a pallet, we needed to reformulate the Thermafiber® insulation (Bottom) product so that it recovers just as well as more loosely packaged insulation.

Employees are asked to examine the need for travel and to look for alternatives. We have adopted remote desktop sharing and have greatly increased the amount of video conferencing in lieu of business travel. Many plants now have video conference rooms available, and personnel at home offices increasingly take advantage of video conferencing technologies on their personal computers. To reduce business travel costs and emissions, employees also will bundle trips and visit multiple plants in the same area rather than making separate trips. Employees are also instructed to take intermediate or compact cars on business trips to limit emissions. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT HANDPRINT 91 GOING FORWARD Photo submitted by: Meren Tabora | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. Collaborating with our suppliers to achieve our sustainability Owens Corning employee at Parainen goals — and supporting them in achieving theirs — is key to our factory, Finland aspiration of becoming a net-positive company.

Our strategy revolves around developing innovative, energy-saving products (see Product Innovation & Stewardship) and implementing programs aimed at reducing our energy usage and shifting toward renewable energy sources. We have strong systems in place to track and monitor our performance against key energy-related indicators. Plants report performance on our goals and targets monthly to stay current on the data and to be able to spot variations that may require corrective action. We use various external platforms, including this sustainability report, to publicly disclose our environmental performance, and invite comments and feedback from all our stakeholders. At each of our plants, a designated energy leader oversees the implementation of energy management activities and helps identify areas for improvement. In addition, Owens Corning has energy managers who conduct assessments, facilitate Kaizen and Total Productive Maintenance activities, develop projects, and provide technical support. Several of our plants with medium and high energy usage also have energy teams that meet monthly.

In 2019, our weighted-average primary energy intensity was a 29% reduction from 2010. Overall, our reduction can be attributed to the conservation measures we have taken to significantly reduce energy consumption and improve plant efficiency. The inclusion of our wind power purchase agreement in our calculation improves the percentage of renewable energy we use, which has a lower factor when we calculate primary energy. Energy Consumption In 2019, Owens Corning decreased its overall consumption of direct energy by 2% from 2018. We reduced consumption of indirect energy by 7%. Direct energy includes the fuel usage in our operations. The indirect energy we use is electricity, steam, and district heating. ■ Direct Energy ■ Indirect Energy 2010 6,703,708 3,137,650 9,841,357 BASELINE 2011 7,178,565 3,321,289 10,499,855 2012 6,877,023 3,276,192 10,153,216 2013 7,098,095 3,397,289 10,495,384 2014 6,891,401 3,371,368 10,262,769 2015 6,692,479 3,310,318 10,002,797 2016 6,730,118 3,303,493 10,033,611 2017 7,030,962 3,412,966 10,443,928 2018 7,156,211 3,534,839 10,691,050 2019 7,013,806 3,275,012 10,288,818 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 97 Energy Intensity ■ Consumed ● Primary Energy Weighted-Average ● Consumed Energy Weighted-Average —— Primary Energy Weighted-Average Energy Intensity Percentage Intensity Percentage Intensity 2020 Goal 12 120 10 100 INTENSITY PERCENTAGE MEGAWATT HOURS 8 80 6 60 (IN MILIONS) 4 40 2 20 0 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 (BASELINE) Consumed Energy (MWh in Millions) 9.8 10.5 10.2 10.5 10.3 10.0 10.0 10.4 10.7 10.3 Primary Energy Weighted-Average 5.24 5.25 5.07 4.94 4.80 4.57 4.41 3.93 3.66 3.69 Intensity (MWh/MT of Product Produced) Primary Energy Weighted-Average 100 100 97 94 92 87 84 75 70 71 Intensity Percentage Consumed Energy Weighted-Average 3.44 3.46 3.29 3.17 3.07 2.93 2.89 2.77 2.82 2.79 Intensity (MWh/MT of Product Produced) Consumed Energy Weighted-Average 100 101 95 92 89 85 84 80 82 81 Intensity Percentage 2010 Indirect Energy Electricity 2019 Indirect Energy Electricity ■ Non-Renewable ■ Non-Renewable Electricity 82% Electricity 51% ■ Renewable ■ Renewable Electricity 18% Electricity 49% 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 98 Energy Conservation and Savings Since 2006, Owens Corning has implemented nearly 1,200 energy-use reduction projects in its facilities across the globe, which together have reduced usage by more than 1.35 million MWh.

We recognize the role of human activity on global climate change, and the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) around the world is an ongoing challenge. Understanding the importance of climate action means we must take seriously our role in the fight against climate change. To that end, we have been working to achieve a series of goals designed to lead us up to 2020, and we have established even more ambitious goals that will guide us in the decade to come. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 103 2019 PROGRESS ON 2020 GOAL Photo submitted by: Amanda Meehan | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. We are committed to reducing our footprint and have established 2020 GHG Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada emissions goals using 2010 data as the baseline.

Our company is focused on reducing GHG emissions related to our operations and activities, and our actions have always been informed by science-based methodologies. In recent years, our GHG reduction goal was designed to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming to less than 2° C above pre-industrial levels, consistent with our commitment to the Paris Agreement of 2015. In 2018, an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a follow-up report urging the temperature rise be held below 1.5° C to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. In keeping with this new, more stringent standard, we set our 2030 goal to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 50%, approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative. We are proud to be among the companies heeding the call for greater urgency and continuing to use the latest climate science in setting targets for GHG emissions reductions and measuring progress. When setting goals for emissions reduction in the past, Owens Corning has used weighted-average intensity targets, which set a target relative to an economic output such as revenue or production. As we adopt our new long-term goal, however, we will be shifting our GHG goal from reducing intensity to reducing emissions according to an absolute target, which refers to a set amount independent of other variables. We have historically measured intensity as a way to smooth out variation caused by market cycles; however, our science-based target now requires us to measure absolute emissions.

Paroc finished construction of a new energy-efficient line in Trzemeszno, Poland, in 2019 and the upgrade of the production technology supports our growth strategy for Central and Western Europe and further expands our current operational capabilities. We expect to reduce our CO2 emission by 75-80% with this line compared to a traditional coke-fired furnace line. Moreover, the new line’s Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) will reduce carbon intensity1 by roughly 10% for all Paroc Insulation in Europe.

Progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions will require us to continue building our understanding of all sources of GHG in our operations — including the Scope 3 emissions related to our supply chain. We recognize that our supply chain contributes to our footprint; as we strive to reduce our emissions and the embodied carbon in our products, we need close collaboration with our suppliers. The discussion of our Scope 3 goal and progress is in the Supply Chain Sustainability chapter, emphasizing the importance of that partnership in driving progress. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 111 AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT Photo submitted by: Abigail Sprague | Wabash, Indiana, U.S. Cumulus clouds As a company dedicated to innovation, we are constantly striving to improve our manufacturing processes.

Looking ahead, we have created separate goals for these important efforts. The progress and ongoing commitment for our greenhouse gas emissions reduction is discussed in the previous chapter, Combating Climate Change. In addition to greenhouse gas emissions, we have made progress in reducing other emissions, but there is still work ahead. Our 2020 goal is to reduce toxic air Our Air Quality Management emissions weighted-average intensity by 75% compared to our 2010 baseline. efforts align with the following In 2019, we achieved a 41% absolute reduction in toxic air emissions and a 54% UN SDGs: reduction in toxic air weighted-average intensity. We’ve done better toward our second 2020 goal, to achieve a 15% reduction in particulate emissions. By the end of 2019, we had reduced our weighted-average intensity we had reduced our weighted-average intensity by 34% from the 2010 baseline. While surpassing our goal in reducing particulate emissions is encouraging, we have set more ambitious goals for this work going forward.

Because both VOCs and fine particulate matter emissions are widely understood to have negative impacts on human health and the environment, our air quality management goal is focused primarily on their reduction. We will also continue our efforts to reduce other emissions as well. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 113 STRATEGY AND APPROACH Photo submitted by: Although both VOCs and fine particulate matter are local issues that are Julie Childers | Granville, Ohio, U.S. receiving attention around the world, regulation does not always move fast The Swiss Alps from a plane enough to keep pace with their impact. We believe our progress must go beyond compliance, and we have set these goals to push innovation and development to reduce these emissions. We have reduced particulates as part of other innovation projects in the past. For example, when we shifted to a starch-based binder for our EcoTouch® product, we reduced particulates in addition to creating a product free of formaldehyde. As we move to the next generation of binder for our insulation products, we expect similar reductions. With our 2030 goal to guide us, we will be considering particulates and VOCs in our development of new innovations. Redesigning or re-engineering processes is another possible path, as is further enhancing the controls we have in place. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 114 VOC EMISSIONS In 2010, Owens Corning announced a 14% weighted-average intensity reduction in VOC emissions from the base year of 2002. Given our past successes and our concerns for pollutants that create greater air quality challenges, we shifted our 2020 corporate goals from nitrogen oxides (NOx) and VOCs to toxic air emissions. However, we have continued to measure and report VOCs, NOx, and sulfur oxide (SOx) emissions. As climate science continues to shape our understanding of emissions, our goals have evolved accordingly. With 2030 targets focused on greenhouse gas emissions, fine particulate matter, and VOCs, we believe it is important to provide transparency around our progress in other categories of emissions as well.

Our weighted-average intensity percentage reflects a 34% reduction from the 2010 baseline. Much of our progress to date has been driven by the conversion of our residential EcoTouch® insulation. As evidenced by the conversion, the key to achieving further gains will be capturing more synergies between innovations that enhance product performance and improvements in process efficiency that reduce environmental impact. To ensure consistency of testing for air and PM2.5 emissions, we have experts who travel to our sites, oversee testing at our facilities, and then review and verify the results and findings. In addition, they partner with our business units and plants to ensure that we understand the impact of potential changes to our processes and plan accordingly for future events.

However, several factors, including regional water scarcity, increasingly limited water availability, and rising water costs, pose risks for our operations and business expansion plans. We are committed to minimizing water consumption and potential contamination from the production, use, and disposal of our products, with a focus on:  Water efficiency.  Deploying our sustainability mapping tool in the development of new and significantly changed products.  Performing life cycle assessments (LCAs) on all our core products.  Conducting product stewardship reviews of our products. We use water management tools and systems to accurately track our water usage and identify potential risks and environmental impacts. This information supports the development of robust strategies to mitigate risks associated with water use. Our management strategy enables us to optimize and reduce water consumption through proactive measures such as the recycling and reuse of water, and leak detection and repair. We also provide training to create employee and stakeholder awareness of better water use practices. For example, Owens Corning, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), and U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Manufacturing Office organized training at one of our plants in Tennessee to baseline the water use in the facility, quantify water consumption/losses, quantify the true cost of water in different systems, and identify water efficiency improvements. The event was led by ORNL and Owen Corning’s water efficiency teams. In addition to identifying projects for the host facility, the event equipped the participants with the knowledge and tools required to do water assessments at other facilities. Exposure to supply and other water-related risks varies among our geographies, processes, and product lines. We proactively minimize the effect of water risk for our locations through regular risk assessments using the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Annual self-assessments are also conducted by suppliers, and the results of the assessments are sent to us, including whether suppliers are setting goals to reduce water usage. We also conduct LCAs to identify the amount of water embodied in each of our products. We routinely evaluate any process, product, regulatory, or price changes in our facilities as well as each site’s environmental footprint. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 122 Water use, water discharge, and recycled and recirculated withdrawal water are tracked monthly at the site level.

This project began in April 2019; by November, the plant started to see full benefits of its water reduction efforts. The plant reduced the absolute volume of its well water consumption by 18.8%, and their water discharge was reduced by 19.7%. The annual cost saving due to this reduction in water discharge volume in 2019, compared with 2018 figures, is estimated at $10,000 USD. The team is continuing their efforts into 2020 to identify and realize additional water and waste water reductions.

By adding a step in the treatment process to preserve the membranes used for the osmosis, the plant plans to increase reuse to eight cubic meters per hour. Water that is not treated through this process is used for cleaning or other activities that don’t require the same degree of purity. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 126 COMPLIANCE Discharge Average Discharge Quality by Effluent Type Our facilities comply with national, state, and local regulations and permits regarding water withdrawals and WATER QUALITY 2019 wastewater discharges.

This determination is based on an evaluation conducted annually by Owens Corning, which continues to show lack of proximity of company manufacturing site locations to the special sites or species. Regarding environments that are around our facilities, discharges are controlled through permits and required monitoring. Unauthorized discharges and runoff must also be reported to the environmental and legal departments of the corporation and corrective action must be taken if occurring. Employees are subject to disciplinary action for knowingly failing to comply with legally required environmental reporting. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 127 EXPANDING OUR SCOPE FOR CONTEXT-BASED TARGETS The shift to context-based targets for our 2030 goals marks a refinement in our approach. Since all our production 2030 Target: 50% aggregate intensity reduction of water processes require water, our operations depend on local withdrawal in high water-stress sites from 2018 baseline. water supply, including both surface water and groundwater.

Atlas indicators that are most relevant to our operations. When we considered the 13 indicators, we asked: 2019 All Other Sites Water withdrawal intensity  Which of these could have direct impact on our ability to 0.00124 (cubic meters normalized by revenue) withdraw water?  Which of these could our water withdrawal directly impact? 2018 (BASE YEAR) 2030 GOAL 0.00128  For which of these would decreasing our water withdrawal by 50% directly matter? Compared to 2018, water use efficiencies and fixture We selected seven indicators that have the highest relevance upgrades and repairs led to a 3% reduction in intensity at to our operations through the lens of those questions. We our high water-stress sites as well as at our remaining sites. consider the first three indicators listed below as significantly relevant, and these are emphasized in our internal evaluation and scoring of our facilities.  Baseline Water Stress. This indicator compares the water withdrawn to the water available in a given sub-basin. Each sub-basin is part of a larger basin that drains into an ocean or lake at a single point. The WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas measures water withdrawal at the sub-basin level because water demand is usually local; the average distance from supply to destination is the main selection criterion in the tool. This indicator measures competition among users.  Baseline Water Depletion. In alignment with the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas definitions, we use “consumption” to refer to water that does not return to the basin. We measure our consumption to track the way our water withdrawal impacts local water supply and decreases water availability for downstream users. Although similar to baseline water stress, which considers total withdrawals, baseline water depletion is calculated based only on the amount of water consumed.  Drought Risk. Because this is a risk measurement, it is more than just the probability that drought will occur. It also takes into account the magnitude of the impact based on the exposure and vulnerability of the affected population and assets. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 128 We also consider these other indicators as relevant to our Our contextual targets are based on a score for each operations: facility, which is derived through calculations based on these indicators.

Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia In connection with our work to create sustainable products and enable the shift to the circular economy, we’re determined to continue striving to eliminate waste sent to landfill. Our focus on waste includes the operational efficiency of our production processes, and extends to how we use, reuse, repurpose, recycle, and dispose of materials generated from our facilities. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 131 2019 PROGRESS ON 2020 GOALS In 2010, we established a 2020 goal to reduce our waste-to-landfill (WTL) intensity by 70% from a 2010 baseline. Making progress toward this goal has been one of our biggest sustainability challenges. We are currently at an 18% reduction in WTL intensity compared with the 2010 baseline, even though our diverted waste was 62% of the total waste in 2019. Photo submitted by: Julie Childers | Granville, Ohio, U.S. Lake Como, Italy in December Many of our facilities have made progress in reducing waste, and we celebrate every success. However, we have fallen far short of our goal, and although 2019 was an improvement over 2018, we have a long way to go. Unfortunately, we do not currently have a direct line of sight to the 70% reduction goal, even with the known internal and external opportunities to recycle, reuse, and reduce waste going to landfills. Nevertheless, we remain committed to our 2020 goal and our Our Waste Management efforts long-term goal of zero WTL. align with the following UN SDGs: 2030 GOAL FOR WASTE MANAGEMENT Sustainability Materiality Definition: By 2030: Send zero waste to landfill by cutting in half the amount of waste we Our ambition is to mitigate the waste generate and recycling the rest. that we produce by redesigning the process to avoid its creation, and While we have not made the progress we need to make, our disappointment repurposing it whenever possible.

Through periodic assessments, we monitor our compliance with internal and external standards, guidelines, and laws, as well as progress on our goals. We look for ways to reduce all forms of waste – liquid, solid, hazardous, nonhazardous, and more – during the complete life cycle of our products. We have established a product stewardship review process, which is conducted at various stages, including design, development, test market, manufacture, and distribution, to conserve resources and prevent waste through our business operations. We use weighted-average intensity to measure performance in waste-to-landfill and diverted waste. Owens Corning continues to evaluate and improve upon the methods and mechanisms for tracking waste streams that are ultimately recycled, reused, or landfilled. When waste management or recycler invoices are available, they are used for data reporting. Otherwise, we rely on on-site weigh scales or, in the absence of scales, we rely on calculated estimates to determine the weights of our shipments. We depend on the final disposition of each material for assessing performance against metrics. Leadership and reporting for waste reduction efforts roll up to the enterprise level, but many of the initiatives happen at the manufacturing facilities. Our global WTL leader is responsible for driving WTL reductions and fostering relationships with internal and external stakeholders across all businesses. In addition, our Composites business has its own WTL leader who prioritizes and tracks waste reduction efforts across the business. Periodic reviews are used to assess progress and take necessary corrective actions. Source reduction and reuse/recycle techniques are important strategies for minimizing waste and the use of landfills. During the initial design phase and through continuous improvement efforts, we seek to increase the percentage of recycled content in our products and packaging materials. Recycled glass reduces demand for raw materials, which is why we maintain a research and development (R&D) focus on glass fiber. We use nearly 1.3 billion pounds of recycled glass annually, making us one of the largest users of recycled glass in the world. We also support glass recycling by collaborating with strategic partners to increase the recycling of glass containers and factory waste. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 133 Our waste elimination efforts clearly show the link 2019 Non-Hazardous Waste by between our environmental footprint and our product Disposal Method (Metric Tons) handprint. As we conduct life cycle assessments for our products, we consider the waste impact of the product. Designing processes that generate minimal – or zero – waste and products that contain the maximum recycled content, making our products more sustainable. As we find solutions to recycle and reuse waste within our processes, we may uncover ways that we can support our customers through take-back programs. Along with that, considering waste during the design phase and throughout a product’s life cycle means considering endof-life issues from the beginning.

Reducing waste generation and reducing waste to landfill benefits the business and the environment. By reducing waste generation, Owens Corning reduces costs associated with the manufacturing process. In addition to reducing costs associated with transportation and disposal, reducing wastes also reduces costs associated with raw materials, energy, time, and labor.

We know that more hard work and creative solutions are needed. It’s clear that relying on third-party recyclers can’t be our primary answer; those outlets may change their specifications, go out of business, or become unavailable to us for other reasons. The limited availability of landfill space, especially outside of the U.S., adds incentive to reduce and recycle waste. As we find or develop solutions for our plants there, we will look for ways to translate those solutions for our U.S. operations. Glass waste from our manufacturing process is our largest category of waste, and our biggest challenge. Our engineers, scientists, and manufacturing experts, along with the employees in our plants, are working to develop solutions. Meanwhile, our employees demonstrate their determination to make progress in any way they can. Reducing nonmanufacturing waste at our facilities may make only a small contribution to our overall progress toward zero waste to landfill, but it represents a mindset and commitment that supports our aspiration. We believe that the decisions and personal actions of our 19,000 employees will provide the momentum and creativity needed to achieve our goal of sending zero waste to landfill. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 140 PROTECTING BIODIVERSITY Photo submitted by: Vicki Hauser | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. Monarch butterflies preparing for migration.

These include:  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves.  Sites designated by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands.  Sites designated by the Alliance for Zero Extinction, an organization dedicated to conserving the world’s most threatened species.  Key Biodiversity Areas, referencing the 2016 IUCN Global Standard report.  Natura 2000 sites, as applicable to Europe.  Nationally listed nature and wildlife reserves. As we look to preserve our surrounding ecosystem, we must of course adhere to not only our internal policies and guidelines, but also regulatory obligations related to air, water, and waste. Our initiatives are meant to go beyond those requirements, exceeding compliance standards by continuously evaluating the environmental performance of our operations. We also actively encourage all stakeholders to consider environmental impacts, including natural resource protection, as part of all capital project planning and internal approval. When we expand our operations through the acquisition of new businesses and associated real estate, part of our due diligence is to evaluate land and adjoining property to identify environmental impairment and protect habitat and species. This ensures we can take necessary restorative and protected measures as needed. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT 143 Wildlife Habitat Council Assessments Our ongoing efforts with the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), an organization dedicated to promoting and certifying habitat conservation and management on corporate lands, has enabled us to further develop site-level biodiversity initiatives according to best practices.

UN SDGs: Like many manufacturers, our processes require our facilities to be in continuous operation. It is difficult for us to close a facility to host an all-day volunteer activity. We have had to be creative to ensure that all our people can participate in company-sponsored community outreach events. One noteworthy success in 2019 is a 150% increase in the number of on-site team events. Activities such as preparing meal kits or packing school supplies give employees an opportunity to participate in projects without having to leave their workplaces.

Some of our facilities conduct multiple community outreach events each year, and we have expanded our global reach through a wide range of initiatives. Through surveys, our employees tell us that working for a company that supports volunteerism is very important to them, and we have seen that their participation in Owens Corning-sponsored outreach strengthens their pride in the company. Building on that, our 2030 goal points us to an even more impactful aspiration: We envision 100% of our employees actively engaged in their communities through company-sponsored outreach. We will continue our efforts to engage 100% of our facilities in community projects by 2022, as a foundation for our broader goal. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 150 STRATEGY AND APPROACH Priorities and Synergies with Our Business We structure our community initiatives around three key priorities, which are aligned with specific U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that relate to our global communities.  Safe & Efficient Housing (Sustainable Cities and Communities — SDG #11)  Basic Health & Wellness (Good Health and Well-being — SDG #3 / Clean Water and Sanitation — SDG #6)  Educational Opportunity (Quality Education — SDG #4) Our strategy is designed to leverage the business expertise, capabilities, and financial resources of the Owens Corning Foundation, along with the corporate community affairs budget, to maximize our positive impact on communities. As a producer of residential and commercial building materials, Owens Corning has the skills and opportunity to help provide safe and efficient housing and shelter for those who are unable to obtain them through traditional methods. By combining our philanthropic activity and volunteerism with our ongoing efforts to develop cost-effective housing solutions, we expand access to safe housing and shelter to members of communities in need. Our vast network of contractors with a track record of excellence means we can extend our contributions by bringing them to projects we support. HOW WE ENGAGE OUR COMMUNITIES Assessing Local Community Needs Guided by our giving policy, the Owens Corning Foundation provides financial support through strategic partnerships with nonprofit organizations that align with our corporate citizenship strategy and key business drivers. We also provide support through our employee matching-gift programs. In many instances, we develop these partnerships to address findings from community needs assessments. We often work with nonprofit organizations to help us identify opportunities. Our partnerships frequently include financial donations from the Owens Corning Foundation, as well as product donations and employee volunteerism. The assessments help us identify needs, look for synergy with what Owens Corning does, and ensure that there are opportunities for our employees to volunteer.

The Foundation supports U.S. defenders, veterans, first responders, and their loved ones. Our partnership directly supports the R.I.S.E. (Restoring Independence, Supporting Empowerment) program, which builds specially adapted homes for severely wounded U.S. military members and their families. We donate insulation and roofing products for homes built through the program and work with contractors who volunteer in the construction of those homes. Our commitment to supporting safe, efficient housing for people in need makes R.I.S.E. a perfect fit for Owens Corning. The men and women in our manufacturing plants are often moved and proud to see how the products they create can make a profound difference in people’s lives. And for many of our U.S. employees who have family members in the armed services, working with the nation’s veterans is deeply meaningful.

As a global leader in building materials and composite solutions, we know the impact that donating our materials can have in providing shelter and safe, efficient housing for those in need. Our donations of building materials help in several important areas:  Building and rehabilitation of safe, efficient housing.  Neighborhood revitalization projects.  Construction and support of shelters and community centers.  Disaster relief. Owens Corning also collaborates with World Vision, an organization serving children, families, and their communities, in projects in which our donated products make a difference to those whose homes need significant repairs. Through all of our 2019 efforts, Owens Corning donated enough material to reroof 718 homes and insulate 184 homes. Like many companies, we are frequently approached with requests from charitable organizations. A substantial number of the requests for one-time gifts come from the Toledo, Ohio, community, the location of our world headquarters. As the sole Fortune 500 Company in the city, we believe it is important to maintain a significant presence and will often sign on to be a corporate sponsor at events and fundraisers in the Toledo area. We also allow local charities to use our facilities, and we donate used office furniture and building materials to them. These donations are all provided directly from Owens Corning rather than Photo submitted by: Julie Childers | Granville, Ohio, U.S. through the Foundation. Trail on the way to Castello di Vezio in Comune Di Perledo, Italy Measuring Our Impact in Communities We regularly measure the impact of our corporate citizenship program and verify its alignment with our key business drivers. This ensures that our work is both business-relevant and meaningful to local communities. We use several key metrics to assess our impact, including:  Facility engagement in community service projects.  Number of volunteer hours and other evidence of employee engagement with our company and local communities.  Completion of contractor-related projects.  Number of Habitat for Humanity builds in each community.  Number of homes that have been re-shingled or insulated through product donations or other work with strategic partners. 2019 Accomplishments We customarily begin community impact assessments at a site after its first full year with Owens Corning to ensure a seamless integration into our corporate citizenship program.

We are unconditionally committed to the health and safety of our employees, and we work to hold our contractors to the same high standards. Safety is more than a workplace initiative for us; it is part of a larger culture of caring for our employees and their families. Through a range of approaches, we engage all our employees to foster an environment of health and safety. Together, we work to identify hazards, and then reduce the risk of injury by eliminating or controlling those hazards. We believe this commitment enhances employees’ quality of life, and that we all share the responsibility to help each other stay safe. We encourage our staff to carry the health and safety knowledge they gain at work into their personal lives, to their families, homes, and communities. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 160 DRAFT: DESIGN IN PROGRESS 2019 PROGRESS ON 2020 GOALS Photo submitted by: Jennifer Payne | Tennesssee, U.S. As we near the target date of our last set of long-term goals, we have made Andrew Ramos explains the TPM board in considerable progress in reducing injuries and keeping everyone at Owens Houston, Texas Corning facilities safe.

Measuring our progress in reducing Our Safety efforts align with the injuries is helpful for determining our safety initiatives, but it does not change following UN SDGs: our goal — the total elimination of injuries. In 2019, our recordable injury rate was 0.65, and 49% of our facilities worldwide were injury-free for twelve months or more+. While Owens Corning continues to have a world-class safety culture and low injury rate, we are acutely aware that each incident represents an injury suffered by one of our colleagues, which truly underscores the importance of remaining diligent where safety is concerned.

Ideally, we will do this by designing equipment and processes to eliminate risk. When an engineering solution isn’t possible, we will continue to evaluate and implement strong rules and policies and ensure use of appropriate protective equipment to keep people from hazards. In new or newly acquired sites, achieve a level of safety at least equivalent to the rest of Owens Corning within one year+. Emphasize the elimination of risks that could lead to the most serious injuries, rather than concentrating on the most frequent ones+. As our safety data from 2019 demonstrates, there is more to do and our 2030 goal of zero injuries keeps the challenge in front of us. It remains our aspiration to eliminate all employee, contractor, and visitor injuries and occupational illnesses at work and at home. Because of our long-standing commitment to this aspiration, Owens Corning is among the safest industrial companies in the world. We are proud of this success, and grateful for every safety milestone we have reached on the journey. When one of our sites has a record number of injury-free months (or years), it reminds us that our aspiration is possible —and inspires us further. To advance our goal, we will:  Systematically assess and rank the risk of the tasks employees, contractors, and visitors perform and the equipment with which they work.  Emphasize the elimination of risks that could lead to the most serious injuries.  Make it impossible for injuries and illnesses to occur.

We Women Build. acknowledge that this is an ambitious goal, and we continue to look for additional strategies to help us close the gap to zero. We also thoroughly investigate all incidents and share what we learn across the company, engaging employees through:  Safety committees.  Mandatory safety training for all employees.  Specialized hazard recognition and control programs.  Behavior-based safety processes.  An operational focus on total productive maintenance (TPM) to keep our operations running safely and smoothly, including regular inspection of equipment. We continuously work to ensure companywide compliance with all applicable environmental, safety, health, and sustainability requirements. Our Environmental, Health, Safety, and Product Stewardship Policy ensures commitment to environmental sustainability, product stewardship, and the safety and health of our employees. Any entity doing business with Owens Corning is expected to follow the principles contained in this policy, and when considering an acquisition, Owens Corning evaluates the health and safety of the target’s operations prior to purchase as part of our due diligence. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 163 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH & SAFETY MANAGEMENT Our ambitious safety goal encompasses everyone who visits or works at any Owens Corning facility; as a result, we must have an inclusive approach to managing occupational health and safety. All employees, contractors, and visitors must follow our safety protocols while on site, whether they are in one of our manufacturing facilities, offices, warehouses, laboratories, or anywhere on Owens Corning property. Our shared commitment can be seen in the many healthand safetyrelated processes and procedures active within Owens Corning facilities globally, the care demonstrated across all levels of the organization, and the world-class safety results produced by the collaborative efforts of our people. There are many ways employees have input and influence on health and safety processes. The specific mechanisms vary by plant and will typically include some combination of safety committees and teams, observation processes, safety-tagging systems (under TPM), all-plant communication meetings, crew meetings, shift huddles, training teams and sessions, and subject-specific safety teams or committees. Our collective bargaining agreements contain all the provisions noted above at the local level, as well as procedures for resolving issues affecting a safe workplace. In terms of how we engage our employees in our occupational health and safety management system, the specific language and scope of our labor agreements vary from site to site. However, all are structured to recognize the importance placed on our commitment to health and safety by Owens Corning and our employees. In all our facilities, employees are trained to understand, appreciate, and mitigate risk in the interest of their own safety and health, the safety and health of those around them, and of the organization overall. Owens Corning uses our qualitative and quantitative survey and corrective/preventive action process to identify and avoid hazards. Healthy and Safety uses several tools, including job hazard analysis and risk assessments, structure hazard assessments, product hazard analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, permitting processes, pre-job hazard analysis, and Stop-Think-Act-Review (STAR) Cards, in addition to other engineering processes and controls. We have a robust industrial and occupational health process that requires sites to conduct scheduled surveys every other year. The routine surveys are supplemented with special studies if necessary (for example, when there are changes in processes, raw materials, or controls). Surveys are audited as part of our EHS assessment process and guided by the global standard that defines Owens Corning’s expectations. We then apply the familiar hierarchy of controls approach to addressing any concerns identified.

Because tasks vary at different plants, facilities have established a variety of EHS initiatives, and all employees and management are encouraged to take part in them. They include:  Oversight safety committees.  Behavior-based safety observation teams.  Hazard recognition teams.  Serious Injury and Fatality/Critical Six program teams.  Human performance improvement teams.

The safety committee Dana Dennison, Newark, Ohio members are normally selected by union leadership, which helps maximize employee participation. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 165 TPM AND SAFETY Another way Owens Corning employees engage in safety is through Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), which is the Owens Corning management system for manufacturing productivity improvement. It is also a mindset that empowers all employees to proactively address issues that could cause losses. TPM works hand in hand with advanced manufacturing and process excellence to deliver world-class manufacturing performance in support of Owens Corning’s growth strategy. See page 50 for more information. TPM strengthens our safety culture in several ways. As employees in the plants perform their daily work, for example, they are constantly monitoring the equipment and the environment for indications that maintenance or other intervention is needed. With TPM, all employees are accountable for watching for developing hazards. This improves efficiency in our operations as well as safety for our people.

Safety procedures are in place for specific hazards, including  Sharing learning across the site and between sites, handling chemicals or hazardous substances. We rank as appropriate. risks based on the frequency of exposure, how severe an Owens Corning has developed a risk assessment injury could be, how likely an incident is to happen, and the calculator that generates a “risk score” based on the level of controls in place. This risk ranking system is used complex relationships between severity and the hierarchy to prioritize projects, identify resource requirements, and of controls. The traditional risk assessment calculation allocate working capital across the corporation. This system multiplied frequency by severity. This formula could provide is also used to measure risk reduction at the plant, business misleading results: a minor but common hazard might be unit, and corporate levels, which enables us to hold leaders scored higher than a rare, serious one. To match our SIF accountable for reduction targets and to obtain the most risk approach, we removed frequency from the calculation. reduction benefits for the resources allocated. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 166 After identifying a risk, users first rate the potential severity as SIF, significant or minor. Then, they rate each control type (passive engineering, active engineering, warning, administrative, and PPE) according to their confidence in the control’s effectiveness. Each selection is weighted and scored, generating a score for the controls and a severity score as well as a total risk score. Based on the points, the risk is categorized as low, acceptable, unacceptable, or dangerous. The last two categories require a mitigation plan. This tool helps users assess the risk as well as the controls. Each site develops action plans to eliminate or reduce its top risks. Internal teams conduct site assessments that contribute to the enterprise risk management assessments that are completed for the audit committee and the board of directors. Business unit managers regularly discuss work-related risks. These discussions are then shared among our EHS departments, the executive management team, and the board of directors on a quarterly basis, resulting in additional action plans for the entire organization. We strive to continually improve our safety model by conducting these quarterly formal business unit reviews, which are then used to develop a continuous improvement program. Our regional leaders conduct periodic plant inspections as well as provide support and growth opportunities to each of their plants. In some cases, regional leaders cross divisional lines to help eliminate hazards. Owens Corning also operates a corporate EHS assessment department, which thoroughly reviews EHS processes at every site at least once every three to four years. When required by our customers, we also obtain third-party safety certifications, such as OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001, which cover approximately 22% of our sites. Our global safety and environmental organization verifies and documents the status of management systems during scheduled audits. After assessments are completed, we obtain a published report. All items identified for improvement in the report are incorporated into the facility improvement plan. Critical items are called out and directed to the vice presidents of operations, sustainability, and EHS for further action. Photo: Jesus Valdez, an employee in Mexico City, Mexico. Safety at Non-Owens Corning Sites When employees are assigned to work at facilities not controlled by Owens Corning, these employees assess the risk of their tasks and in the general work environment. If the level of risk is not acceptable, they will discontinue their activities until riskmitigating actions are completed by the owner of the facility where they are located. If necessary, our EHS personnel visit these facilities to assist with risk assessment and help develop risk mitigation strategies in partnership with the site owners. By empowering our staff to take action for their own safety, Owens Corning ensures that our employees are safe no matter where they are and model good safety practices for others. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 167 FOCUSING ON SIGNIFICANCE Our commitment to safety and to protecting our approximately 19,000 employees is unconditional. Over the last decade, Owens Corning has drastically reduced the number of injuries at our facilities. That has been possible due to our adherence to best practices and our unwavering commitment to safety. However, serious injuries and fatalities (SIF) have continued to occur despite a drop in recordable incidents and first-aids. Previously, Owens Corning, like most companies, followed Heinrich’s Principle of Safety, which states that the causes of near-misses and minor injuries are mainly the same as those for serious ones. Newer studies and our own experience have shown, however, that the causes of serious injuries and fatalities are often very different from those that trigger minor ones. The new approach says that incidents can be split into two categories based on the level of potential for serious injuries. Highpotential incidents are those that can lead to SIF if conditions are allowed to continue. There are precursors that increase the risk of an incident becoming an SIF. Eliminating precursors is the best way to reduce all injuries, including serious ones. Imagine someone trips because of cracks on a plant’s floor. The employee will most likely have minimal injuries, if any. If that employee were to trip from a great height, though, the injuries would most likely be much more serious. In 2018, Owens Corning began increasing our focus on eliminating precursors to SIF as urgently as possible, even if no injury has occurred. As safety incidents — both injuries and near-misses — are reported and we conduct proactive risk assessments, we evaluate them based on how severe the injuries were or might have been. The most serious will get immediate attention. Owens Corning learns from incidents and is continuously evaluating the implementation of our efforts to reduce the risk of SIF within our operations, especially associated with non-routine tasks and maintenance activities by employees and contractors. Photo submitted by: Brittany Barhite | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. Marblehead Lighthouse, Ohio 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 168 INCIDENT REPORTING AND INVESTIGATIONS Working safely is a condition of employment at Owens Corning, and every employee shares responsibility for safety. Our policy states that employees are expected to insist on quality and effective safety training before starting any job or task. As a result, employees are also expected to stop and report unsafe behavior or any work procedure that puts themselves or others at risk. LEARNING FROM NEAR MISSES When any safety incident occurs, whether it results in first aid, a near-miss, or injury, it is reported to plant leaders and the EHS team. Core information is recorded in our central A near-miss incident from 2019 demonstrates the database, and the EHS team will then classify each incident power of our SIF investigation approach and the according to its severity (or potential severity). importance of our TPM system.

For major programs, training is designed and deployed by corporatelevel safety leadership with support and input from plant and other relevant personnel. Safety leaders also work with business partners to provide specialized training, such as driver safety for our sales team and personal protective equipment (PPE) support for our facilities. All employees receive regularly conducted EHS training on employee health and safety standards. We develop an annual training matrix, and our facilities use a common web-based platform with standard training modules through our global corporate intranet. Those are supplemented by site-specific education. This system is fully integrated with our talent management structure and provides the ability to customize learning plans for individuals. Global EHS professionals involved in our safety programs receive advanced safety training.

Based on what we learn, we regularly review and update the metrics and scoring system. When entering data, safety professionals at our facilities categorize incidents with SIF potential, and input the corrective actions taken to address them. In September 2019, Owens Corning began centrally tracking corrective actions related to serious injuries and potential fatalities as a unique category in the incident tracking system. That allows us to evaluate the effectiveness of the remedial steps in dealing with and preventing potential problems, and easily share that information with all sites. In addition to the number of injuries, the database allows us to track other valuable information such as SIF near-miss frequency rate and the number of days employees are out of work due to “A big part of our success in reducing injuries so injury, offering a continually updated picture of our safety. far has been employees’ commitment to learn With the database available for data mining, exposure from safety incidents and share best practices.

Over time, we will replace existing C6 standards with updated SIF standards on the same topics. In 2019, we rolled out a new contractor management standard and implemented pilot programs as a follow up to 2018’s launch of the machine guarding standard. Machine Guarding Implementation Because of the nature of our operations, employees must work with and around industrial equipment. Based on incident reporting and investigations, we recognize that machines represent significant risk potential. Workers’ exposure to machines was a primary factor in 44% of our 2019 recordable incidents that had SIF potential. In 2019, we began efforts to conduct full machine-guarding risk assessments at every location globally. Our first phase Photo: William Sparrow of implementation included locations representing different from the Portland, Oregon, U.S. plant at a Habitat for regions, businesses, and facility size, which helped us gain Humanity build. insight about the process and streamline deployment. As we identified improvement opportunities, we created and shared corrective actions. The effort will continue in 2020.

The effort to continuously improve our work environment, eliminate hazards, and help people stay safe has already brought rewards in the form of fewer injuries. However, it seems we have reached a plateau. To get closer to our aspiration, we need to find new approaches, so we can find and address even the subtlest hazards. Our challenge is to maintain our focus on the common causes of injury while paying even closer attention to the most severe. As we add emphasis on our efforts to eliminate the risks that can lead to serious injuries and fatalities, we must maintain our momentum on reducing the most frequent injuries. We also need innovations that help us see in new ways. Both technological advances and new insights into human behavior are needed to help us continue to eliminate injuries — and the potential sources of injuries — at every Owens Corning site. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 177 HEALTH & WELLNESS Photo submitted by: Frank O’Brien-Bernini | Granville, Ohio, U.S. Bicycles on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts We believe in fostering a culture of caring for our employees and their families.

Our goals are ambitious, consistent with Owens Corning’s overall commitment to sustainability. We aspire to end lifestyle-induced disease in our employees, as well as promoting mental, physical, and financial well-being.

Chan School of Public Health, we are Tim Reed, from the Irving plant, hiking with his working to measure the impact of our wellness programs. We are encouraged by wife in Copper Breaks State Park, Texas, U.S. what we have already learned, but more work and refinement are still needed. The connection between participation in these programs and improved health risk factors is clear in the data; understanding cause and effect is part of our ongoing work. We also recognize the need to establish metrics that will represent the health and well-being of our employees and are meaningful across our global workforce. Changes in our workforce demographics over time add complexity as we track progress toward our goal. Employee privacy expectations, as well as cultural differences and sensitivities regarding health and well-being, impact the availability of comprehensive aggregate health data. However, as a U.S.-based company with a historical focus on employee wellness, we have had the opportunity to build a solid base for developing metrics that drive our understanding. In the U.S., we have access to aggregate data about our employees’ health through our health insurance plans and employees’ self-reporting. We look at key biometric measures, such as blood pressure and body mass index, and work to improve the percentage of employees who have healthy numbers. We also track the percentage who receive annual age-appropriate cancer screenings, go to preventive health appointments, and participate in biometric screenings, which is an important component of our Healthy Living initiative. From the early analysis of this aggregate data, we’re beginning to be able to connect participation in our wellness programs to improved health measures. Armed with the knowledge of which programs make a difference for our employees in the U.S., we can ensure that our entire global workforce has access to those same tools. As we strive to develop the tools and methods necessary to measure our progress, our goal remains the same — we want people to be healthier because they work at Owens Corning. While complying with privacy laws and local expectations, we will use accessible, aggregate data as well as health and behavioral science to guide our strategies and tactics. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 180 HEALTHY LIVING PLATFORM We continue to implement new tools that refine and Champion Network increase our approach to improving the lives of our employees.

Financial Health We aspire to help our employees confidently manage their financial lives today, while preparing for the future and dealing with the unexpected. We seek to raise awareness of company financial benefits available to our employees. This includes planning tools and resources such as financial and legal counseling through Beacon Health Options, retirement counseling through Fidelity Investments, and the implementation of several test-and-learns with banking partners in our plant communities. Our Newark, Ohio, U.S., wellness team won the Healthy Living Gold award given by the Healthy Business Council of Ohio. In addition to mindfulness training and community participation, the team held numerous sessions on financial health. The team had a van outside of the facility to talk to employees about the Fifth Third Membership Advantage program, meant to help staff meet their current financial needs and plan for the future. The program offers special benefits like banking discounts and perks, financial empowerment seminars, and personalized banking assistance. HEALTHY COMPETITION FOR HEALTHY HABITS Our annual Lighten Up! challenge continues strong, thanks in part to the Healthy Living platform. In 2019, 3,016 employees representing 72 Owens Corning locations joined the competition and lost a combined 10,000 pounds in just 14 weeks. Participants committed to eating a healthy diet with fewer carbohydrates and more fruits and vegetables and measured their body composition every two weeks for three months. They also monitored their blood pressure and cholesterol and tracked their food choices daily. Many participants felt that the accountability of having to weigh themselves every few weeks and the encouragement of their coworkers helped them continue their weight loss efforts. In the site competition, Lighten Up! participants at the world headquarters in Toledo, Ohio, U.S., dropped 854 pounds, grabbing the top spot for most pounds lost at a large site, defined as 125 employees or more.

To be eligible for the competition, sites had to meet rigorous criteria, including having been tobaccofree since the first quarter of 2018 and at least 65% staff enrollment in the Healthy Living platform. Representatives from competing facilities traveled to headquarters to make a formal presentation about their 2018 Healthy Living activities. Our Concord, North Carolina, U.S., plant won the competition, with the Duncan/Ridgeview, South Carolina, U.S., placing second. There were several commonalities between the efforts at both plants. Efforts were made to engage all employees, including the leadership team and plant leader, helping them access the Healthy Living mobile platform, championing training, establishing goals and measuring progress against them, and celebrating success. Photo: Representing the Concord plant to the judging panel at headquarters are (from left) Mark Poindexter, Katy Platek, Catinna Brewington, Alice Taylor, Karen Noyes, Mike Asbury, and Grady Whatley. As winners, Concord employees could designate a charity to receive a $10,000 donation from the Owens Corning Foundation. The plant chose the Jeff Gordon Children’s Foundation. Gordon is a former professional stock car racing driver in the U.S. who created the foundation in 1999 to support research and find cures for all types of pediatric cancer. Second-place Ridgeview selected the March of Dimes, an organization that works to improve the health of mothers and babies, to receive their $5,000 donation. Employee Assistance Program Balancing the demands of a fulfilling career and personal life can be challenging. To help our employees be better at work and at home, we offer broad, comprehensive counseling through the employee assistance program (EAP). We partner with a third party to provide professional, confidential counseling sessions to our employees free of charge for up to six visits. Counseling can be conducted either face-to-face or through telephone sessions and covers a range of topics, including:  Traditional counseling services for issues such as stress management, depression, grief, or addiction.  Work/life integration challenges, including child and elder care, home repair, or adoption.  Financial and legal advice, such as college funding, creating wills and trusts, and credit score management.

TPM involves encouraging employees to share the responsibilities for preventing injuries, defects, and losses, because when we do, the company, the customers, and our workforce win. TPM is also a mindset that empowers all employees to proactively address issues that could cause losses. We believe that incorporating the principles of TPM into our healthy living program can truly strengthen our approach toward health. This year, we launched two pilot programs to integrate healthy living initiatives with TPM at our Portland, Oregon, and Jackson, Tennessee, U.S., facilities. Both locations used TPM techniques to determine their best opportunities to make healthy living gains. They then built the strategies to achieve those gains into their local TPM process via methodologies such as Focused Improvement and Daily Management. One immediate challenge involved making the health pillars a priority within the plants, where current TPM plans were heavily focused on safety, injuries, and first aid, and daily discussions on numbers tended to be centered around those issues. Although the health pillars are important to people individually, making them central to discussions within the plant is essential. Helping employees think of health the same way they think of safety can help drive behavior. The majority of our employees work in operations, and including health in the daily operational review, using TPM, drives continuous improvement. We will be expanding this approach to other plants and other regions in 2020. Reporting Healthy Living Metrics We report our Healthy Living critical metrics across three tiers: Action-Based, Health Risk, and Disease-Related. Tier 1: Action-Based Metrics act as leading indicators for Tier 3: Disease-Related Metrics track actual disease tracking program success. Our key Tier 1 metrics include: and illness statistics in the aggregate within our program population. Relevant lifestyle-related morbidities include:  Percentage of employees enrolled in the Healthy Living mobile platform.  Diabetes.  Percentage of employees engaged or highly engaged.  Atherosclerotic coronary vascular disease (ASCVD).  Percentage of employees completing their annual  High blood pressure. health risk assessments and biometric screenings.  Certain cancers.  Heart age survey completion.

In 2019, we completed a study that looked at the number of points employees earned through use of the Healthy Living platform (based on activity, nutrition, sleep, steps, etc.) and health risks. The risks analyzed were from a large, well-researched, and validated data warehouse used by many companies to map the health of their population. It uses an algorithm that considers illnesses, medication usage, demographics, and other factors to calculate risks. Owens Corning looked at five years’ worth of data, and could see clearly that the more points earned, the lower the risk burden. And even though some health risks increase as people age, those from older generations who scored higher had lower health risks than those from the same demographics with lower points. Study Conclusion  Being healthy requires work and maintenance. Our analyses show that higher levels of participation in the Healthy Living program are quantitatively linked to better health among Owens Corning employees.  Owens Corning appears to be tracking the right biometric measures. Better biometrics correlate strongly with better (lower) health risk scores.  Participants with higher points (top 20% of participants) correlate strongly with better (lower) sample health risk scores.  Higher points-based participation measures (top 20% of participants) are strongly related to smaller increases in risk score, BMI, and blood glucose over time. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 187 Corporate Policies beyond the three-day limit must be authorized.

It is the individuals within an organization, after all, who drive innovation and sustain peak performance over time. To do that, people must feel valued, included, and engaged — from recruitment to retirement. That is why Owens Corning is dedicated to ensuring our culture is one that fosters an environment of learning and growth within a supportive, caring culture. We recognize that continuous improvement throughout our company begins with a commitment to continuously improve the lives of our people. To that end, we are dedicated to providing a safe, healthy workplace and a meaningful, engaging employee experience. People who feel engaged in their job can feel more engaged with the world. Owens Corning believes that by creating a challenging, supportive, optimistic workplace, that will translate into a workforce that endeavors to continue to develop solutions that are in keeping with Owens Corning’s overall sustainability goals. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 190 2019 PROGRESS ON 2020 GOALS Photo submitted by: Stephanie Birkeland | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. In 2019, we sought to meet the needs of all employees, regardless of position or Taken at the Susan G.

For 2019, our goal was to reach an average of 18 hours of training per employee, and we recorded an average of 15 training hours in our learning management system. Not all of our learning and development is tracked in the system, as employees have access to a wide range of informal opportunities. External training is encouraged for career development and is also not included in the LMS training hours+.

As we look ahead to 2030, we recognize the importance of cultivating a work environment where people feel fully engaged at their jobs and talent is truly nurtured. To that end, our 2030 targets are as follows: Retention Engagement  100% retention of high-potential talent between  >95% of staff indicating that they are frequently annual talent reviews+.

To optimize the experience for every employee, Owens Corning has established the following priorities:  Strategic Talent Mindset. We will seek to balance the needs of our company with the needs of our employees. We can achieve this through the creation of our Human Resources strategy and roadmap, and by enabling growth through strategic resource allocation.  Organizational Effectiveness. We will foster an engaging work environment and operationalize business strategy through impactful organizational development.  Change and Inclusive Culture. We can collectively influence a culture that values diversity by developing inclusive leadership capabilities, stewarding equitable Human Resources practices, and facilitating organizational change. In addition, we are committed to providing employees with competitive compensation and benefits, as well as additional incentives based on several factors, including individual and company performance. We align our hiring strategy with local labor markets, especially as we grow outside the U.S. We offer additional programs, such as flexible work arrangements, to help employees maintain a healthy work/life integration. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 193 RECRUITING AND RETAINING TOP TALENT Our commitment to sustainability is directly reflected in our approach to talent acquisition. Locating the ideal candidates for every position, encouraging them to align their personal goals with those of the company, and fostering an environment where each individual can flourish are all essential to achieving and advancing our sustainability goals, both now and as we look ahead to 2030. Technology Investment and Branding for Recruitment Owens Corning is proud to be a significant presence around the world, and we recognize the need to balance our unified global approach with the varied needs of the communities in which we do business. That approach received an important boost in 2019 as we invested in technology that brings all our recruiting activity together into one platform. Today, anyone who applies for a position at Owens Corning — anywhere in the world — uses the same technology. We are now able to share metrics and accountabilities across all regions in a way that had not been possible before. In addition, we can now offer the same mobile options around the world, which further increases accessibility for users. The recent rebranding of our employment and recruitment materials has enabled us to communicate a consistent Owens Corning culture around the world. At the same time, though, we can customize our materials to match the nuances of each region we serve. For example, our externally facing career pages are designed to match the needs of the region and celebrate the uniqueness of our various audiences. Inclusive Recruitment Developing an inclusive workforce means appealing to diverse audiences and ensuring the broadest possible talent pool. We do this by reducing barriers to talent acquisition wherever possible. This has led to many significant innovations recently, including the following:  Introducing mobile-friendly applications.  Removing gendered language from job descriptions.  Eliminating educational requirements where they are not necessary.  Strategically appealing to diverse populations by developing relationships with specific universities and professional organizations. Photo submitted by: Joshua Strake | Granville, Ohio, U.S. Employees at the Granville S&T Center on guided nature walk around the campus 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 194 Master Assessor Training In addition to investing in new technologies and branding, Owens Corning has also invested in the skills of our recruiters and leaders. In 2019, we increased participation in our Master Assessor training and certification. Through the Master Assessor program, recruiters are trained to evaluate potential employees based on a full scope of capabilities that go beyond job history alone. We believe that all Owens Corning employees have a role to play in recruitment as they represent the employment brand in their everyday lives. Therefore, in addition to the investment we place in our talent acquisition professionals, we seek to improve the capabilities of our staff around the world. In 2019, we initiated Inclusive Leader training, which empowers leaders around the world to be inclusive recruiters. Early Career Programs Our long-range commitment to inclusivity is inherently linked to maintaining a sustainable pipeline of diverse talent. Through our Early Career programs, we can foster new talent — often directly from college. These new hires are a constant source of invigoration for our team, as their diverse approaches and backgrounds provide us with exciting new perspectives. In addition, Early Career programs enable us to establish long-term plans for a diverse pipeline of future leaders. As of 2019, we have retained 95%+ of Early Career Development Program participants after one year, and 77%+ of participants after five years. This surpasses benchmark retention rates obtained from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), whose 2019 data indicates 71% retention after one year and 50% after five years. High-Performing People A high-performance culture depends on bringing high-performance people together in an environment that fosters excellence.

As of December 31, 2019, more than 3,500 employees had served 20 years or more with Owens Corning, with the longest term being 58 years. We continuously work toward providing a positive employee experience where talented people have great opportunities to grow their careers — and we believe the years of service that so many of our employees have dedicated to our company are a testament to our success. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 196 EMPLOYEE LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT Owens Corning believes that continued education and development is an important part of employee engagement. The investment we make in every employee’s growth benefits both the company and the individual. Our learning and development opportunities extend throughout our employees’ time at Owens Corning, from early career development and mid-career advancement to executive-level cohort learning. We seek to deliver these experiences by aligning them with our business strategy, and we deliver them in the following ways:  Aspiration and Goal Alignment.

Employees hone these skills through We track the progress of our learning and development activities across the company through data recorded in our learning management system (LMS). Each facility reports participation in formal learning programs such as classes, e-learning courses, and structured on-the-job activities. Data include any training that was recorded in our LMS for the year, primarily for the formal learning programs conducted across the company. Most of the learning and development activities that take place in Owens Corning are considered to be informal learning, such as coaching, mentoring, social groups, projects, assignments, and readings, and these are not captured in the LMS.

Internal Succession at Owens Corning Our internal succession initiatives had a dramatic impact on our executive leadership in 2019. Most notably, we welcomed a new chief executive officer, Brian Chambers, in April. Brian served as vice president and general manager of the Roofing business before being named president of Roofing in 2014. Prior to taking office as CEO, Brian served as chief operating officer for Owens Corning. Paula Russell became the vice president, chief human resources officer in 2019. Paula started her career with Owens Corning as part of one of our leadership development programs, and it is a testament to the impact those programs can have on our talent pipeline. Todd Fister became president of the Insulation business in July 2019. Previously, he served as vice president of global Insulation and strategy. This followed the 2018 promotions of Gunner Smith to president of Roofing from vice president of sales for Roofing, and Marcio Sandri to president of Composites after serving as vice president, global strategy and operations for that business. We are proud to have been able to fill these leadership roles from within the company.

We reward both individual and collective contributions to our business’ success through base and variable pay. Base salaries are determined by:  Job responsibility.  Benchmarking data on market competitiveness.  Individual competencies.  Job performance. The design, application, and administration of our global compensation programs adhere to a consistent philosophy, one that ensures equitable treatment for employees, regardless of gender, age, or ethnicity. Compensation at Owens Corning is designed to be competitive within the local labor market. Base pay rates are determined by job responsibility level and are targeted at the market median (the 50th percentile of comparable companies with whom Owens Corning competes for talent). Base pay rates are reviewed and updated annually, based on the job performed and the local market wages for similar skills, to ensure we are providing fair wages. In addition to base pay, most primary employees are eligible to participate in Owens Corning’s Variable Incentive Plan (VIP) at the plant level, which is dependent on individual and plant results. Through this compensation program, above-average total cash compensation is provided when a location performs well, leading to a competitive structure overall. Employees’ compensation is proportionate to their role’s impact and the contributions the individual makes to the company, which ensures fairness. Photo submitted by: Joe Blair | Newark, Ohio, U.S. Owens Corning’s compensation philosophy is to use all elements of Monterrey, California, U.S compensation effectively, aligning employees with the goals of the company and its businesses and encouraging our employees to meet and exceed desired performance objectives. Most staff employees are eligible to receive additional cash incentives through the Corporate Incentive Plan (CIP) based on the company’s year-end results and their individual performance. The corporate component is determined through EBIT targets and a consolidated corporate target, while the individual component is based on each employee’s annual performance. Our compensation team has performed a thorough analysis of our U.S. population and all minimum wage increases that are current and approved, but not yet enacted. We are currently compensating our people at all established minimum wage requirements. For Owens Corning, minimum wages are generally not relevant, as most entry-level Owens Corning positions require a higher level of skills or knowledge than jobs at which the minimum wage would apply. We are committed to providing all employees with equal remuneration for work of equal value, regardless of gender or minority status. Equal remuneration is a key element of a truly diverse and inclusive environment, as we are dedicated to ensuring equal treatment for all employees. Our understanding of pay equity, and the ideal means of measuring this concept, continue to evolve as we grow as a company. Owens Corning has conducted equal pay reviews every other year for the last decade. These reviews include a robust statistical analysis of pay equity across all our U.S. salaried (and most of our global salaried) workforce. Consistent with the company’s commitment to “equal pay for equal work,” where this review indicates pay gaps that cannot be explained through experience, performance, job level and related factors, they are remediated through pay increases. Further, Owens Corning does not solicit applicant pay data, to avoid inheriting any pay bias of prior employers. In 2019, we began a partnership with a third-party group, Mercer, to help us look at the issues surrounding pay equity in a way that better reflects the current landscape regarding equitability issues. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 200 Full-Time Employee Benefits at VOICE OF THE EMPLOYEE Select Sites Owens Corning understands In addition to providing fair compensation for our that listening to our employees employees, Owens Corning offers an array of is one of the best ways to benefits designed to attract and retain a workforce learn what is working in our that is committed to excellence.

We believe this culture of appreciation helps people engage at their best, knowing they have an equal opportunity to grow and succeed based on their performance, regardless of individual differences. We invest equally in our employees and ensure our corporate culture allows all employees to share their unique perspectives and experiences, learn from one another, and contribute to Owens Corning’s global workplace. An inclusive, diverse workforce also reflects our global business and customer base and will lead to a more successful organization. Although our efforts on inclusion and diversity are not new, and we have reported on our initiatives and progress in previous years, this is the first time that we have set broad public long-term goals in this area. In 2019, Owens Corning CEO Brian Chambers signed the CEO Diversity Pledge, an initiative of the CEO Action Committee. He joined more than 500 CEOs in publicly pledging to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Having ambitious targets for 2030 is a way of declaring our values and connecting sustainability efforts to business outcomes. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 206 2030 GOAL FOR INCLUSION & DIVERSITY Photo submitted by: Jessie Edgar | Aiken, South Carolina, U.S. By 2030: To be a company that listens to and understands our employees so that all our employees feel valued, understood, and inspired to bring their authentic selves to work every day.

When we succeed, we open new pools of talent, align with the following UN SDGs: which leads to workforce and leadership teams that are connected to and reflective of the communities in which we live, work, and serve. Our inclusion and diversity aspirations drive our goal and targets for the Owens Corning employee experience, as described in the previous section. The way we hire, support, develop, and engage employees is linked to the culture of appreciation that results from including diverse perspectives. We will advance our external reputation through transparency, and we will earn recognition for successes in inclusion and diversity.

We held CEO Action-sponsored Day of Understanding events designed to facilitate open dialogue and foster appreciation for how differences strengthen the company. These sessions, as well as a survey conducted in December, provided valuable insights about both what’s working and where we have gaps in building the culture of appreciation that we aspire to have. Each member of our executive leadership team hosted an event, and over 350 employees from around the globe have participated so far. We will continue holding these sessions, now called Courageous Conversations, to keep this vital dialogue open. When naming our strategy, we made a conscious choice to put the word inclusion before the word diversity, because we believe that inclusion is what enables diversity to flourish. Employees who feel valued, understood, and inspired can bring their authentic selves to work every day, and when that happens, the entire company benefits. “We want all of our employees to Inclusion and diversity at Owens Corning is a cornerstone of our business, and our feel like they can be themselves leaders are committed to going beyond legal requirements, focusing on creating an at work every day, bring their inclusive environment.

Inclusion and Diversity As a further indication that inclusion and diversity are an integral part of our company’s values and business culture, we created a new role: vice president of inclusion and diversity. This executive, appointed in 2019, has been tasked with developing and carrying out Owens Corning’s long-term inclusion and diversity strategy and partnering with global leaders to increase employee engagement. We have adopted a broad definition of diversity, one that captures many different dimensions of human experience. Physical differences are one aspect of diversity, but cognitive, relational, occupation, and societal differences, as well as values, play equal roles in shaping an individual’s perspective and experience. By recognizing and valuing all aspects of diversity, we strengthen our ability to understand and appreciate all people. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 208 Inclusion and Diversity Council To ensure continued focus, we have created an Inclusion and Diversity Council, which includes senior leaders and leaders of 2030 Target: 100% of people leaders are our employee affinity groups.

Inclusion & Diversity Training and Development To give our leaders a common framework for I&D at Owens Corning, we introduced an Inclusive Leader workshop series in 2019, beginning in North America and Europe. These sessions introduced and established common language around inclusion and diversity. Participants discussed how connection, inclusion, and engagement are linked, and learned how to be more purposeful in engaging people and listening to their stories. By the end of the year, over 500 of our leaders, including all vice presidents, had attended. After attending, leaders receive follow-up surveys and tools to share with their teams. The Inclusive Leader training will be extended to more employees in 2020. Leaders are not the only ones benefitting from inclusion and diversity training.

Women in Manufacturing: New Perspectives Promote Growth Not surprisingly, women at Owens Corning have a distinct view about working in manufacturing, a traditionally male-dominated industry. Realizing that women at our customers have similar experiences, a group of women at Owens Corning formed the Women in Insulation (WII) group and quickly saw that their ideas and discussions could help drive growth for the Insulation business. They hosted an event for female customers and were able to create new business relationships with clients who had not purchased Owens Corning products in a very long time. They enhanced relationships by listening to concerns and working with other Owens Corning teams to address them. The group also created an opportunity for internal and external mentoring by bringing together women business owners at various stages of their careers who could exchange advice, experiences, and ideas in a supportive environment. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL HANDPRINT 212 UNCONSCIOUS BIAS In June, Owens Corning hosted the What’s Getting in the Way? workshop at our Toledo headquarters and streamed it WHAT’S GETTING live via Owens Corning Video to our global sites.

National motivational speaker, attorney, consultant, author, and former Owens Corning employee Diana Patton led the workshop that included a candid discussion about what employees and Owens Corning can do to create a more mindful and authentic culture. During the session, a panel of global participants discussed biases and stereotypes to raise awareness of their impact. Diana shared her “Top Tips to Practice Shaping Your Unconscious Behavior,” meant to help employees adopt more inclusive behaviors. Inclusion helps create an environment that allows employees to stay true to their personal, cultural, and racial identity. “I ACT ON” PLEDGE Following the event, many employees took the “I Act On” Pledge in association with the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. The pledge states, “I pledge to check my bias, speak up for others, and show up for all,” and holds all of us accountable for doing our part.

Occasionally, local grievances require additional input at the divisional or corporate level, and if still not resolved, are definitively decided by a neutral arbitrator. Although the company does not compile the number of grievances or complaints filed by employees/unions at each plant each year, it is not unusual for each facility to resolve dozens of such labor concerns each year. In 2019, we had one labor concern across Owens Corning’s U.S. operations that required the use of an arbitrator to reach a final disposition (i.e., grievance withdrawn, granted, or settled). In the unfortunate circumstance that one of the above mechanisms of resolution is unsuccessful, an employee may choose to proceed with legal action or file a complaint with a local agency. These are handled through Owens Corning’s legal department following the same guidelines of investigation, remediation, and non-retaliation policies described above.

This policy is overseen by our Board Audit Committee. Our anti-corruption policies align with applicable anti-corruption laws, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery. In 2019, our anti-corruption efforts resulted in the following outcomes:  100% of the members of our board of directors received communication, and completed training, on our anticorruption policies and procedures.  100% of our employees received communication on our anti-corruption policies and procedures, and 100% of staff employees, which is approximately 33% (6,413) of A STAND AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING all employees, completed training.

We estimate that about half of our carriers have had some training on how to spot human trafficking. To ensure all of them are educated on the tools available, we will include this training as part of new carriers’ onboarding in 2020. We have already begun working with our carriers on this initiative. In addition, we will join with Truckers Against Trafficking (TAT) in 2020 to help train our drivers and facilities. We plan to have the TAT mobile exhibit at our Supplier Day event in the fall. The 48foot trailer has a compelling exterior and several video monitors inside to educate trucking industry members and others about human trafficking.

This year’s sustainability report, our 14th annual, reflects the reporting period January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, and was published in April 2020. Our previous report was published in May 2019. This is our third report prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards: Comprehensive option. This is the more extensive option for GRI reporting, requiring additional disclosures on our strategy, ethics and integrity, and governance. We do so because we firmly believe that transparency is an essential component of any sustainability effort. In addition, this report is designed to address disclosures and material issues related to CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), United Nations Communication on Progress, and other stakeholders’ requests, including Photo submitted by: Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Olivia Kasle | Toledo, Ohio, U.S. Tulip Festival in Albany, New York, U.S. Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This approach enables us to provide an integrated, comprehensive view of our commitments, progress, and activities related to sustainability and social responsibility. We are focused on creating robust business and reporting strategies that effectively align with the needs and priorities of our company and our stakeholders. We do this by investing substantial time and effort into understanding, prioritizing, and addressing material topics — and reporting on them accurately and transparently. As such, our materiality matrix was carefully developed to take into consideration different stakeholder needs as well as our involvement with impacts of material topics. To remain abreast of the changing business context, stakeholder requirements, and emerging trends, we regularly review our list of material topics and their relative priority, then update them when appropriate. For a list of our material topics and our materiality matrix, plus a discussion of our ongoing stakeholder engagement, please see page 14-25. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | APPENDICES 230 SCOPE AND BOUNDARIES Photo submitted by: Rafał Leśniewski | Trzemeszno, Poland For this report, we developed the content and determined the boundaries of material Greek Islands, Zakynthos and Milos topics based on where the impacts for each material topic occur — on the economy, environment, and/or society. We are reporting on ways that we have caused or contributed to impacts for material topics, as well as ways our activities, products, and services are directly linked to these impacts through our business relationships. This includes business relationships with entities that we do not control and might not have leverage to effect change in their impacts. In summary, the boundary of all these impacts covers our entire global operations, including Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Americas. Internal boundaries include all plants and offices owned or leased by Owens Corning. The external boundary includes supplier locations, communities, and customer locations where Owens Corning where Owens Corning does business. There have been no significant changes in scope in 2019.

Through this agreement, business, as a primary driver of globalization, can help ensure that markets, commerce, technology, and finance advance in ways that benefit economies and societies everywhere. Principle 7 of the UNGC states that, “businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.” The precautionary principle or approach was originally introduced in the 1992 Rio Declaration of Environment and Development. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration explains that, “where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.” The precautionary approach calls upon us to diligently assess and manage environmental, health, and safety risks, so we can take appropriate action to prevent harm. We ensure that our products and technology comply with or exceed all applicable laws, regulations, and approval standards to protect the environment and human life and health. In addition, our product stewardship programs are designed to ensure the integrity of our products and the processes used to develop, produce, and manage them. Owens Corning is confident that these efforts are consistent with the expectations of the precautionary approach. More information is available in our Environmental, Health, Safety, and Product Stewardship Policy, found at www.owenscorning.com/sustainability. As demonstrated throughout the report, we align our activities with the UN’s 17 SDGs. In addition, Owens Corning publicly states our support for the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The 30 articles that make up the Universal Declaration represent a watershed moment in the history of international human rights. As one of the primary driving forces behind the UNGC, the Universal Declaration, which was established in 1948, is as relevant and impactful as ever. Owens Corning is committed — in both belief and action — to the 10 principles of the Global Compact and the 30 articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This commitment extends beyond making our products and operations more sustainable. It involves the broader objectives of sustainability, balancing economic growth with social progress and environmental stewardship. In short, we believe that what is good for people and good for our planet is also good for Owens Corning. Our Human Rights Policy was updated and expanded in December 2016 and informs our supplier code of conduct, all in accordance with the principles of the UNGC and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

António Guterres Secretary-General United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary General: Owens Corning is proud to be a member of the Global Compact, and I am pleased to once again confirm our commitment to the ten principles. As the attached report illustrates, Owens Corning’s commitment extends beyond simply making our products and operations sustainable. By building broad objectives of sustainability into the way we do business, we seek to balance economic growth with social progress and environmental stewardship, which is in the best interests of our company and our stakeholders, and creates long term shareholder value. This work resonates deeply with the sense of purpose that Owens Corning employees share: our people and our products make the world a better place. To help bring that purpose to life, we are engaged in a continuous effort to advance the same principles that are articulated in the Global Compact. Our sustainability strategy incorporates those principles and is driven by our company values, which guide the way we interact with our communities as well as our customers, suppliers, investors, and colleagues. Through the lens of that strategy, Owens Corning has evaluated the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and identified several that are material to our business and on which we believe we have direct impact through our core business competencies. We also identified those where we can have influence, either directly or indirectly. For those aligned with our material issues, we are already underway with active programs and reporting. This work is included in our report. Many of Owens Corning’s sustainability efforts have been recognized by organizations that evaluate our progress against high standards and industry benchmarks. For example, for the seventh consecutive year, Owens Corning earned distinction in 2019 as one of the world’s most sustainable companies – within 1 percent of the top score globally – from sustainability investment specialist SAM. In 2019, Owens Corning was also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the tenth straight year, and ranked as the Building Product industry leader for the seventh consecutive year. For the third year in a row, Owens Corning led the building products sector in all three DJSI dimensions: economic, environmental and social. Additionally, Owens Corning earned placement on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a second year. The North America Index tracks the sustainability leaders in the largest U.S. and Canadian companies in the S&P Global Broad Market Index. In addition to recognition from Dow Jones and RobecoSAM, in 2019 Owens Corning has also been recognized for its corporate leadership, including ranking No. 1 on Corporate Responsibility magazine’s 100 Best Companies and recognition by the Ethisphere Institute as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies. The company earned a position on CDP’s “Climate A List” and CDP’s Water Security A List – one of only 10 U.S.-based companies to earn a place on both. Owens Corning was pleased to sign the updated Business Roundtable statement on the purpose of a corporation, which expresses a view that has guided the company’s approach for a long time. Our long-standing belief that corporations can drive positive change through the way they conduct business led us to issue a $450 million green bond in 2019 – the first offered by a U.S. industrial company. 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | APPENDICES 276 UN GLOBAL COMPACT COMMUNICATION ON PROGRESS Appendix E Our progress to date becomes the baseline for what we need to do going forward. In 2019, our executive team worked hard to develop and align on ambitious 2030 sustainability goals for the company that will push us to innovate and collaborate to make a difference for the world. For instance, we’ve set greenhouse gas emissions targets that have been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative according to the scientific guidance on what’s needed to limit global warming to 1.5° Celsius, and contextual water use targets based on the WRI Aqueduct Indicators that address the risks to water supply in high water-stress areas. The details of our next set of long-term goals are provided in the company’s latest Sustainability Report, attached, which also provides details about our progress and current efforts in areas related to the ten principles of the Global Compact. An index is also attached, to highlight the relevant sections in the report. This is work that will never be finished, but I am proud of our accomplishments to date and pleased to reaffirm Owens Corning’s commitment to the Global Compact and our dedication to conducting business responsibly throughout the world.

SCS Global Services’ (SCS) responsibility was to carry out a moderate level of assurance on the report in adherence to AccountAbility’s Principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness, and Impact. In addition, SCS conducted assurance on a subset of the material performance criteria provided in the Owens Corning 2019 Sustainability Report. Scope The scope of SCS’ work included Owens Corning’s global operations. A Type 2 Assurance Engagement was performed to evaluate Owens Corning against the AA1000 Principles (2018) to a moderate level. In addition, SCS provided assurance at both high and moderate levels on specific performance data in 2019. Specific performance data included Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and energy use at a high level of assurance. A moderate level of assurance was performed on Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions and the following additional performance data in 2019: water usage, waste streams, specified air emissions (nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), particulate matter less than 2.5 micron (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOC), social performance indicators, 2030 goal setting, and 2019 progress towards 2020 and 2030 sustainability goals. Standards SCS performed the assurance of Owens Corning’s 2019 Sustainability Report against the AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS, 2008) with 2018 Addendum. In addition, SCS evaluated the Report against the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI) Standards. Specific performance data were assessed utilizing internationally recognized standards which included, but are not limited to the following:  ISAE 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information  World Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), March 2004 along with Scope 2 and Scope 3 Guidance  ISO 14064-3:2006 Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of GHG assertions. Assurance Team and Methodology Our team was comprised of Tina Sentner, Dr. Gerard Mansell, Tavio Benetti, Vincent Katharua, and Neil Mendenhall with qualifications available online and upon request. SCS’ Assurance Team undertook the following activities in order to render our opinion:  Reviewed documentation, records and systems developed as a part of Owens Corning’s 2019 materiality processes, stakeholder engagement, and mechanisms for stakeholder responsiveness.  Reviewed and analyzed material performance data collected at the corporate and site-levels to identify any material misstatements or process calculation errors. © SCS Global 2019 OWENS Services CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | APPENDICES Page 1 of 3 281 ASSURANCE STATEMENT Appendix F  Conducted on-site and off-site interviews with management and staff at sample of Owens Corning’s sites; and  Reviewed the Sustainability Report for material misstatements and its alignment to the requirements of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. Limitations SCS conducted interviews with management and staff, reviewed governance documents and data, and performed limited recalculations on aggregate and site-specific data. These processes enabled SCS to provide a moderate level of assurance on Owens Corning’s 2019 Sustainability Report, which reduces the risk of our conclusions being in error but does not reduce the risk to zero. Conclusions Based on the methodology and activities performed we have found that Owens Corning’s Report and specified key performance indicators are in adherence to AA1000 AS (2008) and AccountAbility’s Principles (2018 Version). A summary of our conclusions and evidence follow: Inclusivity: Owens Corning has effectively integrated stakeholder input into the development of their products and processes as a strategy to improve performance. Owens Corning updated their materiality assessment in 2019, which showed increased efforts to reach a diverse and representative group of stakeholders. This effort showed that a number of new stakeholders were identified and consulted in 2019. These groups included sustainability NGOs, community groups, employees at manufacturing sites, and more emphasis to reach stakeholders outside the US, and those who do not speak English. Materiality: SCS’ assurance included a review of Owens Corning’s Materiality Whitepaper which included the written processes, methodology, and calculations used in Owens Corning’s 2019 materiality assessment along with supporting documentation and secondary sources of information. Owens Corning benchmarked material issues to those of industry peers, reviewed relevant news articles, regulatory and legal information, trending social media topics, and other online data which was aggregated and analyzed by Datamaran. Owens Corning developed their own stakeholder survey along with internal risk assessments and registers to rank issues based on importance. New 2030 goals were found to have been developed based on the most material issues. Interviews with Owens Corning and service provider Datamaran along with SCS’ own independent research showed that the process was thorough, identified the key material issues and met the AA1000 Principle of Materiality. Responsiveness: SCS reviewed a number of mechanisms in place for capturing information from stakeholders and responding to their concerns. These mechanisms included help lines and email addresses for providing stakeholder assistance and collecting and responding to grievances in violation of the Business Code of Conduct. Competent staff or third parties have been assigned to respond to stakeholder needs and elevate serious matters to management. Owens Corning’s commitment to providing a comprehensive Sustainability Report in line with GRI Standards and having it independently assured is further evidence of the company’s commitment to being responsive to stakeholders. Impact: Owens Corning has a good understanding of their climate impact and has set their 2030 GHG emissions goals using methodology from the Science Based Targets Initiative. Similarly, contextual water use targets were set in 2019 and were based on current water use and the risks to water supply in high water-stress areas as defined by WRI. These are two very good examples of how Owens Corning is measuring impacts and setting goals based on these impacts to meet global threats to the environment 2019 OWENS CORNING SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | APPENDICES 282 © SCS Global Services Page 2 of 3 ASSURANCE STATEMENT Appendix F and society. An opportunity of improvement exists for the organization to further refine current and future impacts of identified material topics outside of GHG emissions and water. This would include supplementing social, regulatory, internal and external stakeholder inputs with additional quantitative data and analysis. The review of the management systems, data and calculations regarding Owens Corning’s reporting of 2019 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste, air pollution, VOCs, social performance indicators, and 2019 progress towards 2020 and 2030 sustainability goals were assured at a moderatelevel and no material errors or misstatements were identified in the final draft chapters of the report.

Sources of data reviewed included benchmarking to industry peers and best in class, news articles, regulatory and legal information, trending social media topics and other online data aggregated and analyzed by Datamaran, Stakeholder survey data, and Owens Corning’s internal risk assessments and registers. Interviews with Owens Corning and Datamaran employees were held to better understand and corroborate the approach used in selecting the material topics. SCS further conducted its own materiality study through targeted internet searches, data pulled from Datamaran, social media postings, and internet news sources to cross‐check identified stakeholders and material issues. Opinion and Findings: SCS Global Services (SCS) has performed the assurance activities to evaluate the process used in identifying and prioritizing the most relevant sustainability topics, with focus on the effect each topic has on Owens Corning and its stakeholders. Based on the evidence presented, the audit team agrees that the material issues adopted by Owens Corning were appropriate and Owens Corning has met the criteria for effectively identifying and prioritizing material issues by effectively utilizing big data and stakeholder feedback. An opportunity of improvement exists for the organization to further refine current and future impacts of identified material topics. This would include supplementing social, regulatory, internal and external stakeholder inputs with additional quantitative data and analysis. All findings raised during this assessment were closed prior to issuing this assurance statement. Statement of Independence SCS provides this moderate assurance in accordance with the requirements of the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles 2018 and GRI 101 Standards. SCS has complied with the commercial independence and other ethical requirements per our internationally accredited quality system, which is founded on fundamental principles of impartiality, competence, objective decision making, openness, and confidentiality.
