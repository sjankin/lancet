San Pedro Garza García, N. L., January 31, 2019. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT The global economic environment continued to perform well in 2018; nevertheless, risks for financial markets remain due to economic policy decisions made in developed nations, the geopolitical environment, commercial tensions and downward projections in the Euro Zone. In the US, there was an initial economic boost from the tax incentives offered by the current administration; however, something of a slowdown was noted by the end of the year. Energy exporting emerging economies were helped by higher petroleum prices in the first half of 2018. The Mexican peso appreciated slightly against the dollar compared to last year, despite the adverse winds facing the Mexican economy. Changes in the GDP and other variables in Mexico and globally, which are key to better understand the results of ALFA, are described in the following paragraphs: Mexico’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) stayed on course at 2.1%(a) in 2017 in line with 2.0%(a) in 2018. Consumer inflation was 4.8%(b) in 2018, lower than the 6.7% (b) registered in 2017. For the second consecutive year the Mexican peso had an annual nominal appreciation in 2018 of 0.3%(c), compared to 4.5% (c) in 2017. In real terms, annual average overvaluation of the peso against the dollar slid from 3.1%(d) in 2017 to 1.0% %(d) in 2018. With regard to interest rates, the average TIIE (Interbank Interest Rate) in Mexico for 2018 was 8.0%(b) in nominal terms, compared to 7.1% in 2017. In real terms, there was an increase, from an annual accumulated rate of 1.2% in 2017 to 3.2% in 2018. Such uptick remains in line with the decisions of Banxico. The nominal three month LIBOR rate in US dollars, at an annual average rate, was 2.3%(b) in 2018, above the 1.3%(b) registered in 2017. If the nominal appreciation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar is included, the LIBOR rate in constant pesos increased from 1.3%(b) in 2017 to 1.6%(b) in 2018.

The general economic environment was subject to volatility in the peso-dollar exchange rate. International oil prices increased in the first half of 2018, which helped several businesses held INDEXES OF REVENUES by ALFA. The Company developed a positive strategy accordingly, and continued to show that (2013=100) it is a financially solid entity, able to take advantage of growth opportunities that will maintain its leadership position in all the industries where it operates. 108 110 RESULTS 111 101 118 REVENUES The following chart provides information on the revenues earned by ALFA for the years 2018, 2017 and 2016, breaking down its volume and price components (the indexes are calculated using the base 95 PRICES 2013=100): 85 DOLLAR 74 73 PESOS 77 DESCRIPTION 2018 2017 2016 VAR. 2018-2017 (%) VAR. 2017-2016 (%) Consolidated Revenues 366,432 317,627 293,782 15 8 Volume Index 167.9 155.5 144.3 8 8 14 15 16 17 18 Price Index Pesos 118.2 110.7 110.2 7 0 Price Index Dollars 77.1 73.4 74.2 5 (1) We also detail the consolidated revenues for each of the main subsidiaries of ALFA: 144 156 DESCRIPTION 2018 2017 2016 VAR. 2018-2017 VAR. 2017-2016 123 168 Alpek 134,523 98,998 90,192 35,525 8,806 130 VOLUMES Sigma 121,900 114,222 106,341 7,678 7,881 PESOS Nemak 90,327 84,779 79,244 5,548 5,535 Axtel 15,561 15,513 13,744 48 1,769 Newpek 2,060 2,036 1,991 24 45 Other 2,061 2,079 2,270 (18) (191) 14 15 16 17 18 Consolidated Total 366,432 317,627 293,782 48,805 23,845 Note: In this document the figures of Axtel 2016 include results 12 months Alestra and 10.5 months Axtel. 41 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS REVENUE TRENDS ARE EXPLAINED BELOW: 2018-2017: For the year 2018, consolidated revenues were $366,432 million (US$19,055 million), 15% up on the figure for 2017 (13% higher in dollars). Below we detail the behavior of the businesses of ALFA over the year: Alpek, in line with its strategy, had outstanding results in 2018. Revenues totaled US$6,991 million, a 34% increase compared to 2017, driven by higher oil prices and the contribution as of May 2018 of the plants of Petroquimica Suape and Citepe in Brazil. In 2018, Sigma revenues totaled US$6,336 million, 5% higher than 2017, mainly due to the synergies obtained with Caroli (Rumania) and Supemsa (Peru). Sales volume in 2018 was 1,756 thousands of tons of food products, which is 2.1% higher than the previous year. In 2018, seeking to capitalize on consumer trends, Sigma used innovation to expand its product offerings. In Mexico it launched the “Doble Cero” yogurt made by Yoplait, a snack line of Campofrío in Europe, and introduced lactose-free cheeses in Central America and the Premium chorizo made by FUD in the US, among others. Also, the plant at Burgos, Spain went fully into operation, offering its products mainly to the European market. During 2018, Nemak, in line with the automotive industry expanded its portfolio of products, based on global industry trends for weight reduction and electrification of vehicles. In North America, the company benefited from favorable economic conditions where demand increased, whereas in Europe there were lower sales of diesel components, apart from production delays related to the implementation of the new emission control regulations. Sales volume was 50 million equivalent units in 2018, in line with that recorded in 2017. Sales for the year were US$4,704, a 5% increase over the previous year. Axtel continued to strengthen its leadership role in the IT and telecommunications market, focusing on the business and government sectors. In 2018 it earned revenues of US$809, a 2% reduction compared to 2017. This result mainly reflects the growth recorded in the business and government segments, supported by its six data centers. Also, new services were added, such as virtual switchboards, wireless access solutions and Big Data. Against a backdrop of price increases for oil and hydrocarbons, in 2018 Newpek produced a performance similar to that of 2017. In the US, productive activity focused on Eagle Ford Shale, while in Mexico the operation of mature oil wells continued in San Andres and Tierra Blanca, located in Veracruz, reaching a total of 137 wells, with average production of 3.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD). Sales volume was 4.4 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD), a reduction of 10%. In 2018, the revenues of Newpek were US$108 million, similar to last years revenue. 42 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS 2017-2016: In 2017, consolidated revenues totaled $317,627 million (US$16,804 million), 8% above the figure for 2016 (7% higher in dollars). Below we detail the performance of the businesses of ALFA in the year quite: Alpek reported sales volume in line with estimates. Revenues totaled US$5,231 million, an 8% increase against 2016, due to the increase in prices of raw materials, mainly paraxylene and propylene. During 2017, the petrochemicals industry continued to face high volatility in prices of crude oil and its derivatives, resulting in temporary distortions in demand. In the case of polyester, there was a recovery in the second half due to a better balance between supply and demand in Asia and more favorable conditions in North America, based on expected favorable rulings in the antidumping cases. Also, plastics and chemicals outperformed due to higher margins in the polypropylene business. Sigma revenues totaled US$6,054 million, 6% higher than the previous year, mainly due to better performance in Mexico and Europe. Sales volume reached 1,727 thousand tons of food products, 3% above that recorded in the prior year. In 2017, Sigma continued using innovation as a growth factor, establishing a procedure to accelerate the development of new products and drive platforms which enabled the company to get even more in line with customer thinking. Also, it added two processed meats companies, in Peru (Supemsa) and Romania (Carolí), and made progress in the startup of the plant at Burgos, Spain, improving its efficiency, as it has last generation processes and installations which make it an industry benchmark. In 2017 the automotive industry enjoyed contrasting fortunes, with a downturn in North America offset by growth in Europe and other regions. Nemak continued its coordination with the assembly plants in the trend towards structural components, which brings the benefit of auto lightweighting. Furthermore, the development of electric power in vehicles opens new doors for Nemak, where it can seek growth in the supply of structural components and also for electric cars, such as hybrid transmissions, battery housings and electric engines. Sales volume was 49.9 million equivalent units in 2017, 0.4% lower than the previous year. Revenues for the year came in at $84,779, a 7% increase compared to 2016. In dollar terms, revenues showed a 5% increase, due to the higher price for aluminum, the primary raw material, which directly affected the selling price. Axtel had revenues of US$822 in 2017, a 12% increase in dollar terms compared to 2016. This improvement is mainly due to the business and government sectors, and includes greater cloud market share, based on the financial and IT security sectors. To do this Axtel banked on infrastructure growth, such as the opening of the first room of the second Data Center in Querétaro, which covers 600mts² dedicated to hosting. It also consolidated agreements with the largest public cloud services in Mexico, seeking to become the first MultiCloud Service Provider in the country, offering integral solutions based on the cloud hosted in its Data Center. It also continued expansion of its service portfolio with Cisco as technology partner. Finally, in Newpek, even though there was a slight recovery in prices of hydrocarbons, the drop in oil and gas prices since mid-2014 affected operating and financial performance in 2017. As a result, the company continued focusing its activities on reducing operational costs in its assets, without jeopardizing their operation and focusing investment on exploration, drilling and well termination. In the US drilling resumed in Eagle Ford Shale, with 20 new wells, raising the total number of production wells to 648. In Mexico it continued operating the mature oil wells in San Andres and Tierra Blanca, located in Veracruz, and reached a total of 137 wells with an average production of 3.6 thousand barrels of petroleum equivalent per day (MBPED). Sales volume was 4.8 thousand barrels of petroleum equivalent per day (MBPED), a drop of 34%. In 2017 Newpek revenues totaled US$107 million, similar to the prior year. 43 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS OPERATING INCOME The operating income of ALFA in 2018, 2017 and 2016 is illustrated below: 2018-2017: OPERATING INCOME VARIATION BY GROUP 2018 2017 VAR. ALPEK SIGMA NEMAK AXTEL NEWPEK OTHER Revenues 366,432 317,627 48,805 35,525 7,678 5,548 48 24 (18) Operating income 35,705 11,195 24,510 24,056 (1,153) 808 2,291 (1,215) (277) Consolidated operating margin (%) 9.7 3.5 Alpek (%) 15.8 (2.9) Sigma (%) 6.1 7.5 Nemak (%) 8.7 8.3 Axtel (%) 23.8 9.1 Newpek (%) (92.9) (34.3) In 2018, consolidated operating income enjoyed an increase of 219% (expressed in Mexican pesos) and 231% (expressed in US dollars) compared to 2017. The explanations for the performance of each ALFA business are shown below: Alpek had an outstanding year, with operating income growth of 676% compared to 2017, in dollar terms. Greater margins in polyester and polypropylene, plus the incorporation of Petroquimica Suape y Citepe as of May 2018, provided a strong boost for results, apart from the increase in oil and hydrocarbons prices over much of the year. Operating income includes extraordinary items due to a gain in business combination of US$220 million, recognized for the purchase of Petroquimica Suape and Citepe in Brazil and a reversal in the impairment of intangible assets in the Corpus Christi operation (M&G) for US$195 million. Excluding the effect of extraordinary items, the operating income of Alpek increased by 101% compared to 2017, mainly due to the improvement in polyester margins described above. With regards to Sigma, despite increased sales, operating incomes dropped 15% compared to 2017, in dollar terms, mainly due to extraordinary events recorded in Campofrio for impairment of assets. Excluding these effects, the operating income of Sigma in 2018 is 2% higher than 2017 in dollar terms. This result was based on a solid performance in the Mexican and Latin American operations, whereas greater costs for raw materials and distribution affected US margins. Nemak generated a 10% increase in operating income for the year, measured in dollars. This was due to different factors, including a higher price for aluminium, operating efficiencies and a better product mix, higher North American demand and underperformance in Europe and Asia. Nemak continued to take advantage of its leadership in technology, as well as international diversification to move towards solutions for lightweighting and opportunities in structural components and electric vehicles. 44 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS Operating income at Axtel increased by 146% in dollar terms compared to 2017, due to the partial sale of its mass segment fiber business, the sale of the last batch of its telecommunications towers, and the boost from the business and government segment, where it enjoyed solid growth by expanding and improving the services portfolio. Excluding the effect of extraordinary items, operating income increased by 17% compared to 2017. In 2018, Newpek dealed with higher international oil prices, which then fell at the end of the year. Newpek also completed the sale of the two territorial assets located in Texas, together with its partners Pioneer Natural Resources and Reliance Industries. These two factors, plus the impairment of its assets in BPZ, the Peruvian operation, generated an operating loss for Newpek in 2018. 2017-2016: OPERATING INCOME VARIATION BY GROUP 2018 2017 VAR. ALPEK SIGMA NEMAK AXTEL NEWPEK OTHER Revenues 317,627 293,782 23,845 8,806 7,881 5,535 1,769 45 (191) Operating income 11,195 24,214 (13,019) (12,717) 72 (1,669) 921 1,246 (872) Consolidated operating margin (%) 3.5 8.2 Alpek (%) (2.9) 10.9 Sigma (%) 7.5 8.0 Nemak (%) 8.3 11.0 Axtel (%) 9.1 3.5 Newpek (%) (34.3) (97.7) The 54% drop in consolidated operating income from 2017 over 2016 is due to the individual performance of the ALFA companies, as discussed below: In Alpek, while greater margins in polyester enhanced performance, especially in the second half, operating income was adversely affected by the shutdown of Mossi & Ghisolfi (M&G), its main customer, which resulted in the recording of nonrecurring provisions and impairments of receivables and other intangible and financial assets, as well as the temporary suspension of the PTA supply to two plants of that company. With regard to plastics and chemicals, the drop in operating income in the plastics and chemicals segment was lower than expected due to higher margins in polypropylene, expandable polystyrene and caprolactam. In Sigma, operating income increased 1% compared to the prior year, mainly because in 2017 there was a better performance from Europe and Mexico. Another factor helping growth was the incorporation of two companies engaged in the production of processed meats: Caroli in Rumania and Supemsa in Peru, which enabled it to enter the Eastern European market and assume a market leadership role in the South American country. Over the year Nemak suffered a 19% drop in operating income compared to the previous year, measured in pesos. This was mainly due to the underperforming North American market, which was only partially offset by the better performance of the automotive market in Europe and China, and the time lag needed to pass on aluminum price increases to customers and incremental increases due to the launch of new programs. In dollar terms the drop is 21%. 45 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS In 2017, Axtel had a successful year. In operating terms, the merger of Alestra and Axtel cut expenses and helped to streamline both functions and infrastructure. Improved performance in the business and government segments and the sale of its telecommunications towers also enhanced results. All of these factors helped boost operating income by 190% in Mexican pesos, and 174% in US dollars terms. In Newpek, operating income continued to suffer from a combination of international oil prices and lower production of hydrocarbons due to the natural decline in operating wells. It was also affected by an impairment in its unproven reserves. REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME COMPOSITION The percentage structure of revenues between 2018 and 2017 shows an upturn mainly in the business of Alpek, and a downturn in Sigma, Nemak and Axtel, with no major changes between 2017 and 2016. There were significant changes for ALFA between 2018 and 2017, largely due to an increase in the operating income of Alpek, which reduced the percentage of the other businesses. Such variances were explained above.

Operations between the Company and its shareholders, mainly dividends paid, are excluded. Comprehensive income and loss for 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows: COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) 2018 2017 2016 Net income (loss) 17,960 (1,428) 4,735 Translation of foreign entities (5,226) 1,223 16,058 Effects of derivative financial instruments (554) 162 419 Actuarial losses from employee benefits 122 (91) (81) Other comprehensive profit and loss items for the year (5,658) 1,294 16,396 Comprehensive income (loss) for the year 12,302 (134) 21,131 Attributable to: Controlling interest 8,301 (906) 15,473 Noncontrolling interest 4,001 772 5,658 A previous section of this report explains the net income obtained in 2018, 2017 and 2016; the translation effect of foreign entities, which is the product of using different exchange rates between the balance sheet accounts and income statements accounts. During this year there was significant movement due to volatility in the exchange rates of the currencies of different countries where ALFA has operations. The equity effect of financial derivatives represents the effect from energy derivatives, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, and is presented in stockholders’ equity. The effect of actuarial results of the labor liability is due to the variation in actuarial estimates. 51 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS DIVIDENDS DECLARED AND CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY In 2018, ALFA S.A.B. declared a dividend of $3,154 equivalent to $0.62 per share. For the year 2017 it declared a dividend of $3,312, equivalent to $0.65 per share. For the year 2016 it declared a dividend of $3,043 equivalent to $0.59 per share. In 2018, total stockholders’ equity increased by 7%, in dollar terms, due to a net favorable result, and the conversion effect of foreign entities and dividends. INVESTMENT IN DAYS NWC(1) In 2018 at a consolidated level, the ratio of revenues to NWC behaved similarly to that of 2017, with a slight change in the main subsidiaries, which meant that the NWC days at a consolidated level have the same figure of 13 in 2018 and 2017.

In Alpek the incorporation of Petroquimica Suape and Citepe was completed in Brazil, as well as the establishment of Corpus Christi Polymers LLC, a joint venture created together with Indorama Ventures Holdings LP and Far Eastern Investment (Holding) Limited, in which it signed a purchase of assets agreement with M&G USA Corp. and its affiliated debtors ( M&G Corp. ) to acquire the PTA-PET integrated plant under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas, as well as certain intellectual property of M&G Corp. and a desalination plant/boiler which supplies water and steam to the site. Furthermore, Axtel sold off part of its mass segment fiber business, as well as the last batch of its telecommunications towers. In the energy sector Newpek completed the sale of two territorial assets located in Texas, USA. Such operations improved ALFA’s financial position so that it can capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its market leadership position. 53 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSIONS & ANALYSIS CASH FLOWS Starting with the line item Cash Flows generated from operations, the chart below shows the main transactions for 2018 and 2017. 2018 2017 Cash flows generated from operations 35,050 34,403 Property, plant and equipment and other (15,602) (19,139) Investment in acquisitions of subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures (12,974) (1,697) (Decrease) increase in Bank Financing (44) 13,256 Dividends paid by ALFA, S.

A. B. de C. V. OPINION We have audited the consolidated financial statements of Alfa, S. A. B. de C. V. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”), which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the consolidated statements of income, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the consolidated statements of changes in equity and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the years then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”), as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. BASIS FOR OPINION We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISA”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (“IESBA Code”) together with the Code of Ethics issued by the Mexican Institute of Public Accountants (“IMCP Code”), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code and with the IMCP Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. KEY AUDIT MATTERS Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined that the matters described below are the key audit matters which should be communicated in our report. BUSINESS COMBINATION COMPANHIA PETROQUÍMICA DE PERNAMBUCO (PETROQUÍMICA SUAPE) Y COMPANHIA INTEGRADA TEXTIL DE PERNAMBUCO (CITEPE) As disclosed in Note 2b. to the consolidated financial statements, Alpek, S. A. B. de C. V. (“Alpek”), subsidiary of the Company, acquired all of the shares representing the respective share capital of Petroquímica SUAPE and CITEPE. Both companies operate an integrated PTA-PET site in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil, with an installed capacity of 640,000 and 450,000 tons per year of PTA and PET, respectively. The total consideration amounted to US$435 million, paid in Brazilian reals at the closing date of the transaction. The fair value of the assets acquired and assumed liabilities determined and recognized at the acquisition date amounted to US$792 million and US$137 million, respectively. Additionally, a gain in business combination of US$220 million was recognized. 59 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT Due to the significant judgments used by management in the valuation models to determine the consideration, the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly property, plant and equipment, as well as the intangible assets, we involved our experts in valuation to evaluate the premises and criteria used by the administration and its independent expert and we carry out the following procedures: • We evaluated the capacity and independence of the independent expert. • We verified that the models used by the administration to determine the fair values were those used and recognized to value assets with similar characteristics in the industry. • We challenged the financial projections of the administration and compare them with the performance and historical trends of the Company's businesses. • We evaluated that the projections of the administration were consistent with those approved by the Board of Directors of the Company. • We reviewed the most relevant valuation assumptions (discount rate, multiple of EBITDA, sales multiples, as well as the determination of the useful life of the assets), and compared them with independent market sources. The results of our procedures were satisfactory and we agree with the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed recognized. JOINT VENTURE GRUPO MOSSI & GHISOLFI (“M&G”) As disclosed in Note 2c. y 2h., to the consolidated financial statements, in 2015, Alpek, subsidiary of the Company, entered into agreements with M&G Resins USA, LLC (“M&G”), one for capacity reservation and another of tolling services, for which the latter agreed to supply PET for its plant to be constructed in Corpus Christi, Texas. As a result of these agreements, Alpek paid $7,745 million (US$435 million). In 2017, due to M&G’s inability to complete the construction of the plant, Alpek decided to recognize an impairment for $11,456 million ($8,721, net of taxes) for its assets associated with M&G. In October 2017, M&G, as owner of the assets under construction, requested a voluntary reorganization petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States of America ( USA ). As a result of the foregoing, during 2018 Alpek, Indorama Ventures, LLC ( Indorama ) and Far Eastern Investment ( Far Eastern ) made a joint proposal to the bankruptcy administrator for the acquisition of the aforementioned assets under construction and created a joint venture for this purpose, from which the constitution of Corpus Christi Polymers LLC ( CCP ) was incorporated as the legal vehicle for the acquisition. The acquisition agreement for the assets amounted to US$1,199 million in cash and other capital contributions (capacity reservation) made by CCP in 2018. Alpek was recognized for its US$200 million contribution, which partially represented the capacity reservation rights paid in 2015, US$133 million as part of its contributions to CCP and US$67 million (US$62 at present value) for the sale to Indorama and Far Eastern of one sixth of said capacity reservation agreement, and therefore, Alpek reversed US$195 million of the impairment recognized in 2017. Due to the significant judgments used by management to determine the partial reversal of the impairment of Alpek's assets arising from the operation with M&G, our audit procedures focused on reviewing the significant elements and judgments considered by the Company. Regarding the recognized effects of reversal of impairment, we obtained and read the contractual agreements of the transaction and carried out the following procedures: • We reviewed the contractual agreements between the joint venture participants. • We reviewed the cash contributions made to CCP and the legal documentation that supports the contribution of capacity reservation rights. • We verified the authorization granted by the competition authorities of the United States of America for the acquisition of the assets of M&G. • We discussed with management and confirmed that at the date of the consolidated financial statements all the obligations of the parties to comply with the acquisition have been fulfilled. The results of our procedures were satisfactory and we agree with the judgments used by management to reverse the impairment. 60 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL As described in Notes 3l., 3m. and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment tests on its intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill on an annual basis. We have been focused in the review of the intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and goodwill, mainly due to the importance of the intangible assets balance in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, which consists of goodwill of $22,798 million and trademarks of $13,389 million, and because impairment tests involve the application of significant judgments by the Company’s management in determining the assumptions related to the estimation of the recoverable value allocated to its cash generating units ( CGUs ). As part of our audit, we focused on the following significant assumptions that the Company considered when estimating future projections to assess the recoverability of intangible assets: growth rate of the industry, new projects and significant customers, estimated revenues, discount rates, expected gross profit margin and projected cash flows. With support from our expert appraisers, our procedures, among others, included: • We reviewed the models applied to determine the recoverable value of the assets and methods used and accepted for valuing assets with similar characteristics. • We challenged the financial projections by comparing them to the business performance and historical trends, verifying the explanations of the variations with management. In addition, we assessed the internal processes used by management to make projections, including timely monitoring and analysis by the Board of Directors, and if the projections are consistent with the budgets approved by the Board. • We analyzed the assumptions used in the impairment model, specifically including the cash flow projections, EBITDA multiple and long-term growth plans. The key assumptions used to estimate cash flows in impairment tests of the Company are those related to revenue growth and operating margin. • Independent assessment of discount rates used and the methodology used in the preparation of the model of the impairment test. In addition, we tested the integrity and accuracy of the impairment model. • We evaluated the factors and variables used to determine the CGUs, among which were considered the analysis of operating cash flows and borrowing policies, analysis of the legal structure, allocation of production and understanding of the operation of the commercial area and sales. • We discussed with management the sensitivity calculations for all CGUs, calculating the degree to which the assumptions used will need to be changed, and the likeliness these changes may arise. The results of our procedures were satisfactory, and we believe the assumptions used, including the discount rate, are reasonable. 61 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS The Company records deferred income tax assets derived from tax loss carryforward. Management performed an assessment of the probability of recovering the tax losses carryforward to support the deferred tax assets recognized on its consolidated financial statements. Due to the importance of the balance of the deferred tax asset derived from the tax loss carryforward as of December 31, 2018, amounting to $6,903 million, and to significant judgments and estimates to determine the future projections of the Company's tax results, we focus on this area and perform, among others, the following procedures: • We verified the reasonableness of the projections used to determine future taxable income. • We challenged the projections used by comparing them to the business performance and historical trends, verifying the explanations of the variations with management. • With the support of tax experts, we assessed the processes used to determine the projected taxable income, and the assumptions used by management in preparing tax projections. • We discussed with management the sensitivity analysis and assessed the degree to which the key assumptions used would need to be modified in order for an adjustment to be considered for evaluation. The results of our audit procedures were satisfactory. The Company’s accounting policy for the recording of deferred taxes, as well as the detail of their disclosure are included in Notes 3o. and 17, respectively, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. INFORMATION OTHER THAN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AUDITOR’S REPORT THEREON Management is responsible for the other information presented. The other information includes two documents, the Annual Stock Exchange Filing and the information that will be incorporated in the Annual Report that the Company must prepare pursuant to the General Provisions Applicable to Issuers and other Participants in the Mexican Stock Exchange and file it with the National Banking and Securities Commission (“CNBV” for its acronym in Spanish). The Annual Stock Exchange Filing and the Annual Report are expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditors’ report. Our opinion of the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance over it. In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility will be to read the other information, when available, and in doing so, consider whether the other information contained therein is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or with our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to contain a material error. If based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter in a statement in the Annual Report required by the CNBV and those charged with governance in the Company. 62 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company’s consolidated financial reporting process. AUDITOR’S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • I­dentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • ­Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control. • ­Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • ­Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • ­Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • ­Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Company and subsidiaries to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Company and subsidiaries audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. 63 INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The Senior Notes mature in ten years at a coupon of 4.875%. The transaction proceeds were mainly used to prepay 2022 Campofrío Senior Notes and for general corporate purposes. Nemak On January 11, 2018, Nemak issued Senior Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange and on the Global Exchange Market in the amount of US$500, through a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Senior Notes accrue an annual coupon of 4.750%, maturing in 7 years. The proceeds were mainly used to prepay other financial liabilities with shorter maturity terms. 71 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Axtel On February 22, 2018, Axtel’s syndicated long-term credit with HSBC Mexico was increased by $291 from the original amount of $5,709 to $6,000, with the same terms as the original credit. The proceeds obtained from this additional loan were used to pay short-term debt of $400 with HSBC Mexico. On August 30, 2018, Axtel entered into a debt restructuring agreement with Bancomext to exchange the original debt of US$171 to a new debt of $3,263. The terms of the new debt is 10 years with quarterly principal payments from the third year and with a 91-day TIIE interest rate plus 2.10 basis points. b. Acquisition of Petroquímica SUAPE and CITEPE On April 30, 2018, Alpek completed the acquisition of 100% of Companhia Petroquímica de Pernambuco ( Petroquímica Suape ) and Companhia Integrada Têxtil de Pernambuco ( Citepe ), owned by Petróleo Brasileiro, S.A. ( Petrobras ), through DAK Americas Exterior, S.L. and Grupo Petrotemex, S. A. de C. V., with stakes of 99.99% and 0.01%, respectively. The total consideration paid by Alpek was US$435, free of debt, which was paid in Brazilian reals at the closing date of the transaction. As a result of this transaction, Alpek acquired an integrated PTA-PET site in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil, with a capacity of 640,000 and 450,000 tons per year of PTA and PET, respectively. Citepe also operates a textured polyester filament plant with a capacity of 90,000 tons per year. The operation was carried out due to Alpek’s strategy of making continuous and selected investments in integration, efficiency and expansion projects, in order to achieve a sustainable growth. The consolidated financial statements of Alpek include the financial information of Petroquímica Suape and Citepe as of the date of acquisition. The acquisition of the business is included in the Polyester segment of Alpek. The acquisition of Petroquímica Suape y Citepe met the criteria of a business combination in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, for which Alpek applied the acquisition method to measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The purchase price allocation was determined in 2018, and the adjustments derived from acquisition method accounting were recognized from the date of acquisition. 72 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of this acquisition are as follows: Inventories US$101 Other current assets (1) 162 Recoverable taxes 115 Property, plant and equipment, net 353 Intangible assets(2) 21 Other non-current assets (3) 40 Current liabilities (4) (87) Provisions (5) (50) Net acquired assets 655 Gain on business combination 220 Consideration paid US$435 (1) Current assets consist of cash and cash equivalents for US$18, accounts receivable for US$98, recoverable taxes for US$45 and others for US$1. (2) Intangible assets consist of customer relationships, which guarantee the existence and continuity of the business from the moment of acquisition. (3) The other non-current assets consist of an indemnification asset for US$23 and others for US$17. The indemnification asset corresponds to the right of reimbursement in case of any disbursement that is made corresponding to labor and civil contingencies. (4) Current liabilities consist of suppliers and accounts payable for US$77 and others for US$10. (5) Provisions consist of provisions for labor contingencies for US$6, provisions for civil contingencies for US$18, provisions for tax contingencies for US$11 and provisions for reimbursement of taxes recovered to Petrobras for US$15. As a result of this transaction, a gain associated with the business combination was recognized for an amount of US$220, recorded in 2018 (Note 24). The gain associated with the business combination is the result of Petrobras divesting of these operations as part of its Strategic Plan, in order to optimize its business portfolio and cease its participation in the petrochemical industry; the aforementioned portfolio included the plan to sell Petroquímica Suape and Citepe. The consolidated statement of cash flows in 2018 presents the incorporation of the operations of Petroquímica Suape and Citepe into a single line within the investment activity, net of cash acquired. c. Acquisition of Corpus Christi Project from Grupo Mossi & Ghisolfi (“M&G”) On March 21, 2018, Alpek announced its participation in the creation of Corpus Christi Polymers LLC ( CCP ), a joint venture formed together with Indorama Ventures Holdings LP ( Indorama ) and Far Eastern Investment (Holding) Limited ( Far Eastern ), through which it signed an asset purchase agreement with M&G USA Corp. and its affiliated debtors ( M&G Corp. ) to acquire the integrated PTA-PET plant currently under construction in Corpus Christi, Texas, as well as certain intellectual property of M&G Corp. and a desalination/boiler plant that supplies water and steam to the place (the Corpus Christi Project ). 73 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On December 28, 2018, Alpek announced that CCP completed the acquisition of the Corpus Christi Project, for an aggregate amount of US$1,199 in cash and other capital contributions. Of this amount, Alpek contributed US$283 in cash and US$133 in other capital contributions, which correspond to a portion of its secured claim with M&G, arising under the Corpus Christi Capacity Reservation Agreement (“Capacity Reservation Agreement”). In addition, Alpek agreed to sell the rest of the Capacity Reservation Agreement to Indorama and Far Eastern (the buyers ), for which it will obtain US$67 in cash, which will be payable in 3 years in equal parts from each of the buyers, subject to certain conditions. Alpek will recognize its investment in CCP as a joint venture through the equity method. Once finished, the plant will have a nominal production capacity of 1.1 million and 1.3 million metric tons per year of PET and PTA, respectively. In accordance with the terms of CCP, the partners will provide resources to complete the Corpus Christi Project in the most efficient way. As of December 31, 2018, Alpek has invested US$416 and it is estimated that the project will be completed by the end of 2021. Additionally, Alpek, Indorama and Far Eastern will each have the right to receive one third of the PTA and PET produced by the Corpus Christi Project upon completion. Moreover, each one is responsible for acquiring their raw materials independently, as well as carrying out the sale and distribution of their corresponding PTA and PET. In line with the foregoing, Alpek recognized the reversal of a portion of the impairment recorded in 2017 on intangible assets (see Note 2h), for US$195, which correspond to the amount that Alpek expects to recover from the Capacity Reservation Agreement, which is recognized as part of its investment in CCP for US$133, and as an account receivable from its joint venture partners for US$62 (recognized at present value). d. Sale of Mass Segment of Axtel On December 17, 2018, Axtel divested a significant portion of its Mass Segment through the sale of assets, shares, inventories, receivables and telecommunications equipment to Grupo Televisa in exchange for consideration of $4,713. As of December 31, 2018, the rest of the Mass Segment not contemplated in this transaction continues to be operated by Axtel. The divestment is part of Axtel's business strategy to be the leading provider of information and communication technology solutions in the Business and Government Segments in Mexico. On December 21, 2018, with the proceeds obtained from the transaction, Axtel made a partial prepayment of the syndicated loan held with HSBC, as lead coordinator of the participating financial institutions, for $4,350, reducing the outstanding principal balance to $1,570 as of December 31, 2018. Debt issuance costs of $27 pending to be amortized and that corresponded to the amount of the prepayment, were recognized in results in the statement of income. For Alfa, the gain of $2,256 was recognized in the result of the year ended December 31, 2018 in the caption Other income (expenses), net . e. Acquisition of Sociedad Suizo Peruana de Embutidos, S. A. On July 1, 2017, Sigma acquired 100% of the common shares of Sociedad Suizo Peruana de Embutidos, S.A. (“SUPEMSA”) for US$38. The acquired entity is engaged in the production of processed meat and marketing of dairy products in Peru, and is included in the Latam. The acquisition qualified as a business combination in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations ( IFRS 3 ); therefore, Sigma applied the purchase method to measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Sigma recognized goodwill of $320, which was recognized in 2018, when the allocation of fair values of the net assets acquired was concluded; however, 2017 amounts were not restated given the immaterial nature of the purchase price adjustments in 2018. SUPEMSA’s results have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date; therefore, the consolidated statements of income for 2017 are not comparable with those of the current year. The 2017 consolidated statement of cash flows presents the incorporation of SUPEMSA’s operations in a single line within the investment activity, net of acquired cash. 74 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS f. Acquisition of Caroli Foods Group B. V. On September 1, 2017, Sigma acquired the remaining 51% of the shares of Caroli Foods Group B.V. (“Caroli”) for $1,054, whereby Sigma became the sole owner. Caroli is an entity engaged in the production and marketing of processed meat and prepared meals in Pitesti, Romania, where it has operated for over 23 years, and it is included in the Europe sector. Sigma already owned 49% of the shares and, with this transaction, it acquired all the shares of Caroli; therefore, under IFRS 3, the transaction is deemed an acquisition in stages. According to this standard, Sigma revalued the previously held 49% interest of the shares of Caroli at fair value at the acquisition date of the remaining 51% of the shares of this entity; therefore, it recognized a gain in the consolidated statement of income of 2017 of $410 (equivalent to €18.5). The acquisition of 51% of the shares of Caroli was classified as a business combination in accordance with IFRS 3 requirements; therefore, Sigma applied the purchase method to measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. Sigma recognized goodwill of $2,150, which was recognized in 2018, when Sigma completed the allocation of fair values of the net assets acquired; however, 2017 amounts were not restated given the immaterial nature of the identified acquisition adjustments. Caroli’s results have been included in the consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date; therefore, the consolidated statements of income for 2017 are not comparable with those of the current year. In addition, the 2017 consolidated statement of cash flows presents the incorporation of Caroli’s operations in a single line within investing activities, net of acquired cash, whereas for 2018, the cash flows corresponding to this business are presented within each of the corresponding operating, investing and financing activities. During 2018, Sigma remeasured the interest of 49% of the shares of Caroli at fair value as of September 30, 2018, due to an adjustment in the estimate of the earn-out payable to the sellers and based on Caroli’s improved performance than initially estimated; therefore, it recognized a gain in the consolidated statement of income of $224 (equivalent to €10). 2017 g. Issuance and prepayment of debt Sigma On February 2, 2017, Sigma Alimentos, S. A. de C. V. issued Senior Notes on the Irish Stock Exchange through a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S, in the amount of €600, gross from issuance costs of €5.4 and discounts of €2.2. The Senior Notes mature in seven years at a coupon of 2.625%. The transaction resources were mainly used to pay debt. On March 9, 2017, Sigma prepaid the Senior Notes maturing on December 14, 2018, in the amount of US$450, incurring a cost for the prepayment of US$20 recognized as a financial expense in the consolidated statement of income. The Notes were issued in 2011 under Rule 144A and Regulation S at an annual coupon of 5.625%. All transaction costs to be amortized previously presented net of debt were recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017 for US$1.9. Nemak On March 9, 2017, Nemak issued Senior Notes on the international market that were listed on the Irish Stock Exchange in the amount of €500, through a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S. The Senior Notes accrue an annual coupon of 3.25%, maturing in 7 years. The proceeds were mainly used to prepay other financial liabilities with shorter maturity terms. 75 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Axtel On November 9, 2017, Axtel placed Senior Notes in the international market and listed on the Irish Stock Exchange under a private offering under Rule 144A and Regulation S in the amount of US$500, gross of issuance costs of US$7. The Senior Notes accrue an annual coupon of 6.375% maturing in 7 years. The proceeds were mainly used to prepay the existing debt, including certain issuance costs. All transaction costs to be amortized previously presented net of debt were recognized in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017, for $53. Additionally, on December 19, 2017, Axtel signed a bilateral credit agreement with HSBC México, for an amount of $5,709 (equivalent to US$300) with a maturity of 5 years and at a variable interest rate with a margin on the TIIE rate applicable according to the leverage ratio between 1.875% and 3.25%. The proceeds obtained were used to prepay the remaining debt of the syndicated loan, denominated mainly in dollars. h. Impairment of assets from supply agreements with several subsidiaries of Mossi & Ghisolfi Group (“M&G”) and agreement to provide secured financing to M&G Mexico During 2015, Alpek held a licensing agreement for IntegRex® PTA technology and another PTA-PET supply agreement with M&G Resins USA, LLC (“M&G Resins”). These agreements will allow M&G to use the IntegRex® PTA technology in the PTA-PET integrated plant to be constructed in Corpus Christi, Texas in the United States of America. Resulting from this agreement, Alpek paid US$435 to M&G Resins, of which US$360 were recognized as an intangible asset, to be amortized based on their production volumes, and US$75 were recognized as an inventory advance within the prepayment line item. However, during 2017 M&G suspended payments and began formal restructuring of its operations, including bankruptcy filings in the United States and Italy, due to its liquidity problems. As a result of the foregoing, Alpek recognized an impairment due to the following concepts: IMPAIRMENT AMOUNT DEFERRED TAX EFFECT RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME Intangible assets and advanced payments US$435 $ 7,745 $ 1,658 $ 6,087 Trade and other accounts receivable (1) 113 2,017 560 1,457 Long-term notes receivable(1) 94 1,694 517 1,177 (1) Held with various subsidiaries of M&G. Subsequently, on October 9, 2017, Alpek entered into a transfer-of-rights agreement with Banco Inbursa, S.A., on an unsecured loan agreement bearing interest and mortgage guarantee with M&G Polímeros México, S. A. of C. V. ( M&G Polímeros México ). The consideration for the assignment of rights paid by Alpek amounts to $1,870 (US$100), which were recognized in the consolidated financial statements as other non-current assets. This contract gives Alpek a right in the first instance over the other creditors of M&G Polímeros México and is guaranteed by a PET plant in Altamira, Mexico, whose fair value exceeds the amount of the right to payment maintained by Alpek. 76 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS On December 29, 2017 Alpek signed an agreement to provide secured financing to M&G Polímeros México, S. A. de C. V. (“M&G Mexico”). The new credit facility is secured by a second lien on M&G Polímeros México’s PET production facility in Altamira, Mexico, and has a two-year term for a maximum principal amount of US$60 that will be disbursed in several intervals subject to certain conditions, including a restructuring plan that should be presented by M&G Polímeros México and approved by its creditors. The new credit facility is intended to support M&G Polímeros México’s PET operations during its restructuring process. i. Adjustment to Alfa shareholding On July 18, 2017 and in accordance with the resolutions adopted at the General Stockholders’ Extraordinary Meeting held on January 15, 2016 relating to the merger of Onexa, S. A. of C.V., Axtel, proceeds to deliver to Alfa 1,019,287,950 Class I shares of Series B , representing an additional ownership to Alfa of 2.50% in Axtel. The shares were previously held in the Axtel’s Treasury and its payment to Alfa cancelled the liability previously recognized by Axtel as a consideration for the merger. 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The following are the most significant accounting policies followed by Alfa and its subsidiaries, which have been consistently applied in the preparation of their financial information in the years presented, unless otherwise specified: a. Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Alfa, S. A. B. de C. V. and subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). IFRS include all International Accounting Standards ( IAS ) in force and all related interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”), including those previously issued by the Standard Interpretations Committee (“SIC”). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the cash flow hedges which are measured at fair value, and for the financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss with changes reflected in the consolidated statement of income and for financial assets available for sale. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. Additionally, it requires management to exercise judgment in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where judgments and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are disclosed in Note 5. b. Consolidation i. Subsidiaries The subsidiaries are all the entities over which the Company has control. The Company controls an entity when it is exposed, or has the right to variable returns from its interest in the entity and it is capable of affecting the returns through its power over the entity. When the Company's interest in subsidiaries is less than 100%, the interest attributed to external stockholders is recorded as non-controlling interest. Subsidiaries are consolidated in full from the date on which control is transferred to the Company and up to the date it loses such control. 77 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The accounting method used by the Company for business combinations is the acquisition method. The Company defines a business combination as a transaction in which it gains control of a business, and through which it is able to direct and manage the relevant activities of the set of assets and liabilities of such business with the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, smaller costs or other economic benefits directly to stockholders. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Identifiable acquired assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree based on the share of the non-controlling interest in the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity. The Company accounts for business combinations using the predecessor method in a jointly controlled entity. The predecessor method involves the incorporation of the carrying amounts of the acquired entity, which includes the goodwill recognized at the consolidated level with respect to the acquiree. Any difference between the transferred consideration and the carrying amount of the net assets acquired at the level of the subsidiary are recognized in equity. The acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses when incurred. Goodwill is initially measured as excess of the sum of the consideration transferred and the fair value of the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets and liabilities assured. If the consideration transferred is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statement of income. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the book value at the acquisition date of the interest previously held by the Company in the acquired entity is remeasured at its fair value at the acquisition date. Any loss or gain resulting from such remeasurement is recorded in results of the year. Transactions and intercompany balances, as well as unrealized gains on transactions between Alfa’s companies are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. In order to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company, the amounts recorded by subsidiaries have been changed where it was deemed necessary. 78 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the primary subsidiary companies of Alfa were as follows: SHAREHOLDING (%) (2) COUNTRY(1) 2018 2017 FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY ALPEK (PETROCHEMICALS AND SYNTHETIC FIBERS) Alpek, S.

(5) Companies acquired in 2018, see Note 2. (6) In 2017, 100% of the shares were acquired. Prior to the acquisition, Sigma owned 49% of the shares. (7) In 2017, the Extraordinary General Stockholders’ Meeting decided that, concerning the merger of Onexa, S.A. de C.V. with Axtel, 1,019,287,950 Class I Series B shares, equivalent to 2.50% of Axtel’s capital stock will be delivered to Alfa. (8) The purchase agreement of this entity included an earn-out clause for the production of PETG. Under this clause, the selling party kept in stock the shares not acquired by Alpek, which could be released to the extent that Alpek completed the first production run of PETG. At the end of 2018, Alpek maintains 50% + 1 shareholding. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there are no significant restrictions for investment in shares of subsidiary companies mentioned above. ii. Absorption (dilution) of control in subsidiaries The effect of absorption (dilution) of control in subsidiaries, that is, an increase or decrease in the percentage of control, is recorded in stockholders' equity, directly in retained earnings, in the period in which the transactions that cause such effects occur. The effect of absorption (dilution) of control is determined by comparing the book value of the investment in shares before the event of dilution or absorption against the book value after the relevant event. In the case of loss of control, the dilution effect is recognized in income. 82 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS When the Company has issued a call option on certain non-controlling interests in a consolidated subsidiary. The exercise price of the option is determined according to a predefined formula based on the financial performance of the subsidiary and can be exercised on a certain date. Put options granted to noncontrolling stockholders that hold the risks and benefits on the net assets of the consolidated subsidiary are recognized as financial liabilities at the present value of the amount to be reimbursed of the options, initially recorded with a corresponding reduction in the Equity and subsequently accrue through financial charges in results during the contractual period. iii. Sale or disposal of subsidiaries When the Company ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured at fair value, and the change in the carrying amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of accounting for any subsequent retained interest in the associate, joint venture or financial asset. Any amount previously recognized in comprehensive income in respect of that entity is accounted for as if the Company had directly disposed of the related assets and liabilities. This results in the amounts previously recognized in comprehensive income being reclassified to income for the year. iv. Associates Associates are all entities over which the Company has significant influence but not control. Generally, an investor must hold between 20% and 50% of the voting rights in an investee for it to be an associate. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The Company's investment in associates includes goodwill identified at acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss. If the equity in an associate is reduced but significant influence is maintained, only a portion of the amounts recognized in the comprehensive income are reclassified to income for the year, where appropriate. The Company's share of profits or losses of associates, post-acquisition, is recognized in the consolidated statement of income and its share in the other comprehensive income of associates is recognized as other comprehensive income. When the Company's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its equity in the associate, including unsecured receivables, the Company does not recognize further losses unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If so, the Company calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes it in share of profit of associates recognized by the equity method in the consolidated statement of income. Unrealized gains on transactions between the Company and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Company´s equity in such gains. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence that the asset transferred is impaired. In order to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Company, the accounting policies of associates have been modified. When the Company ceases to have significant influence over an associate, any difference between the fair value of the remaining investment, including any consideration received from the partial disposal of the investment and the book value of the investment is recognized in the consolidated statement of income. v. Joint ventures Joint arrangements are those where there is joint control since the decisions over relevant activities require the unanimous consent of each one of the parties sharing control. 83 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Investments in joint arrangements are classified in accordance with the contractual rights and obligations of each investor such as: joint operations or joint ventures. When the Company holds the right over assets and obligations for related assets under a joint arrangement, this is classified as a joint operation. When the company holds rights over net assets of the joint arrangement, this is classified as a joint venture. The Company has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and classified them as joint ventures. Joint ventures are accounted for by using the equity method applied to an investment in associates. c. Foreign currency translation i. Functional and presentation currency The amounts included in the financial statements of each of the Company's subsidiaries and associates should be measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates ( the functional currency ). In the case of Alfa, S. A. B. de C. V., the functional currency is determined to be the Mexican peso. The consolidated financial statements are presented in Mexican pesos, which is the Company’s presentation currency. When there is a change in the functional currency of one of the subsidiaries, according to International Accounting Standard 21 Effects of changes in foreign exchange rates (“IAS 21”), this change is accounted for prospectively, translating at the date of the functional currency change, all assets, liabilities, equity, and income items at the exchange rate of that date. ii. Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the foreign exchange rates prevailing at the transaction date or valuation date when the amounts are re-measured. Gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing exchange rates are recognized as foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income, except for those which are deferred in comprehensive income and qualify as cash flow hedges. Changes in the fair value of securities or monetary financial assets denominated in foreign currency classified as available for sale are divided between fluctuations resulting from changes in the amortized cost of such securities and other changes in value. Subsequently, currency fluctuations are recognized in income and changes in the carrying amount arising from any other circumstances are recognized as part of comprehensive income. Translation of subsidiaries with recording currency other than the functional currency. The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, having a recording currency different from their functional currency were translated into the functional currency in accordance with the following procedure: • The balances of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in the recording currency were translated at the closing exchange rate. • To the historical balances of monetary assets and liabilities and stockholders’ equity translated into the functional currency the movements that occurred during the period were added, which were translated at historical exchange rates. In the case of the movements of non-monetary items recognized at fair value, which occurred during the period stated in the recording currency, these were translated using the historical exchange rates in effect on the date when the fair value was determined. • Revenues, costs and expenses of the periods, expressed in the recording currency, were translated at the historical exchange rate of the date they were accrued and recognized in the consolidated statement of income, except when they arose from non-monetary items, in which case the historical exchange rate of the non-monetary items was used. • The exchange differences arising in the translation were recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statement of income in the period they arose. 84 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Translation of subsidiaries with functional currency other than the presentation currency. The results and financial position of all Alfa’s entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows, depending on whether the functional currency comes from a non-hyperinflationary or hyperinflationary environment: Non-hyperinflationary environment • Assets and liabilities for each statement of financial position are translated at the closing exchange rate at the date of the statement of financial position. • Stockholders’ equity of each statement of financial position presented is translated at historical exchange rate. • Revenues and expenses for each statement of income are translated at average exchange rate (when the average exchange rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates of the transaction, to the exchange rate at the date of the transaction is used); and • The resulting exchange differences are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as translation effect. Hyperinflationary environment • Assets, liabilities and equity in the statement of financial position, as well as income and expenses in the income statement, are translated at the closing exchange rate of the statement of financial position, after being restated in its functional currency (Note 3d.); • Assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses of the comparative period, are maintained according to the amount obtained in the translation of the year in question, that is, the financial statements of the preceding period. These amounts are not adjusted to subsequent exchange rates because the Company presents its financial information in Mexican pesos, which correspond to a currency of a non-hyperinflationary environment. The main exchange rates in the different translation procedures are listed below: LOCAL CURRENCY TO MEXICAN PESOS CLOSING EXCHANGE RATE AT DECEMBER 31, AVERAGE ANNUAL EXCHANGE RATE COUNTRY LOCAL CURRENCY 2018 2017 2018 2017 Canada Canadian dollar 14.41 15.74 14.77 15.09 USA US dollar 19.68 19.75 19.20 19.10 Brazil Brazilian real 5.07 5.96 5.24 5.81 Argentina Argentine peso 0.52 1.06 0.70 1.07 Peru Peruvian sol 5.84 6.09 5.83 5.92 Costa Rica Costa Rican Colon 0.03 0.04 0.03 0.04 Ecuador US dollar 19.68 19.75 19.20 19.10 Czech Republic Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 85 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LOCAL CURRENCY TO MEXICAN PESOS CLOSING EXCHANGE RATE AT DECEMBER 31, AVERAGE ANNUAL EXCHANGE RATE COUNTRY LOCAL CURRENCY 2018 2017 2018 2017 Germany Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Austria Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Italy Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 France Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Hungary Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Poland Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Slovakia Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Spain Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Romania Euro 22.51 23.69 22.62 22.92 Russia Russian ruble 0.28 0.34 0.31 0.33 China RenMinBi Chinese yuan 2.86 3.03 2.90 2.92 India Indian rupee 0.28 0.31 0.28 0.30 d. Hyperinflationary effects As of July 1, 2018, the cumulative inflation in Argentina of the prior 3 years exceeded 100%, consequently, the Argentine peso was classified as a currency of a hyperinflationary economic environment. As a result of, the financial statements of the subsidiaries located in that country, whose functional currency is the Argentine peso, have been restated and adjusted for inflation in accordance with the requirements of the International Accounting Standard 29 Financial information in hyperinflationary economies ( IAS 29 ) and they have been consolidated in compliance with the requirements of IAS 21. The purpose of applying these requirements is to consider changes in the general purchasing power of the Argentine peso in order to present the financial statements in the current unit of measurement at the date of the statement of financial position. The financial statements before including any inflation adjustments were prepared using the historical cost method. The Company determined the inflation adjustments in its consolidated financial statements in the following manner: • The amounts corresponding to non-monetary items of each statement of financial position, which are not measured at the date of the statement of financial position at their fair value or net realizable value, as the case may be, are restated applying the variation of a general price index, from the date of acquisition or the date of its last measurement at fair value, to the date of the statement of financial position, to the historical cost; • The amounts corresponding to monetary items of the statement of financial position are not restated; • The components of stockholders’ equity of each statement of financial position are restated: i. iat the beginning of the first period of application of IAS 29, except for retained earnings, by applying the change of a general price index from the dates the components were originated to the date of restatement. Restated retained earnings are derived from all the other balances in the statement of financial position; 86 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ii. at the end of the first period and in subsequent periods, all components of stockholders’ equity are restated by applying a general price index from the beginning of the period or the date of contribution, if later. • Revenues and expenses are restated by applying the variation in the general price index, from the date on which the expenses and revenues were recognized, up to the reporting date. • Gains or losses arising from the net monetary position are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. As of July 1, 2018, the Company reflects the effects of hyperinflation on the financial information of its subsidiaries in Argentina using price indexes that are considered appropriate in accordance with Resolution 539/19 JG ( the Resolution ) of the Argentine Federation of Professional Councils of Economic Sciences. This resolution establishes that a combination of price indices should be used in the calculation of the effects of restatement of financial statements. Therefore, the Company has decided to use the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) to restate balances and transactions that have been generated as of January 2017; and the IPIM (domestic wholesale price index) for balances and transactions generated for all months prior to 2017, except for the months of November and December 2015, due to the fact that said index was not available. For these months, the Company used the IPCBA (consumer price index of the city of Buenos Aires). The effects of the restatement of the financial statements of the subsidiaries located in Argentina, were not material; therefore, they were included in the “Financial result, net” line item of the year ended December 31, 2018. e. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, bank deposits available for operations and other short-term investments of high liquidity with original maturities of three months or less, all of which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and maintain a high credit quality. Bank overdrafts are presented as loans as a part of the current liabilities. f. Restricted cash Cash and cash equivalents whose restrictions cause them not to comply with the definition of cash and cash equivalents given above, are presented in a separate line in the consolidated statement of financial position and are excluded from cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement cash flows. g. Financial instruments Financial assets Through December 31, 2017, the Company classified financial assets into the following categories: at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, investments held to maturity and available for sale. The classification depended on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. Beginning January 1, 2018, in accordance to the adoption of IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, the Company subsequently classifies and measures its financial assets based on the Company’s business model to manage financial assets, and on the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of such assets. This way financial assets can be classified at amortized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income, and at fair value through profit or loss. Management determines the classification of its financial assets upon initial recognition. Purchases and sales of financial assets are recognized at settlement date. Financial assets are entirely written off when the right to receive the related cash flows expires or is transferred and the Company has also substantially transferred all the risks and rewards of its ownership, as well as control of the financial asset. 87 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Classes of financial assets under IAS 39, in effect through December 31, 2017 i. Financial assets at FVTPL Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are financial assets held for trading. A financial asset is classified in this category if it is acquired mainly for the purpose of being sold in the short term. Derivative financial instruments are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Financial assets recorded at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognized at fair value, and transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statement of income. Gains or losses due to changes in fair value of these assets are presented in profit or loss of 2017. Beginning January 1, 2018, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss still maintain their classification according to the assessment of their business model, however, financial assets previously classified in this category at December 31, 2017, did not suffer measurement impacts and were classified as described in Note vii of this section. ii. Loans and receivables Accounts receivable are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or specific payments that are not traded in an active market. They are included as current assets, except for maturities greater than 12 months after the date of the consolidated statement of financial position, which are classified as non-current assets. Loans and receivables are initially valued at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs and, subsequently, at amortized cost, using the effective interest method. When circumstances indicate that amounts receivable will not be collected in the amounts initially agreed or will be collected in a different period, accounts receivable are impaired. Beginning January 1, 2018, loans and receivables are considered within the class of financial assets at amortized cost (see number v in this section). iii. Investments held to maturity If the Company has a demonstrable intention and capacity to hold debt instruments to maturity, they are classified as held to maturity. Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are expected to be settled within the following 12 months, otherwise, they are classified as non-current assets. They are initially recognized at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction cost, subsequently, they are valued at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Investments held to maturity are recognized or written off on the day they are transferred to or through the Company. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company does not have this type of investment. iv. Investments available for sale Investments available for sale are non-derivative financial assets designated to this category or that do not fall under any of the other categories. They are included as non-current assets, unless their maturity is less than 12 months or management intends to dispose of that investment within the following 12 months after the date of the consolidated statement of financial position. Investments available for sale are initially recognized at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these assets are recorded at fair value (unless they cannot be measured at their value in an active market, and the value is not reliable, in this case, they will be recognized at cost less impairment). Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of monetary and non-monetary instruments are directly recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. 88 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS When investments classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the fair value accumulated adjustments recognized in equity are reclassified to the consolidated statement of income. As of December 31, 2017, the Company does not have this type of investment. Classes of financial assets under IFRS 9, in effect beginning January 1, 2018 v. Financial assets at amortized cost Financial assets at amortized cost are financial assets that i) are held within a business model whose objective is to hold said assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and ii) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount of outstanding principal. vi. Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are financial assets: i) held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and ii) the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the amount of outstanding principal. As of December 31, 2018, the Company does not have financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. vii. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in addition to those described in point i in this section, are financial assets that do not meet the characteristics to be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, since i) they have a business model different to those that seek to collect contractual cash flows, or collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, or otherwise ii) the generated cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest on the amount of outstanding principal. Despite the mentioned classifications, the Company can make the following irrevocable elections in the initial recognition of a financial asset: • Disclose the subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity instrument in other comprehensive income, only if such investment (in which no significant influence, joint control or control is maintained) is not held for trading purposes, that is, a contingent consideration recognized as a result of a business combination. • Assign a debt instrument to be measured at fair value in profit or loss, if as a result it eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would arise from the measurement of assets or liabilities or the recognition of profits and losses on them in different bases. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not made any of the irrevocable designations described above. Impairment of financial assets. Through December 31, 2017, the Company assessed whether there was objective evidence of impairment of each financial asset or group of financial assets. An impairment loss was recognized if there was objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a “loss event”), and provided that the loss event (or events) had an impact on the estimated future cash flows derived from the financial asset or group of financial assets that could be reliably estimated. 89 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS New impairment policy from the adoption of IFRS 9. Beginning January 1, 2018, the Company used a new impairment model based on expected credit losses rather than losses incurred, applicable to financial assets subject to such assessment (i.e. financial assets measured at amortized cost and at fair value through other comprehensive income), as well as lease receivables, contract assets, certain written loan commitments, and financial guarantee contracts. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated from the initial recognition of the asset at each reporting date, using as a reference the past experience of the Company's credit losses, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors or groups of debtors, the general economic conditions and an assessment of both, the current management and the forecast of future conditions. i. Trade receivables and contract assets The Company adopted the simplified expected loss calculation model, through which expected credit losses are recognized during the account receivable’s lifetime. The Company performs an analysis of its portfolio of customer receivables, in order to determine if there are significant customers for whom it requires an individual assessment; meanwhile, customers with similar characteristics that share credit risks (participation in the portfolio of accounts receivable, type of market, sector, geographic area, etc.), are grouped to be evaluated collectively. In its impairment assessment, the Company may include indications that the debtors or a group of debtors are experiencing significant financial difficulties, and also observable data indicating that there is a significant decrease in the estimated cash flows to be received, including arrears. For purposes of the historical estimate, the Company considers that the following constitutes an event of default, since historical experience indicates that financial assets are not recoverable when they meet any of the following criteria: • The debtor does not fulfill its financial agreements; or • Information obtained internally or from external sources indicates that it is unlikely that the debtor will pay its creditors, including the Company, in its entirety (without considering any guarantee held by the Company). The Company defined the breach threshold as the period from which the recovery of the account receivable subjected to analysis is marginal, considering the internal risk management customers. ii. Other financial instruments The Company recognizes credit losses expected during the asset’s lifetime of all financial instruments for which credit risk has significantly increased since its initial recognition (assessed on a collective or individual basis), considering all the reasonable and sustainable information, including the one referring to the future. If at the presentation date, the credit risk a financial instrument has not significantly increased since its initial recognition, the Company calculates the loss allowance for that financial instrument as the amount of expected credit losses in the following 12 months. In measuring the expected credit losses, the Company does not necessarily identify all the possible scenarios. However, it considers the risk or probability that a credit loss occurs, reflecting the possibility that the payment default occurs and does not occur, even if that possibility is very low. In addition, the Company determines the period for the default to occur, and the recoverability rate after default. Management assesses the impairment model and the inputs used therein at least once every 3 months, in order to ensure that they remain in effect based on the current situation of the portfolio. 90 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Financial liabilities Financial liabilities that are not derivatives are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently valued at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Liabilities in this category are classified as current liabilities if they are expected to be settled within the following 12 months; otherwise, they are classified as non-current liabilities. Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been purchased or received from suppliers in the ordinary course of business. Loans are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Loans are subsequently recognized at amortized cost; any difference between the resources received (net of transaction costs) and the settlement value is recognized in the consolidated statement of income during the loan’s term using the effective interest method. Derecognition of financial liabilities The Company derecognizes financial liabilities if, and only if, the obligations of the Company are fulfilled, cancelled or have expired. The difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized financial liability and the consideration paid and payable is recognized in profit or loss. Additionally, when the Company carries out a refinancing transaction and the previous liability qualifies to be derecognized, the costs incurred in the refinancing are recognized immediately in profit or loss at the date of termination of the previous financial liability. Offsetting financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognized amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. h. Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities All derivative financial instruments contracted and identified, classified as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges, for trading or the hedging of market risks, are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position as assets and/or liabilities at fair value and similarly measured subsequently at fair value. The fair value is determined based on recognized market prices and when they are not traded in a market, it is determined using valuation techniques accepted in the financial sector. The fair value of hedging derivatives is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Derivative financial instruments classified as hedges are contracted for risk hedging purposes and meet all hedging requirements; their designation at the beginning of the hedging operation is documented, describing the objective, primary position, risks to be hedged and the effectiveness of the hedging relationship, characteristics, accounting recognition and how the effectiveness is to be measured, applicable to that operation. Fair value hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income. The change in fair value hedges and the change in the primary position attributable to the hedged risk are recorded in the consolidated statement of income profit in the same line item as the hedged position. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has no derivative financial instruments classified as fair value hedges. 91 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of derivative instruments associated to cash flow hedges are recorded in stockholders’ equity. The effective portion is temporarily recorded in comprehensive income, within stockholders’ equity and is reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged position affects these. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded profit or loss. Net investment hedge in a foreign transaction. Beginning March 1, 2018, the Company applies the hedge accounting to currency risk arising from its investments in foreign transactions for variations in exchange rates arising between the functional currency of such transaction and the functional currency of the holding entity, regardless of whether the investment is maintained directly or through a sub-holding entity. Variation in exchange rates is recognized in the other items of comprehensive income as part of the translation effect, when the foreign transaction is consolidated. To this end, the Company designates the debt denominated in a foreign currency as a hedging instrument; therefore, the exchange rate effects caused by the debt are recognized in other components of comprehensive income, on the translation effects line item, to the extent that the hedge is effective. When the hedge is not effective, exchange differences are recognized in profit or loss. Suspension of hedge accounting The Company suspends hedge accounting when the derivative financial instrument or the non-derivative financial instrument has expired, is cancelled or exercised, when the derivative or non-derivative financial instrument is not highly effective to offset the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The replacement or successive renewal of a hedging instrument for another one is not an expiration or resolution if such replacement or renewal is part of the Company's documented risk management objective and it is consistent with this. On suspending hedge accounting, in the case of fair value hedges, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged amount for which the effective interest rate method is used, is amortized to income over the period to maturity. In the case of cash flow hedges, the amounts accumulated in equity as a part of comprehensive income remain in equity until the time when the effects of the forecasted transaction affect income. In the event the forecasted transaction is not likely to occur, the income or loss accumulated in comprehensive income are immediately recognized in income. When the hedge of a forecasted transaction appears satisfactory and subsequently does not meet the effectiveness test, the cumulative effects in comprehensive income in stockholders' equity are transferred proportionally to income, to the extent the forecasted transaction impacts it. The fair value of derivative financial instruments reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company, is a mathematical approximation of their fair value. It is computed using proprietary models of independent third parties using assumptions based on past and present market conditions and future expectations at the closing date. i. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average cost method. The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress includes cost of product design, raw materials, direct labor, other direct costs and production overheads (based on normal operating capacity). It excludes borrowing costs. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the normal course of business, less the applicable variable selling expenses. Costs of inventories include any gain or loss transferred from other comprehensive income corresponding to raw material purchases that qualify as cash flow hedges. j. Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less the accumulated depreciation and any accrued impairment losses. Costs includes expenses directly attributable to the asset acquisition. 92 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flows to the Company and the cost of the item can be reliably measured. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Repairs and maintenance are recognized in the consolidated statement of income during the year they are incurred. Major improvements are depreciated over the remaining useful life of the related asset. When the Company carries out major repairs or maintenance of its property, plant and equipment assets, and the cost is recognized in the carrying amount of the corresponding asset as a replacement, provided that the recognition criteria are met. The remaining portion of any major repair or maintenance is derecognized. The Company subsequently depreciates the recognized cost in the useful life assigned to it, based on its best estimate of useful life. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method, considering separately each of the asset's components, except for land, which is not subject to depreciation. The estimated useful life of the asset classes is indicated below: Buildings and constructions 33 to 60 years Machinery and equipment 10 to 14 years Vehicles 4 to 8 years Telecommunications network 6 to 28 years Lab and IT furniture and equipment 6 to 10 years Tooling and spare parts 3 to 20 years Leasehold improvements 3 to 20 years Other assets 3 to 20 years The spare parts to be used after one year and attributable to specific machinery are classified as property, plant and equipment in other fixed assets. Borrowing costs related to financing of property, plant and equipment whose acquisition or construction requires a substantial period (nine months or more), are capitalized as part of the cost of acquiring such qualifying assets, up to the moment when they are suitable for their intended use or sale. Assets classified as property, plant and equipment are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances occur indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of income in other expenses, net, for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The residual value, useful lives and depreciation method of assets are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the changes are accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. During 2018, the Company reviewed the useful lives of its property, plant and equipment, and determined some changes because it is estimated that these assets will generate future economic benefits for period greater than previously estimated. These changes in the estimated useful life were recognized prospectively at the beginning of 2018 and represented a decrease in depreciation expense of $768 with respect to the previous year. 93 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Gains and losses on disposal of assets are determined by comparing the sale value with the carrying amount and are recognized in other expenses, net, in the consolidated statement of income. k. Leases The classification of leases as finance or operating depends on the substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract. Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards relating to the leased property are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. Payments made under operating leases (net of incentives received by the lessor) are recognized in the consolidated statement of income based on the straight-line method over the lease period. Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Finance leases are capitalized at the beginning of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the leased property and the present value of the minimum lease payments. If its determination is practical, in order to discount the minimum lease payments to present value, the interest rate implicit in the lease is used; otherwise, the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee should be used. Any initial direct costs of the leases are added to the original amount recognized as an asset. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges to achieve a constant rate on the outstanding balance. The corresponding rental obligations are included in non-current debt, net of finance charges. The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income for the year during the period of the lease, so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. As of January 1, 2019, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, the Company´s accounting policy for the treatment of leases as a lessee, has been modified according with what it is detailed in Note 3y. l. Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position when they meet the following conditions: they are identifiable, they provide future economic benefits and the Company has control over such benefits. Intangible assets are classified as follows: (i) Indefinite useful life These intangible assets are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment assessment. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no factors have been identified limiting the life of these intangible assets. (ii) Finite useful life These assets are recognized at cost less accumulated amortization and accrued impairment losses. They are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life, determined based on the expectation of generating future economic benefits, and are subject to impairment tests when triggering events of impairment are identified. 94 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The estimated useful lives of intangible assets with finite useful lives are summarized as follows: Development costs 5 to 20 years Exploration costs (1) Trademarks 5 to 22 years Relationships with customers 15 to 17 years Software and licenses 3 to 11 years Intellectual property rights 20 to 25 years Other (patents, concessions, non-competition agreements, among others) 3 to 20 years (1) Exploration costs are depreciated based on the unit-of-production method based on proven reserves of hydrocarbons. Development costs Research costs are recognized in income as incurred. Expenditures on development activities are recognized as intangible assets when such costs can be reliably measured, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, potential future economic benefits are obtained and the Company intends also has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset. Their amortization is recognized in income by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Costs in development that do not qualify for capitalization are recognized in income as incurred. Exploration costs The Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs associated with productive and non-productive wells are capitalized while non-productive and geological exploration costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as incurred. Net capitalized costs of unproved reserves are reclassified to proven reserves when they are found. The costs of operating the wells and field equipment are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as incurred. Trademarks Trademarks acquired in a separate transaction are recorded at acquisition cost. Trademarks acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Trademarks are amortized based on their useful life according to the Company's evaluation; if in said evaluation it is determined that the useful life of these assets proves to be indefinite, then trademarks are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests. Licenses Licenses acquired in a separate transaction are recorded at acquisition cost. Licenses acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value at acquisition date. Licenses that have a defined useful life are presented at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded by the straight-line method over its estimated useful life. 95 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The acquisition of software licenses is capitalized based on the costs incurred to acquire and use the specific software. Software development Costs associated with the maintenance of software are recorded as expenses are incurred. Development costs directly related with the design and tests of unique and identifiable software products controlled by the Company are recorded as intangible assets when they fulfill the following criteria: • ­Technically, it is possible to complete the intangible asset so that it may be available for its use or sale; • ­The intangible asset is to be completed for use or sale; • ­The ability to use or sell the intangible asset; • ­The way in which the intangible asset is to generate probable future economic benefits; • ­The availability of adequate technical, financial or other type of resources, to complete the development and use or sell the intangible asset; and • ­The ability to reliably calculate the disbursement attributable to the intangible asset during its development. The amount initially recognized for an intangible asset generated internally will be the sum of disbursements incurred from the moment the element fulfills the conditions for recording, as established above. When no intangible asset internally generated may be recognized, the disbursements for development are charged to income in the period they are incurred. m. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition cost of a subsidiary over the Company's interest in the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired, determined at the date of acquisition, and is not subject to amortization. Goodwill is shown under goodwill and intangible assets and is recognized at cost less accumulated impairment losses, which are not reversed. Gains or losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. n. Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not depreciable or amortizable and are subject to annual impairment tests. Assets that are subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels at which separately identifiable cash flows exist (cash generating units). Non-financial long-term assets other than goodwill that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. When an impairment loss is reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit, is increased to the revised estimated value of its recoverable amount, in such a way that the adjusted carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if an impairment loss had not been recognized for that asset or cash generating unit in previous years. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. 96 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS o. Income tax The amount of income taxes in the consolidated statement of income represents the sum of the current and deferred income taxes. The amount of income taxes included in the consolidated statement of income represents the current tax of the year and the effects of deferred income tax assets determined in each subsidiary by the assets and liabilities method, applying the rate established by the legislation enacted or substantially enacted at the consolidated statement of financial position date, wherever the Company operates and generates taxable income. The applicable rates are applied to the total temporary differences resulting from comparing the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and that are expected to be applied when the deferred tax asset is realized or the deferred tax liability is expected to be settled, considering, when applicable, any tax-loss carryforwards, prior to the recovery analysis. The effect of the change in current tax rates is recognized in current income of the period in which the rate change is determined. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which the applicable law is subject to interpretation. Provisions are recognized when appropriate based on the amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when it is probable that future taxable profits will exist against which the deductions for temporary differences can be taken. Deferred income tax on temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, associates, and joint agreements is recognized, unless the period of reversal of temporary differences is controlled by Alfa and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the near future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when a legal right exists and when the taxes are levied by the same tax authority. p. Employee benefits i. Pension plans Defined contribution plans: A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Company has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to their service in the current and past periods. The contributions are recognized as employee benefit expense on the date that the contribution is required. Defined benefit plans: A defined benefit plan is a plan which specifies the amount of the pension an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation. The liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the consolidated statement of financial position date less the fair value of plan assets. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent third parties using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using discount rates in conformity with IAS 19 – Employee Benefits that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and have maturities that approximate the terms of the pension liability. Actuarial remeasurements arising from adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized directly in stockholders' equity in other items of the comprehensive income in the year they occur, and will not be reclassified to profit or loss of the period. The Company determines the net finance expense (income) by applying the discount rate to the liabilities (assets) from net defined benefits. 97 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Past-service costs are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of income. ii. Post-employment medical benefits The Company provides medical benefits to retired employees after termination of employment. The right to access these benefits usually depends on the employee´s having worked until retirement age and completing a minimum of years of service. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same criteria as those described for defined benefit pension plans. iii. Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated by the Company before the normal retirement date or when an employee accepts voluntary termination of employment in exchange for these benefits. The Company recognizes termination benefits on the following dates, whichever occurs first: (a) when the Company can no longer withdraw the offer of these benefits, and (b) when the Company recognizes the costs from restructuring within the scope of the IAS 37 and it involves the payment of termination benefits. If there is an offer that promotes the termination of the employment relationship voluntarily by employees, termination benefits are valued based on the number of employees expected to accept the offer. The benefits that will be paid in the long term are discounted at their present value. iv. Short-term benefits La Compañía otorga beneficios a empleados a corto plazo, los cuales pueden incluir sueldos, salarios, compensaciones anuales y bonos pagaderos en los siguientes 12 meses. Alfa reconoce una provisión sin descontar cuando se encuentre contractualmente obligado o cuando la práctica pasada ha creado una obligación. v. Statutory employee profit sharing (PTU in Spanish) and bonuses The Company recognizes a liability and an expense for bonuses and statutory employee profit sharing when it has a legal or assumed obligation to pay these benefits and determines the amount to be recognized based on the profit for the year after certain adjustments. q. Provisions Liability provisions represent a present legal obligation or a constructive obligation as a result of past events where an outflow of resources to meet the obligation is likely and where the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the value of money over time and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized as interest expense. When there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognized even if the likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. A restructuring provision is recorded when the Company has developed a formal detailed plan for the restructure, and a valid expectation for the restructure has been created between the people affected, possibly for having started the plan implementation or for having announced its main characteristics to them. r. Share based payment The Company has compensation plans that are based on the market value of shares of Alfa, Alpek, Axtel and Nemak granted to certain senior executives of the Company and its subsidiaries. The conditions for granting such compensation to the eligible executives includes compliance with certain financial metrics such as the level of profit achieved and remaining in the Company for up to 5 years, among other requirements. The Board of Directors has appointed a Technical 98 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Committee to manage the plan, and it reviews the estimated cash settlement of this compensation at the end of the year. The payment plan is always subject to the discretion of the senior management of Alfa. Adjustments to this estimate are charged or credited to the consolidated statement of income. Fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payments which are settled in cash is recognized as an administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period of service required. The liability is included within other liabilities and is adjusted at each reporting date and settlement date. Any change in the fair value of the liability is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of income. s. Treasury shares The Company’s stockholders' periodically authorize a maximum amount for the acquisition of the Company's own shares. Upon the occurrence of a repurchase of its own shares, they become treasury shares and the amount is presented as a reduction to stockholders' equity at the purchase price. These amounts are stated at their historical value. t. Capital stock Alfa’s common shares are classified as capital stock within stockholders' equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are included in equity as a reduction from the consideration received, net of tax. u. Comprehensive income Comprehensive income is comprised of net income or loss, plus the annual effects of their capital reserves, net of taxes, which are comprised of the translation of foreign subsidiaries, the effects of derivative cash flow hedges, actuarial remeasurements, net investment hedges, the effects of the change in the fair value of financial instruments available for sale, the equity in other items of comprehensive income or losses of associates, and other items specifically required to be reflected in stockholders’ equity, and which do not constitute capital contributions, reductions and distributions. v. Segment reporting Segment information is presented consistently with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Executive Officer who is the highest authority in operational decision-making, resource allocation and assessment of operating segment performance. w. Revenue recognition Revenues comprise the fair value of the consideration received or to receive for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the transactions, and are presented in the consolidated statement of income, net of the amount of variable considerations, which comprise the estimated amount of returns from customers, rebates and similar discounts and payments made to customers with the objective that goods are accommodated in attractive and favorable spaces at their facilities. To recognize revenues from contracts with customers, the comprehensive model for revenue recognition is used, which is based on a five-step approach consisting of the following: (1) identify the contract; (2) identify performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Contracts with customers are formalized by commercial agreements complemented by purchase orders, whose costs comprise the promises to produce, distribute and deliver goods based on the contractual terms and conditions set forth, which do not imply a significant judgment to be determined. When there are payments related to obtaining contracts, they are capitalized and amortized over the term of the contract. 99 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For Nemak, the Company evaluates whether agreements signed conjunction with a manufacturing contract must be combined as a single contract. In cases where the two contracts meet the characteristics to be combined, management evaluates the performance obligations identified in the contract. Therefore, when determining the existence of separable performance obligations in a contract with clients, management evaluates the transfer of control of the good or service to the client, with the purpose of determining the moment to recognize the revenue corresponding to each performance obligation. Additionally, for Axtel, the Company evaluates certain contracts in which more than one separable performance obligation is identified, which consists of the equipment used to provide the service that is installed in the customer's locations. In addition to the equipment, telecommunications and information technology services are identified as another separable performance obligation. In the event that the equipment delivered to the customer is an separate performance obligation for the performance of the service, the Company assigns the price of the service contracts administered to the performance obligations identified according to their independent values in the market and relative discounts. Performance obligations from the sale of goods and products are not separable, and are not partially met, so they are satisfied at a point in time, when the control of the products sold has been transferred to the customer which is given at the time of the delivery of the goods promised to the customer in accordance with the contractual terms negotiated. The Company recognizes an account receivable when the performance obligations have been met, recognizing the corresponding revenue. The payment terms identified in most sources of revenue are short-term, with variable considerations including discounts and product rebates that are granted to customers, without financial components or significant guarantees. These discounts and incentives to customers are recognized as a reduction in revenue. Therefore, the allocation of the price is direct on the performance obligations of production, distribution and delivery, including the effects of variable consideration. When the Company identifies separable performance obligations, it allocates the price of the transaction to each item, in order to recognize the corresponding revenue, either at a point in time, or over time. Specifically, for Axtel, the Company recognizes the revenue derived from managed service contracts as follows: • Revenues ­­ for equipment installed in customer locations are recognized at the time control is transferred or the right to use them, that is, at a point in time. This performance obligation has a significant financial component, so that revenues are recognized in accordance with the effective interest rate method during the term of the contract. • ­Revenues from services are recognized as they are provided, that is, as the customer is consuming them in relation to voice, data and telecommunications services. Dividend income from investments is recognized once the stockholders' rights to receive this payment has been established (provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and that the income can be reliably determined). The Company's management adopted IFRS 15, Revenue from contracts with customers on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method applied to the contracts in force on the date of adoption, for which reason the accounting policy applied as of said date, is not comparable to that used for the year ended December 31, 2017. x. Earnings per share Earnings per share are calculated by dividing the income attributable to the owners of the controlling entity by the weighted average of outstanding common shares during the year. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, there are no dilutive effects for instruments potentially convertible to shares. 100 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS y. Changes in accounting policies and disclosures i. New standards and changes adopted by the Company. The Company adopted all new standards and interpretations in effect as of January 1, 2018, including the annual improvements to IFRS, as described below: IFRS 9, Financial Instruments IFRS 9, Financial instruments, replaces IAS 39, Financial instruments: recognition and measurement. This standard is mandatorily effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and introduces a new expected loss impairment model and limited changes to the classification and measurement requirements for financial assets. More specifically, the new impairment model is based on expected credit losses rather than incurred losses, and will apply to debt instruments measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), lease receivables, contract assets and certain written loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts. In regards of the expected loss impairment model, the initial adoption requirement of IFRS 9 is retrospective and establishes as an option to adopt it without modifying the financial statements of previous years by recognizing the initial effect on retained earnings at the date of adoption. In case of hedge accounting, IFRS 9 allows application with a prospective approach. The Company had no impacts associated with the new measurement category of fair value through other comprehensive income, because it currently does not have any instrument that qualifies for this treatment; however, potential impacts could arise if its investment strategy was changed in the future. In addition, there were no impacts related to hedge accounting. Finally, in regards to the new model for impairment based on expected losses, the Company decided to adopt the standard retrospectively, recognizing the effects on retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. On this date, derived from the new requirements, the Company recognized an adjustment of $359, net of deferred taxes, for increasing the allowance for impairment of accounts receivable. In addition, the number of disclosures increased in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. IFRS 15, Revenues from contracts with customers IFRS 15, Revenues from contracts with customers, is effective for periods beginning January 1, 2018. Under this standard, revenue recognition is based on the transfer of control, i.e. notion of control is used to determine when a good or service is transferred to the customer. The standard also presents a single comprehensive model for the accounting for revenues from contracts with customers, which introduces a five-step approach for revenue recognition: (1) identifying the contract; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company’s management adopted this standard using the modified retrospective approach applied to contracts in effect at the date of initial adoption on January 1, 2018. On this date, derived from the new requirements, the Company through its Sigma segment, recognized a liability corresponding to the right granted to its customers for the return of goods; such impact was recognized against retained earnings in the amount of $80, net of taxes. Additionally, the Company recognized through its Nemak segment, the cancellation of certain assets associated with long-term contractual relationships derived from the assignment of variable consideration to performance obligations that at the date of adoption have already been met; this impact was recognized against retained earnings for an amount of $1,106, net of taxes. 101 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Finally, the Company determined that for its Axtel segment, IFRS 15 impacted the following: (i) contracts with multiple performance obligations and (ii) recognition of costs for obtaining contracts. For the new contracts that were negotiated subsequent to January 1, 2018, in which embedded finance leases related to the equipment used to provide services to customers were identified, revenue was recognized for the sale of equipment at the inception date of the lease; an account receivable for contractual payments at their present value and the corresponding cost of the equipment. Additionally, during the term of these agreements, Axtel will recognize interest income based on the effective interest method. In addition, the required disclosures increased in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. IFRIC 22, Interpretation on foreign currency transactions and advance consideration This new Interpretation clarifies the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment of advance consideration in a foreign currency. The interpretation is being issued to reduce diversity in practice related to the exchange rate used when an entity reports transactions that are denominated in a foreign currency in accordance with IAS 21 in circumstances in which consideration is received or paid before the related asset, expense, or income is recognized. Effective for annual reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018. The Company translates advance considerations at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction, either received or paid, and recognizes them as nonmonetary items; therefore, it did not have significant impacts in the adoption of this interpretation in its consolidated financial statements. ii. New standards and interpretation, not in force in the reporting period A number of new standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued, are not yet effective for reporting periods ended December 31, 2018, and have not been early adopted by the Company. Below is a summary of these new standards and interpretations as well as the Company’s assessment as to the potential impacts on the consolidated financial statements: IFRS 16, Leases IFRS 16, Leases, supersedes IAS 17, Leases, and the related interpretations. This new standard brings most leases on balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and financial leases, while the model for lessees remains without significant changes. IFRS 16 is effective beginning January 1, 2019, and the Company decided to adopt it with the recognition of all the effects as of that date, without changing prior years. Under IFRS 16, lessees will recognize a right-of-use asset and the corresponding lease liability. The right of use will be depreciated based on the contractual term or, in some cases, on its economic useful life. On the other hand, the financial liability will be measured at initial recognition, discounting future minimum lease payments at present value according to a term, using the discount rate that represents the lease funding cost; subsequently, the liability will accrue interest through maturity. The Company will apply the exemptions to not to recognize an asset and a liability as described above, for lease agreements with a term of less than 12 months (provided that they do not contain purchase or term renewal options) and for those agreements where the acquisition of an individual asset of the contract was less than USD$5,000 (five thousand dollars). Therefore, payments for such leases will continue to be recognized as expenses within operating income. The Company adopted IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019; therefore, it recognized a right-of-use asset and a lease liability of approximately $5,965. 102 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In addition, the Company adopted and applied the following practical expedients provided by IFRS 16: • Account for as leases the payments made in conjunction with the rent, and that represent services (for example, maintenance and insurance). • Create portfolios of contracts that are similar in terms, economic environment and characteristics of assets, and use a funding rate by portfolio to measure leases. • For leases classified as financial leases as of December 31, 2018, and without elements of minimum payment updating for inflation, maintain the balance of the right-of-use asset, and its corresponding lease liability on the date of adoption of IFRS 16. • Not to revisit the previously reached conclusions for service agreements which were analyzed to December 31, 2018 under the IFRIC 4, Determining Whether a contract Contains a Lease, and where it had been concluded that there was no implicit lease. The Company has taken the required steps to implement the changes that the standard represents in terms of internal control, tax and systems affairs, from the adoption date. Lastly, as a result of these changes in accounting, some performance indicators of the Company, such as operating income and adjusted EBITDA, will be affected because what was previously recognized as an operating rental expense equivalent to rental payments, now a portion will be recognized by reducing the financial liability (which will not affect the statement of income), and the other portion will be recognized as a financial expense under the operating income indicator. On the other hand, the expense for depreciation of right-of-use assets will affect operating income linearly, but without representing a cash outflow, which will benefit the adjusted EBITDA. IFRIC 23, Interpretation on uncertainty over income tax treatments This new interpretation clarifies how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12, Income taxes when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. Uncertain tax treatments are tax treatments for which there is uncertainty over whether the relevant taxation authority will accept the tax treatment under tax law. In such a circumstance, an entity shall recognize and measure its current or deferred tax asset or liability by applying the requirements in IAS 12 based on taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates determined applying this Interpretation. An entity shall apply IFRIC 23 for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted and the fact must be disclosed. On initial application, the Interpretation must be applied retrospectively under the requirements of IAS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, modifying comparative periods or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the Interpretation as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, without modifying comparative periods. The Company determined that the impacts of the implementation of this Interpretation as of January 1, 2019 are not material considering the prevailing conditions of the tax positions that it has taken at the date of adoption and the faculties of the competent authorities to assess tax positions held by the Company at the same date. 103 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 4. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company’s activities expose it to various financial risks; market risk (including exchange rate risk, price risk, and interest rate variation risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company has a general risk management program focused on the unpredictability of financial markets, and seeks to minimize the potential adverse effects on its financial performance. The objective of the risk management program is to protect the financial health of its business, taking into account the volatility associated with foreign exchange and interest rates. Sometimes, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures to risks. In addition, due to the nature of the industries in which it participates, the Company has performed hedges of input prices with derivative financial instruments. Alfa has a Risk Management Committee (RMC), comprised of the Board’s Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Chief Financial Officer (“CFO ) and the Chief Executive Officer of the corresponding business unit. The RMC reviews derivative transactions proposed by the subsidiaries of Alfa, in which a potential loss analysis surpasses US$1. This Committee supports both the CEO and the Company’s Board President. All new derivative transactions which the Company proposes to enter into, as well as the renewal or cancellation of derivative arrangements, must be approved by both Alfa’s CEO and the corresponding subsidiary, according to the following schedule of authorizations: MAXIMUM POSSIBLE LOSS US$1 MILLION INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION ANNUAL CUMULATIVE TRANSACTIONS Chief Executive Officer of Alfa 1 5 Risk Management Committee of Alfa 30 100 Finance Committee 100 300 Board of Directors of Alfa >100 >300 The proposed transactions must meet certain criteria, including that the hedges are lower than established risk parameters, and that they are the result of a detailed analysis and properly documented. Sensitivity analysis and other risk analyses should be performed before the operation is entered into. The Company's risk management policy indicates that hedge positions must always be less than the projected exposure to allow for an acceptable margin of uncertainty. Exposed transactions are expressly prohibited. The Company's policy indicates that the farther the exposure is, the lower the coverage, based on the following table: 104 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAXIMUM COVERAGE (AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE PROJECTED EXPOSURE) CURRENT YEAR Commodities 100 Energy costs 75 Exchange rate for operating transactions 80 Exchange rate for financial transactions 100 Interest rates 100 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Company’s objectives when managing capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns to stockholders and benefits to other stakeholders, as well as maintaining an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may adjust the amount of dividends paid to stockholders, return equity to stockholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. Alfa monitors capital based on a leverage ratio. This percentage is calculated by dividing total liabilities by total equity. The financial ratio of total liabilities/total equity was 2.77 and 2.88 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting in a leverage ratio that meets the Company’s management and risk policies. 105 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY CATEGORY Below are the Company’s financial instruments by category: As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, financial assets and liabilities consist of the following: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 26,411 $ 32,813 Restricted cash 1,480 1,965 Financial assets measured at amortized cost: Trade and other accounts receivable 45,184 38,690 Other non-current assets 4,077 2,227 Financial assets measured at fair value (1): Derivative financial instruments(2) 1,121 209 $ 78,273 $ 75,904 Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost: Debt $155,549 $157,945 Trade and other accounts payable 76,230 71,031 Other non-current liabilities 90 82 Financial liabilities measured at fair value: Derivative financial instruments 1,369 776 $233,238 $229,834 (1) As described in Note 3g., the Company had no impacts associated with the introduction of the new category of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, derived from the adoption of IFRS 9. Therefore, all financial assets that were measured at fair value as of January 1, 2018 thereon, were classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore, the comparative information is appropriate, since it reflects the consistency in the recognition and measurement principles for all reporting periods. (2) The Company designated the derivative financial instruments that comprise this balance, as hedges for accounting purposes, in accordance with what is described later in this Note. 106 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES VALUED AT AMORTIZED COST The amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, customers and other accounts receivable, other current assets, trade and other accounts payable, current debt, other current liabilities approximate their fair value, because their maturity date is less than twelve months. The net carrying amount of these accounts represents the expected cash flows to be received as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying amount and estimated fair value of assets and liabilities valued at amortized cost is presented below: AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 CARRYING AMOUNT FAIR VALUE CARRYING AMOUNT FAIR VALUE Financial assets: Non-current accounts receivable $ 4,077 $ 4,077 $ 2,227 $ 2,227 Financial liabilities: Non-current debt(1) 142,899 139,585 146,425 151,475 (1) The book value of the debt, for purposes of calculating its fair value, is presented gross of interest payable and issuance costs. The estimated fair values as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 were determined based on discounted cash flows and with reference to the yields at the closing of the debt securities, using rates reflecting a similar credit risk, depending on the currency, maturity period and country where the debt was acquired. The primary rates used are the Interbank Equilibrium Interest Rate (“TIIE” for its acronym in Spanish) for instruments in Mexican pesos, London Interbank Offer Rate (“LIBOR”) for instruments in US dollars and Euro Interbank Offer Rate (“EURIBOR”) for instruments in Euro. Measurement at fair value for non-current accounts receivable is deemed within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, while for the financial debt, the measurement at fair value is deemed within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy, as described herein below. MARKET RISKS (i) Exchange rate risk The Company operates internationally, and is exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily derived from the transactions and balances that the subsidiaries conduct and have in foreign currency, respectively. A foreign currency is that which is different from the functional currency of an entity. In addition, the Company is exposed to changes in the value of financial instruments arising from foreign exchange variations; therefore, the Company applies hedge accounting to the differences in foreign currency originated between the functional currency of the foreign operation and the functional currency of the holding company (pesos), regardless of whether the net investment is maintained directly or indirectly through a subholding. The behavior of the exchange rates fluctuations between the Mexican peso, US dollar and the euro represents a very important factor for the Company due to the effect that such currencies have on its consolidated results and because, in addition, Alfa has no interference in its determination. Historically, in times when the Mexican peso has appreciated in against other currencies such as the US dollar, Alfa's profit margins have been reduced. On the other hand, when the Mexican peso has lost value, Alfa’s profit margins have increased. However, although this factor correlation has arisen several times in the recent past, there is no assurance that it will be repeated in the event the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and any other currency fluctuates again, because it also depends on the foreign currency monetary position of its subsidiaries. 107 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Accordingly, the Company sometimes enters into transactions with derivative financial instruments on exchange rates in order to hedge the risk associated with exchange rates. However, as most of the Company’ revenues are in US dollars, there is a natural hedge against its obligations in US dollars. Based on the above, the Company has the following assets and liabilities in foreign currency in relation to the functional currency of the subsidiary entities, translated to millions of Mexican pesos at the closing exchange rate as of December 31, de 2018: MXN USD EUR Financial assets $19,899 $ 24,403 $ 1,036 Financial liabilities (22,545) (51,815) (14,427) Foreign exchange monetary position $ (2,646) $ (27,412) $ (13,391) The exchange rates used to translate the foreign currency monetary positions to Mexican pesos are those described in Note 3. Based on the financial positions in foreign currency maintained by the Company, a hypothetical variation of 10% in the MXN/USD and MXN/EUR exchange rate and keeping all other variables constant, would result in an effect of $4,179 in the consolidated statement of income and stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2018. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS Beginning March 1, 2018 (designation date), the Company designated certain non-current debt instruments as hedges to net investments in foreign transactions in order to mitigate the variations in exchange rates arising between the functional currency for such transactions and the functional currency of the holding or sub-holding company that maintains these investments. The Company formally designated and documented each hedging relationship establishing objectives, management’s strategy to hedge the risk, the identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk to be hedged, and the methodology to assess the effectiveness. Given that the exchange rate hedging relationship is clear, the method that the Company used to assess the effectiveness consisted of a qualitative effectiveness test by comparing the critical terms between the hedging instruments and the hedged items. The hedge will be effective as long as the notional debt instrument designated as a hedging instrument is equal to or less than the value of the net assets of the hedged foreign transaction. When the value of the net assets of the foreign transaction is less than the notional value of the designated debt, the Company rebalances the hedging relationship and recognizes the ineffectiveness in the income statement. 108 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of December 31, 2018, the Company maintains the following hedging relationships: HOLDING FUNCTIONAL HEDGING NOTIONAL HEDGED ITEM CHANGE IN CURRENCY INSTRUMENT VALUE NET ASSETS OF HEDGED ITEM Alfa, S.A.B de C.V. MXN Senior Notes Fixed Rate US$ 500 Compagnie Selenis Canada US$ 9 Senior Notes Fixed Rate 500 Polioles, S. A. de C. V. 12 Bank loan 50 Styropek Mexico, S. A. de C.

V. 18 Alestra USA, Inc. 1 US$1,050 US$ 1,368 The average hedging ratio of the Company amounted to 96.5% from the designation date until December 31, 2018. Therefore, the exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instrument from the date of designation until December 31, 2018 amounted to a net loss of $1,068, which was recognized in other comprehensive income, offsetting the translation effect generated by each foreign subsidiary. The hedging effectiveness results confirm that the hedging relationships are highly effective due to the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged items; however, the effects of ineffectiveness that caused the need to rebalance the hedging relationship during the period were recognized immediately in profit or loss. 109 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Additionally, the sub-holding companies of Alfa maintain the hedge relationships described below: HOLDING FUNCTIONAL HEDGING NOTIONAL HEDGED ITEM CHANGE IN CURRENCY INSTRUMENT VALUE NET ASSETS OF HEDGED ITEM Nemak, S. A. B de C. V.(1) USD Senior Notes and bank loans € 210 Subsidiaries of Nemak, S. A. B de C.V. € 575 Alpek, S. A. B de C. V.(2) MXN Senior Notes and bank loans US$502 Subsidiaries of Alpek, S. A.

V. $ 2,140 (1) The average hedging ratio of Nemak amounted to 30.8%. Therefore, the exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instruments from the date of designation until December 31, 2018 amounted to a net gain of $304, which was recognized in the other comprehensive income items. (2) The average hedging ratio of Alpek amounted to 55.2%. Therefore, the exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instruments from the date of designation until December 31, 2018 amounted to a net loss of $324, which was recognized in the other comprehensive income items. (3) The average hedging ratio of Sigma Alimentos amounted to 97.0%. Therefore, the exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instruments from the date of designation until December 31, 2018 amounted to a net gain of $868, which was recognized in the other comprehensive income items. (4) The average hedging ratio of Campofrio Food Group amounted to 100% from the date of designation, because the Company maintains a bond for US$495, of which it designated only US$86 as an instrument to hedge the value of the net assets of its foreign investment with dollar as its functional currency. The exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instrument from the date of designation until December 31, 2018 amounted to a net loss of $20, which was recognized in the other comprehensive income items, offsetting the conversion effect generated by the foreign investment. (5) The average hedging ratio of Sigma Alimentos Exterior was 100% from the date of designation, due to the fact that the Company maintains a bond of US$409, of which it designated only US$368 as an instrument to hedge the value of the net assets of the net assets of its foreign investment with dollar as its functional currency. The exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instrument from the date of designation until December 31, 2018 amounted to a net loss of $571, which was recognized in the other comprehensive income items, offsetting the conversion effect generated by each foreign investment. (6) The average hedging ratio of Sigma Alimentos amounted to 80.7%. Therefore, the exchange fluctuation generated by the hedging instruments from the date of designation until July 12, 2018, amounted to a net gain of $43, which was recognized in the other comprehensive income items. The effectiveness results of the hedges confirm that the hedging relationships are highly effective due to the economic relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged items. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE EXCHANGE RATE RISK As of December 31, 2017, the Company held forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk of the fluctuation of the dollar with respect to the Mexican peso. The fair value of these derivative financial instruments, classified as trading, was $62. Axtel, a subsidiary of the Company, has the Mexican peso ( MXN ) as its functional currency and maintains accounts payable in US dollars ( USD ), and is exposed to foreign exchange risk. Therefore, as of December 31, 2018, it has designated forward contracts as accounting hedges, where the hedged item is represented by the payments of the USD debt. Alpek, subsidiary of the Company, maintains forwards (USD/MXN and EUR/USD) to cover different needs. In the case of the USD/MXN ratio, Alpek seeks to cover short-term needs, which correspond to the sale of US dollars for the purchase of raw material in Mexican pesos. For its part, the EUR/USD ratio is used because part of Alpek's revenues are received in Euros, therefore, a highly probable forecasted transaction related to revenues budgeted in said foreign currency has been documented as a hedged item. 110 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sigma, subsidiary of the Company, maintains three currency swaps ( CCS ) of hedge accounting with the objective of mitigating the risk of exposure to the MXN/USD exchange rate derived from the operations of its subsidiaries with peso functional currency. Therefore, Sigma has documented an accounting cash flow hedge relationship, considering as a hedged item a highly probable forecasted transaction related to a revolving liability denominated in Dollars. The conditions of the derivative financial instruments and the considerations of their valuation as hedging instruments are mentioned below: CHARACTERISTICS FORWARDS FORWARDS FORWARDS CCS USD/ CCS USD/MXN MXN/USD USD/MXN EUR/USD MXN Notional amount US$94 US$16 €6 US$250 US$250 Currency USD USD EUR USD USD Average strike / Coupon 20.54 MXN/USD 20.79 MXN/USD 1.1756 EUR/USD 6.875% 4.125% Notional amount US$4,652.5 US$4,560 Currency USD/MXN USD/MXN Average strike / Coupon 12.29% 8.88%-8.90% Maturity 07/24/2019 02/27/2019 03/31/2020 12/16/2019 05/02/2026 Carrying amount of the Forward / CCS $(39) $17 $1 $301 $763 Change in the fair value of the Forward / CCS, to measure ineffectiveness $(39) $17 $1 $297 $728 Recognized in OCI net of reclassifications $35 $(8) $$(223) $59 Ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss $$$$$Reclassification from OCI to profit or loss $4 $ (9) $$18 $17 Carrying amount of the liability in USD $$$$(352) $(758) Change in the fair value of the hedged item to measure ineffectiveness $39 $(17) $(1) $$In measuring the effectiveness of these hedges, the Company determined that they are highly effective because changes in the fair value and cash flows of each hedged item are compensated within the range of effectiveness established by management. The method used by the Company is the offset of cash flows using a hypothetical derivative, which consists in comparing the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument with the changes in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative that would result in an identical hedge. In accordance with the notional amounts described and the way in which the flows of the derivatives are exchanged, the average coverage ratio for the MXN/ USD exchange rate is 46%, for the USD/MXN ratio it is 100 %, of 100% for the EUR/USD ratio; while, for CCS, the average coverage ratio is 25%. In this hedging relationship, the source of ineffectiveness may be caused by three main reasons: the difference in the settlement date of the derivative and the hedged item, the credit risk and that the expected amount becomes a lower amount than the hedging instruments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, no ineffectiveness was recognized in profit or loss. 111 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRICE RISK In carrying out its activities, the Company depends on the supply of raw materials provided by its suppliers, both in Mexico and abroad, among which are intermediate petrochemicals, beef products, pork and poultry, dairy products and aluminum scrap, principally. In recent years, the price of some inputs have shown volatility, especially those related to oil, natural gas, food, such as meat, cereals and milk, and metals. In order to fix the selling prices of certain of its products, the Company has entered into agreements with certain customers. At the same time, it has entered into transactions involving derivatives on natural gas that seek to reduce price volatility of the prices of this input. Additionally, it has entered into derivative financial instruments transactions to hedge purchases of certain raw materials, since these inputs have a direct or indirect relationship with the prices of its products. The derivative financial operations have been privately contracted with various financial institutions, whose financial strength was highly rated at the time by rating agencies. The documentation used to formalize the contract operations is that based generally on the Master Agreement , generated by the International Swaps & Derivatives Association ( ISDA ), which is accompanied by various accessory documents known in generic terms as Schedule , Credit Support Annex and Confirmation . Regarding natural gas, the selling price of natural gas is determined by the price of that product on the spot market in South Texas, USA, which has experienced volatility. For its part, the Mexican Electric Commission is a decentralized public company in charge of producing and distributing electricity in Mexico. The Company entered into various derivative agreements with various counterparties to protect it against increases in prices of natural gas and other raw materials. In the case of natural gas derivatives, hedging strategies for products were designed to mitigate the impact of potential increases in prices. The purpose is to hedge the price from volatility by taking positions that provide stable cash flow expectations, and thus avoid price uncertainty. The reference market price for natural gas is the Henry Hub New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The average price per MMBTU for 2018 and 2017 was US$3.20 and US$3.00, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had hedges of natural gas prices for a portion expected of consumption needs in Mexico and the United States. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK Alfa's subsidiaries use natural gas and WTI crude derivatives to carry out their operating processes and within the polyester chain some of their main raw materials are paraxylene, ethylene and ethane, which causes an increase in the prices of natural gas, crude WTI, paraxylene, ethylene or ethane have negative effects on the cash flow of the operation. The objective of the hedge is to hedge against the exposure in the price increase of the aforementioned commodities, for future purchases by contracting swaps where variable prices are received and a fixed price is paid. A strategy called roll-over has been implemented, through which it is analyzed each month if more derivatives are contracted to expand the time or the amount of coverage. Currently, the Company is hedged until December 2024. Additionally, one of Alfa's subsidiaries is a producer of hydrocarbons, so a drop in oil and gas prices negatively affects cash flow. The objective of the hedge is to hedge against the exposure to the decrease in prices of the aforementioned commodities, for future sales by contracting swaps where a fixed price is received and a variable price is paid. A strategy called roll-over has been implemented, through which it is analyzed each month if more derivatives are contracted to expand the time or the amount of coverage. The current contract as of December 31, 2018, expires in January 2019. 112 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These derivative instruments have been classified as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. In this sense, the administration has documented, as a hedged item, a highly probable transaction in relation to the budget for purchases of these generic goods. The conditions of the derivative financial instruments and the considerations of their valuation as hedging instruments are mentioned below: CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SWAPS NATURAL GAS PARAXYLENE NAFTA ETHYLENE MEG ETHANE CRUDE WTI Notional amount 17,228,760 297,200 10,500 118,000,000 33,500 10,200,000 26,000 Units MMBtu MT MT Pound MT Gal Barrels Price received Market Market Market Market Market Market Market Price paid (average) $4.35/MMBtu $1,057/MT $459/MT $0.21/pound $741/MT $0.32/gal $54.16/Bbl Maturity (monthly) 2024 Dec-2019 Sept-2019 Dec-2019 Dec-2019 Dec-2019 Jan-2019 Net position of the swap (1)(2) $(478) $(710) $(3) $(12) $(70) $(2) $3 Change in the fair value to measure $200 $(803) $(3) $(28) $(70) $(2) $3 ineffectiveness Recognized in OCI, net of reclassifications $(478) $(710) $(3) $(12) $(70) $(2) $3 Efficiency test results 99% 99% 99% 99% 99% 99% 99% Fair value as of December 31, 2017 $(703) $125 $$23 $$$ (64) (1) Due to the high volume of operations, the net position of derivative financial instruments is presented; however, since these instruments do not meet the criteria for offsetting financial instruments, they are presented grossly in the consolidated statement of financial position. (2) The change in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments recognized in OCI for the year ended December 31, 2018 is $(669). For commodity hedging relationships, management is designating as a hedged item a specific risk, which is defined by the underlying assets that are clearly identified in the corresponding invoices of the purchases. The designated risk components cover most of the changes in the fair value of the hedged item as a whole. On the other hand, in the measurement of the effectiveness of these hedges, the Company determined that they are highly effective because the changes in the fair value and cash flows of each hedged item are compensated within the range of effectiveness established by management. The method used by the Company is to offset cash flows using a hypothetical derivative, which consists of comparing the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument with the changes in the fair value of the hypothetical derivative that would result in a perfect coverage of the item. covered. According to the notional amounts described and the way in which the flows of the derivatives are exchanged, the average coverage ratio for the natural gas ratio is 30%, 72% for the paraxylene, 44% for the ethylene, 33% for ethane and 0% for WTI crude. If necessary, a rebalancing will be done to maintain this relationship for the strategy. The source of ineffectiveness can be caused mainly by the difference in the settlement date of the hedging instruments and the hedged items, and that the budget becomes less than the hedging instruments. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there was no ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss. 113 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTEREST RATE RISK The Company is exposed to interest rate variation risk mainly for long-term loans bearing interest at variable rates. Fixed-interest loans expose the Company to interest rate risk at fair value, which implies that Alfa might be paying interest at rates significantly different from those of an observable market. As of December 31, 2018, 78% of the financings are denominated at a fixed rate and 22% at a variable rate. As of December 31, 2018, if interest rates on variable rate are increased or decreased by 100 basis points in relation to the rate in effect, the income and stockholders’ equity of the Company would change by $336. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS In order to maintain good control over the total cost of its financing and the volatility associated with interest rates, the Company contracted interest rate swaps ( IRS ) to convert the interest payment of certain variable rate loans at a fixed rate; and designated the interest payments derived from the debts it maintains as a covered item. The conditions of the derivative financial instrument and the considerations of its valuation as a hedging instrument are mentioned below: CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SWAP INTEREST RATE SWAP INTEREST RATE SWAP Currency MXN USD Notional $3,380 US$290 Coupon 8.355% Libor 3m Coupon 2.897% Maturity 12/15/2022 03/26/2021 Carrying value of the swap $24 $(42) Change in the fair value to measure ineffectiveness $24 $(42) Recognized in OCI, net of reclassifications $(24) $39 Reclassification from OCI to profit or loss $$(3) Change in the fair value of the hedged item to measure ineffectiveness $(25) $42 As of December 31, 2018, this hedge is highly effective given that the critical terms of the derivative and the loan are perfectly matched, so it is confirmed that there is an economic relationship. In addition, both the credit profile of the Company and the counterparty are good and are not expected to change in the medium term; therefore, the credit risk component is not considered to be significant to the hedging relationship. The method used to evaluate effectiveness is through a qualitative evaluation comparing the critical terms between the hedging instrument and the hedged instrument. The prospective effectiveness test resulted in 99%, confirming that there is an economic relationship between the hedging instruments and the hedged instrument. 114 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS In accordance with the notionals described and the way in which the flows of derivative financial instruments are exchanged, the average coverage ratio for the interest rate ratio is 95% and 100%. If necessary, a rebalancing will be done to maintain this relationship for the strategy. In this hedge relationship, the source of ineffectiveness is mainly credit risk; For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no ineffectiveness recognized in profit or loss. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the net position of the fair value of the aforementioned financial derivative instruments amounts to $ 248 and $ 567, respectively. CREDIT RISK Credit risk is managed on a group basis, except for the credit risk related to accounts receivable balances. Each subsidiary is responsible for managing and analyzing credit risk for each of its new customers before setting the terms and conditions of payment. Credit risk is generated from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposure to customers, including receivables and committed transactions. The Company denominates, from a business point of view and credit risk profile, the significant customers with which it has an account receivable, distinguishing those that require an assessment of the credit risk individually. Each subsidiary is responsible for managing and analyzing the credit risk for each of its new clients before setting the terms and conditions of payment. If the wholesale customers are independently qualified, these are the ratings used. If there is no independent rating, the Company's risk control evaluates the client's credit quality, taking into account its financial position, prior experience and other factors. The maximum exposure to credit risk is given by the balances of these items, as presented in the consolidated statement of financial position. Individual risk limits are determined based on internal and external ratings in accordance with limits set by the RMC. The use of credit risk is monitored regularly. Sales to retail customers are in cash or by credit card. During 2018 and 2017, credit limits were not exceeded. Additionally, the Company performs a qualitative evaluation of economic projections, in order to determine the possible impact on probabilities of default and the recovery rate assigned to its customers. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there have been no changes in estimation techniques or assumptions. LIQUIDITY RISK Projected cash flows are determined at each operating entity of the Company and subsequently the finance department consolidates this information. The finance department of the Company continuously monitors the cash flow projections and liquidity requirements of the Company ensuring that sufficient cash and highly liquid investments are maintained to meet operating needs, and it’s that some flexibility is maintained through open and committed credit lines. The Company regularly monitors and makes decisions ensuring that the limits or covenants set forth in debt contracts are not violated. The projections consider the financing plans of the Company, compliance with covenants, compliance with minimum liquidity ratios and internal legal or regulatory requirements. The Company’s treasury department invests those funds in time deposits and marketable securities whose maturities or liquidity allow flexibility to meet the cash needs of the Company. 115 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The following table analyzes the derivative and non-derivative, grouped according to their maturity, from the date of the consolidated statement of financial position to the contractual maturity date. Derivative financial liabilities are included in the analysis if their contractual maturities are required to understand the timing of the Company's cash flows. The amounts disclosed in the table are contractual undiscounted cash flows.

The 3 different levels used are presented below: • ­Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets • ­Level 2: Other valuations including quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, which are directly or indirectly observable • ­Level 3: Valuations made through techniques where one or more of their significant data inputs are unobservable. The derivative financial instruments of the Company that are measured at fair value as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, are located within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers between level 1 and 2 or between level 2 and 3. The specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: • ­­Market quotations or quotations for similar instruments. • ­The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. • ­The fair value of forward exchange agreements is determined using exchange rates at the closing balance date, with the resulting value discounted at present value. • ­Other techniques such as the analysis of discounted cash flows, which are used to determine fair value of the remaining financial instruments. 116 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. 5.1 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below. a. Estimated impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives The Company annually performs tests to determine whether goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite live have suffered any impairment (see Note 12). For impairment testing purposes, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinites lives is allocated to the groups of cash generating units ( CGUs ) of which the Company has considered that economic and operating synergies of the business combinations are generated. The recoverable amounts of the groups of CGUs were determined based on the calculations of their value in use, which require the use of estimates, within which, the most significant are the following: • ­Estimate of gross margins and future operations according to the historical performance and expectations of the industry for each CGU group. • ­Discount rate based on the weighted cost of capital (WACC) of each CGU or group of CGUs. • ­Long-term growth rates b. Contingent losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording provisions for matters relating to claims and litigation, primarily in relation to rates of interconnection services. Actual costs may vary from estimates for several reasons, such as changes in cost estimates for resolution of complaints and disputes based on different interpretations of the law, opinions and evaluations concerning the amount of loss. Contingencies are recorded as provisions when it is likely that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. It is not practical to estimate sensitivity to potential losses if other assumptions were used to record these provisions, due to the number of underlying assumptions and the range of possible reasonable outcomes regarding potential actions by third parties, such as regulators, both in terms of loss probability and estimates of such loss. c. Recoverability of deferred tax assets Alfa has tax loss carryforwards, which can be used in the following years until maturity expires. Based on the projections of taxable income that Alfa will generate in the subsequent years through a structured and robust business plan, which includes the sale of non-strategic assets, new services to be provided to its subsidiaries, among others, management has determined that current tax losses will be used before they expire and, therefore, it was considered probable that the deferred tax assets for such losses will be recovered. d. Long-lived assets The Company estimates the useful lives of long-lived assets in order to determine the depreciation and amortization expenses to be recorded during the reporting period. The useful life of an asset is calculated when the asset is acquired and is based on past experience with similar assets, considering anticipated technological changes or any other type of changes. Were technological changes to occur faster than estimated, or differently than anticipated, the useful lives assigned to these assets could have to be reduced. This would lead to the recognition of a greater depreciation and amortization expense in future periods. Alternatively, these types of technological changes could result in the recognition of a charge for impairment to reflect the reduction in the expected future economic benefits associated with the assets. 117 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company reviews depreciable and amortizable assets on an annual basis for signs of impairment, or when certain events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recovered during the remaining useful life of the assets. For intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, the Company performs impairment tests annually and at any time that there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. To test for impairment, the Company uses projected cash flows, which consider the estimates of future transactions, including estimates of revenues, costs, operating expenses, capital expenditures and debt service. In accordance with IFRS, discounted future cash flows associated with an asset or CGU are compared to the book value of the asset or CGU being tested to determine if impairment exists or a reversal of impairment recorded in previous periods. e. Default probability and recovery rate to apply the expected credit losses model in the impairment measurement of financial assets The Company assigns to customers with whom it has an account receivable at each reporting date, either individually or as a group, an allowance for the probability of default in the account receivable and the estimated recovery rate, in order to reflect the cash flows expected to be received from the outstanding balances as of that date. f. Business combinations When business combinations are concluded, the acquisition method is required to recognize the identifiable net assets acquired at fair value, at the date of acquisition; any excess of the consideration paid on the identified net assets is recognized as goodwill, which is subject to impairment tests at least once a year. On the other hand, any excess of the net assets acquired over the consideration paid is recognized as a gain in profit or loss. To estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company uses observable market data to the extent in which this is available. When the input data of Level 1 is not available, the Company hires an independent qualified appraiser to perform the valuation. Management works closely with the independent qualified appraiser to establish the valuation techniques, the premises, the appropriate input data and the criteria to be used in the valuation models. 5.2 CRITICAL JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING THE COMPANY’S ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of all entities in which the Company has a controlling interest. The outstanding balances and significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. To determine control, the Company considers whether it has the power to govern the financial and operational strategy of the respective entity and not just the power of the capital held by the Company. As a result of this analysis, the Company has exercised critical judgment to decide whether to consolidate the financial statements of Axtel, where the determination of control is not clear. Based on the principal substantive right of Alfa in accordance with the by-laws of Axtel by appointing the General Director, who has control over the relevant decision making and based on the by-laws of Axtel and supported in the General Law of Mercantile Organizations, which allow Alfa to control the decisions over relevant activities by a simple majority through an Ordinary Stockholders' Meeting, where it holds 52.78% of Axtel. Management has concluded that there are circumstances and factors described in the by-laws of Axtel and applicable standards that allow the Company to conduct the daily operations of Axtel, which therefore demonstrate control. Additionally, the Company has evaluated critical control factors and has concluded it should consolidate the financial statements of its subsidiaries Polioles and Indelpro. The analysis performed by the Company included the assessment of the substantive decision making rights of the respective stockholders set forth in their bylaws, resulting in management’s conclusion that it has the power to govern their relevant activities. The Company will continue to evaluate these circumstances at the date of each statements of financial position to determine whether these critical judgments will continue to be appropriate. 118 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 6.

Axtel and Telmex created a trust with BBVA Bancomer (as trustee) to ensure the payment of fixed interconnection services on the dispute applicable to 2008, 2009 and 2010. As of December 31, 2018, the restricted cash status remains unchanged. The restricted cash representing the balance of the trust is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within non-current assets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the balance of the trust was $94 and $162, respectively composed of contributions by Alestra and corresponding yields.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, trade and other accounts receivable of $43,419 and $38,994, respectively have an impairment provision (represented by customers and sundry debtors). The amount of the impairment provision as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounts to $5,817 and $5,127, respectively. Movements in the provision for impairment during 2018 and 2017 of customers and other receivables, with the impairment model used by the Company, are analyzed as follows: DECEMBER 31, 2018 DECEMBER 31, 2017 Opening balance as of January 1 $ 5,640 $ 2,687 Allowance for impairment of trade and other accounts receivable 1,144 2,600 Receivables written off during the year (967) (160) Ending balance as of December 31 5,817 5,127 Adjusted balance of adoption of IFRS 9 513 Adjusted balance of adoption of IFRS 9 $ 5,817 $ 5,640 120 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The net change in the allowance for impairment of trade and other accounts receivable of $690 for the year ended December 31, 2018, was mainly due to changes in the estimation of probabilities of default and percentage of recovery, assigned to the different risk groups. customers of the segments in which the Company operates, which reflected an increase in credit risk on financial assets. The following describes the probability of default and loss given default ranges assigned to the main customer segments with which the Company has balances receivable in its different businesses: SEGMENT PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT IN RANGE LOSS GIVEN DEFAULT RANGE Axtel 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 100.0% Alpek 0.0% 100.0% 0.0% 100.0% Nemak 0.0% 0.85% 100.0% Sigma 0.1% 11.0% 100.0% Increases in the allowance for impairment of trade and other accounts receivable and cancellations, when they do not imply the derecognition of an account receivable, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income under sales expenses. The Company does not have any guarantee or collateral that covers the exposure to credit risk of financial assets. 9.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL As mentioned in Note 5, goodwill is allocated to groups of cash generating units (“CGUs”) that are associated with the operating segments, from which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquirer are assigned to those units or groups of units, as follows: DECEMBER 31, 2018 2017 Alpek $ 339 $ 339 Sigma 13,567 14,742 Nemak 6,054 6,257 Axtel(1) 2,687 3,357 Other 151 153 $22,798 $24,848 (1) As mentioned in Note 2.d, as part of the sale of the massive segment of Axtel, an amount of $ 670 was recognized as a reduction in goodwill, which is presented in the line Other income (expenses), net of the consolidated income statement, as part of the determination of the gain on the sale. The recoverable value from each group of CGUs has been determined based on calculations of values in use, which consist of cash flow projections after on pre-tax financial budgets approved by management covering a period of 5 years. The gross and operating margins included in the estimates of value in use have been estimated based on the historical performance and the growth expectations of the market in which each group of CGUs operates. The long-term growth rate used in estimating value in use is consistent with the projections included in industry reports. The present value of the cash flows was discounted using a specific discount rate after taxes for each group of CGUs and reflects the specific risks associated with each of them. 127 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The key assumptions used in calculating the value in use in 2018 and 2017, were as follows: 2018 ALPEK SIGMA NEMAK AXTEL OTHER SEGMENTS Tasa de crecimiento a largo plazo 1.0% 2,8% 1.8% 3.9% 3.5% Tasa de descuento 8.9% 7.9% 10.3% 10.5% 12.7% 2017 ALPEK SIGMA NEMAK AXTEL OTHER SEGMENTS Long-term perpetual growth rate 0.0% 2.1% 1.8% 4.9% 4.0% Discount rate 9.0% 8.1% 8.7% 10.1% 12.7% In relation to the calculation of the value in use of groups of cash-generating units, the Alfa Management considers that a possible increase in the discount rate in 100 basis points would cause an impairment of $308, while a possible decrease in the long-term growth rate in a similar level, a loss of $97. For the periods ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, no impairment loss was recognized for goodwill. 128 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company held 144,888,980 treasury shares, and the market value of the shares was $23.38 and $21.62, respectively. The profit for the period is subject to the legal provision requiring at least 5% of the profit for each period to be set aside to increase the legal reserve until it reaches an amount equivalent to one fifth of the amount of paid capital. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the legal reserve amounted to $60, which is included in retained earnings. On February 28, 2018, the Ordinary General Stockholders' Meeting approved the payment of an ordinary cash dividend of $.0332 dollars for each of the outstanding shares, equivalent to approximately $3,154.

In accordance with the Mexican Income Tax Law becoming effective on January 1, 2014, a 10% tax on income generated starting 2014 on dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican individuals when these correspond to taxable income. It also establishes that for fiscal years 2001 to 2013, the net tax on profits will be determined as established in the Income Tax Law effective in the corresponding fiscal year. Dividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends exceeding CUFIN will cause a tax on the income at the applicable rate for the period in which they are paid. This tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against its income tax in the same year or the following two years or, if applicable, against the flat tax of the period. Dividends paid from profits which have previously paid income tax are not subject to tax withholding or to any additional tax payment. At December 31, 2018, the tax value of the CUFIN and tax value of the Capital Contribution Account (CUCA) amounted to $38,371 ($36,455 in 2017) and $42,183 ($40,767 in 2017), respectively. In case of capital reduction, the procedures established by the Income Tax Law provide that any surplus of stockholders' equity be made over the balances of the tax accounts of the capital contributed, the same tax treatment as applicable to the dividends. 149 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 22. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS Alfa has a compensation scheme referenced to the value of its own shares and the value of the shares of its subsidiaries for senior executives of the Company. According to the terms of the plan, eligible executives will receive a cash payment conditional on the achievement of certain quantitative and qualitative metrics based on the following financial measures: • Improved share price of the Group • Improvement in net income • Permanence of the executives in the Company The bonus will be paid in cash over five years after the grant date, i.e. 20% each year at the average price of the share at the end of each year. The average price of the shares in 2018 and 2017 was $22.11 and $21.12, respectively. These payments are measured at the fair value of the consideration, so, because they are based on the price of Alfa shares, the measurement is considered to be within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the liability for share-based payments amounted to $311 and $267, respectively. The short-term and long-term liability is as follows: DECEMBER 31, 2018 2017 Short term $ 92 $ 87 Long term 219 180 Total carrying amount $ 311 $ 267 150 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY SEGMENTS Segment information is presented consistently with the internal reporting provided to the chief executive officer who is the highest authority in operational decision-making, resource allocation and assessment of operating segment performance. An operating segment is defined as a component of an entity over which there is separate financial information that is evaluated regularly. The Company manages and evaluates its operation through five primary operating segments, which are: • ­Alpek: This segment operates in the petrochemical and synthetic fibers industry, and its revenues are derived from sales of its main products: polyester, plastics and chemicals. • ­Sigma: This segment operates in the refrigerated food sector and its revenues are derived from sales of its main products: deli meats, dairy and other processed foods. • ­Nemak: This segment operates in the automotive industry and its revenues are derived from sales of its main products: aluminum engine heads and blocks. • ­Axtel: This segment operates in the telecommunications sector and its revenues are derived from the provision of data transmission services, Internet and long distance phone service. • ­Newpek: This segment is dedicated to the exploration and exploitation of natural gas and oil fields. • ­Other segments: includes all other companies operating in business services and others which are non-reportable segments and do not meet the quantitative limits in the years presented and, therefore, are presented in aggregate, besides the eliminations of consolidation. These operating segments are managed and controlled independently because the products and the markets they serve are different. Their activities are performed through various subsidiaries. The transactions between operating segments are performed at market value and the accounting policies with which the financial information by segments is prepared, are consistent with those described in Note 3. The Company evaluates the performance of each of the operating segments based on income before financial result, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ), considering that this indicator is a good metric to evaluate operating performance and the ability to meet principal and interest obligations with respect to indebtedness, and the ability to fund capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Nevertheless, EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or cash flows as a measure of liquidity. 155 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Company has defined the Adjusted EBITDA by also adjusting EBITDA by the impacts of asset impairment.

CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS: In the normal course of its business, the Company is involved in disputes and litigations. While the results of the disputes cannot be predicted, as of December 31, 2018, the Company does not believe that there are current or threatened actions, claims or legal proceedings against or affecting the Company which, if determined adversely to it, would damage significantly its individual or overall results of operations or financial position. As of December 31, 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries had the following commitments: a. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the subsidiaries had entered into several agreements with suppliers and customers for the purchase of raw materials used for the production and sale of finished products, respectively. These agreements have a maturity of between one and five years, and generally comprise price adjustment clauses. b. In December 2018, Indelpro (subsidiary of Alpek) entered into an extension agreement with PEMEX Refinación to cover the supply of propylene for the chemical and refining area, which establishes the obligation to purchase the maximum level of production available to a price referenced to market values for a given period. c. Newpek, S. A. de C. V., ( Newpek ) a subsidiary of the Company, won in areas 2 and 3 auctioned on July 12, 2017, corresponding to the third bidding of the Round 2 held by the National Hydrocarbons Commission ( CNH for its acronym in Spanish ). In order to comply with the requirements of the contract for exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons in conventional onshore deposits under the license modality, the Company has granted CNH an indirect investment in Newpek Capital, S. A. of C.V. The latter must maintain capital stock equal to or greater than US$300 or the shareholding held must equal that amount, which covers the part that corresponds to the Company. The contract establishes that such guarantee will be exercised in the last resort, in a subordinate way and exclusively to demand compliance with the obligations established in the bidding of the contract, referring to those obligations that have not been paid and/or fulfilled in their entirety. d. A subsidiary of the Company, Nemak México, S. A. ( Nemak México ) received a tax credit from the Tax Agency of Canada (CRA) for refunds of Tax on Goods and Services (GST) and the Harmonized Tax on Sale (HST) by an approximate total amount including interest of US$82 million. The CRA alleges that Nemak Mexico delivered certain assets in Canada that were subject to GST and HST. Nemak Mexico presented an objection to the CRA arguing that its clients acted as importers in Canada and that the goods were delivered outside that country. As of the date of the financial statements, the result of this claim cannot be predicted, however management considers that it has the arguments to obtain a favorable result. e. As of December 31, 2018, Alpek, subsidiary of the Company, is in a process of fiscal litigation in one of its subsidiaries in Brazil, in relation to the demand for payment of the Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services ( ICMS ) that the Ministry of Finance of the State of Sao Paulo ( SFSP , for its initials in Portuguese) has raised against Alpek, due to differences in the criteria for the calculation and crediting of said tax. Considering all the circumstances and precedents of jurisprudence available at that date, management and its advisors have determined that it is probable that the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil will issue a judgment in favor of Alpek for the amount related to differences in the calculation, which it would exempt it from paying $401 in taxes, fines and interest that the SFSP demands. On the other hand, for the concept of ICMS accreditation, the amount demanded amounts to $80, and management consider that it is possible for the authorities to issue an unfavorable resolution for Alpek. 159 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 30. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS In preparing the consolidated financial statements the Company has evaluated the events and transactions for recognition or disclosure subsequent to December 31, 2018, and through January 31, 2019 (date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements), and except for the matters mentioned in the following paragraph, no additional significant subsequent events have been identified: a.

V. and Cogeneration of Clean Energy of Cosoleacaque, S. A. de C. V., for an amount of US$801 to ContourGlobal Terra 3 S.à.r.l. ( CG Terra 3 ), a subsidiary of ContourGlobal PLC.

V. undertakes to sell its shares representing the capital stock of Tereftalatos Mexicanos Gas, S. A. de C. V. (whose assets include gas pipelines that transport natural gas from the point of interconnection of the national transport system integrated to the point of consumption), in favor of CG Terra 3, in the event that the latter exercises the purchase option within a maximum term of 5 years from the date of signature of the option contract. The option will be subject to compliance with certain conditions precedent under this contract and its price will be subject to working capital adjustments. The agreed price will be subject to certain adjustments established in the purchase agreement and must be paid at the close of the transaction, which is expected during the first months of 2019, and is subject to customary closing terms and conditions, including corporate and consumer approvals. the Federal Commission of Economic Competition. b. On January 9, 2019, Alpek announced that one of its subsidiaries signed an agreement with Perpetual Recycling Solutions, LLC ( Perpetual ), for the purchase of a PET recycling facility located in Richmond, Indiana, United States of America.

The closing of the transaction is subject to compliance with preceding conditions and is expected during the first quarter of 2019. c.
