In our opinion, a responsible approach to taxation is decisive for our long-term activities in the countries in which we operate. This includes identifying and complying with current tax legislation, disclosing all the necessary information to the relevant authorities, and taking prudent tax positions where tax legislation allows different interpretations or choices.

Hurtigruten and shipbuilder Kleven worked with KONGSBERG on MS Roald Amundsen and MS Fridtjof Nansen. Their goal is to ensure they operate emission-free in sensitive areas while meeting environmental and reliability requirements dictated by the harsh polar conditions. A ‘first phase’ system onboard the Roald Amundsen reduces fuel consumption. Fridtjof Nansen features a larger capacity ‘second phase’ battery pack. This enables fully electric sailing across greater distances for longer periods and zero-emission port operation. Hurtigruten aims to upgrade the first ship to the same battery system. For zero-emissions mode, Kongsberg Maritime’s SAVe Energy Storage system powers the complete system, eliminating the need for running engines. KONGSBERG’s AZP 120L-PM thrusters provides propulsion and manoeuvring, whilst Kongsberg Maritime’s electric power system, generators, motors, switchboards, power management system, ACON integrated automation system provides power. The Kongsberg Energy Management System provides real-time information about the vessels operation, fuel consumption and emission levels. The decision to invest in a hybrid solution was an important milestone in Hurtigruten’s goal of sailing fully electric expeditionary ships in the Arctic and Antarctic. The technology, in combination with the design of the hull and effective use of electricity onboard, reduce fuel consumption by approximately 20 per cent. CO2 emissions are reduced by a similar amount equalling more than 3,000 tonnes of CO2 annually.

One of our goals is to prevent all incidents, accidents or fatal injuries involving our employees, visitors, customers and partners. Through a proactive and open HSE culture, we are continually striving to achieve this goal. Safety must always come first – Our employees have the authority to “Stop work”. Our HSE KPIs have once again seen a positive development this year. The targeted increase in reported near-accidents and observations has been achieved. KONGSBERG grew throughout 2019, not only organically, but also through two major acquisitions. The activities and operations of the new businesses are high-risk from an HSE perspective. Through the introduction of a new “KONGSBERG Global HSE Day”, we introduced the “KONGSBERG Life-Saving Rules”, which are based on the rules developed by the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP). These are nine life-saving rules within areas where there is a high risk of accidents occurring. They can be linked to the various types of activities and operations in which the “new” KONGSBERG participates. At the same time, we will also contribute to a common basis for the Group’s proactive HSE work. The rules are a supplement to the established governance system for HSE. The aim is for them to direct attention on risk areas with relevant issues, and act as a topic for discussion for the various activities and locations within KONGSBERG. The KONGSBERG Life-Saving Rules are in­ tend­ed to ensure focus and attention, to bring us closer to our zero vision and boost our efforts to build a strong and proactive HSE culture. Our HSE work is being continued with goals concerning continuous improvement and focus. The zero vision and safe@KONGSBERG is our goal. KONGSBERG has a zero vision. We aim to ensure that no incidents, accidents or fatal injuries occur. KONGSBERG Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2019 62 01 Year 2019 02 About 03 Sustainability 04 Corporate 05 Directors’ Report and KONGSBERG Governance Financial Statements Sustainability in KONGSBERG Focus areas Climate Statement and Key Figures Auditor’s Report EQUALITY AND MANAGEMENT Young Professional Advisory Board Developments within professional life have led to fierce competition to attract and retain the greatest talent. We have to think in new, more sustainable ways to stand up to the great changes we are facing. We also have to involve younger employees. When young people evaluate their career goals, they are just as interested in how the Group develops people and society as they are in products and services. Young people communicate in a different way and look to get more out of working life than just money. They want a future-oriented workplace that paves the way for business models and uses technology to ensure that products and services are produced in a way the Earth can sustain. In light of this, the Young Professional Advisory Board (YPAB) was established in 2018. YPAB consists of a total of ten representatives be­­ tween the ages of 24 and 31, with different types of education and experience. The board has representation from all three KONGSBERG business areas, and meets at least twice a year. Representatives serve on the board for two years. This group is an advisory body for the CEO and other senior management, related specifically to profiling and strategy work. The board is used as a consultative body for the Group's strategy, to capture trends and ideas which may have an impact on its content and implementation. The board members have also reviewed the Group's HR Strategy and provided input on its content. They advocate suggestions and opinions on behalf of the age group they represent. The board provides input on how the Group should position itself to ensure it is attractive to the younger age groups, both internally and externally. It offers its views on the Group's values and behaviour, which influences management principles and future management training within the company. Corporate management is extremely happy to be working with young and talented employees who can both challenge and share new knowledge, something that is vital in our strategic work.

This is a 48-hour case competition, where groups of 2–5 students work on solving a hypothetical future scenario where sustainability and technology are at the core of the problem. The purpose of the competition has been to motivate students to complete their degrees, due to the significant drop-out of first and second-­ year students in certain subjects, and to relate their theoretical knowledge to solving practical problems they may encounter in working life. The theme for the 2019 competition was “Urbanisation – interplay between land and ocean”. The students were challenged to describe the role that technology can play in implementing resource-efficient and climate-adapted initiatives for more robust and resilient coastal towns and cities. The students were asked to reflect on technical, ethical and societal issues related to urbanisation along the coast. This year’s winner was the “Green Hemisphere” team. Their proposed solution was based on a concept which uses dry ice or silver iodide to trigger precipitation. By obtaining data from weather stations and using KONGSBERG technology for autonomous drones and mother ships, an outline was presented as to how humans can control the weather for the very first time. In their entry, the team demonstrated the use of technology and expertise in an innovative and sustainable way. Their solution addressed five criteria: Problem delimitation, innovation, feasibility, sustainability and market potential.

Our responsibility is to provide a limited level of assurance on the subject matters concluded on below. Management responsibilities The Management of KONGSBERG is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Report and that it has been prepared in accordance with the reporting criteria described in the Report, including the GRI Standards, level Core. The Management is also responsible for establishing such internal controls that they determine are necessary to ensure that the information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s responsibilities Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the information in the Report. We have conducted our work in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. Deloitte AS is subject to International Standard on Quality Control 1 and, accordingly, applies a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. Considering the risk of material misstatement, our work included analytical procedures and interviews with management and individual resources responsible for the preparation of the Report and for sustainability management at corporate level, as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the information in the Report. We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to provide a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters.

Code of Practice DEVIATIONS FROM THE CODE OF PRACTICE According to the Group’s own evaluation, KONGSBERG deviates from the code of practice on one major point: Item 6 – General Meeting There are two deviations on this point: I. The entire Board has not usually attended the General Meeting. Thus far, the items on the agenda of the General Meeting have not required this. One or more Board representatives are always present to respond to questions. Other Board members participate on an ad hoc basis. From the Group’s perspective, this is considered to be sufficient. II. Article 8 of the Articles of Association specifies that the General Meetings are to be chaired by the Chair of the Board. If the Chair is absent, the General Meeting is chaired by the Board’s Deputy Chair. In the absence of both, the Chair shall be elected by the General Meeting. This is a departure from the recommendation regarding an independent chair. The arrangement has been adopted by the shareholders through a unanimous resolution of the General Meeting and has worked satisfactorily thus far. develop attractive solutions for 1 REPORT ON 2 OPERATIONS the market, meet important needs CORPORATE for a sustainable society, and GOVERNANCE focus on continually improving Articles of association our operations.

For contracts with a significant financing item, the interest component will be separated out from the contract revenue. IFRS 15 consists of 5 steps that must be assessed to determine There may also be cases involving income reduction as a result of the correct revenue recognition of customer contracts. financial penalties for delays. When determining the transaction price, Step 1: Identifying customer contracts these must only be taken into consideration if it is highly likely that Step 2: Identifying separate performance obligations they will occur. Step 3: Determining the transaction price Step 4: Allocating the transaction price Step 4: Allocating the transaction price Step 5: Recognition when the performance obligation is fulfilled When the transaction price has been determined, it will be allocated to each individual performance obligation as identified under step 2, Step 1: Identifying customer contracts based on the stand-alone selling price. The stand-alone selling price is The first step in the evaluation model specifies main criteria for the normally the price of the product when it is sold separately, less any existence of a customer contract. The contract must have commercial discounts that are to be distributed. If this price cannot be observed substance, and key terms of delivery must be agreed between the directly, it must be estimated.

It revenues between licences and services, but also to the distribution must also be probable that KONGSBERG will receive settlement for the of revenues between different products that are supplied as an delivery. In principle, a customer contract does not have to be in integrated solution. Integrated solutions are mainly considered as a writing, but KONGSBERG has established this as a requirement. single performance obligation under step 2. This is because the systems operate together and because the delivery is usually Step 2: Identifying separate performance obligations approved as a whole. Nevertheless, a performance obligation can be The accounting standard also requires that an assessment must be allocated different prices for different parts of the customer contract. made for all goods and services that the seller is committed to by the This is done according to the stand-alone principles described above. contract, in relation to those that are processed as separate This means that the level of earning in different phases of a customer performance obligations or reported together in connection with contract may vary depending on which parts are to be transferred to revenue recognition. The assessments consider whether or not goods the customer’s control. and services in the agreement are suitable for separate delivery, and whether or not the contract gives the customer a stand-alone value Step 5: Recognition when the performance obligation is fulfilled for individual goods and services. The latter is assessed on the basis The final step of the model states when revenue is to be recognised, of specific contractual conditions.

In obligation. KONGSBERG, revenue recognition is often based on the progress of the Examples of contracts that are normally divided into parts are projects. The principle stated in IFRS 15 is that control over the asset various products in a single contract that are used by the customer will then be transferred to the customer before KONGSBERG can independently of one another, goods with service agreements, recognise revenue. Control normally means that the customer can use licences and services. Certain areas in KONGSBERG use the latter type an asset directly, is able to achieve most of the remaining benefits of of contract.

Estimation uncertainty There will always be uncertainty related to the estimate of value in use. The assessments are based on key assumptions as described above, and are to a large degree influenced by market data for comparable companies, interest rates and other risk conditions. These calculations are based on discounted future cash flows, in which judgement was used as regards future profit and operation.

Forward rates as fair value hedges shall hedge all contractual currency flows. This means that the forward rates will hedge capitalised receivables in foreign currency, as well as invoicing remaining on the contracts. KONGSBERG is also exposed to other currencies, but these are insignificant compared to the exposure to USD and EUR. The summary for 2018 included the British pound (GBP) due to the considerable exposure of cash flow hedges in connection with the acquisition of Rolls-Royce Commercial Marine.

The effect on results that occurs will be recognised in the statement of financial position and realised in line with the progress of the projects. The capitalised value associated with the rolled cash flow hedges amounts to MNOK 157 as of 31 December 2019 (MNOK 76 as of 31 December 2018). 2) The net effect from the cash flow hedges before tax that are recognised in comprehensive income amounts to MNOK -159 in 2019 (MNOK 65 in 2018). Comprehensive income shows a change of MNOK -117 and the deviation of MNOK 42 is due to a change in the fair value of basis swaps of MNOK 23 and adaptations in connection with hedge accounting in acquired companies of MNOK 19. If an expected project is contracted and a fair value hedge is established, the hedge reserve is recognised as transferred from comprehensive income to the capitalised value of the hedged project. If an expected cash flow occurs and does not result in a fair value hedge, the hedge reserve is recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transactions. In 2019, no effects were recognised related to ineffective cash flow hedges in the ordinary result. Any hedge ineffectiveness concerning cash flow hedges is also recognised under the item “recognised gains/losses in the period” in the table above.

No adjustment is made with respect to these prices. Level 2: Fair value is measured based on data other than the list prices covered by the level 1, but which is based on observable market data either directly or indirectly. These methods have some uncertainty in the determination of fair value. Level 3: Fair value is measured using models that substantially employ non-observable market data. This involves more uncertainty connected to the determination of fair value. See also Note 4 “Fair value” for a discussion of the fair value measurement. H) Estimate uncertainty KONGSBERG has a range of financial instruments that are recognised The assessments are always based on KONGSBERG’s best estimates, at fair value. When market prices cannot be observed directly through but it is still likely that the observable market information and the traded prices, fair value is estimated by using different models that assumptions will change over time. Such changes can affect the either build on internal estimates or input from banks or other market calculated values of financial instruments considerably, and thereby players. The assumptions for such assessments include spot prices, result in gains and losses that will affect future periods’ income forward prices and interest curves. statements. How such changes affect the income statement depends on the type of instrument and whether it is included in a hedging relation. 23 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Nominal amounts in MNOK 31 Dec 19 31 Dec 18 Bank deposits 5 654 10 038 Total 5 654 10 038 Bank guarantees have been furnished for funds related to withholding tax for employees of MNOK 297 (MNOK 273 in 2018).

The process of measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligations and selecting the method of measuring this progress, involves judgement and estimates by the management. It may be uncertainty in relation to the transaction price, allocation of the transaction price, and in the estimated costs in fulfilling the contract. The recognition of revenue from customer contracts over time is a key audit matter, due the extent and complexity of ongoing projects in the Group with different duration, and where management exercises judgement to estimate the progress, including expected transaction price and costs to fulfil the contract. We evaluated the application of accounting principles, methods for estimating the projects’ progress, routines for monitoring projects and tested controls over estimating projects’ progress, estimation of expected transaction price and costs to fulfil the contract. We discussed estimated total project costs, including provisions for guarantees, with project management. We evaluated these estimates against comparable projects and analysed the development in margins for selected projects and the project portfolios. For a selection of contracts, we tested estimated revenues against agreements, incurred costs against invoices and hours against project reports, and assessed the total estimated project costs. In addition, we have analysed actual margins on a selection of completed contracts against estimated total margins during the project period in order to evaluate management’s accuracy in judgments and estimates. We refer to note 2 for details on estimation uncertainty and note 8 on customer contracts in the financial statements for further information.

The assessment of fair value of intangible assets is judgmental and complex, and the acquisition and initial consolidation has a significant impact in the financial statements of Kongsberg and hence we considered this as a key audit matter. We reviewed and assessed the accounting principles and discussed the methods of assessing the fair value of customer relations, brands and technology with the management and third-party valuation specialists. We tested the basis for the purchase price allocation and assessed the completeness of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by reading the share purchase agreement, due diligence reports, board minutes, and the final agreement after the closing negotiations in October 2019. We also had discussions with management to review the adjustments that has been done during the measurement period with effect on the recognised preliminary amounts on the transaction date. We refer to note 6 acquisitions in the financial statements for additional information. Other information Other information consists of the information included in the Company’s annual report and sustainability report other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (management) are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of management for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act and accounting standards and practices generally accepted in Norway for the financial statements of the parent company and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU for the financial statements of the Group, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with law, regulations and generally accepted auditing principles in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ► identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ► obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control ► evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. ► conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. ► evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report and on the report on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the report on corporate governance and corporate social responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and proposal for the allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on registration and documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, «Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information», it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to ensure that the Company's accounting information is properly recorded and documented as required by law and bookkeeping standards and practices accepted in Norway.
