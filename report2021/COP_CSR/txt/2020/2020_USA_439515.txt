Date: April 13, 2020 Subject: ON Semiconductor Communication on Progress to the United Nations Global Compact To our stakeholders: In April 2019, our company joined the United Nations (UN) Global Compact as a signatory. In doing this, we agreed to align with the UN Global Compact’s Ten Principles covering human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. We would like to utilize this annual Communication on Progress, to communicate our actions to continuously improve the integration of the global compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations, as well as commit to sharing this information with our internal and external stakeholders during the time period of April 2019 – April 2020. During the course of the year, ON Semiconductor mapped the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to our material topics and business strategy, all of which align to our business objectives through our products, programs and initiatives. While we strongly believe that all of the SDGs are vital, we prioritized five goals that are the most relevant to our sustainability strategy to make the largest global impact. The principles are a natural fit for the company as each of the elements has been a part of our organization’s business strategy and practiced for several years as noted in our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) statement of commitment. We are furthering that commitment in 2020 as the ON Semiconductor executive staff committed to adopt targets and key performance metrics for the following SDGs: SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation Targets/Goals for 6.3 and 6.4 SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth Targets/Goals for 8.5, 8.7 and 8.8 SDG 10: Reduced Inequalities Targets/Goals for 10.2 and 10.3 SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Targets/Goals for 12.4, 12.5 and 12.6 SDG 13: Climate Action Targets for 13.3 The detailed actions including policies, procedures, programs and activities that the company has undertaken to implement the ten principles of the UN Global Compact and the measure of these outcomes can be found in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility report (scheduled for publication in June 2020) and our Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Content Index.
