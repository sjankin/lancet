It represents 55% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed at long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount is unchanged on 2013 when it was increased by 10% to reflect the change in Mr. Paul Hermelin’s role who became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the end of the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 24, 2012, the extension of his responsibilities and the evolution and internationalization of the Group since 2008, when his compensation was last modified. The annualized increase in his theoretical compensation since 2008 and therefore in his fixed compensation is less than 0.9% per annum. This theoretical compensation falls within the median of CAC 40 executives. Annual variable €1,311,780 During the Board of Directors’ meeting of March 11, 2020, the Board, based on the audited and compensation (paid in 2020 approved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the in respect of amount of Mr. Paul Hermelin’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2019, of a target amount if 2019) objectives are attained of €1,200,000, i.e. 45% of his total theoretical compensation and 82.6% of his fixed compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that may vary between 0% Reminder and 200% of the theoretical amount for quantifiable objectives and 0% and 100% of the theoretical €1,337,226 amount for purely qualitative objectives. (paid in 2019 in respect of V1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the following 2018 after respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to an ambition decided by the approval by Board: Shareholders’ 1) % attainment of revenues: 30% weighting; Meeting) 2) % attainment of operating margin rate: 30% weighting; 3) % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; 4) 2019 free cash flow: 20% weighting. These objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ meeting of March 20, 2019. CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT — Corporate Governance 94 Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation Attainment rates for these four objectives were 98.2%, 97.38%, 102.37% and 111.98% respectively, which taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment rate of 101.54%. The Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards or downwards such that for 2019: 2. — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to 75%, the V1 component will be nil; — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is greater than or equal to 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount; — accordingly, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases the variable component by 4%; — a weighted rate of 101.54% in 2019 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable component by 106.18%; — giving a final V1 amount of €1,200,000/2*106,18% equal to €637,080. V2 component: The assessment and associated proposal were based on work performed by the Compensation Committee, which reviewed the various personal objectives grouped into two categories: “shared objectives” for 50% and” specific objectives” for 50%. For the shared objectives, the Board defined three sets of indicators, evenly spread, around (i) the operational transformation of the Group and its commercial structure and strengthening of the client-focus (including 7.5% quantifiable) (ii) accelerating the transition of the Group’s business portfolio (20% quantifiable) and (iii) the roll-out of the CSR strategy (including 10% quantifiable). In regard to the first set of shared objectives, the Board assessed the efficiency of the transformation program, validating the achievement of the 2019 market guidance, based on strengthened client relations, as well as an ambitious 2020 budget, and identified major commercial wins (including the Bayer contract recently announced to the market). For the quantitative part, the Board noted a resignation rate for managers holding key positions below the target rate set and an external hires percentage for managers in line with objectives. These two indicators reflect the attractiveness of the Group and its new organization toward the talent market. On this basis the Board assessed the first set of shared objectives to be attained 126%. For the second set of shared objectives the Board validated the published growth in Digital and Cloud offers of over 20%, in excess of the growth objective set. On this basis the Board assessed the objectives for the second set of shared objectives to be attained 135%. The third shared objective (15%) concerned the deployment of the CSR strategy around three pillars (diversity and digital inclusion, quantitative objectives and environmental responsibility, a qualitative objective). The diversity objective was measured based on the % of women in key senior executive positions, with an improvement objective of 3 points. This ambitious objective was only attained in the amount of 2.8 percentage points. The digital inclusion objective sought to focus over 70% of internal initiatives in this sector, based on a methodology validated and audited by an external firm. This objective was attained, with nearly 74% of internal initiatives concerning this sector. The environmental responsibility qualitative objective was to support our clients accelerate their energy transition and roll-out the “client carbon saving” project. The strategy and actions taken and deployed were presented to and approved by the Board. Given these achievements, the Board considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 110%. The Board defined three specific personal objectives. The first specific objective (20% qualitative) concerned the impact of mergers and acquisitions on the Company’s growth (quantitative). 2019 was marked by the announcement of a friendly tender offer for the listed company, Altran. This strategic acquisition was validated by the Board and the completion of this acquisition has been validated by the AMF in January 2020. The Board considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 100%. The second specific objective (20% qualitative) concerned the efficiency of Group governance. Given the market announcement of the choice of future Chief Executive Officer, the fluid managerial transition and the cohesion of the management team, the Board considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 100%. The third specific objective (10%) concerned supporting the development of new trends and innovative technologies to enable the Group attain its growth objectives. This was reflected, in particular, by the presentation of the data strategy at Munich and the resulting implementation of pilot projects with partners and clients. The Board considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 100%.

Total fixed and variable compensation for 2019 is therefore €2,763,780 i.e. 104.2% of the theoretical compensation and may be summarized as follows: 2019 Variable compensation calculation for Mr. Paul Hermelin V1: quantitative part based on budgeted financial targets % Indicator Weight attainment Weighted Revenues 30% 98.20% 29.46% Operating Margin rate (%) 30% 97.38% 29.21% Pre-tax net profit 20% 102.37% 20.47% Organic free cash flow 20% 111.98% 22.4% Weighted total performance before flex 101.54% Weighted total after 75/125 flex (4*weighted performance – 3) 106.18% Variable V1 on target 600,000 Computed V1 637,080 V2: qualitative part based on 2019 objectives Category Weight Weighted total Operational transformation of the Group 15% Accelerating the transition of the business portfolio 20% Deployment of the CSR strategy 15% Impact of M&A on growth and successful integration 20% 112.5% Efficient governance 20% Supporting the development of new trends and innovative technologies 10% Variable V2 on target 600,000 Computed V2 674,700 TOTAL 2019 VARIABLE COMPENSATION 1,311,780 As a % of the total variable on target 109.3% As a % of fixed compensation 90.3% CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT — Corporate Governance 96 Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation The variable compensation due in respect of a given year is calculated based on the audited accounts approved by the Board at the beginning of Y+1 and is paid after the approval of the compensation components by shareholders.

The external performance conditions accounts other form of (IFRS for 35% of the grant and is based on the comparative performance of the Capgemini share over three long-term accounting years against the average performance of a basket of 8 comparable companies in the same business compensation value on sector and from at least 5 countries (Accenture/Indra/Atos/Tieto/Sopra Steria/CGI Group/Infosys and grant date) Cognizant) the CAC 40 index and the Euro Stoxx 600 index. Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, while 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance is similar to that of the market, only 50% of the initial grant vests. The external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares starts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while historically it started at 90%. The internal performance condition based on organic free cash flow generation over the three-year period from 2019 to 2021 accounts for 50% of the grant. The minimum amount necessary for shares to vest is €3.1 billion. Above this threshold, shares vest progressively on a straight-line basis, with the maximum grant requiring organic free cash flow of €3.4 billion or more. The internal performance condition relating to CSR performance indicators measured at the end of 2021 is based for 50% on the percentage inflow of female executives (VPs) through promotion and external hiring during the period 2019 to 2021. This % must be 25% to receive 100% of the grant with no grant if it is below 22%. For the remaining 50%, it is based on a reduction in GHG emissions/employee of at least 20% vs. the 2015 benchmark, with 100% of the grant vesting if this reduction reaches 23%. The number of shares that may vest to the Executive Corporate Officer may not exceed 0.001% of the share capital.

This plan was reviewed by an external firm which confirmed that it complies with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendations of October 6, 2009, and also the revised AFEP-MEDEF Governance Code issued. The plan was closed to new beneficiaries in 2015 and rights of existing members have been frozen as of October 31, 2015. In order to receive benefits under this plan it is necessary to be with the Group at the time of retirement, to have at least 10 years of seniority, to have been a Group Executive Member for at least 5 years and to have a compensation level above eight times the French annual social security ceiling (PASS) during 5 years at least. Benefits are based on reference earnings equal to the average of the three best years (fixed and variable components) from among the ten years preceding retirement. In addition, this supplementary pension is subject to three cumulative limits such that the pension amount cannot exceed: — 40% of reference earnings; — 50% of reference earnings, including pensions received under all other pension plans; and — reference earnings are capped at 60 times the French annual social security ceiling. Benefits are proportional to length of service (minimum of 10 years required and a maximum of 30 years), reflecting the required progressive acquisition of entitlement, which remains well below the threshold set by the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the recent legal ceiling of 3% per annum. Entitlement is acquired at a rate of 1.5% per year for the first 10 years of seniority and for subsequent years only at rates of: — 1% up to 20 times the French annual social security ceiling — 2% between 20 and 40 times the French annual social security ceiling — 3% between 40 and 60 times the French annual social security ceiling Therefore, the maximum possible annual entitlement is equal to 1.83% before the potential impact of the cumulative limits. Due to the long seniority of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (frozen at 23 years in 2015) the value of the annual pension is estimated at a net amount after income tax and employee social contributions of K€300, corresponding to a gross amount of K€901 or 34% of his 2019 theoretical compensation. The plan is financed through an external insurance company and as such the required funds to pay the pension support a contribution of 24%. 21 members have benefited from this regime since its launch with eight presently active as of December 31, 2019.

Fixed €885,000 The gross fixed compensation of €885,000 for fiscal year 2019 was approved by the Board of Directors compensation (paid in 2019) on March 20, 2019 at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. It represents 60% of the total theoretical compensation if objectives are attained and is reviewed at long intervals in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code. This amount was proposed following the nomination as of January 1, 2018 of Mr. Thierry Delaporte as Chief Operating Officer and approved by the Combined Shareholders’ Meetings of May 23, 2018 and May 20, 2019. Annual variable €630,209 During the Board of Directors’ meeting of March 11, 2020, the Board, based on the audited and compensation (paid in 2020 approved accounts and at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, assessed the in respect of amount of Mr. Thierry Delaporte’s variable compensation for fiscal year 2019, of a target amount if 2019) objectives are attained of €590,000, i.e. 40% of his total theoretical compensation and 66.6% of his fixed compensation and comprising two equal components, V1 and V2, that may vary between 0% Reminder and 200% of the theoretical amount for quantifiable objectives and 0% and 100% of the theoretical €647,148 amount for purely qualitative objectives. (paid in 2019 in respect of V1 component: this component is calculated in accordance with quantifiable criteria and the following 2018 after respective weightings, all relating to the financial results as compared to an ambition decided by the approval by Board: Shareholders’ 1) % attainment of revenues: 30% weighting; Meeting) 2) % attainment of operating margin rate: 30% weighting; 3) % attainment of pre-tax net profit: 20% weighting; 4) 2019 free cash flow: 20% weighting. These objectives were assessed with respect to the objectives set by the Board of Directors’ meeting of March 20, 2019. Attainment rates for these four objectives were 98.2%, 97.38%, 102.37% and 111.98% respectively, which taking account of the relative weighting of each objective, gives a weighted attainment rate of 101.54%. The Group’s historical calculation formula accelerates actual performance upwards or downwards such that for 2019: — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is less than or equal to 75%, the V1 component will be nil; — if the weighted performance of the above four financial indicators is greater than or equal to 125%, the V1 component will be capped and equal to twice its theoretical amount. — accordingly, a one-point variance in the weighted attainment rate increases or decreases the variable component by 4%; — a weighted rate of 101.54% in 2019 results in the multiplication of the theoretical variable component by 106.18%; — giving a final V1 amount of €590,000/2* 106.18% equal to €313,231. V2 component: The assessment and associated proposal were based on work performed by the Compensation Committee, which reviewed the various personal objectives grouped into two categories: “shared objectives” for 50% and “specific objectives” for 50%. For the shared objectives, the Board defined three sets of indicators, evenly spread, around (i) the operational transformation of the Group and its commercial structure and strengthening of the client-focus (including 7.5% quantifiable) (ii) accelerating the transition of the Group’s business portfolio (20% quantifiable) and (iii) the roll-out of the CSR strategy (including 10% quantifiable). In regard to the first set of shared objectives, the Board assessed the efficiency of the transformation program, validating the achievement of the 2019 market guidance, based on strengthened client relations, as well as an ambitious 2020 budget, and identified major commercial wins (including the contract recently announced to the market). For the quantitative part, the Board noted a resignation rate for managers holding key positions below the target rate set and an external hires percentage for managers in line with objectives. These two indicators reflect the attractiveness of the Group and its new organization toward the talent market. On this basis the Board assessed the first set of shared objectives to be attained 126%. CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT — Corporate Governance 100 Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation For the second set of shared objectives the Board validated the published growth in Digital and Cloud offers of over 20%, in excess of the growth objective set. On this basis the Board assessed the objectives for the second set of shared objectives to be attained 135%. The third shared objective (15%) concerned the deployment of the CSR strategy around three pillars (diversity and digital inclusion, quantitative objectives and environmental responsibility, a qualitative 2. objective). The diversity objective was measured based on the % of women in key senior executive positions, with an improvement objective of 3 points. This ambitious objective was only attained in the amount of 2.8 percentage points. The digital inclusion objective sought to focus over 70% of internal initiatives in this sector, based on a methodology validated and audited by an external firm. This objective was attained, with nearly 74% of internal initiatives concerning this sector. The environmental responsibility qualitative objective was to support our clients accelerate their energy transition and roll-out the “client carbon saving” project. The strategy and actions taken and deployed were presented to and approved by the Board in March 2020. Given these achievements, the Board considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 110%. The Board defined three specific personal objectives. The first specific objective (20% quantifiable) concerned the improvement in the gross margin percentage compared to 2018. Based on the audited accounts, the Board noted that the gross margin improved in 2019 compared with 2018 in accordance with the objective set and considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 100%. The second specific objective (15% quantifiable) concerned the commercial success of a selection of strategic partnerships. The Board noted that the sales growth objective of over 20% jointly set with these partnerships was exceeded, reflecting the “New” momentum and considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 127%. The third specific objective (15%, including 5% quantifiable) concerned operational transformation in India as part of its strategic plan. The quantitative objective concerned a significant reduction in the employee turnover rate. This objective was not attained. In addition, the strategic plan was presented to the Board and the related choices included in the 2020 plans. The Board considered the objectives set for this category to be attained 40%. The Board approved a weighted performance rounded to 107.5% as per the table below: Target Proposal Objective Computed Qualitative Max Computed Qualitative Operational transformation of the Group 7.5% 7.5% 22.5% 12.5% 6.5% Accelerating the transition of the business portfolio 20% n/a 40.0% 27.0% n/a Deployment of the CSR strategy 10% 5% 25.0% 11.5% 5.0% Improvement in the gross margin vs. 2018 20% n/a 40.0% 20.0% n/a Commercial success of strategic partnerships 15% n/a 30.0% 19.0% n/a Operational transformation in India 5% 10% 20.0% 0.0% 6.0% Total 77.5% 22.5% 177.5% 90.0% 17.5% Target 100% Proposed 107.5% leading to a V2 calculation of €295,000*107.5% = €316,978 CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT 101 Corporate Governance — Compensation of Executive Corporate Officers Amount or accounting value subject to vote Presentation Accordingly, variable compensation of €630,209 was approved by the Board for 2019, i.e. 71.2% of fixed compensation for the same year and 106.8% of the theoretical variable compensation.

The external performance conditions accounts for 35% of the grant and is based on the comparative performance of the Capgemini share over three long-term accounting years against the average performance of a basket of 8 comparable companies in the same business compensation value on sector and from at least 5 countries (Accenture/Indra/Atos/Tieto/Sopra Steria/CGI Group/Infosys and grant date) Cognizant) the CAC 40 index and the Euro Stoxx 600 index. Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, while 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance is similar to that of the market, only 50% of the initial grant vests. The external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares starts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while historically it started at 90%. The internal performance condition based on organic free cash flow generation over the three-year period from 2019 to 2021 accounts for 50% of the grant. The minimum amount necessary for shares to vest is €3.1 billion. Above this threshold, shares vest progressively on a straight-line basis, with the maximum grant requiring organic free cash flow of €3.4 billion or more. The internal performance condition relating to CSR performance indicators measured at the end of 2021 is based for 50% on the percentage inflow of female executives (VPs) through promotion and external hiring during the period 2019 to 2021. This % must be 25% to receive 100% of the grant with no grant if it is below 22%. For the remaining 50%, it is based on a reduction in GHG emissions/employee of at least 20% vs. the 2015 benchmark, with 100% of the grant vesting if this reduction reaches 23%. The number of shares that may vest to the Executive Corporate Officer may not exceed 0.001% of the share capital.

As Mr. Thierry Delaporte will continue to hold positions within the Capgemini group at the end of his term of office, the Board of Directors meeting in December 2019 noted that one of the cases of exclusion provided for under the severance indemnity had thus been established and that, as a result, no indemnity was due to Mr. Thierry Delaporte at the end of his term 2. of office as Deputy Chief Executive Officer. It is also reminded that following the appointment of Mr. Thierry Delaporte as Chief Operating Officer as of January 1, 2018, the Board, based on the proposal of the Compensation Committee, authorized the principle of severance pay due to each Chief Operating Officer in the event of termination of their corporate office. However, no severance pay is due if the Chief Operating Officer leaves the Company on his own initiative, changes functions within the Group, is entitled to assert in a near future his rights to retirement or in the event of a gross negligence or serious misconduct. In compliance with the recommendations of the revised AFEP-MEDEF Code, the aggregate amount of (i) severance pay effectively paid, (ii) any indemnity likely to be paid in connection with the termination of an employment agreement, and (iii) any indemnity likely to be paid in consideration for the non-compete undertaking, may not exceed a maximum amount equal to twice the applicable gross theoretical compensation (fixed plus variable) as at the date of termination of the functions. The grant and amount of the severance pay will depend on the percentage attainment of the weighted performance of the financial indicators applicable for the Chief Operating Officer’s V1 variable component during each of the three completed fiscal years preceding the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer, it being specified that the last year will count for 40%, while the two previous fiscal years will count for 30% each. As the grant and amount of the V1 variable component is subject to performance indicators and to the Group’s consolidated results, the severance pay will therefore also be subject to the satisfaction of these same performance conditions. The Board will confirm the effective achievement of these performance criteria. Board approval on December 6, 2017 Authorized by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 23, 2018 Seventh resolution (regulated agreements) Non-compete €0 No amount due in respect of the year indemnities Thierry Delaporte retaining functions within Capgemini, the Board of Directors of December 2019, acknowledged that the non-compete obligation undertaken by Thierry Delaporte upon his appointment as Chief Operating Officer will not be applicable as the termination of his office as Chief Operating Officer will not be followed by the termination of his employment agreement. As a consequence, no indemnity will be due to Thierry Delaporte under the non-compete undertaking at the end of his corporate office. It is reminded that, on a proposal of the Compensation Committee, the Board decided that each Chief Operating Officer will be subject to a non-compete undertaking for a period of twelve months as from the termination of his employment contract following termination of his functions of Chief Operating Officer, and will receive an indemnity equal to half of the applicable gross theoretical compensation (fixed plus variable) if objectives are attained on the date of termination of the functions of Chief Operating Officer. The Board of Directors will be entitled, at its own discretion, to lift this non-compete obligation on departure of the Chief Operating Officer and therefore in such case, not to implement this non-compete indemnity.

The external performance conditions accounts for 35% of the grant and is based on the comparative performance of the Capgemini share over three long-term accounting years against the average performance of a basket of 8 comparable companies in the same business compensation value on sector and from at least 5 countries (Accenture/Indra/Atos/Tieto/Sopra Steria/CGI Group/Infosys and grant date) Cognizant) the CAC 40 index and the Euro Stoxx 600 index. Accordingly, no shares vest if the relative performance of the Capgemini share is less than 100% of the performance of the basket of comparable companies, while 100% of shares vest only if this relative performance is at 110% or above. If performance is similar to that of the market, only 50% of the initial grant vests. The external condition has been strengthened since 2016, as the effective vesting of shares starts from a minimum achievement of 100% of the basket of comparable companies, while historically it started at 90%. The internal performance condition based on organic free cash flow generation over the three-year period from 2019 to 2021 accounts for 50% of the grant. The minimum amount necessary for shares to vest is €3.1 billion. Above this threshold, shares vest progressively on a straight-line basis, with the maximum grant requiring organic free cash flow of €3.4 billion or more. The internal performance condition relating to CSR performance indicators measured at the end of 2021 is based for 50% on the percentage inflow of female executives (VPs) through promotion and external hiring during the period 2019 to 2021. This % must be 25% to receive 100% of the grant with no grant if it is below 22%. For the remaining 50%, it is based on a reduction in GHG emissions/employee of at least 20% vs. the 2015 benchmark, with 100% of the grant vesting if this reduction reaches 23%. The number of shares that may vest to the Executive Corporate Officer may not exceed 0.001% of the share capital.

However, no severance pay is due if the Chief Operating Officer leaves the Company on his own initiative, changes functions within the Group, is entitled to assert in a near future his rights to retirement or in the event of a gross negligence or serious misconduct. 2. In compliance with the recommendations of the revised AFEP-MEDEF Code, the aggregate amount of (i) severance pay effectively paid, (ii) any indemnity likely to be paid in connection with the termination of an employment agreement, and (iii) any indemnity likely to be paid in consideration for the non-compete undertaking, may not exceed a maximum amount equal to twice the applicable gross theoretical compensation (fixed plus variable) as at the date of termination of the functions. The grant and amount of the severance pay will depend on the percentage attainment of the weighted performance of the financial indicators applicable for the Chief Operating Officer’s V1 variable component during each of the three completed fiscal years preceding the termination of his duties as Chief Operating Officer, it being specified that the last year will count for 40%, while the two previous fiscal years will count for 30% each. As the grant and amount of the V1 variable component is subject to performance indicators and to the Group’s consolidated results, the severance pay will therefore also be subject to the satisfaction of these same performance conditions. The Board will confirm the effective achievement of these performance criteria. Board approval on December 6, 2017 Authorized by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting: May 23, 2018 Seventh resolution (regulated agreements) Non-compete €0 No amount due in respect of the year indemnities On a proposal of the Compensation Committee, the Board decided that each Chief Operating Officer will be subject to a non-compete undertaking for a period of twelve months as from the termination of his employment contract following termination of his functions of Chief Operating Officer, and will receive an indemnity equal to half of the applicable gross theoretical compensation (fixed plus variable) if objectives are attained on the date of termination of the functions of Chief Operating Officer. The Board of Directors will be entitled, at its own discretion, to lift this non-compete obligation on departure of the Chief Operating Officer and therefore in such case, not to implement this non-compete indemnity.

Data identified in these tables by a √ has been reviewed by KPMG with a reasonable level of assurance. 2. Data for 2015 and 2018 differs from that reported in previous years’ reports for the following key reasons: – an increase in the scope of reporting in 2019 to include four new entities in Asia-Pacific and additional data from local expense systems (in Australia, Belgium, Mexico, and the Nordics). Where these changes are significant, we have recalculated previous years data; – a few smaller data corrections and updates have been applied for India rail, Italy natural gas, Morocco hotel & taxi travel, and Poland car travel; – our carbon accounting approach follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard – the term “Scope” is used to categorize emissions reported according to the level of control a company has over an emissions source. 3. All emission sources, except electricity, have been calculated using the emission factors recommended by DEFRA: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/measuring-and-reportingenvironmental-impacts-guidance-for-businesses 4. Electricity emissions have been calculated in the main body of the table above, in line with the GHG Protocol’s “location-based ” approach. Regional electricity emission factors have been applied for the UK (DEFRA 2019) and the US (eGrid). For all the other countries, emission factors from International Energy Agency (IEA) have been applied to calculate Scope 2 location-based emissions. Scope 3 “T&D losses” refers to electricity transmission and distribution grid losses i.e. the energy loss that occurs in transmitting the electricity from the generation source to our facilities. As recommended by the GHG Protocol, emissions of Fluorinated Gas (F-gas) not covered by the Kyoto Protocol such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are not reported as Scope 1 emissions and are therefore not included above. These F-gas emissions are, however, captured with a value of 1,212 tons of CO2e for 2019. 5. Our business travel emissions are calculated including the impact of radiative forcing for air travel, as well as the impact of hotel night stays. Whilst this is recommended best practice, many companies in our sector do not yet include these two emission sources and therefore caution should be applied trying to compare Capgemini’s business travel emissions to those of other companies in our sector. 6. The “Market-based emissions” given in the final row of the first table are a recalculation of Scope 2 emissions using the GHG Protocol’s market-based approach. Where possible, market-based emissions have been calculated using supplier-specific emission factors. Where these are not available, we have used a residual fuel mix factor, sourced for from REDISS for countries in Europe and from green-e.org for US and Canada. For a few smaller entities, we have assumed an emission factor of 0 for electricity purchased on renewable energy tariffs. In locations where neither supplier-based nor residual fuel mix factors are available, we have used a location-based emission factor. 7. “Renewable Electricity” denotes all renewable electricity purchased at renewable energy tariffs or through renewable energy certificates and a small amount of energy generated on-site in India and through solar photovoltaic panels in the United Kingdom. “Other electricity” means purchased electricity generated from other sources (nuclear or fossil fuels). 8. Given the nature of our business, many of Capgemini’s offices have large server rooms. These are not considered to be data centers but their presence should be taken into consideration when comparing the energy usage of our offices against those in other sectors. 9. Due to lack of reliability in the data provided by the electricity supplier, 68% of the office energy data for France for Q1-Q3 2019 has been estimated based on a standard ratio kWh/m² also used in previous years. This estimated data accounts for approximately 6% of total Group energy use, 8.2% of total office energy use and 0.34% of total GHG emissions. 10. “Other travel emissions” refers to travel by other modes of transportation (bus, tram, motorcycle). 11. Where mileage data is not available this has been estimated by taking the cost data within that country and applying the average cost per mile ratio from other data within that country or region. 12. The availability of accurate waste and water data varies considerably across the Group, depending on the type of site, the type of lease and local waste arrangements. Where actual data is not available, it has been estimated using relevant estimation methods. 13. For anaerobic digestion and composting, data gathering was rolled out across the Group in 2016, hence the figure for 2015 is very low.

The amount of revenue and the costs to be recognized for the period, and of any provisions for loss at completion at the closing date, depends upon the Group’s ability to: — identify all the performance obligations in the long-term multi-service contracts and determine their related accounting treatment; — measure the costs incurred or the total services rendered; — estimate the costs to be incurred till the end of the contract. Considering the judgments and estimates made by the management to determine how revenue and related costs should be recognized, we deemed the recognition of revenue and costs related to long-term service contracts to be a key matter in our audit.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement provided for by article L. 2251021 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is included in the Management Report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of article L. 823-10 of said Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the financial statements of the information contained in this statement which has to be subject to a report by an independent third party. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory auditors We were appointed as Statutory auditors of Capgemini SE by the Annual General Meeting held on 25 April 2002 for KPMG audit and on 24 May 1996 for PricewaterhouseCoopers audit. As at 31 December 2019, KPMG audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers audit were in the 18th year and 24th year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach 5. Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: — identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; — evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements; — assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; — evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; — obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT — Financial information 254 Consolidated accounts Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

This matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT 281 Financial information — 2019 financial statements Measurement of investments in subsidiaries in Capgemini SE Risks identified Our audit approach At December 31, 2019, equity investments reported in the balance Our work included: sheet amount to €18,038 million.

Such change would require reassessing the financial year to infinity; comparing these rates with market relevance of the assumptions used to determine value in use and data or external sources and recalculating the rates based the reasonableness and consistency of the calculation criteria. on our own data sources, – comparing net cash/debt with underlying data used to prepare We believe that measurement of the value of equity investments is the Company’s consolidated financial statements; a key audit matter given the significant amount of equity investments reported in the financial statements and their sensitivity to — when the value in use of equity investments is measured based assumptions made by Management. on the proportionate share of consolidated net equity or based on the market value of comparable transactions: – assessing the appropriateness of the valuation method used, – assessing the documentation used to measure value in use; 5. – assessing the appropriateness of the financial information provided in the notes to the annual financial statements.

Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory auditors We were appointed as Statutory auditors of Capgemini SE by the Annual General Meeting held on April 25, 2002 for KPMG audit and on May 24, 1996 for PricewaterhouseCoopers audit. As at December 31, 2019, KPMG audit and PricewaterhouseCoopers audit were in the 18th year and 24th year of total uninterrupted engagement. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with French accounting principles and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on 5. the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit. Furthermore: — identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; — obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; — evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements; — assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein; — evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT 283 Financial information — 2019 financial statements Our report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

These commitment amounts were reduced to €419 million for each of these two banks following the syndication phase. This bridge loan of an initial term of one year, with two successive six-month extension options exercisable at the initiative of Capgemini, contains standard stipulations for this type of financing. Commission and interest payable to Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Société Générale in respect of this bridge loan are identical to amounts payable to the other banking institutions participating in the bridge loan in the same capacity and are consistent with market practice for this type of financing.

CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT 339 Report of the Board of Directors and draft resolutions to be presented at the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting — Supplementary report of the Board of Directors on the issuance of shares under the Capgemini group “ESOP 2019” employee shareholding plan 2. Further details regarding the transaction Framework of the transaction In a press release dated September 19, 2019, the Company specified that this fifth international share ownership plan, proposed to approximately 98% of the employees of the Group, aims to associate all employees to the Capgemini development and performance. The shares were subscribed to either directly or through a FCPE, in accordance with applicable regulatory and/or tax legislation in the various countries of residence of the beneficiaries of the capital increase. Employees subscribed to Capgemini shares within the framework of a unique subscription formula called leveraged and guaranteed, allowing the employees to benefit from a guarantee on their investments made into this plan. In certain countries, employees will be allocated Stock Appreciation Rights (“SAR”) by their employer, the amount of which will be indexed in accordance with a formula similar to the one offered under the leveraged formula; a specific subscription formula was also proposed in the United States of America to take into account the applicable regulatory and tax legislation. Subscribers to the offer shall hold either the shares subscribed to directly, or the corresponding units of the FCPEs, for a five-year period, except in the event of an authorized early exit. Other characteristics of the transaction The reservation period of the shares (at an unknown price), during which the employees and corporate officers of the Capgemini group could request to subscribe, was opened from September 19 to October 8, 2019. A subscription period, during which subscription requests made during the reservation period could be withdrawn, was opened from November 12 to 14, 2019 (inclusive), after communication to the beneficiaries of the subscription price established by the decision of the Chairman & Chief Executive Officer dated November 7, 2019. Having taken into account all subscription requests, a reduction of the subscription requests has been made. Thus, all of the shares that may be issued within the framework of the transaction, or 2,750,000 (two million seven hundred fifty thousand) shares will be subscribed to. The number of subscribers amounted to more than 33,700 employees, or 16.07% of the eligible population, and similarly to the previous ESOP plans, the transaction was oversubscribed to in the amount of 162%. The newly-issued shares will be fully assimilated with the existing ordinary shares comprising Capgemini’s share capital. These shares will bear benefit entitlement as of January 1, 2019. The request to list the newly-issued Capgemini shares to trading on the same line of Euronext Paris (ISIN code: FR0000125338) as the existing shares will be made as soon as possible following the completion of the capital increase scheduled to take place on December 18, 2019. 3. Impact of the issuance of 2,750,000 shares on the stake of holders of shares and securities, their shareholders’ equity per share and the theoretical impact on the market value of the share price. 3.1 Impact on shareholders’ stake in the share capital of the Company For illustrative purposes, on the basis of the share capital of the Company at June 30, 2019, or 167,293,730 shares, the impact of the issuance of new shares on the stake of a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital of the Company prior to, and not subscribing to, the issuance would be as follows: Shareholder stake Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase 1% 0.97% After issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase 0.98% 0.96% (1) Calculations are made assuming the delivery of the 4,934,457 performance shares granted on June 30, 2019 (assuming that all the performance conditions will be satisfied). 3.2 Impact of the issuance on the consolidated shareholders’ equity per share 7. For illustrative purposes, the impact of the issuance on the consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to owners of the Company per share (calculations based on consolidated shareholders’ equity attributable to owners of the Company at June 30, 2019, and the number of shares comprising the share capital at June 30, 2018 after deduction of treasury shares) would be as follows: Consolidated shareholders’ equity per share Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €45.12 €43.82 After issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €45.89 €44.59 (1) Calculations are made assuming the delivery of the 4,934,457 performance shares granted on June 30, 2019 (assuming that all the performance conditions will be satisfied). CAPGEMINI — 2019 UNIVERSAL REGISTR ATION DOCUMENT — Report of the Board of Directors and draft resolutions to be presented at the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting 340 Supplementary report of the Board of Directors on the issuance of shares under the Capgemini group “ESOP 2019” employee shareholding plan 3.3 Impact of the issuance on the statutory shareholders’ equity per share For illustrative purposes, the impact of the issuance on the statutory shareholders’ equity per share of Capgemini SE (calculations based on statutory shareholders’ equity attributable to owners of Capgemini SE at June 30, 2019, and the number of shares comprising the share capital at June 30, 2019 after deduction of treasury shares) would be as follows: Statutory shareholders’ equity per share Non-diluted basis Diluted basis (1) Before issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €84.24 €81.80 After issuance of the new shares resulting from the capital increase €84.37 €81.97 (1) Calculations are made assuming the delivery of the 4,934,457 performance shares granted on June 30, 2019 (assuming that all the performance conditions will be satisfied). 3.4 Theoretical impact on the stock market value of the Capgemini share The theoretical impact of the issuance of 2,750,000 shares at the issuance price on the stock market valuation of the Capgemini share is calculated as follows: Share price before the transaction = the average of the listed closing prices of the Capgemini share during the 20 stock market trading days preceding the fixing of the issuance price (calculated as the average of the closing share price between October 10 and November 6, 2019, inclusive). This price amounts to 105.45 euros. Theoretical share price after the transaction = ((the average of the listed closing prices of the Capgemini share during the 20 stock market trading days preceding the fixing of the issuance price x the number of shares before the transaction) + (the issuance price x the number of newly-issued shares))/(the number of shares before the transaction + the number of newly-issued shares). The issuance price of the reserved capital increase is set at 92.27 euros. Accounting for these assumptions, the theoretical post-transaction stock market value of the Capgemini share amounts to 105.47 euros. It is recalled that this theoretical approach is provided for illustrative purposes and does not predict future evolutions in the share price. — This supplementary report and the Statutory auditors’ report may be consulted by shareholders at the Company’s head office and will be brought to the attention of shareholders at the next Shareholders’ Meeting.
