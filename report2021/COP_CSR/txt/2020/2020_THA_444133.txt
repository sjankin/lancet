Emission factors of GHG emissions refer to the data of Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization), IPCC 2006 and Defra 2018. The data of GWP refers to GHG Protocol. Reporting scope of GHG emissions is operational control. Reporting of indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) is the location-based method. Direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) in 2018 and 2019 for Mitr Phol Group were reduced from 2016 and 2017 due to a decrease in non-renewable energy usage and an increase in solar energy, which contributed to lower GHG emissions. Indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) in 2018 and 2019 for Mitr Phol Group were reduced from 2016 and 2017 due to an increase in bioenergy usage produced by Mitr Phol Group and more solar energy, which helped to lessen electricity purchased from external providers. Other indirect GHG emissions (Scope 3) includes GHG emissions from raw material transportation by third-party organization, product transportation by third-party organization, and employee’s ground transportation and air travel. 128 Sustainability Report 2019 Mitr Phol Group Air Emissions Quality from Factory Business Standard Average of Air Emission Quality in Each Year Unit Air Quality Level 2016* 2017** 2018** 2019** GRI 305-7 (2016) Air Quality Sugar NOx (ppm) ≤ 200 112.00 83.40 58.70 44.92 business SOx (ppm) ≤ 60 5.90 12.00 2.61 1.74 CO (ppm) ≤ 690 327.80 306.00 182.50 166.58 TSP (mg/m3)1) ≤ 120 18.80 6.40 23.83 29.40 TSP (mg/m3) 3) ≤ 320 NA NA NA 26.65 TSP (mg/m3) 4) ≤ 400 NA NA NA 4.68 Energy NOx (ppm) ≤ 200 62.37 66.84 113.89 81.54 business SOx (ppm) ≤ 60 2.20 1.89 6.15 3.19 CO (ppm) ≤ 690 172.57 127.16 353.66 177.12 TSP (mg/m3)1) ≤ 120 28.09 19.77 41.76 22.46 TSP (mg/m3) 2) ≤ 320 17.40 1.10 11.80 30.14 TSP (mg/m3) 4) ≤ 400 NR NR NR NR Wood NOx (ppm) ≤ 200 11.00 15.00 38.58 20.95 substitute materials SOx (ppm) ≤ 60 2.00 2.00 3.36 2.24 business CO (ppm) ≤ 690 264.00 132.00 110.11 53.82 TSP (mg/m3)1) ≤ 120 130.00 160.00 79.74 4.95 TSP (mg/m3) 3) ≤ 320 NA NA NA 2.54 TSP (mg/m3) 4) ≤ 400 NA NA NA 81.20 Fertilizer NOx (ppm) ≤ 200 NR NR NR 20.41 business SOx (ppm) ≤ 60 NR NR NR 1.31 CO (ppm) ≤ 690 NR NR NR 11.20 TSP (mg/m3)1) ≤ 120 NR NR NR NR TSP (mg/m3) 3) ≤ 320 NR NR NR NR TSP (mg/m3) 4) ≤ 400 NR NR NR 204.54 Remarks: * refer to data collected between January 1 December 31, 2016. ** refer to data collected between November 1 of the previous year to October 31 of the reporting year.
