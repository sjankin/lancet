The objective: promote the empowerment and accountability indispensable to Sodexo’s growth. To empower managers and reward them for their contribution to the company’s results, Sodexo bases its compensation on a philosophy of paying for performance. The objective is to reward results and to promote behaviors that foster sustainable and proﬁtable growth. This policy is based on sharing the collective value created to reward each person’s individual contribution. Compensation policies and programs are intended to be straightforward and transparent, grounded in globally consistent principles and guidelines that are adapted to speciﬁc local factors.

The center will enable people in France with few qualiﬁcations to learn new skills, increasing their employability and providing the business with the resources it needs to deliver its services. The initiative leverages a new law in France facilitating the creation of such centers by companies, alone or in partnership with other companies. Sodexo and its partners, all leaders in their market, joined forces to enhance the image of the foodservices sector and address labor and skills shortages. The partners’ shared objectives are to increase the industry’s attractiveness, particularly to young people, by offering a qualifying training path with a twofold objective: to boost employment through skills training targeted to industry needs and to contribute to the performance and growth of the partner companies. TEACHING SOFT SKILLS In addition to raising awareness and the image of foodservices professions, the center will allow the companies to deﬁne the educational content and adapt it to their needs. Beyond technical skills, this includes imparting knowledge of workplace health and safety issues as well as developing the soft skills that are critical in consumer-facing jobs, such as a sense of service and hospitality or empathy as well as the ability to work as a team, a topic of particular focus.

These include rising awareness of the impact of food choices on health, the amount of food wasted globally and economic disparity in communities. Through its corporate responsibility roadmap, Better Tomorrow 2025, the company fosters diversity and inclusion and takes action in a number of areas, from developing and advocating healthy and sustainable eating choices to sourcing locally and inclusively. Among its areas of particular focus are two highlighted in this report: reducing its carbon footprint and ensuring the waste reduction on sites. 5,121,136 5.5 56.2% tons of CO2 billion euro of total of shell eggs Scope 3 Supply Chain of Sodexo business value purchased by Sodexo are carbon emissions beneﬁting SMEs cage free shell eggs S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 U N I V E R S A L R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T 51 2 G R O W I N G O U R B U S I N E S S R E S P O N S I B LY FOOD SHOULD BE EATEN, NOT WASTED Sodexo extends its leadership in ﬁghting food waste Sodexo is deploying innovative technology at its sites around the world to achieve its goal of halving food waste and losses in its operations by 2025. The Group extended its efforts to ﬁght against food waste by announcing in May 2019 the deployment of a data-driven food waste prevention program, WasteWatch by Leanpath(1), at 3,000 sites within one year. The Group’s program for preventing food waste incorporates smart food waste measurement technology which enables Sodexo teams to easily and rapidly capture food waste data and identify what is being wasted and why. Teams are then able to implement targeted operational and behavioral changes to eliminate avoidable waste generated by kitchens or disposed by consumers. On average, the program has been shown to be effective in reducing food waste by 50% on the sites on which it has been deployed. DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLE In March 2018, a site in Singapore implemented WasteWatch beginning with training sessions for Sodexo employees and end users, followed by a trial run using the new equipment. As the program was fully implemented, initiatives were introduced to reduce trim waste during food preparation and raise awareness with students to reduce post-consumer waste. Daily production planning has helped reduce food waste from overproduction and chefs are contributing new ideas to further reduce food waste. WasteWatch implementation has helped the client meet its sustainability goals and generated a strong positive response from the team and the surrounding school community. FIGHTING PLASTIC WASTE IN OCEANS Single-use plastics have traditionally been a staple of the Food services industry due to their ability to preserve 15 countries that represent around 70% food, and so reduce food waste. of our revenues. At the same time, it pollutes oceans, harming marine life wildlife and the wider environment. To reduce its dependence on plastics, Sodexo has “Our goal is to prevent food waste throughout the value chain and empower other stakeholders to join 69.2% this effort.

As part of its Better Tomorrow 2025 roadmap, the Group tracks progress toward achieving its 2025 objective to reduce carbon emissions by 34%. Sodexo has achieved signiﬁcant carbon emissions reductions in Scope 1 and 2 (direct GHG(1) emissions from the combustion of energy and electricity). However, there is far greater potential to improve environmental outcomes through the reduction of Scope 3 carbon emissions (indirect emissions), which represent most of the Group’s footprint. Sodexo therefore revised its methodology to calculate and capture emissions reductions achieved in its supply chain. In May 2019, Sodexo submitted its 34% carbon emissions reduction objective for official validation by the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi), in line with the most recent climate data and a warming trajectory limited to +1.5° C. This target was validated by the SBTi in July 2019.

We conducted work to form an opinion on the Statement’s compliance with legal and regulatory provisions and the fair presentation of the Information therein: • we gained an understanding of the activity of all companies in the consolidation scope, of the Entity’s exposure to the main social and environmental risks relating to the business activity and, of its effects on respect for human rights and the ﬁght against corruption and tax evasion, including any related policies and their outcomes; • we assessed the appropriateness of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, by taking into consideration, where relevant, the sector’s best practices; • we veriﬁed that the Statement covers every category of information required under Article L. 225-102-1, Paragraph III concerning social and environmental matters as well as respect for human rights and the ﬁght against corruption and tax evasion; • we veriﬁed that the Statement presents the business model and the main risks relating to the activity of all companies in the consolidation scope, including – if relevant and proportionate – risks due to its business relationships, products or services, as well as policies, actions and outcomes, including key performance indicators; • we veriﬁed that the Statement presents the disclosures required under article R. 225-105, Paragraph II, of the French Commercial Code if they are relevant given the main risks or policies presented; • we obtained an understanding of the process for selecting and validating the main risks; • we enquired about the existence of internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the entity; • we assessed the consistency of the outcomes and key performance indicators with the main risks and policies presented; • we veriﬁed that the Statement covers all companies in the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16 within the limits speciﬁed in the Statement; • we assessed the data collection process implemented by the entity to ensure the completeness and fair presentation of the Information; • For key performance indicators and the other quantitative outcomes(1) that we considered the most important, we set up: • analytical procedures to verify that collected data is correctly consolidated and that any changes to the data are consistent, • tests of details based on sampling to verify that deﬁnitions and procedures are correctly applied and to reconcile data with supporting documents. The work was carried out with a selection of entities contributing(2) to the reported data and represents between 39% and 57% of consolidated data of key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests; • we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative disclosures (actions and outcomes) that we deemed the most important(3) ; • we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our understanding of all companies within the consolidation scope. We believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgment, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance opinion. A higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Means and resources Our work drew on the skills of seven individuals and was conducted between May and November 2019 for a total working time of approximately twelve weeks. To assist us in conducting our work, we called on our ﬁ rm’s sustainable development and corporate social responsibility (CSR) specialists.

Unrealized operating lease commitments presented as off-balance sheet losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, commitments in note 4.24.2.

This report includes information speciﬁcally required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of Statutory Auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. (For the year ended August 31, 2019) SODEXO 255 Quai de la Bataille de Stalingrad 92866 Issy-les-Moulineaux Cedex 9, France To the Shareholders, OPINION In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders’ Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Sodexo for the year ended August 31, 2019. In our opinion, the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Group at August 31, 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. BASIS OF THE AUDIT OPINION Audit framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements” section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules applicable to us, for the period from September 1, 2018 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non audit services prohibited by article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors. Emphasis of matter Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to note 2.1.2 “New accounting standards and interpretations required to be applied” to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, which describes the methods used and the impact of the ﬁrst-time application at September 1, 2018 of IFRS 9, “Financial Instruments” and IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. 144 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W. S O D E X O . C O M C O N S O L I D AT E D I N F O R M AT I O N Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements JUSTIFICATION OF OUR ASSESSMENTS – KEY AUDIT MATTERS In accordance with the requirements of articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most signiﬁcant in our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on speciﬁc items of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill (Notes 2.8.2 and 4.10 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) Description of risk At August 31, 2019, the goodwill balance amounted to 6,158 million euro, representing the largest item on the balance sheet. An impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount of goodwill as determined during the annual impairment test or during a speciﬁc test carried out where there is an indication of impairment, is lower than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is typically determined based on the present value of future cash ﬂows and requires signiﬁcant judgment from management, in particular as regards the preparation of business forecasts, as well as the discount and long-term growth rates used. Accordingly, we deemed the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill to be a key audit matter, due to the size of the goodwill balance and the inherent uncertainty of certain inputs, in particular the likelihood of achieving forecast results included in such measurement. 3 How our audit addressed this risk We performed a critical review of the methods applied by management to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill. Our audit work consisted in: • assessing the components of the carrying amount of cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs, corresponding to the level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group, and their consistency with those used in projecting future cash ﬂow forecasts; • assessing the consistency of the projected future cash ﬂows with the economic environments in which the Group operates; • assessing the consistency of the growth rates used to project future cash ﬂows with available external analyses; • assessing the reasonableness of the discount rates applied to estimated future cash ﬂows, verifying in particular that the various inputs used to calculate the weighted average cost of capital for each CGU or group of CGUs were sufficient to approximate the return expected by market participants for similar activities; • verifying that note 4.10 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements contains the appropriate disclosures on the sensitivity of the recoverable amount of goodwill to changes in the main assumptions used. Supplier discount allowances (Note 2.22.3 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) Description of risk Vendor Discount Allowances (VDA) received by the Group from suppliers in the context of Sodexo managed food or facilities services contracts are recognized as a reduction in cost of sales. The Group has a large number of supplier purchasing agreements that provide for VDAs based on quantities purchased or other contractual conditions, including exceeding thresholds or respecting commitments, such as vendor exclusivity arrangements. These agreements may be signed at a local, regional or global level. Due to the number of such agreements within the Group and the fact that their anniversaries do not always coincide with the Group’s ﬁscal year, the measurement of VDAs requires signiﬁcant estimates from management and is therefore deemed to be a key audit matter. S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T 145 3 C O N S O L I D AT E D I N F O R M AT I O N Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements How our audit addressed this risk We tested the effectiveness of the controls implemented by management to avert or detect any errors in estimating the value of VDAs. Our audit procedures included, on a sample basis: • analyzing supplier agreements and the proper application of their terms and conditions in determining the VDAs recognized for the ﬁscal year, in particular as regards purchasing volumes, including the estimation of VDA accruals at the end of the reporting period; • verifying the existence of the most material receivables recognized at the end of the reporting period with regard to accrued VDAs, as well as the consistency of their calculation with the terms and conditions of the supplier agreements; • comparing the VDAs effectively received after the end of the reporting period with the receivables recognized at the end of the reporting period in order to assess the reliability of the Group’s estimates. Post-employment beneﬁts (Notes 2.17.2 and 4.17 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) Description of risk The Group contributes to deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans, mainly in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy. At August 31, 2019, the Group recognized a net beneﬁt obligation of 244 million euro, corresponding to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the net beneﬁt obligation. Assumptions used in calculating the obligation include length of service, life expectancy, salary inﬂation, staff turnover, and the discount and inﬂation rates, and therefore involve the judgment of management. Any change in these key assumptions could have a signiﬁcant impact on the net beneﬁt obligation. Accordingly, this subject was deemed to be a key audit matter. How our audit addressed this risk We were informed of the procedures implemented by the Group for measuring the net beneﬁt obligation. With the support of our actuaries, we assessed the key assumptions and data used by the Group’s actuaries to measure the net beneﬁt obligation with regard to the main deﬁned beneﬁt plans, most notably in France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy, and evaluated their ﬁndings. We compared the key assumptions taken from the measurement models with external data and tested the sensitivity of the net beneﬁt obligation to changes in these key assumptions. We also obtained external conﬁrmation of the plan assets or implemented other audit procedures to conﬁrm their existence and proper valuation. Tax risks (Notes 2.16, 4.18 and 4.28 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) Description of risk The Group has operations in numerous countries around the world and, in the normal course of business, is subject to regular inspections by local tax authorities. Such inspections, covering corporate income tax, as well as other taxes, levies and similar payments, may give rise to tax adjustments and disputes with tax authorities. Estimates of the impacts of these tax risks and any related provisions involve signiﬁcant judgment by management, especially as regards the expected outcome of disputes in progress or the probability of identiﬁed risks occurring. Accordingly, we deemed this subject to be a key audit matter. 146 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W. S O D E X O . C O M C O N S O L I D AT E D I N F O R M AT I O N Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements How our audit addressed this risk We held meetings with management to gain an understanding of the internal control procedures implemented to identify tax risks and uncertain tax positions, and, when necessary, determine any provisions. With the support of our tax experts, we also: • held meetings with the Group tax department and local management to assess the latest status of any inspections in progress and tax adjustments notiﬁed by the tax authorities, and to monitor developments in any disputes in progress; • consulted the recent decisions and correspondence of Group companies with the tax authorities, and gained an understanding of the correspondence between the companies concerned and their tax advisors; • analyzed the responses of the tax advisors to our requests for information or their analyses of disputes in progress; • conducted a critical review of the estimates and positions adopted by management; • veriﬁed that the latest developments had been factored into the risk analysis and the estimates of the provisions set aside in the statement of ﬁnancial position. Measurement of the fair value of the Group’s interest in Bellon SA (Notes 2.1.2, 2.12.1, 4.11 and 4.21 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements) Description of risk Through its subsidiary Soﬁnsod, the Group holds a 19.61% interest in Bellon SA, which holds a controlling interest in Sodexo SA with 42.22% of the share capital and 56.58% of the exercisable voting rights at August 31, 2019. In accordance with IFRS 9, the Group accounts for its investment as a non-current financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income (not recyclable). 3 Following the ﬁrst-time application of IFRS 9 at September 1, 2018, the Group measured the fair value of the investment at 596 million euro. At August 31, 2019, management determined that the fair value was 708 million euro using the same methods. With the support of two independent experts, management developed a method to measure the fair value of the investment based on the net asset value (NAV) of Bellon SA, taking into account the speciﬁc characteristics of this investment as described in note 4.21 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Management therefore considered that the investment’s fair value corresponded, at both September 1, 2018 and August 31, 2019, to the Group’s share in Bellon SA’s NAV, less a 40% discount. Determining the fair value of Sodexo’s interest in Bellon SA requires signiﬁcant judgment from management as regards the choice of measurement method and the use thereof, in particular the discount applied to Bellon SA’s NAV. Accordingly, we deemed the measurement of the fair value of Sodexo’s interest in Bellon SA to be a key audit matter, due to the size of the item on the balance sheet and the degree of judgment inherent in certain inputs used to determine fair value. How our audit addressed this risk We performed a critical review of the methods applied by management to determine the fair value of the interest in Bellon SA. With the assistance of our asset valuation experts, our procedures consisted in: • familiarizing ourselves with the work of management and the management-appointed independent experts to develop a measurement method for the investment and determine the terms and conditions of its implementation; • assessing the consistency of the measurement method used with the speciﬁc characteristics of the investment; • assessing the appropriateness of the inputs used to determine the 40% discount applied to Bellon SA’s NAV in measuring the fair value of the investment; • verifying that note 4.21 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements contains the appropriate disclosures on the measurement method used by management and the terms and conditions of its implementation.

We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We attest that the information pertaining to the Group provided in the management report includes the consolidated non-ﬁnancial information statement required under article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code. However, in accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-10 of the French Commercial Code, we have not veriﬁed the fair presentation and consistency with the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the information given in that statement, which will be the subject of a report by an independent third party. REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed Statutory Auditors of Sodexo by the Shareholders’ Meetings held on February 22, 1994 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on February 4, 2003 for KPMG Audit. At August 31, 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and KPMG Audit were in the twenty-sixth and seventeenth consecutive year of their engagement, respectively. RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE RELATING TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for preparing consolidated ﬁnancial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the ﬁ nancial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and ﬁnancial reporting procedures. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Objective and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements. As speciﬁed in article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company’s management. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; • obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements; 148 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W. S O D E X O . C O M C O N S O L I D AT E D I N F O R M AT I O N Statutory Auditors’ Report on the consolidated financial statements • assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualiﬁed opinion or a disclaimer of opinion; • evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon. Report to the Audit Committee We submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal control that we have identiﬁed regarding the accounting and ﬁnancial reporting procedures.

This report includes information specifically required by European regulations or French law, such as information about the appointment of Statutory Auditors. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the year ended August 31, 2019 SODEXO 255, quai de la Bataille-de-Stalingrad 92866 Issy-les-Moulineaux Cedex 9, France To the shareholders, Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Shareholders Meeting, we have audited the accompanying ﬁnancial 4 statements of Sodexo for the year ended August 31, 2019. In our opinion, the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the ﬁnancial position of the Company at August 31, 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee. Basis of the audit opinion Audit reference framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under these standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the ﬁnancial statements” section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules applicable to us, for the period from September 1, 2018 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014 or the French Code of Ethics (Code de déontologie) for Statutory Auditors. Justiﬁcation of our assessments – key audit matters In accordance with the requirements of articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justiﬁcation of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were the most signiﬁcant in our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed as part of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed as expressed above. We do not provide a separate opinion on speciﬁc items of the ﬁnancial statements. S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T 179 4 I N F O R M AT I O N O N T H E I S S U E R Statutory Auditors’ Report Valuation of equity investments Description of risk The balance of equity investments at August 31, 2019 represented 6,488 million euro, the largest asset on the balance sheet. Equity investments are carried at cost, and at each balance sheet date, may be impaired based on their value in use. As described in note 2.1.3 to the ﬁnancial statements, value in use is determined by management on the basis of net asset value, proﬁtability and the future prospects of the investee. When the carrying amount of an investment is higher than the net book value of the share of net assets of the subsidiary, value in use is determined based on discounted future cash ﬂows, using business plans prepared by management and covering one to ﬁve years. In preparing such business plans, management is required to exercise judgment. Accordingly, we deemed the valuation of equity investments and any related receivables or provisions for contingencies to be a key audit matter, due to the inherent uncertainty of certain components of the valuation, in particular the likelihood of achieving forecast results used to calculate value in use. How our audit addressed this risk In order to assess the reasonableness of the estimate of the value in use of equity investments, based on the information provided to us, our audit work consisted mainly in verifying that the estimated values determined by management were based on an appropriate measurement method and underlying data, and, depending on the investee concerned: • for valuations based on historical data: verifying that the equity values used were consistent with the ﬁnancial statements of the entities concerned, and that any adjustments to equity were based on documentary evidence; • for valuations based on forecast data: • obtaining forecast future cash ﬂows of the investees concerned, and assessing their consistency with the business plans drawn up by management, • assessing the consistency of the growth rates used for projected cash ﬂows with available external analyses, in light of the economic environments in which the investees operate, • assessing the reasonableness of the discount rates applied to estimated future cash ﬂows, verifying in particular that the various inputs used to calculate the weighted average cost of capital for each investee were sufficient to approximate the return expected by market participants for similar activities. Our audit work also consisted in: • assessing the recoverability of receivables related to equity investments; • verifying the recognition of provisions for contingencies where the Company is exposed to the losses of investees with negative equity. Speciﬁc veriﬁcations In accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also performed the speciﬁc veriﬁcations required by French legal and regulatory provisions. Information given in the Management Report and in the other documents provided to the shareholders with respect to the Company’s ﬁnancial position and the ﬁnancial statements We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the ﬁnancial statements of the information given in the Board of Directors’ Management Report and in the other documents provided to the shareholders with respect to the Company’s ﬁnancial position and the ﬁnancial statements. We attest to the fair presentation and the consistency with the ﬁnancial statements of the information about payment terms referred to in article D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code. Information with respect to Corporate Governance We attest that the section of the Board of Directors’ Report relating to Corporate Governance sets out the information required by articles L. 225-37-3 and L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code relating to remuneration and beneﬁts received by corporate officers and any other commitments made in their favor, we have veriﬁed its consistency with the ﬁnancial statements or with the underlying information used to prepare these ﬁnancial statements, and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from companies controlling it or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest to the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of article L. 225-37-5 of the French Commercial Code relating to those items your Company has deemed liable to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, we have veriﬁed its consistency with the underlying documents that were disclosed to us. Based on this work, we have no matters to report with regard to this information. 180 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W. S O D E X O .

Report on other legal and regulatory requirements Appointment of Statutory Auditors We were appointed Statutory Auditors of Sodexo by the Shareholders Meetings held on February 22, 1994 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and on February 4, 2003 for KPMG Audit. At August 31, 2019, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and KPMG Audit were in the twenty-sixth and the seventeenth consecutive year of their engagement, respectively. Responsibilities of management and those charged with governance for the ﬁnancial statements Management is responsible for preparing ﬁnancial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with French accounting principles, and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the ﬁ nancial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well as, where applicable, any internal audit systems, relating to accounting and ﬁnancial reporting procedures. The ﬁnancial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Responsibilities of the Statutory Auditors relating to the audit of the ﬁnancial statements 4 Objective and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the ﬁnancial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements. As speciﬁed in article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company’s management. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgment throughout the audit. They also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; • obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control; • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management and the related disclosures in the notes to the ﬁnancial statements; • assess the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the Audit Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory Auditors conclude that a material uncertainty exists, they are required to draw attention in the Audit Report to the related disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualiﬁed opinion or a disclaimer of opinion; • evaluate the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

The activities concerned are (i) holding any position as a corporate officer, employee or consultant, and (ii) carrying out any consulting work for certain of the Sodexo Group’s competitors, as set out in the agreement, either directly or through another legal entity. Because of his duties within the Group, Denis Machuel has knowledge of Sodexo’s business, strategy and customers in each of its activities, which, according to the Board of Directors, justiﬁes the need for a non-compete agreement. This non-compete agreement entered into between the Company and Denis Machuel on August 30, 2018, and amended on November 6, 2018, will apply for a period of twenty-four months (24) as from the date on which his duties as Chief Executive Officer cease.

If Denis Machuel fails to fulﬁll his obligations under this agreement, he will not receive the indemnity described above, and he will have to repay any amounts that he has already received. In addition, he will be liable to pay a ﬁxed penalty representing twelve (12) months of his most recent gross annual compensation.

S O D E X O . C O M C O R P O R AT E G OV E R N A N C E Board of Directors 5.2.2 Compliance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code Sodexo uses the AFEP-MEDEF Code as its Corporate Governance framework. The latest version of this Code, as revised in June 2018, is available on the websites of the AFEP (www.afep.com) and the MEDEF (www.medef.com). The Company has opted not to apply certain of the Code’s recommendations, for the reasons set out in the table below. AFEP-MEDEF RECOMMENDATIONS SODEXO PRACTICE Independence criteria for Board members Robert Baconnier’s terms of office as a director of Sodexo have exceeded 12 years since (section 8.5.6 of the Code) February 9, 2017. Among the criteria to be evaluated in In its analysis of whether Robert Baconnier could still qualify as an independent director, considering whether a Board member is the Board of Directors took the following factors into account: independent is that of not having been a • his financial expertise; Board member for more than 12 years. • the objectivity he has always shown during the Board’s debates and discussions; • his ability to convey his opinions and beliefs and make balanced judgments in all circumstances; • his deep understanding of the Group’s challenges and goals, which facilitates the continuity of discussion and provides perspective on decisions. The Board of Directors considers that his personality, leadership qualities and underlying commitment are all evidence of his independent mindset. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the Board has decided not to apply the independence criterion limiting Board members’ terms of office to 12 years and to continue to consider Robert Baconnier an independent director. Furthermore, Robert Baconnier chose to resign from the Audit Committee as of January 22, 2019 and his directorship was only renewed for one year at the Annual Shareholders Meeting of January 22, 2019. Consequently, his final term of office will end on January 21, 2020. Proportion of independent members on Sodexo’s Nominating Committee comprises four members, 50% of whom are independent the Nominating Committee directors. However, it is important to note that: (section 16.1 of the Code) • its members do not include any executive corporate officer, as recommended by the Code; The Code recommends that the majority of • like the Board’s other Committees, it is chaired by an independent director. the members of the Nominating Committee be independent directors.

These shares are subject to a four-year vesting period and their vesting will be contingent upon the following: • for 25% of the shares, average organic revenue growth based on the financial statements for Fiscal 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; • for 25% of the shares, average growth in underlying operating profit margin based on the financial statements for Fiscal 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022; • for 30% of the shares, a TSR target, based on Sodexo’s TSR as measured against that of a peer group comprising 12 companies (ABM Industries, Aramark, CBRE, Compass, Edenred, Elior, Elis/ Berendsen, G4S, ISS, Jones Lang Lasalle, Rentokil and Securitas); • for 20% of the shares, a Corporate Responsibility target corresponding to 37% of the Group’s top management posts to be held by women as of August 31, 2022. These performance conditions are described in detail in section 5.5.2.2 of this Document. No stock options were granted to Denis Machuel. Non-compete No amounts In the event of the termination of Denis Machuel’s duties as Chief Executive Officer, he is subject to a indemnity paid non-compete obligation. This commitment from the Company, which was approved by the Shareholders Meeting on January 22, 2019, has not been implemented during Fiscal 2019. The related conditions and financial consideration are set out in section 5.5.1.3 (Compensation policy) and in section 4.4.2 (Statutory Auditors’ Report on related party agreements and commitments). Supplemental No amounts Since he was appointed a member of the Group’s Executive Committee in September 2014, Denis Machuel pension plan paid has been a beneficiary of a defined benefit pension plan governed by article 39 of the French General Tax Code and article 137-11-1 of the French Social Security Code, set up for the Group’s senior executives who hold an employment contract with one of its French companies. Following his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, at its meeting on April 27, 2018, the Board of Directors decided to authorize Denis Machuel to continue to be a beneficiary of this plan. Under this supplemental pension plan (subject to a minimum of five years of presence in the plan), as a member of the plan for at least 15 years, the pension paid can represent up to 15% of the average of his last three years’ fixed compensation preceding his retirement, to which are added the pensions due to him under compulsory pension plans, provided that he is a corporate officer of the Company at the time of his retirement. Since the enactment of French law of August 6, 2015 known as the “Macron Act”, supplemental pension benefits for corporate officers of listed companies must be subject to performance conditions. Consequently, the Board decided that the Chief Executive Officer’s entitlements under this plan (1% per year up to a maximum of 15%) will only accrue if the achievement rate for his annual variable compensation targets is at least 80%. If this rate is reached then an additional 1% contribution to the defined benefit plan will be accrued for the year concerned. However, if the achievement rate is less than 80%, no defined benefit contribution will be accrued for that year. The Chief Executive Officer did not acquire any rights in Fiscal 2018. Total commitments in favor of the Chief Executive Officer represent, as at August 31, 2019, an amount of 1,554,905 euro. Fringe benefits €14,930 Denis Machuel has the use of a company car and is the beneficiary of an unemployment insurance policy. Denis Machuel does not receive any of the following types of compensation or beneﬁts: multi-year variable compensation, exceptional compensation or indemnity for loss of office. 250 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 U N I V E R S A L R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W.

In accordance with the Company’s bylaws, shares held in registered form for at least four (4) years, i.e., since at least August 31, 2015, and which are still held in such form when the Fiscal 2019 dividend is paid, will automatically be entitled to a 10% dividend premium, representing an additional 0.29 euro per share. Where necessary, the amount of the dividend plus the premium will be rounded down to the nearest euro cent. The number of shares eligible for the dividend premium may not represent over 0.5% of the share capital for any single shareholder (corresponding to a maximum of 737,274 shares per shareholder based on the Company’s share capital as of August 31, 2019). The payment of the dividend and the 10% dividend premium, as described above, represents a payout ratio of 64%, which is fully in line with Sodexo’s policy of providing shareholders a return on their investment over the long term. The dividend payment schedule is as follows: January 30, 2020: Ex-dividend date, i.e., date on which the shares are traded without rights to the Fiscal 2019 dividend.

These principles and criteria will apply from Fiscal 2020 until the approval of a new compensation policy by the Shareholders Meeting. The main proposed evolutions to the compensation policy approved by the Shareholders Meeting of January 22, 2019 are the following: • the possibility to grant exceptional compensation to the Chief Executive Officer has been discarded; • the authorization which may be given to the Chief Executive Officer by the Board to retain non-vested shares in case of departure will only be possible in exceptional circumstances and the number of shares will be determined on a pro rata basis by reference to the time spent within the Group during the vesting period; • the vesting period of shares granted under future performance share plans was aligned with the performance assessment period of 3 years. From now on, the plans shall be approved at the beginning of each ﬁscal year, after the ﬁnancial statements for the previous fiscal year have been published. Consequently, and in order to maintain a regular annual delivery of performance shares, no performance shares will be granted to the Chief Executive Officer in Fiscal 2020.

The Board also decided to implement another beneﬁt pension plan governed by article L.137-11-2 of the French Social Security Code. This new plan which will beneﬁt Denis Machuel will give rise to annual rights amounting to 0.5% of his ﬁxed and variable compensation for the ﬁrst ﬁve years and to 1% beyond those ﬁve years, up to a total of 10%. The acquisition of rights will remain subject to the same performance condition as the one set for the previous plan, i.e. an achievement rate of his annual variable compensation targets of at least 80%. In the twelfth resolution, shareholders are invited to approve the decision taken by the Board of November 6, 2019 which constitutes, in accordance with the current provisions of article L.225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code, a regulated commitment beneﬁting Denis Machuel. 284 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 U N I V E R S A L R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W.

In the thirteenth resolution, shareholders are invited to renew the 18-month authorization granted to the Board of Directors to enable the Company to purchase its own shares at any time other than when a public tender offer for the Company’s shares is in progress. Although French law authorizes share buybacks of up to 10% of a company’s share capital, it is proposed that they be limited to 5% of the share capital as of the date of the Annual Shareholders Meeting on January 21, 2020. The maximum price of the shares that may be purchased under this share buyback program would be 120 euro per share and the total amount invested in the program may not exceed 885 million euro. The shares purchased pursuant to this resolution would be used, inter alia, to (i) cover restricted share plans, (ii) reduce the Company’s share capital by canceling shares, and (iii) provide liquidity in Sodexo shares under the liquidity contract entered into between Sodexo and Kepler-Cheuvreux.

However, the Shareholders Meeting Extraordinary resolutions Fourteenth to nineteenth resolutions: Amendments to the Company’s bylaws The fourteenth to nineteenth resolutions concern various amendments to the Company’s bylaws. Deletion of the article relating to capital contributions Purpose Article 6 (Contributions) of the bylaws, which was included when the Company was ﬁrst created in order to state the various capital contributions made at the time of and subsequent to its formation, is now redundant and unnecessarily complicates the wording of the bylaws. Consequently, the purpose of the fourteenth resolution is to delete article 6 of the bylaws relating to capital contributions and to renumber the subsequent articles accordingly. Disclosure thresholds for ownership interests Purpose Article 9.4 of the Company’s bylaws currently provides that any shareholder whose ownership interest reaches or falls below a number of shares representing 2.5% of the capital must inform the Company within ﬁfteen days. The aim of the ﬁfteenth resolution is to amend this disclosure threshold to 1% of the Company’s voting rights and any multiple thereof and to change the disclosure deadline to ﬁve trading days. The newly worded article 9.4 would also state that these disclosure requirements likewise apply (i) to registered intermediaries acting for shareholders that are not domiciled in France, and (ii) in the same way as for statutory disclosure thresholds, to equity-settled arrangements and derivative instruments. In a rapidly changing market environment, stock market prices are more volatile and the Company considers that more in-depth knowledge of its shareholding structure, whether in shares or in derivative instruments, is essential in order to engage more efficiently with shareholders. 286 S O D E X O F I S C A L 2 0 1 9 U N I V E R S A L R E G I S T R AT I O N D O C U M E N T W W W. S O D E X O . C O M COMBINED ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING, JANUARY 21, 2020 Resolutions submitted to the Combined Annual Shareholders Meeting of January 21, 2020 Appointment of directors representing employees Purpose The PACTE Act lowered the number of Board directors from 12 to 8 for a second director representing employees to be appointed. Consequently, in the sixteenth resolution, shareholders are asked to amend article 11-4 of the Company’s bylaws relating to this requirement so that the article refers to the applicable legal provisions rather than a given number of directors. The Company is already compliant with this requirement as two directors representing employees are members of Sodexo’s Board of Directors. Written consultation of directors for certain Board decisions Purpose France’s new law on the simpliﬁcation, clariﬁcation and modernization of French business law dated July 19, 2019 introduced the option for French joint stock companies (sociétés anonymes) to provide in their bylaws that certain Board decisions may be made through written consultation of the directors. The purpose of the seventeenth resolution, therefore, is to amend article 12 of the Company’s bylaws in order to provide for this possibility for certain types of decisions. The decisions concerned are detailed in full in the legislation and correspond to the appointment of directors in the event that a seat becomes vacant due to a director’s death or resignation; authorizations for granting security interests, endorsements and guarantees; amendments to the bylaws to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations (subject to ratiﬁcation at an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting); and calling the Annual Shareholders Meeting. Removal of the obligation to appoint a deputy Statutory Auditor Purpose The purpose of the eighteenth resolution is to render the Company’s bylaws compliant with the French Act of December 9, 2016 relating to transparency, anti-corruption and economic modernization (the “Sapin II Act”), with respect to the amendment to article L.823-1, paragraph 2, of the French Commercial Code. This new law removes the obligation for companies to appoint a deputy Statutory Auditor when the principal Statutory Auditor is not an individual or a one-person ﬁrm. The shareholders are therefore invited to amend article 15 of the Company’s bylaws to reﬂect this change. Removal of the transitional provisions relating to the introduction of the dividend premium in 2011 Purpose Lastly, the ﬁnal paragraph of article 18-3 of the Company’s bylaws relating to the appropriation and distribution of net income, and in particular the right to a dividend premium for shares held in registered form for at least four years, corresponds to transitional provisions that have been applicable since 2014, after the dividend premium was ﬁrst introduced in 2011. As this paragraph is now redundant, shareholders are invited to remove these transitional provisions. Fourteenth resolution voting rights or any multiple thereof, including percentages (DELETION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE BYLAWS RELATING TO CAPITAL that are higher than the disclosure thresholds provided for in CONTRIBUTIONS) the applicable laws and regulations, must inform the Company Having considered the Board of Directors’ Report, the within five trading days of the threshold being crossed.

Article 9-4 of If these disclosure requirements are not respected, at the request the Company’s bylaws has therefore been amended to read as of one or more shareholders that together hold at least 5% of the follows: Company’s voting rights, the interests in excess of the relevant “Article 9-4: threshold will be stripped of voting rights at Shareholders Meetings. If the omission is remedied, the voting rights concerned Any shareholder whose interest in the Company – held in any will only be exercisable aft er the expiration of a period of two form, taking into account the forms of ownership provided for in the legislation applicable to statutory disclosure requirements – years following such remedy.” reaches or falls below one percent (1%) of the Company’s The wording of articles 9-1 to 9-3 remains unchanged.

Pursuant to this resolution, if an issue is not taken up in full by shareholders exercising their preferential subscription rights, the Board of Directors would be able to offer all or some of the unsubscribed shares or other securities on the open market. The subscription price of the shares and/or other securities that may be issued under this authorization would be set by the Board of Directors, in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations and standard market practices. The maximum nominal amount(1) of the capital increases that could be carried out pursuant to this resolution would be set at 85 million euro (representing approximately 14% of the Company’s share capital) and the maximum nominal amount of any debt securities issued would be 1 billion euro. The 85 million euro ceiling would include the amounts of any capital increases carried out pursuant to the twenty-ﬁrst and twenty-second resolutions below by capitalizing premiums, reserves or proﬁt or by issuing shares and/or other securities to members of an employee share purchase plan. The previous authorization granted at the Annual Shareholders Meeting of January 23, 2018 for the same purpose was not used by the Board. Increase in the Company’s share capital by capitalizing premiums, reserves or proﬁt Purpose The purpose of the twenty-ﬁrst resolution is to renew, for a 26-month period, the delegation of powers granted to the Board of Directors to carry out – at any time other than when a public tender offer for the Company’s shares is in progress – one or more capital increases by capitalizing eligible amounts as provided for in the applicable laws and the Company’s bylaws (premiums, reserves or proﬁt).
