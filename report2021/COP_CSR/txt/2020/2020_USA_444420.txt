World Fuel Services Corporation 9800 NW 41st Street Suite 400 Miami, FL 33178 +1 305 428 8000 www.wfscorp.com December 7, 2020 His Excellency António Guterres Secretary‐General of the United Nations New York, NY 10017 United States of America Your Excellency, I am pleased to reaffirm World Fuel Services Corporation’s ongoing commitment to the UN Global Compact and its Ten Principles on human rights, the environment, anti‐corruption, and labor, and to further confirm our intention to embed the Ten Principles in our corporate strategy, culture, and ongoing business practices. As a leader in the global energy industry, we became a signatory to the UN Global Compact in 2019 as part of an ongoing effort to enhance the transparency and oversight of our sustainability activities. As part of the process, we have selected certain UN Sustainable Development Goals that we believe best represent areas where we can have the greatest impact and that will help guide our focus going forward. For our first annual Communication on Progress, we respectfully submit our 2019 Sustainability Report (the “Report”). Our Report highlights the deliberate actions we have taken to increase the availability of sustainable and alternative energy within the global transportation industry, as well as further develop and implement technology to reduce our own carbon footprint within our operations. This document also demonstrates how we have committed our resources to creating a more sustainable future for ourselves and our stakeholders based on the Ten Principles, and how we plan to realize success through our actions, investments, and energy solutions. As we continue our sustainability journey, it is the people that I am proud to call my colleagues that make World Fuel Services Corporation what it is: a company that takes foremost into consideration health, safety, diversity, community engagement and environmental matters as part of its everyday business calculus. We are pleased to submit our first Communication on Progress and proud to be a part of this indispensable global effort. Sincerely, Michael Kasbar Chairman and Chief Executive Officer World Fuel Services Corporation
