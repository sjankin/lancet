ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS In 2019 our absolute direct (scope 1 and scope 2) emissions were 110 247 tons of CO2e. This is an increase of 11.4 % when compared to 2018. This increase is mainly related to the startup of new plants and to the yearly variation in the product mix across our plants. Direct emissions represent only 3.6% of our absolute direct and direct emissions, 96.4% of which are indirect emissions arising from electricity consumption. 41 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | Table: Direct Emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) 2018 2019 VARIATION (%) TONS CO2e WEIGHT (%) TONS CO2e WEIGHT (%) SCOPE 1 3 200 3,2% 3 988 3,6% 24,6% SCOPE 2 95 776 96.8% 106 260 96.4% 10.9% TOTAL 98 976 100,0. 110 247 100.0% 11.4% Most of our Scope 1 emissions in 2019 (91.9%) were related to leakages of refrigeration gases, use of natural gas and diesel.

As mentioned before, this trend in being changed. In 2019 Logoplaste Mealhada started a project to implement photovoltaic solar panels, which will allow an annual production of 800 000 kWh from renewable sources, saving 500 tons of CO2 emissions per year. 42 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | CO 2e EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS Having 2019 as the base year, Logoplaste established a corporate GHG emissions reduction target: Our goal, by 2030, is to accomplish a 30% reduction in our operational* CO2e emissions This goal focuses on two fronts: plants where we have full ownership on energy, and W2W operations where we will work closely with our customers to reduce our emissions. *Scope 1 and 2 CO 2e EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS Based on 2019 data, Logoplaste defined a GHG emissions intensity indicator that best represents its production process, showing the intensity of GHG emissions relative to production – the ratio between the CO2e emissions resulting from electricity consumption and tonnage of raw materials transformed in the same period, for the plants that operated the full year (excluded are startup Our 2030 goal is a plants and plants closed during 2019). reduction of 30% in As electricity is the main energy source used in production and therefore the main contributor to our GHG emissions scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions (it represents more than 96% of scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emisintensity indicator, sions) it was chosen as numerator. The tonnage from base year. of raw materials transformed was chosen as denominator as raw materials are our main production input. This ratio can be decreased through improved energy efficiency, best practices and the use of renewable energy sources.

To understand the emissions not released with the W2W business model, we calculated the yearly average emissions saved. By having 69% of our plants within our customers’ premises we save 15 529 tons CO2 per year. These CO2 savings are equivalent to 8 500 transatlantic flights, London/New York on a 747. Seen in a different light, you need 721 000 trees to offset 15 529 tons of CO2.

This bottle is the first ever bottle made from waste plastic fished out of the ocean, using recycled Ocean Plastic and Post-Consumer Recycled (PCR) Plastic. The first edition was launched in 2014 through a combined effort of Ecover, TerraCycle, SUEZ and Logoplaste. Since then, every year a new edition is placed on the market to continue reinforcing the message. Another important feature of this bottle is its structural design, supported by Biomimicry Thinking, inspired by the design principles of the skeletons of Diatoms and Radiolarians. These organisms form a large part of the plankton and zooplankton at the base of the marine and freshwater food chains and pollution is having a major impact on their populations. As a result of this design structure, the mechanical performance of the bottle was optimized, while allowing a weight reduction of 20%. 52 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | TAKING STEPS CIRCULAR ECONOMY Becoming a perfect fit for the Circular Economy Logoplaste is committed to manufacturing prodrequires many players all playing the same game. ucts that are fully recyclable or reusable, so materials are kept within the loop whenever possible.

It was created to be offered by the public water supplier in Portugal, to promote the consumption of tap water everywhere, and not just indoors. Its design, inspired by a water cascade, is ergonomic and all its details were given careful attention to optimize resources and energy used in its production. The 500ml PET bottle weights 27.5g and uses a manufacturing process that consumes much less energy when compared to glass or aluminum, materials that are often used to produce reusable bottles. The cap was also optimized and weighs just 1.25g, allowing the creation of one of the lightest reusable water bottles on the market. 54 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | Another commitment is to grow the use of recycled content across all packaging we produce, thus contributing to the circular economy.

One strategy for surviving such a harsh climate is the spiral fibers in the tree trunk that provide strength, among other functions. Our customer wanted a PET bottle that would have strong brand identity and use less material. Logoplaste Innovation Lab used the Biomimicry methodology to tackle this challenge and found inspiration from the white bark pine. Spiral patterns were tested, like those of the pine, to come up with this bottle, where the spirals provide strength and beauty, yet make the bottle lightweight and save 250 tons of raw material per year. 58 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | TAKING STEPS WATER Clean Water and Sanitation is one of the United goplaste has taken several measures to reduce Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.

LOCAL & GLOBAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE Risk assessment is a core function of our OHSMS, hence all actions identified in the assessments are analyzed by the plant managers and their teams, with immediate action plans. We communicate hazards to employees through our risk assessments (available to all employees) and local and global performance reports are shared via email, on Logo TV (corporate television) and posted on the intranet. 79 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | 3. ENGAGEMENT WITH THE TEAMS The plants hold regular OHS meetings where everyone is welcome. The sessions address local performance, improvement plans, accidents and potential changes in the workplace. The meeting minutes and actions are made available to all employees. The use of a near-miss reporting system is also a core and vital activity for employee engagement, making the workplace safer for all. All employees have a duty of care to themselves and to those around them, who might be affected by what they do or do not do. All employees are encouraged to report any unsafe act or condition, and they are empowered to stop working if they feel the workplace is not safe. All accidents are recorded and acted upon by trained First Aid Responders. Accidents are investigated by Team Leaders, and if needed by a Safety Specialist. We use a global accident report based on 5 Whys and a gap analysis to get to the root cause of the problem, as well as implementing the corrective actions. In order for plants to learn from each other, a global accident report with non-sensitive information is shared with all sites. “If you do not ask the right question, you will not get the right answer.” Olivier Serrat, “The Five Whys Technique“ Based on our experience and historical data, • Out of the box thinking – where new engiour most common hazards in the workplace are neering solutions are implemented to overnoise, manual handling (pushing, pulling, twistcome risk ing) and hazardous substances (oil, greases, solvents, cleaning materials).

Digital Watermarks can revolutionize the way packaging is sorted in the waste management system. The discovery was made under the New Plastics Economy program of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which investigated different innovations to improve post-consumer recycling. Digital Watermarks are imperceptible codes, the size of a postage stamp, covering the surface of a consumer goods packaging. They can carry a wide range of attributes such as manufacturer, SKU, type of plastics used and composition for multilayer objects, food vs. non-food usage, etc. The aim is that once the packaging has entered into a waste sorting facility, the digital watermark can be detected and decoded by a standard high resolution camera on the sorting line, sorting packaging into their corresponding streams. This would results in better and more accurate sorting streams and 95 | Logoplaste’s 2019 GRI Sustainability Report | RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT E-PACKAGING A NEW LAYER FOR DIGITAL CONNECTION Digital content is increasing interest in a more chase.

For corporate offices where data was not available, data was extrapolated from other offices based on number of employees. Some plants use steam provided by the customer, but consumption is not available as there are no meters installed. Based on some information provided by the customers we estimated that steam represents less than 0.35% of the total electricity consumption. The conversion factor used to convert kWh to GJ is 0.0036, as defined by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The formula Energy (GJ) = Consumption (tons/year) * LHV (MJ/kg) was used to convert fuels consumption to GJ. We used the Density and LHV (low heating value) values available in DEFRA UK conversion factors 2019 database – Fuel properties. As fuel represents only 4% of our energy consumption, we didn’t apply country specific conversion factors as the impact on the final results wouldn’t be significant.
