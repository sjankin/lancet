On the front cover: Oscar Babucci – Val di Chiana Consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 254 of 30th December 2016 Sustainability Report 2019 Letter to our Stakeholders Ever since its foundation, UBI has been very aware of and focused on sustainability issues. This is clear from the wide range of environmental, social and governance initiatives organised and/or sponsored by the Bank and described in our Sustainability Reports, and from the national and international awards and recognition it has received over the years. In line with EU guidelines and Italian law, the selection and reporting of non-financial activities is based on a materiality analysis, with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) recommendations. The use of a standardised set of indicators has increased information transparency for stakeholders and allowed comparisons to be made between time periods in order to identify development trends. A materiality analysis has many practical benefits, but also some drawbacks. If on the one had it helps produce a more structured description of priorities, on the other it tends to restrict the choice of priorities within an established framework, not necessarily appropriate for the performance and especially the ambitions of a bank such as UBI. From a methodological point of view, a materiality analysis is not always able to grasp the effective importance or impact of the various initiatives or to accurately interpret the input from stakeholders. As many experts have pointed out, these are general limitations, inherent to the nature of a materiality analysis. These limitations may be partly superseded within this type of analysis by improving and refining criteria and procedures. However, in order to do so, it is important to step outside of the box and to take an objective look at the appropriateness, consistency, efficiency and effectiveness of the Bank’s entire sustainability strategy. A materiality analysis is not only required to comply with current regulatory requirements, it is above all a tool for the overall strategy. This is why from this year, as part of the 2020-2022 Business Plan, which involves strengthening the sustainability strategy, we have decided to reconsider the ESG medium to long-term agenda (environment, social and governance), in order to move beyond the goals established for the period covered by the plan. The process will move in four different directions. Firstly, there will be an in-depth examination of the directions being taken by the UN and the EU with regard to sustainability (or rather, “sustainable prosperity”), and in particular the paradigm known as “fair and sustainable finance”. The UN has recently launched its initiative Decade of Action, which aims to accelerate achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set for 2030. Governments will be asked to make a greater and more solid commitment to climate change in the run-up to the climate change conference COP26, to be held in Glasgow in October 2020. All those playing a role in the economy and civil society will be asked to make a more active contribution to the macro-objectives and targets, particularly those that more directly concern people in need and the young. For its part, in January 2020 European Union approved a Plan of Action entitled A Strong Social Europe for Just Transitions. The aim is to make the interaction between the environmental and social dimensions of sustainability more direct and effective. From this year the European Semester will incorporate the SDG indicators into its monitoring and specific country recommendations. From 2021 it will also include the indicators relating to implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. New financial instruments are expected within the framework of the Green New Deal, including a Just Transition Fund and Modernisation Fund for disadvantaged social groups and areas that are underdeveloped and/or more affected by the needs for energy and digital transformation. Important projects in the new Commission’s social agenda include reform of The Youth Guarantee, establishment of a Child Guarantee scheme, launch of a new gender equality strategy, a plan of action to promote a social economy, another to update workers’ skills, and the establishment of the European Education Area. As far as sustainable finance is concerned, there is a proposal for a European Regulation on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, complete with a new classification system, or taxonomy, to classify and assess non-financial initiatives and risks (starting with those concerning the environment). The Commission has announced the publication of an update to the Sustainable Finance Agenda by summer 2020. The European Banking Federation recently stated its hope that the banking world would raise the bar of its ambitions and review its modus operandi in light of the new shared regulatory framework and the more general strategic directions for the next few decades. The second direction will involve self-assessment. The annual sustainability reports and other more detailed information will be used to reconstruct and map UBI’s total non-financial activities in the last five years, based on new criteria that will capture the areas of intervention, types of beneficiary and measures, trends and as far as possible the impacts with greater precision and in a more systematic manner. The purpose of this exercise is to identify the Bank’s strengths and weaknesses as regards sustainability, and the consistency and overall balance of the strategy adopted thus far. The third direction concerns the comparative framework. Global best practice in European and US banking will be examined and studied in order to identify substantive and methodological opportunities and to select benchmarks with which to compare UBI’s non-financial activities and improve its positioning in the national and international panorama. Finally, the fourth direction which will move in tandem with the others will aim to draw up a set of proposals to update and structure the Bank’s medium to long-term agenda and its methods of implementation as clearly as possible. Based on the indications and outcomes of other investigations and studies, the aim is to set out an organisational and functional framework to enable UBI to take a leading position with regard to: 1) the continuous acquisition of usable knowledge concerning sustainability that can be used to precisely define and update the ESG and the Materiality matrix in line with the EU agenda; 2) the selection of a range of lines of activity that best fit these goals; 3) impact assessment and monitoring, also in order to boost organisational learning. The future framework will affect the bank internally (what, how and who) and externally: listening to stakeholders, communication and dissemination of information to reach public opinion including through the effective branding of initiatives, and awareness-raising about sustainability issues among institutional players and civil society, in line with the priorities of the Decade of Action. The Mission UBI has set itself from the outset is “to bank fairly and well”. This motto takes on particular significance and value when it comes to sustainability. This has been the driver behind the decision to undertake a period of reconsideration as described above, which we can summarise as follows: to capture the various aspects that define sustainable prosperity as a collective “good” in order to pursue it in a “good” way.

Repercussions on the Group’s lending due to the impacts on competitiveness and customer choices, mitigated by the high level of diversification in lending sectors. Political and legal Transition risks Increased energy costs for the Group and its customers in sectors that are particularly dependent on fossil fuels, due to the increased costs of GHG emissions. The impact is mitigated by the fact that 100% of the electricity consumed by UBI comes from renewable sources and by the limited exposure of its portfolio to fossil fuels. Risk associated with new regulatory changes that may affect UBI’s products and strategy is also considered in the context of this risk category. The impacts of this risk are considered limited at present, given the sectoral and geographical diversification of lending. Acute Extreme weather events that might affect the operational capacities Physical risks and reduce the profitability of business customers and, with limited impacts for the Group due to the high level of sectoral and geographical diversification in lending sectors.

Pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10, of the Legislative Decree no. 254 of December 30, 2016 (hereinafter “Decree”) and to article 5 of the CONSOB Regulation n. 20267/2018, we have carried out a limited assurance engagement on the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement of Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter “Group”) as of December 31, 2019 prepared on the basis of art. 4 of the Decree, and approved by the Board of Directors on February 28, 2020 (hereinafter the “NFS”). Responsibility of the Directors and the Management Control Committee for the NFS The Directors are responsible for the preparation of the NFS in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting Standards” established in 2016 by GRI Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI Standards”), which they have identified as reporting framework. The Directors are also responsible, within the terms established by law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of NFS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Directors are moreover responsible for defining the contents of the NFS, within the topics specified in article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, taking into account the activities and characteristics of the Group, and to the extent necessary in order to ensure the understanding of the Group’s activities, its trends, performance and the related impacts. Finally, the Directors are responsible for defining the business management model and the organisation of the Group’s activities as well as, with reference to the topics detected and reported in the NFS, for the policies pursued by the Group and for identifying and managing the risks generated or undertaken by the Group. The Management Control Committee is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by law, the compliance with the provisions set out in the Decree.

We conducted our work in accordance with the criteria established in the “International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” (hereinafter “ISAE 3000 Revised”), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. The standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance whether the NFS is free from material misstatement. Therefore, the procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement are less than those performed in a reasonable assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, therefore, do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures performed on NFS are based on our professional judgement and included inquiries, primarily with company personnel responsible for the preparation of information included in the NFS, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures aimed to obtain evidence as appropriate. Specifically we carried out the following procedures: 1. analysis of relevant topics with reference to the Group’s activities and characteristics disclosed in the NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the selection process in place in light of the provisions of art. 3 of the Decree and taking into account the adopted reporting standard; 2. analysis and assessment of the identification criteria of the consolidation area, in order to assess its compliance with the Decree; 3. comparison between the financial data and information included in the NFS and the data included in the consolidated financial statements of the Group; 4. understanding of the following matters:  Business management model of the Group’s activities, with reference to the management of the topics specified by article 3 of the Decree.  Policies adopted by the entity in connection with the topics specified by article 3 of the Decree, achieved results and related fundamental performance indicators.  Main risks, generated and/or undertaken, in connection with the topics specified by article 3 of the Decree. Moreover, with reference to these matters, we carried out a comparison with the information contained in the NFS and the verifications described in the subsequent point 5, letter a) of this report. 5. understanding of the processes underlying the origination, recording and management of qualitative and quantitative material information included in the NFS. We carried out interviews and discussions with the management of Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A. and with the employees of UBI Sistemi e Servizi S.c.p.A., UBI Academy S.c.r.l., IW Bank S.p.A. and we carried out limited documentary verifications, in order to gather information about the processes and procedures, which support the collection, aggregation, elaboration and transmittal of non-financial data and information to the department responsible for the preparation of the NFS. In addition, for material information, taking into consideration the Group’s activities and characteristics:  at the parent company’s and subsidiaries’ level: 3 a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and specifically with reference to the business management model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and gathered supporting documentation in order to verify its consistency with the available evidence; b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical procedures and limited verifications in order to ensure, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data.  For the following subsidiaries, divisions and sites, Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A. headquarter, UBI Sistemi e Servizi S.c.p.A. and UBI Academy S.c.r.l., which we selected based on their activities, their contribution to the performance indicators at the consolidated level and their location, we carried out site visits, during which we have met their management and have gathered supporting documentation with reference to the correct application of procedures and calculation methods used for the indicators. Conclusion Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of the Group as of December 31, 2019 is not prepared, in all material aspects, in accordance with articles 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards.
