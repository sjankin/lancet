Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process. 5) Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements In an independent audit, our responsibilities as the auditors are: Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with InAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with InAS, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: -Identify and assess the risks of “material misstatement” of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. (The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.) 120 121 ÇİMSA 2019 Integrated Annual Report ÇİMSA 2019 Integrated Annual Report INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TABLE OF CONTENTS -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are Page appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Consolidated statement of financial position 124 Group’s internal control. -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and Consolidated statement of profit or loss 126 related disclosures made by management.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Consolidated statement of cash flows 130 financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause Notes to the consolidated financial statements 131 208 the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. -Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. -Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the Derecognition of tangible and intangible assets carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. Tangible and intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the Gains or losses arising from derecognition of tangible and intangible assets, measured as the differences between carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (cashthe net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is generating unit) in previous years. Impairment loss on goodwill cannot be reversed in the consolidated statement of derecognised.

The consideration business less accumulated impairment losses, if any. transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisitiondate fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups acquire and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquire. Acquisition-related costs of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. are generally recognized in loss as incurred. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair value when there is indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is at the acquisition date, except that: less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset -Deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized in the unit.

As a result of these over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. If, after impairment tests, as of 31 December 2019, the recoverable value of goodwill is determined under the registered reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed value and an impairment of TL 3,705,259 is found. exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and Impairment on non-financial assets the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognized immediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that book value of tangible and intangible assets, calculated by acquisition cost less accumulative amortization, is impaired. When an indication of Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share impairment exists, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of such assets. When individual recoverable value of of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the nonassets cannot be measured, recoverable value of cash generating unit of that asset is measured. controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
