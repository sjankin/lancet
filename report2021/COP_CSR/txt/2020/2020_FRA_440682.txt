Global Compact United Nations Communication on Progress Business Language Skills Period from May 2019 to June 2020 Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) BLS’s CEO makes a formal commitment to Global Compact principles every year in her note to shareholders. Dear Shareholders, In the decisions we make as a company, BLS’s key reference points remain more than ever the social and environmental concerns. This year I am pleased to confirm that we have continued in this vein and have strived to advance the principles of Global Compact both within the company and throughout our customer and supplier base and, at our modest level, work towards the Sustainable Development Goals as set out by the UN Global Compact . Since joining in 2004, we have continually upheld the ten principles of Global Compact with regards to human rights, labor standards, protection of environment and anti-corruption, promoted and supported those principles within our company and have striven to extend them to our sister companies, BLS formation and BLS Group. This commitment is included in our website on the home page. This year we applied for and were granted a Grace period to cover the later publishing of our Communication on Progress due to the outbreak and pandemic spread of the Coronoavirus Covid19 which has distrupted considerably our ability to function normally as an organisation. Our efforts are and were centred on helping our staff cope with the confinement situation in France with regard to their work for the company and more generally their well-being and support and, on liaising with our customers and finding solutions where possible to the organisational problems this virus is causing. As of June, France is progressively coming out of lockdown whilst taking precautionary measures to ensure that members of the public stay safe. We as a company are taking measures in line with government guidelines to enable our staff to carry out their activities as safely as possible in the new « post » pandemic but ongoing Covid-19 outbreak. In the body of the Communication on Progress, some of these measures that have been implemented are described as well as all other practical actions taken by BLS to support and practice the principles of Global Compact in our everyday working lives. As always practical actions taken by our group in the last year are summarized in our Communication on Progress and periodically in our internal newsletters to staff.

In the last few months, we have been communicating to our staff the risks linked to the Coronavirus and giving them clear instructions on how to best protect their health and well being and adapting their methods of work to the current situation.

This document explains BLS’s commitment to protecting the environment, preventing and managing environmental risks. BLS ensures sustainability in the management of all its activities and is committed to minimize its impact on the environment such as promoting car sharing and preference for public transport. Implementation Some concrete examples of the implementation of our ecological charter are : • investing and implementing a comprehensive management tool “Manageall” to reduce and in some cases to eliminate totally paper pedagogical files and to allow our trainers to access and update their planning remotely. • installing movement detectors in the common areas of the building to economize energy while still maintaining lighting in these areas. • further promotion of telephone or classes by Skype or Webcam to reduce the carbon footprint due to driving to and from our customers’ offices for classes where public transport is not available. This has taken off considerably in the light of the Covid-19 lockdown and has been extended to group on line classes. • the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies – promotion of e-learning tools and remote conferencing internally. A formal offer for viseoconfering now represents a key element in our training solutions offer. • the decision to work with suppliers that are committed to respecting the environment and with a sustainable development. • Renewal of the main photocopier / printer certified “imprimvert”, the French ecological label” ,with additional functions to reduce energy consumption , reduce noise, ink and costs. • raising awareness among suppliers by asking them for environmental data on their products. • to favour “soft copies” of training materials (podcasts, IT versions of training packs) over “hard copies” such as paper training manuals and burning CDs. This option is actively promoted in our response for calls for tender and several companies have seized this more cost effective and environmentally friendly option. • Reduction by 50% of use of personal cars for the top management of the company.
