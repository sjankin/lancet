We are aware that we have a responsibility to produce sustainably and to be at the forefront of addressing the urgent challenges of progress. For instance, climate change is becoming a determining factor in companies’ long-term prospects; many have stressed the significant and lasting impact it will have on economic growth and prosperity, and the resulting risks that today can no longer be ignored, even by the market. We are committed to the products and services we create; to the means and resources we use; through the Values we represent; with awareness of the impact of our actions on the world; to ensure: the use of technology as a means to improve life; the safeguarding and protection of the environment; respect for the law, for people and for human dignity; 1 Improving life through innovation Technological development is changing the world; it will revolutionise workplaces, places and lifestyles.

Our product is empowered because it is designed to guarantee maximum performance throughout its life cycle: from design, to construction, up to commissioning and operation, ensuring durability and low consumption. 10 1. IDENTITY OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 1.3 HISTORY O MAL was founded in Polaveno in Val Trompia in 1981 at the behest of Agostino Bonomi, son of a dynasty of entrepreneurs specialising in ball valves, who understood that the future of this sector should focus on automation and the customisation of products for industrial use. Thanks to the creation of a team of specialised technicians and engineers, in just a few years OMAL established itself on the domestic and foreign markets with an innovative product able to effectively meet the most complex technical needs, with high performance, suitable for various applications and customised for its customers’ specific needs. Design, research, innovation, automation and customisation are the keys to OMAL’s success. The stages of this success: Foundation 1981 Headquarters relocation 1987 With the increase in the number of employees and greater production, OMAL moved to the ISO 9001 Certification plant in Villa Carcina, in Val Trompia. Among the first Brescia companies in the sector, it certifies its Quality Management 1992 System. (certificate no.0041/7 dated 14/07/1992). New production plant in Rodengo Saiano A new and highly modern plant is opened, 2008 where all the operating units currently operate, with the exception of production and the technical office, which moved to the new API certification factory in Passirano in October 2016. In 2010 OMAL obtained license no. 6D_1007 APIQ1 from the American Petroleum Institute. for the 2010 manufacture of valves for the Oil & Gas sector. ISO 14001 Certification 2012 OMAL achieves certification of its Environmental Management System at the Rodengo Saiano site (certificate dated 23/01/2012).

All of OMAL’s production activity still takes place in Italy, over a total area of 38 thousand square meters of which 17 thousand are covered. We firmly believe that the added value of OMAL’s achievements is represented by the all-Italian ability to design and manufacture a mechanical product with special attention and dedication, with craftsmanship that takes great care of every detail in order to meet all of our customers’ needs. 11 1. IDENTITY 1.4 VISION, MISSION, VALUES W e believe in the strength of our reputation. We believe that a company’s true value is the reputation it has been able to build over the years thanks to its daily work, the relationships it has created and the ability to meet its stakeholders’ expectations.

IDENTITY OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 The values OMAL believes in make up the OMAL Code of Ethics, a crucial strategic document for the company’s positioning within the world of CSR and sustainable business. The Code of Ethics, divided into various sections according to the relevant stakeholder, contains a compendium of the corporate values that each actor interacting with the company is required to respect. The starting point for any CSR rationale is the Code of Ethics, which OMAL distributes to all new employees as a starting point for every fruitful working and human relationship. 1.5 TRANSPARENCY AND LEGALITY RATING O MAL has voluntarily committed itself to a certification process promoted by AGCM the competition and market authority to ensure maximum transparency on its commercial operations to all stakeholders. The Legality Rating is an ethical evaluation issued by AGCM in agreement with the Ministries of Justice and the Interior, to Italian companies that have achieved a minimum turnover of two million euros and that demonstrate that they: respect the contents of the Legality Protocol signed by the Ministry of the Interior and Confindustria (Italian industrial federation), the guidelines that constitute its implementation, the Protocol signed by the Ministry of the Interior and the League of Cooperatives, and at a local level by the Prefectures and trade associations; use payment traceability systems even for amounts lower than those established by law; adopt an organisational structure that carries out checks on the compliance of company activities with regulatory provisions applicable to the company or an organisational model pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 231/2001; adopt processes to guarantee forms of Corporate Social Responsibility; are included in one of the lists of suppliers, service providers and contractors not subject to mafia infiltration attempts; have adhered to self-regulatory codes of ethics adopted by trade associations; have adopted organisational models to prevent and combat corruption. In the rating update, which took place in June 2019, OMAL improved its reliability by obtaining a + on top of the two stars previously obtained. https://www.agcm.it/competenze/rating-di-legalita/rating-elenco-imprese 13 1. IDENTITY 1.6 GOVERNANCE, BUSINESS MODEL AND STRATEGY O MAL’s administration and control system is of the “traditional” type with a Board of Directors appointed by the Shareholders’ Meeting and a Board of Statutory Auditors. The BoD is the body vested with powers for the management and definition of organisational structures, as well as for the evaluation of the general performance. It is made up of two directors (Head of the Board of Directors and Director). The Board of Statutory Auditors is made up of five members and monitors compliance with the law and compliance with the principles of correctness. An audit firm guarantees the correctness and truthfulness of financial and asset information and ensures regulatory compliance. The CEO has delegated powers of ordinary and extraordinary administration with regard to safety and hygiene at work, as well as the protection of the environment inside and outside the company (with the exclusion of those reserved by law or by the Articles of Association to the BoD or the Shareholders’ Meeting). 14 1. IDENTITY OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 There are four governance drivers that characterise OMAL’s corporate strategy, making it unique and diversified compared to the competition: Turnkey The experience and know-how accumulated in 40 years of package design and production: product: valve and actuator allows OMAL to develop and manage product covalve and engineering collaborations in the pneumatics sector, the industrial world actuator and the process industry. OMAL was founded with a strong manufacturing vocation rooted in the Brescia area, particularly specialised in mechanical and industrial processing. OMAL’s expertise in mechanical processing and in aluminum In House die casting is of the highest level. process & OMAL has also specialised in the plastic moulding of some strategic components thanks to the installation of some production lines with Made In robotic presses. The testing phase is also 100% in house with a test room and test benches dedicated entirely to internal production. OMAL initially started the digitisation process of the company on the production and assembly lines with intelligent robotisation to guarantee quality and process precision, then in the operational and administrative Smart offices with the use of business intelligence and project management Factory software. OMAL is a smart factory: this is demonstrated by its multi-channel system, the product configurator, an e-commerce site, and the APP available on Android and IOS. The company has a code of ethics that guides it, OMAL presents itself to the market “doing what it says it does”. When OMAL makes statements, WalkTheTalk makes a commitment or simply expresses itself, what it says is a promise that must be fulfilled and must stand for an absolute truth. A truth that does not yield in the face of any flattery from the market. 15 1. IDENTITY 1.7 BEING B CORP B Corp is a company that incorporates positive social and environmental impact objectives into its business strategy, in tune with its economic-financial objectives.

The B Corp® certification applies to the entire company, and includes all product or service lines and all business areas. A third-party audit certifies the achievement of the required social and environmental sustainability performance. OMAL obtained the prestigious B Corp® certification in September 2017, far exceeding the required 80 points and demonstrating its high performance with a final evaluation of 106.7 points.

CORPORATE SOCIAL F RESPONSIBILITY or OMAL Corporate Social Responsibility is the voluntary choice of wanting to integrate social and environmental aspects in our daily production of valves and actuators. We believe that the overall performance of a company and the effectiveness of its actions are closely related to the wellbeing of the social context in which it operates and the impact generated on the environment. For these reasons, at OMAL, Corporate Social Responsibility is fully integrated into business and Governance, aimed at defining the strategy to best meet the challenges of the market and achieve our growth objectives, as well as to create shared value in the long term. Sustainability has always accompanied our corporate history, guiding our way of doing business and creating value for stakeholders. Our aspiration is to progressively integrate sustainability into the day-to-day operations of all company units, in order to achieve consistent operations, in line with the most virtuous and advanced companies in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility. OMAL is now in its fourth year of reporting on its social and environmental sustainability, based on a practice that is now in-house and communicated to the outside world in a timely and participatory manner. Our awareness stems from a careful approach to corporate values, constantly updated and shared internally, in order to align the Sustainability Report, Code of Ethics, Supplier Code of Conduct and Internal Policies. 21 2. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 2.2 METHODOLOGICAL NOTE T he purpose of this Report is to communicate OMAL’s response to the social and environmental challenges we are facing to stakeholders and to present our approach to creating shared value. This Report has been prepared according to the most widespread international guidelines, issued by the Global Reporting Initiative, the GRI Sustainable Reporting Standards, “core” option. A summary table of correlation between the information reported in this Report and the GRI standard indicators is provided in the final annexes. The reporting period runs from January 2019 to December 2019 and covers all of OMAL’s activities and impacts in its production plants in Rodengo Saiano and Passirano. The data collection process has been coordinated internally at OMAL by the Head of Quality and has indirectly involved all the production units. Reporting is divided into six sections that define all dimensions of OMAL’s activities, starting from its corporate identity (IDENTITY) through its values, business model and sustainability governance, as well as the reporting methodology implemented ( CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY). Here are the three areas in which OMAL’s sustainability is expressed: PEOPLE, QUALITY and ENVIRONMENT. The last chapter of the reporting (ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION) is dedicated to economic results, investments made and commercial development, as well as OMAL’s intangible assets, communication and reputation. This document will be disseminated both by means of distribution within the company and with the main customers and suppliers, as well as through the usual publication on our website www.omal.com Each section will open with a summary page that summarises the approach to the subject, the material topics for OMAL in that area, the numbers that depict the size of the company and the reference to the goals of Agenda 2030. Finally, the final annexes contain tables of correspondence with the indicators provided for by the GRI and the SDGs. 22 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 2.3 2016-2020 STRATEGIC PLAN T 2.

This analysis activity, started in 2016 and updated annually, has allowed us to define a materiality matrix, i.e. the tool that indicates the relevance given by the company and its stakeholders to specific issues, in order to identify those on which to focus our action, focusing our expectations and timing. The analysis of the relevant issues was also influenced by the opinion of the media, the approach of Italian and foreign competitor companies, the OMAL code of ethics and the presence of global megatrends reported in international documents and policies. The image below represents the OMAL materiality matrix, updated during 2019 in terms of the company’s priorities The relevance given by the company to the issues emerging from stakeholder engagement is shown horizontally, while the relevance given by the stakeholders involved is shown vertically. 26 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 2.

CORPORATE SOCIAL S RESPONSIBILITY takeholders are people, groups or entities that interact at various levels with OMAL. A dense network of commercial, economic and institutional relations that make up our world and form the basis of continuous exchanges and benefits. Their mapping was conducted on the basis of the principles of: Dependency Referred to the extent to which stakeholders are more or less close to the company’s economic activities. Responsibility Referred to legal, social, commercial or environmental responsibility ties that bind the stakeholder to the company. Necessity Referred to the need to consider a given stakeholder because they are important. Once the stakeholders were identified, the main channels of exchange and information with the company were then analysed. 29 2.

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES PER YEAR 2019 2018 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Below are the employee data divided by type of contract and gender: No. % of the total Type of contract % men % women workers workforce Temporary workers 7 6,8% 71,4% 28,6% Permanent workers 96 93,2% 84,4% 15,6% Total 103 100,0% 83,5% 16,5% When it appears that OMAL is a male-dominated company, in 93.2% of cases a permanent contract is applied, 71.4% of temporary contracts are male, but the incidence is higher among women. OMAL Women: 16,5% employees by Men: 83,5% gender 38 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 As we can see, this is a young company, almost half of the employees are under 35 years of age and over 90% are under 50, with length of service mainly under 10 years. OMAL employees OMAL employees by by age length of service 3. PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY 35 and under: 45,6% 10 and under: 62,1% 36 to 50 years: 44,7% 11 to 20 years: 21,4% Over 50 years: 9,7% 21 to 30 years: 14,6% Over 30 years: 1,9% As OMAL is constantly expanding, the length of service is low, but about 38% of the staff have been working with us for over 10 years. It can therefore be concluded that the turnover rate is low. OMAL’s distinctive feature of always counting on a team of specialised technicians and engineers is shown by the graph below, demonstrating that design, research and innovation are at the heart of our activities, guaranteed by a high level of specialisation of our staff.

OMAL staff are required to: not encourage or take part in bullying, mobbing, stalking or humiliating acts, both verbally and physically. To not create conditions that can detract from colleagues’ self-esteem or professional reputation. To intervene and contact their manager or management in the event that discriminatory acts against OMAL staff are observed. Likewise, OMAL respects its employees’ freedom to express their ideas and positions, since only by sharing different opinions can we truly work in an enriching environment, where professionals can 3. PEOPLE AND improve their skills. Act fairly and honestly with all counterparties; Stimulate innovative thinking and participatory methods for exchanging views and resolving issues, COMMUNITY such as new strategies to shape concepts and relationships that can help address problems and setbacks more efficiently and quickly. OMAL respects cultural differences and treats every employee with respect and dignity. Race, gender, religious orientation, cultural beliefs, nationality, political opinions, physical conditions or socio-economic origins are seen as enriching variables and should not be used to discriminate against anyone. 3.3 ENGAGEMENT C orporate engagement is one of the objectives of the 2016-2020 strategic plan to increase involvement and a sense of belonging. The actions implemented in this regard were: “Tutti Convocati” scheme: these are periodic meetings between Management and Top Management to share strategies, objectives and results. In 2019 there were three in-depth study and discussion events on the following issues: May 9: MID TERM MEETING PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES PROGRESS STATUS August 29: JPA PROJECTS / JPA WORKFLOW PRESENTATION November 7: PRESENTATION OF THE SALES BUDGET FOR 2020 Corporate events: as usual, two events are organised each year during which OMAL meets with employees, discusses specific projects and shares recreational time in a cool location. The first event extended to all workers and their families was held in July 2019, with a play by Compagni Rossolevante entitled “the virus that saves your life” to raise staff awareness of health and safety at work, an essential aspect for the growth of the organisation. The second is the traditional Christmas dinner, which includes a moment of sharing and reflection on the progress of the working year concluded with all employees. The event is also extended to retired staff. As per tradition, during the dinner there was a raffle for which the prizes were the gifts received by the company during the year, so they can be shared by everyone. 41 3. PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY 3.4 TRAINING T o support the 2020 strategic plan the following training needs have been defined, described in the company training course called “In FormAzione”, which develops both technical and managerial skills for managers: Technical skills Management skills English language development Work organisation Business intelligence Leadership skills Management system Delegating skills The “In FormAzione” pathway also involves the provision of internal training (company self-training) for the transfer of company skills and/or to support changes in personnel in key roles. Alongside this four-year project, implemented at a single operation level, there is a higher strategic level that focuses on the efficiency of inter-operation and intra-operation processes, with the aim of moving in a coordinated and efficient way within increasingly complex projects. In this regard, all unit managers must be able to: organise; manage; measure; As can be seen from the figure below, in 2019 there was a significant increase in investment in training both in terms of the number of courses carried out, as well as in terms of staff involvement and total hours. 1000 945 Employee Training 800 713 Trends 600 Year 2018 400 Year 2019 284 200 97 33 58 0 No. No. Total hours training participants provided courses 42 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 The average hours of training per employee rose from 7.8 hours in 2018 to 9.2 in 2019.

PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY 3.5 HEALTH AND SAFETY F or OMAL, protecting the health and safety of workers is a priority that has led us to define organisational and operational procedures aimed at reducing exposure to the risks inherent in our business as much as possible. The aim is to reduce work-related accidents and illnesses, aware that health is important to work well and for a long time. Average Accident Frequency Index Severity Index Period Duration Index IF = d/L x 106 IG = Kt/L x 103 DM= d/Kt Year 2019 13,0 16,6 0,2 Year 2018 17,0 17,2 0,3 AVERAGE previous 15,4 19,3 0,3 three years The efforts made have yielded very positive results in 2019 with a significant reduction in both the duration, frequency and severity of injuries compared to 2018 and the average over the last three years. In particular, the accident severity index decreased by more than 50% compared to the previous three years and by more than 30% compared to 2019 alone. All the indices considered are lower than the average for the three-year period, including the use of sick days per employee: therefore the global index (I-SSL) that indicates the trend in health and safety conditions in the work environment is equal to 100. Occupational health and safety was the central theme of our activities during 2019, specific investments were made to prepare emergency measures and widespread staff training and awareness raising activities were carried out. In particular: We purchased and installed defibrillators at the Passirano and Rodengo Saiano production sites, aware that prompt and effective first aid can be the difference between life and death, between prompt or prolonged recovery, between temporary or permanent disability; An emergency team has been trained in the use of AEDs because early intervention within 5 minutes can reduce cardiac damage and save a life; Our canteen encourages a balanced and healthy diet with top quality ingredients. Vegetarian dishes are always offered on the daily menu. Meals are booked via the App where you can view the nutritional information and the energy value of the dishes chosen; A “Guide to healthy eating” was provided with the 10 rules for healthy eating and a healthy lifestyle taken from the Ministry’s “Guidelines for healthy Italian nutrition”; 44 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 In order to raise awareness and engage not only our staff but also their families on health and safety issues, an ad hoc show entitled “the virus that saves your life” was organised. 3. PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY 3.6 WELFARE W e have promoted corporate welfare by encouraging the activation of services reserved for companies that apply the CCNL (National Labour Collective Agreement). There were 27 requests for contributions submitted by OMAL employees mainly for the enrolment of children in various school, book and baby birth orders, for a total amount of 5,250 euros. 45 3. PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY 3.7 COMMUNITY W e want to live in a society capable of sharing knowledge and good practices among all the different actors who carry out their work with a particular attention to ethical values. This is why we are more than happy to communicate our behaviour transparently, in the hope that it will prove that combining fairness and business is not a slogan. We believe that sharing the values and the path undertaken by OMAL is strategic in order to multiply the positive impact of our actions, sharing them with other actors who could in turn replicate them. This is reflected in OMAL’s participation in conferences, thematic meetings and participation in training projects to bring the world of school closer to production companies. In June 2019 OMAL presented its case history at the conference “Sustainability: a strategic choice for companies” organised by 2A GROUP to raise awareness of sustainable development and the growth opportunities provided by an increasingly green-oriented market. Our Quality & Environmental Manager illustrated the virtuous path undertaken by OMAL over the years and the returns in terms of efficiency, image and economy. In addition, sharing the way we act with others allows us to innovate our approaches, connecting with new people, smart networks and understanding the needs of our community more deeply. Moreover, for some years now, it has been participating in schoolwork alternation projects with some high schools in the area, giving children the opportunity to consolidate the knowledge acquired at school, test their aptitude and learn about our working approach. With the same principle, an internship was launched with a third year student from Bocconi University. Nowadays it is increasingly important to recognise ethical values as promoters of “shared virtuous practices”, i.e. virtuous attitudes commonly put into practice by a system of different actors but all belonging to the same community. Extract from the OMAL Code of Ethics. 46 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 3.8 PHILANTHROPY O MAL is aware of its economic and social role in the areas of Franciacorta and Val Trompia, where its facilities are based. The company therefore listens to the area and, where possible, responds to the needs of local associations and institutions in order to contribute to the public good and the protection of disadvantaged people. Philanthropy has been, and continues to be, one of the channels of intervention to cope with extraordinary emergencies in one’s own territory or country, or to support issues particularly close to one’s heart, such as youth sport and disability. Philanthropy at OMAL is not for marketing purposes, but represents a commitment motivated by 3. PEOPLE AND emergency or particularly worthy needs. During 2019, OMAL’s philanthropic projects were: COMMUNITY I CENTURIONI RUGBY The donation has contributed to the organisational and sporting management of all men’s rugby categories from Under 6s to Under 18s. It made it possible to carry out the “Schools Project” to raise awareness and promote this sport among young people and to convey educational concepts based on inclusion, respect and equality. It has given support to families by upgrading the transport service on training days. FLAG FOOTBALL The company has renewed its commitment to support the sports and educational project of Flag Football junior, aimed at boys and girls from 6 to 17 years of age with the aim of encouraging younger people to take part in sport, especially young people from disadvantaged families who have thus been able to show their talent. 47 3. PEOPLE AND COMMUNITY I BAMBINI DELLE FATE Since 2011 OMAL has supported the I Bambini delle Fate per Inclusione Sociale (Fairy Children for Social Inclusion) association which deals with social communication and fundraising for inclusion and autonomy projects aimed at improving the life of families experiencing the challenge of autism and disability.

For OMAL, quality also means using the best raw materials and selecting its suppliers according to increasingly demanding criteria. Furthermore, constantly training and updating its staff to encourage professional growth. The quality of the production process has been guaranteed since 1992 with the certification of our Quality Management System according to the UNI EN ISO 9001:2015 standard. ISO 9001 Certification 4. QUALITY A strategic choice that helps the organisation to improve its performance, to make its production processes more efficient, to correctly manage risks and development opportunities according to the corporate pay off “Empowered performance”. “Responsible Quality” is the added value of our product. We believe that our customer’s satisfaction can be increased by the attention we pay to the context and the environment in which we operate, respecting the expectations of all those involved, both internal and external. In 2012 OMAL also certified its Environmental Management System according to the UNI EN ISO 14001 standard. ISO 14001 Certification 53 4. QUALITY The implementation and daily application of the Management Systems guarantee high performance of all the activities that affect the quality of the product and the service provided, in particular: 1 Effectiveness and efficiency of internal processes; 2 Continuous improvement of business performance; 3 Regulatory compliance; 4 Control over environmental impacts and respect for the environment; 5 Identification of areas of risk and opportunity for the organisation; 6 Prevention or reduction of unwanted or unexpected effects; 7 Dynamic, innovative management model oriented towards customer loyalty; This integrated and systemic approach is in line with OMAL’s way of operating, which has always asked management and organisational questions in order to offer customers a product or service that conforms to the best international standards. Our quality policy was updated during 2019. 54 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 4. QUALITY 55 4. QUALITY 56 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 FOCUS: API Q1 CERTIFICATION Another important certification achieved by OMAL is the API Q1 specification. This is a company-wide certification based on the standard developed and published by the American Petroleum Institute (API) entitled “Specification for quality management system requirements for manufacturing organizations for the petroleum and natural gas industry”. This certification is intended for companies that manufacture equipment or components of equipment used in the production of petroleum and natural gas. The certificates are issued exclusively by API after the positive outcome of an on-site audit to verify the correct implementation of the quality system and all the risk mitigation procedures indicated in the standard, as well as constant compliance with the requirements. To maintain the certification it is necessary to repeat the audit annually, the next one is scheduled for mid-2020. 4. QUALITY The advantages of the API Q1 specification are many: minimisation of the risk of supplying non-compliant products and guarantee to the customer of constant product quality; maximisation of management by improving productivity, reducing waste and guaranteeing ontime deliveries; ensuring that customer requirements are clearly defined, communicated and understood prior to their management; optimisation of corporate processes and standards and consequently of corporate competitiveness. In addition, OMAL’s overall approach to continuous improvement and its focus on defect prevention has enabled it to successfully pursue its mission of providing empowered products. 57 4. QUALITY 4.2 THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGN S ince its inception, for OMAL design has represented the added value of its valves, focused on the pursuit of increasingly advanced performance. We are a solution provider. Our team of experts in the field of co-engineering is able to design the best combination of valves and actuators and all the other accessory elements needed to best control the intercepted fluid. Our main objective is to create a high-performance, efficient and reliable valve that meets sustainability criteria at the same time: maximum service life, maintainability, low energy consumption during use, easy disassembly at the end of its life for proper disposal are the factors we strive for to reduce the environmental impact of our product. To pursue these objectives, we constantly invest in: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OMAL has always focused on the innovation of its product thanks to the collaboration of a team of highly specialised engineers and technicians. Our test room allows us to test and stress prototypes, components or finished products for continuous verification of our product’s performance. In addition, thanks to collaborations with university institutions such as the University of Brescia, the company is also involved in technical projects and welcomes students into the company. SPECIFIC SIMULATION SOFTWARE Solidworks Flow Simulation software allows you to simulate the flow of liquids and gases under reallife conditions, run hypothetical scenarios and efficiently analyse the effects of fluid flow, heat transfer and related forces on submerged or surrounding components, which are key elements in the creation of innovative, high-performance products. AESTHETICS OMAL’s commitment to offer its customers an innovative product with high technical performance is also reflected in its attention to detail and the quality of the shapes. Thanks to the collaboration established a few years ago with the ITALDESIGN GIUGIARO S.p.A design studio, the added value of the design of our product starts from the style, going on to enrich the development of its functions, imagining its final application within broader boundaries. 58 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 RACKON Rack and pinion pneumatic actuator 4. QUALITY VIP EVO pneumatic valve It is within this philosophy that OMAL embodies its commitment to its customers so that the design effort generates reliable and beautiful solutions, therefore different and distinguishable, in one word: empowered. 59 4. QUALITY 4.3 OUR PRODUCT T he valve is a mechanical component that intercepts or regulates the flow of a material able to flow through a pipe in order to guarantee specific pressure or flow values. The intercepted material can be solid (powders, flours) or, as in the vast majority of cases, a fluid (a liquid or a gas). The materials intercepted can therefore be distinguished between hazardous or non-hazardous. OMAL designs and manufactures industrial valves suitable to be used in many applications and sectors and able to meet the functional safety standards foreseen for the process industry and to ensure the safety requirements of the plants they are part of. 60 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 OMAL products’ main applications for use are: CEMENT PACKAGING CERAMIC WATER & WASTEWATER CHEMESTRY MARINE INDUSTRY PHARMA & CHEMICAL & FIRE POWER & 4.

DAN This system allows a long actuator life and the best performance with and SRN minimum energy consumption. They actuators are available both in the double acting “DAN” version and in the single acting “SRN” version with spring return. It uses Rack & Pinion kinematics to convert the linear motion of the pistons into rotary shaft motion, with a rotation RACKON angle from 0° (valve closed) to 90° actuators (valve open) and vice versa. Versions with clockwise and counterclockwise closing are available. It is an automatic fluid interception (on/off) device which includes both the control device (pneumatically operated) and the fluid interception device. Careful design has made it possible to reduce its weight and VIP EVO overall dimensions and to guarantee a valve high number of opening and closing manoeuvres. Furthermore, the study of internal fluid dynamics has made it possible to minimise turbulence and pressure drops. It is a high pressure ball valve designed to intercept a wide range of fluids (both self-lubricating and non-selflubricating). It is designed to withstand KRATOS a high number of drive cycles (HIGH valve CYCLICITY) and therefore to be automated. The version made with corrosion-resistant materials allows heavy use and in the presence of aggressive fluids. 62 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 4.4 CERTIFICATIONS I n line with the company Mission “We guarantee a better world for our children.

IGR Qualification 65 4. QUALITY 4.5 PRODUCTION PROCESS A t OMAL the production unit is located at the Passirano facility, built according to the best environmental and architectural standards. Since 2016 it has been the hub where OMAL valves and actuators are born, from the technical drawing to the finished product ready for use. To pursue the objectives of our strategic plan, we have directed our investments towards: Automation 2,24 investments for new Internet of Things Business intelligence In House process & made in machinery and work ML € stations PROCESS AUTOMATION Considerable investments have been made in recent years to achieve an important level of automation at the Passirano and Rodengo Saiano sites with the construction of automated work stations, many of which are robotic. This has had many positive repercussions on management thanks to greater control and efficiency in production processes, optimisation of consumption and energy savings, as well as on the quality of the final product. 80 Provision of 70 67 machinery and 60 57 work stations 50 Year 2018 40 Year 2019 30 25 26 20 16 16 10 0 Machinery Work stations Robotic work stations 66 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 The main investments in 2019 concerned the construction of: an automatic warehouse for the storage of brass and steel bars that guarantees traceability and the best conditions for the product, as well as operator safety; an automatic material handling warehouse, conceived according to IoT principles, with vehicles equipped with a mixed “track” and “free” driving system which, thanks to the use of inductive and laser navigation technologies, allows them to move easily within corridors, between racks and to circulate in the warehouse without the guidance or intervention of an operator; INTERNET OF THINGS IoT is a technology that makes it possible to maximise the capacity for collecting and communicating data from a multitude of sources (intelligent objects, machines, robotic work stations...) by networking them, including remotely, for the benefit of greater digitisation and process automation. Collecting 4. QUALITY and processing this data helps us to monitor performance, supervise processes and extract useful information for decision-making. MOVICON 11 (monitoring vision and control) has been adopted at the Passirano and Rodengo Saiano facilities, an application capable of statistically analysing the downtime on the plants, classifying them by production period. Data analysis allows us to quickly identify critical points in the production process and improve them in order to achieve maximum system efficiency and productivity. In addition, the Movicon Pro-Energy module, activated in 2019, allows the detection and management of the energy consumption of each production plant. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE Continuous improvement is based on the principle that “You can only improve what can be measured”. User friendly analysis tools, such as the JPA, Qlik view and Qlik sense applications adopted allow us to make decisions in real time, guaranteeing an immediate response. In particular, the JPA software is a Project Management system that allows coordinated management of activities, from the planning and progress phase to their closure. JPA also manages some critical or strategic “internal processes” by distributing responsibilities and activities through a specific work-flow in order to speed up the relationships between internal processes and manage them in a more controlled manner. This is very useful for those processes that have ad-hoc regulations or certifications such as the management of orders for countries subject to trade restrictions, or towards which specific regulations on the circulation of goods operate (e.g. DUAL USE Reg). 67 4. QUALITY IN HOUSE PROCESS & MADE IN In order to increase control over the entire process, a new work station was created for cutting and sandblasting aluminium components, bringing processing in house, with significant management advantages. The strategic processes that characterise the value of our product and that OMAL has always kept self made in are: Die casting in the actuator the cast components are the heart of the product, for this reason OMAL has specialised in aluminium die casting. The sheer size of our automated press fleet allows us to print hundreds of thousands of aluminium components for our actuators and valves. Plastic material moulding a plant for the injection moulding of plastic materials guarantees a high level of quality in the production of certain parts of OMAL products. Mechanical Machining thanks to a fleet of cutting-edge machines and automated processes, OMAL is able to supply products with excellent performance. We are therefore able to perform mechanical machining with precision and a very large variety of materials for which specific expertise is required: steel, aluminium, brass and bronze. Assembly and testing each OMAL product undergoes rigorous checks before being marketed and distributed. Automated test benches are installed in the assembly department to allow for strict product control and testing. We also guarantee the best valve-actuator combinations. 68 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 FOCUS: PRO056 ROBOTIC STATION FOR CUTTING ALUMINUM PROFILES AND SANDBLASTING The installation of the PRO 056 robotic line was completed at the end of 2019. The new line consists of an automatic cutting system for aluminium profiles (TR) and subsequent automatic sandblasting and palletising of the bodies of the OMAL pneumatic actuators. The line is completely automated through the use of two anthropomorphic robots which respectively (UD) load the pieces, which come from the cutting system via a conveyor belt, into the sandblaster (TV) and unloading (UE) after sandblasting and storage on pallets for subsequent automatic packaging (UC). The material is stored or sent to the mechanical processing departments. The automatic system guarantees operator safety, the control and maximum efficiency of the process and the quality of the product, as well as its protection during the subsequent handling phases. 4. QUALITY 69 4. QUALITY FOCUS: SMART FACTORY The SMART FACTORY project was born with the aim of fully digitising the company to innovate it with a view to Industry 4.0. This goes beyond more traditional automation, involving a completely connected, flexible and intelligent system capable of also generating new business models supported by enabling technologies such as IoT and digital intelligence, which focus on the following aspects: INTELLIGENT ROBOTISATION This involved the bar warehouse, production, assembly and logistics with two new ADVs. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE Thanks to project and process management applications (such as JPA, Qlik view, Qlik sense, Measurlink and EPDM…) information is collected and shared in real time to support decision-making and to intervene promptly. DEVELOPMENT OF OMNI-CHANNEL SYSTEMS To use multiple integrated channels to communicate, promote and sell our products thanks to the new product configurator contained in our website and the OMAL CATALOGUE app developed to allow easy access to information on OMAL products with any device connected to the network. 70 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 ZERO PAPER PROJECT This approach, which has now become established practice in the company, has led to a system of widespread digitisation of documentation and its archiving. In addition, the development of apps such as Info Day Pocket allows the complete IT management of personnel. 4. QUALITY 71 4. QUALITY 4.6 QUALITY SUPPLIERS AND RAW MATERIALS T he quality of a company can be measured by the care with which raw materials are chosen. The selection of materials with which to make valves and actuators assumes the utmost importance when it comes to offering a product characterised by high performance and reliability. The definition of strict procedures for the selection of qualified suppliers and top quality incoming materials, allow us to trace all the production steps and to process highly controlled and high performance metals and plastics. To select and qualify suppliers, the Purchasing Department uses a special evaluation form to assess quality, production control and environmental requirements. Depending on the nature and level of criticality of the product/service supplied, an assessment is then made of the supplier’s reliability. In 2019, there was a decrease in the number of non-conformities found compared to the previous year, thanks to the strict supplier selection policy implemented. OMAL has also established an annual supplier audit plan. The quality level of the supplies purchased is periodically assessed through two performance indices: number of LQF compliant pieces / pieces purchased number of deliveries without defects / total IEN deliveries 72 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 102,0% 99,7% 99,8% 100,0% 98,6% 98,0% 98,0% 96,0% 94,0% Supply quality indices 92,0% 90,0% 88,0% 86,0% 84,0% IEN 2018 IEN 2019 LQF 2018 LQF 2019 4.

QUALITY 4.8 CUSTOMER SATISFACTION C ustomer satisfaction is our most important objective and a useful indicator for monitoring the effectiveness of the actions taken and the policies implemented. The sales office is in constant contact with customers and collects ideas and observations, but in order to assess the quality perceived by the customer in more detail, some specific indicators have been created: Lead time: delivery times expressed in days; On-time deliveries: percentage of deliveries on time; Delay days: average number of days of delay; Analysing the performance of the three indicators used in the table below, it can be concluded that the average delivery time was reduced by 21.1% and only in 11.2% of cases was there a delay in the expected time, which on average was 3.4 days. Indicator 2018 2019 Change Lead time 19 15 -21,1% Percentage of deliveries on time 70% 88,8% 26,9% Average days of delay 4,17 3,4 -18,5% Where only 2.5% of deliveries had a delay of more than 5 days. Performance of deliveries Percentage On time 88,8% Delay 1 3 days 7% Delay 3 5 days 1,7% Delay > 5 days 2,5% Total 100% 80 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 Another important indicator is the ISC customer satisfaction index which is calculated on the entire portfolio of active customers and on the basis of the following criteria: A. If at least 90% of customers with orders worth more than €10,000 a year have ordered for at least 2 consecutive years, the score assigned is equal to 100 otherwise it is equal to the ratio between the two years; B. If the turnover is higher than that of the previous year, the score assigned is equal to 100, otherwise the ratio between the current year’s turnover and the previous year’s turnover; C. If the Customer Return Value does not exceed 1% of the turnover, the score assigned is equal to 100 otherwise it is equal to (100 ratio between the two); D. The value of the on-time delivery index is given by the ratio between the number of deliveries made with no more than 3 days of delay and the number of total deliveries. Furthermore, a distribution coefficient is assigned to each criterion according to the importance and sensitivity of the criterion and the data collected by the management system. The resulting algorithm is ISC = (A * 0.3) + (B * 0.3) + (C * 0.2) + (D * 0.2) 4. QUALITY ISC performance 93,4 index year 2019 As can be seen from the graph, for 2019 the ISC was not only higher than the minimum value set by OMAL as a target of 90, but also better than last year. 94 93,4 ISC trend customer 93 92 satisfaction index 92 91 90 89 ISC Minimum target 88 2018 2019 81 4.

The commitment to protecting the environment is promoted and encouraged by the Management and extended to the entire organisational context, shifting daily actions towards: sustainable use of resources; the optimisation of procurement processes; the reduction of waste production; the recovery and/or recycling of materials with a view to circular economy; sharing our Policies with the supply chain; In addition, we seek to improve internal and external communication to promote a culture of work oriented towards sustainability through annual reporting and ad hoc social media campaigns. 5. ENVIRONMENT 87 5. ENVIRONMENT The relationship with the environment therefore shifts from corporate boundaries to relationships with customers and suppliers, considering “extended management models” capable of reducing overall impacts through the involvement of all actors in the chain, creating sustainable value for stakeholders and minimising inefficiencies and risks. 5.2 AWARDS FOR OUR COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT CSR RATING ECOVADIS OMAL’s commitment to the environment has been recognised by ECOVADIS, one of the leading international sustainability rating platforms, with a Gold sustainability performance level. OMAL SPA has been awarded a Gold medal as a recognition of their EcoVadis CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Rating JANUARY 20192019 Valid until: January 2020 EcoVadis® is a registered trademark. © Copyright EcoVadis 2018 All rights reserved The score achieved in the “production of machines for general use” category places OMAL’s environmental performance in the ranking of companies evaluated according to the Policies adopted, the actions implemented and the results achieved. At the beginning of this year OMAL updated its rating and is waiting for the new 2020 certificate. 88 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 B CORP AWARD: “BEST FOR THE WORLD 2019” In 2019 OMAL was also awarded for its commitment to the environment. In the Benefit Impact Assessment OMAL scored, in the ENVIRONMENT section, over 10 percentage points above the world average for B Corps. This important recognition for commitment to the environment was given to only 11 Italian companies belonging to various sectors. If, on the other hand, we look at its specific product category (Industry section), OMAL is the only one to qualify worldwide. 5.3 THE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY 5. ENVIRONMENT O MAL has voluntarily adopted an Environmental Management System compliant with the ISO 14001:2015 standard which allows it to monitor and control environmental impacts, correctly assess risks and guarantee its legislative compliance. In everyday life, this is reflected in lines of action, policies and operating procedures that allow for the coordinated and systematic management of all activities and processes that may have repercussions on the environment. Our Environmental Policy guides our actions and sets improvement targets regarding: reduction of resource consumption through technological innovation and the adoption of higher performing technical and organisational solutions; pollution risk prevention through constant monitoring of the environmental impacts of our production sites and along the supply chain; minimisation of waste production by favouring recovery-recycling and reuse according to the principles of circular economy; definition of the characteristics and performance of products that ensure control of the impact on the environment during operation and when the end of life is reached; improvement of communication inside and outside the organisation to promote a work culture oriented towards sustainability. 89 5. ENVIRONMENT The system concerns all activities carried out at the Rodengo Saiano and Passirano plants. Specifically, the design and production of pneumatic and electric actuators, coaxial and flow-started pneumatic valves, manual and automated ball and butterfly valves through mechanical processing, plastic moulding, assembly, testing, packaging and shipping processes. With a view to continuous improvement, each year specific environmental targets and sustainability objectives are defined which are then implemented in all business units. The Quality Manager supervises the correct application of the system, collects the information needed to update the defined performance indicators, verifies regulatory compliance, coordinates audit activities and manages relations with the Certification Body. During the DNV surveillance audit, one observation and two opportunities for improvement emerged which the Quality Manager took on board and resolved. 90 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 5.4 GREEN IN C are for the environment has led OMAL to analyse the entire value chain and assess specific optimisation actions of the various processes. The GREEN IN project was born with the aim of improving the impacts related to the supply chain and procurement. The focus therefore shifts from OMAL as a company to the system of relationships and actors upstream of our production process. SUSTAINABLE SUPPLY CHAIN By sustainable procurement we mean: strict selection of suppliers on the basis of environmental and social criteria and sharing our values (Code of Ethics) and policies (Supplier Code of Conduct) with them; involvement of the main suppliers in projects to optimise the resources used and the circular economy; reduction of the impacts related to procurement logistics; As regards the first point, we refer to the previous chapter where we analysed our sustainable supply chain in detail (paragraph 4.7). The main actions implemented to engage suppliers in circular economy projects concerned the aluminium and brass supply chain in particular, through: modification of the length of the purchased aluminium profiles to optimise cutting phases and reduce processing waste; transfer of metal waste from OMAL’s processes to suppliers of raw materials to create a virtuous 5. ENVIRONMENT circuit with a view to circular economy; redefinition of the aluminium supply chain relations thanks to the subsidiary Actuatech to which the aluminium waste is delivered, transformed into alloy ingots that it reuses in the die-casting process necessary for the production of semi-finished products purchased by OMAL. OMAL has started a process to extend this mechanism to all its subcontractors, implementing a framework agreement with them, in which they are asked to return the mechanical processing waste to the same suppliers from which they purchase the raw material. 91 5. ENVIRONMENT SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT As seen in the previous chapter, 88% of the value of purchases comes from Italy. The choice to give preference to national suppliers is motivated not only by the quality of the materials, but also by the proximity and speed of supplies. Analysing the average distance of the 165 qualified suppliers, 88% are less than 200 km away from OMAL. Average distance of qualified suppliers Suppliers <200 km away: 88% Suppliers between 200 km and 300 km away: 2% Suppliers >300 km away: 10% Supplies less 90% than 300 km away INCOMING LOGISTICS OFFSETTING For some years OMAL has been part of several projects to offset CO2 emissions related to the logistics of its procurement. The three main logistics partners: Aprile Spa, Shenker Italia Spa and DHL Express, which manage about 90% of the incoming movements, quantify and report the impacts generated by the transport carried out for OMAL and offer the possibility to offset them by joining specific projects. Value of offsetting 5.500€ projects signed in 2019 92 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 With the acquisition of these credits OMAL finances various types of projects such as reforestation or planting, the production of energy from renewable sources or biomass, the recovery of polluted or socially disadvantaged areas. The quantity of certificates purchased corresponds to the number of tons of CO2 generated by the transport carried out on behalf of OMAL: Emissions of 210 t CO2 offset 5.5 GREEN US T 5. ENVIRONMENT his section analyses all the activities to reduce environmental impacts implemented directly on the company’s internal processes in depth. ENERGY Correct energy management has always been a central theme for OMAL and investments in recent years have been directed towards: building efficiency; efficiency of plants and consumption monitoring; self-production of energy; purchase of clean energy; BUILDING EFFICIENCY Our factories are built according to high performance standards that allow us to reduce energy consumption. In particular, the Passirano site is equipped with an insulation system that includes a shed roof and polycarbonate windows and reinforced concrete tiles with insulation. The external façades of the shed are made with prefabricated panels that allow us to reduce noise emissions and reduce heat lost to the outside by 20%. 93 5. ENVIRONMENT PLANT EFFICIENCY AND CONSUMPTION MONITORING At the plant level, investments have been made in: automation systems to centrally manage and optimise the operating periods of the summer and winter air conditioning system in order to reduce consumption; The heating of the building is also guaranteed by the recovery of the heat produced by the compressors during their normal operation. Assuming an average use of 16 hours/day, the intervention allows us to reduce energy consumption by 7,268 kWh1 thus avoiding the emission of 958 kg of CO2eq; all systems (compressors, air conditioning, electrical ...) are equipped with inverters; The main heating and heat recovery circuits are equipped with thermal energy counters to control and monitor consumption; energy consumption management is monitored by the MOVICON Pro Energy application, which, from the end of 2019 onwards, makes it possible to check and optimise consumption and prevent waste and inefficiencies. 1 Calculation carried out assuming that the recovered heat is produced by the air conditioning system installed at the Passirano (BS) site. ENERGY SELF-PRODUCTION As far as self-production of electricity is concerned, OMAL has installed a photovoltaic system consisting of 400 panels capable of providing a minimum contribution of 100,000 kwh/year of renewable energy. In 2019, 112,805 kwh of energy was produced, of which 93.3% used for self-consumption and 6.7% sold to the national energy grid. The energy used for our own activities and produced by the photovoltaic system has made it possible to avoid not only CO2eq emissions linked to the production of this energy, but also grid losses linked to its feeding into the national grid. The graphs below show the performance of the system from 2017, the year of installation, to date: Energy produced kwh Energy sold kwh 150.000 15.000 100.000 10.000 50.000 5.000 0 0 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 The energy produced and sold decreased slightly compared to the previous year due to a variation in the levels of solar radiation during the year and to a physiological decline in the efficiency of the plant. During 2020, the possibility of cleaning the panels will be evaluated to restore the system to maximum efficiency.

Below is the certification of origin and the certificates issued by A2A to guarantee the origin of the electricity purchased by OMAL in 2019. 5. ENVIRONMENT This choice allowed OMAL to save about 765 tons of CO2 equivalent. This was calculated based on the total kWh used by OMAL, compared with the impact that would have been generated by using the average national energy mix, compared to the virtuous choice of using self-produced energy from the photovoltaic system and the specific clean energy applied by A2A. -77,5% Impact avoided by using green energy + consumption of energy self-produced CO2eq. by the photovoltaic system. 2017 2018 2019 EECS certificates issued and GO certificates 705 1712(*) 1744(*) (*) The “GO guarantee of origin” is the document referred to in Article 15 of Directive 2009/28/EC aimed at proving to end customers the share or quantity of energy from renewable sources in the energy mix of an energy supplier. 95 5. ENVIRONMENT ENERGY CONSUMPTION Energy consumption can be traced back to production machinery, heating and air conditioning and fuel for the company’s mobility of vehicles and forklifts. The trend in energy, methane and gas consumption over the last three years can be summarised as follows: Energy Methane consumption kwh consumption mc 3.000.000 400.000 2.000.000 300.000 1.000.000 200.000 0 100.000 2016 2017 2018 2019 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 Petroleum consumption litres 30.000 20.000 10.000 0 2016 2017 2018 2019 Electricity consumption has slightly increased compared to last year due to the decision to bring some production processes in-house (e.g. station for aluminium cutting and sandblasting) which were previously entrusted to subcontractors and which did not involve consumption by OMAL. 2018 2019 Electricity consumption Change % (values in Kwh) (values in Kwh) Electricity purchased 1.713.887 1.744.476 1,8% Electricity self-produced and 109.556 105.213 -4,0% consumed Total electricity consumption 1.823.443 1.849.689 1,4% 96 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 By comparing electricity consumption with the number of hours worked or to the annual turnover, a performance indicator is obtained which, in both cases, is very similar to the previous year.

During 2019, the project for the recovery and reuse of condensation water generated by the compressed air plant at the Passirano site was completed. The system makes it possible to separate the water from the condensate oil and to break down the bacterial load with specific substances and subjecting it to UV rays. Every year the plant can purify and reuse as much as 30,000 litres of water in the production process. Water reused in 30.000 the production litres process 98 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 In addition to water recovery, this system makes it possible to purify the wastewater leaving the compressed air system which may contain variable quantities of oil and particularly polluting impurities. Water consumption mc 14.000 13.000 12.000 11.000 10.000 2018 2019 The total annual water consumption has increased abnormally, but analysing the performance of each plant it can be seen that while the Passirano plant recorded a reduction in water supply of -39%, the Rodengo Saiano site deteriorated sharply due to a leak in the greenery irrigation system.

ENVIRONMENT Passirano site 5.986 3.660 -39% Rodengo Saiano site 5.644 9.975 77% Total 11.630 13.635 17% Since water resources are not a critical factor for the production process, consumption was not subject to precise control and for this reason the leak was not detected promptly. The goal for the new year will be to periodically monitor water consumption as well. 99 5. ENVIRONMENT FOCUS: PLANT REMEDIATION SYSTEM FOR WASTEWATER The Passirano site has adopted a plant remediation system for waste water. Thanks to specific plants capable of absorbing heavy metals such as lead and nickel, OMAL returns chemically and bacterially purified water to the environment. These plants protect the purification system from low winter temperatures, provide a greater spectrum of activity to the bacterial micro fauna and absorb the mineral substances released during the purification process. 100 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 WASTE MANAGEMENT The objective of sustainable waste management consists of: reducing the amount of waste produced and circular economy actions; maximising the amount of waste destined for recovery; reducing the proportion of hazardous waste out of total waste; reducing the proportion of waste going to landfill; In the belief that great results can also be achieved through small efforts, we have invested in training and raising staff awareness on proper waste separation and sorting methods in order to send as much waste as possible for recovery. Collection data from the last two years shows that the effort has paid off: 2018 2019 Change % Waste produced 535.438 582.321 8,8% Proportion of hazardous waste 4,90% 3,60% -1,30% out of the total Percentage of waste sent for recovery 96,80% 99,40% 2,60% Percentage of waste sent to landfill 3,20% 0,60% -2,60% 5. ENVIRONMENT Although the share of waste produced increased by 8.8%, the quality of waste collected made it possible to landfill only 0.6% compared to 3.2% last year. Of the 99.4% of waste sent for recovery, 4.5% was in the form of energy recovery and 94.90% was sent for recovery according to the principles of the circular economy to guarantee its reuse in other production processes for the production of new products and incoming materials.

The carbon footprint is the quantification of the direct and indirect impacts of activities that fall under the responsibility of the organisation and translated into CO2 equivalent. In accordance with the standard and the GHG Protocol, emissions are accounted for in accordance with: SCOPE 1: DIRECT EMISSIONS direct GHG emissions from installations within the organisation’s perimeter. 102 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 SCOPE 2: INDIRECT EMISSIONS DUE TO ENERGY CONSUMPTION indirect GHG emissions from the generation of electricity, heat and steam imported and consumed by the organisation. SCOPE 3: OTHER INDIRECT EMISSIONS emissions related to the manufacture of products and the provision of the services used by the organisation, such as emissions from production and transport of raw materials, packaging, auxiliary materials, waste treatment, from the distribution of finished products and end-of-life products and their packaging. After the first study in 2016, it was decided to repeat the calculation every two years on all the activities 5. ENVIRONMENT carried out by the organisation to verify the effects of the policies implemented. In 2018 the full study was therefore repeated as reported in the previous report, while for this year the analysis was limited to scopes 1 and 2. The results show a general decrease in impacts in terms of CO2 equivalent (-0.8%), mainly due to an improvement in the consumption featured in scope 1. 2018 2019 Scope (values in (values in Change % tCO2eq) tCO2eq) Scope 1: direct emissions 191,01 184,03 -3,7% Methane combustion 126,83 140,82 11,0% Diesel consumption 64,17 43,21 -32,7% Emissions into the atmosphere 0 0 0,0% Scope 2: indirect emissions 217,94 221,61 1,7% Electricity consumption 217,94 221,61 1,7% Total Scope 1 and 2 408,95 405,64 -0,8% 103 5.

For some years now OMAL has participated in the CO2web® project of Rete Clima, which offsets the CO2 emissions generated by access to the OMAL website according to the number of pages visited per year2. The offsetting takes place through reforestation in Italy, in combination with environmental education programmes carried out for free in schools. 2 Offsetting carried out by Rete Clima® based on the ENEA-MSE document by encoding a specific emission coefficient in terms of CO2eq/kWh, based on the national energy mix declared by Terna for 2012. PAPER CONSUMPTION OMAL has always been attentive to paper consumption by launching the Zero Paper Project in 2012. This project was based on a gradual reduction in paper consumption thanks to the digitisation and computerisation of processes, the use of specific software and Apps, as well as the features of the new website. The Smart Factory project permeates the entire company and allows it to manage all documentation digitally: all workstations are equipped with networked PCs from which it is possible to digitally manage all the information needed by the operator in production, from technical drawings to control plans, and share an increasing volume of information, through dedicated applications or those connected to the Panthera management system. a Project Management system allows coordinated management of activities, from the planning and progress phase to their closure. JPA also manages some critical or strategic “internal processes” by distributing responsibilities and activities (through a specific work-flow). The features of the new website and the OMAL Catalogue App allow easy access to product information. The App is a functional tool for the OMAL sales network, available in English and Italian, which allows users to consult the prices of each item, view and download the related 3D, and make a 5. ENVIRONMENT sort of personal order cart that can be sent to the OMAL back-office. The organisation’s digital evolution has also made it possible to increasingly reduce the amount of paper printing, always favouring the management and sharing of documents and copies in electronic format and their storage in digital archives. USE OF RECYCLED AND/OR FSC CERTIFIED STATIONERY AND PAPER Green procurement also translates into the decision to use sustainable gadgets: all pens, pencils, bags and canvas bags bearing the OMAL brand are made from recycled material. All catalogues, brochures and communication materials are printed on recycled or FSC certified paper. The “Zero Paper” project, which has been underway for some years now, has made it possible to minimise paper consumption but, where it is impossible to do without it, only FSC and ECOLABEL certified paper is used to guarantee that the raw material used comes from forests where strict environmental, social and economic standards are met. SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING The boxes and spacers of the multi-packs of OMAL products are made of corrugated cardboard marked “Fully made with recycled paper” which guarantees that the raw material used for the paper and cardboard is recycled and recyclable by the Paper Mills Association. The outer packaging, having to guarantee greater resistance and protection, are instead produced in 105 5. ENVIRONMENT corrugated cardboard containing only a lower percentage of recycled material, but it is still guaranteed to be completely recyclable at the end of its life in the COMIECO circuit. IoBevo PROJECT The “IoBevo” (“I Drink”) project, launched a couple of years ago, means that drink dispensers are available in the canteen to replace disposable bottles and cans. On an average of 5,000 meals a year, the benefits can be quantified as follows: 180 kg less waste generated; 7,6 tonnes of goods (bottles/cans) not transported; 240 kg of diesel saved due to non-transportation of goods; 280 kg of CO2 not released into the atmosphere in relation to the plastic bottles not produced; FOCUS: ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO KPIs SET Summarising the results of our environmental performance against the KPIs set, we can conclude that we performed well in 2019.

ENVIRONMENT 5.6 SUSTAINABILITY OF OMAL PRODUCTS O MAL products are designed and manufactured to ensure Empowered Performance, including from an environmental point of view both during the production phase, in the subsequent phase of use by the customer and at the end of life. The previous paragraphs illustrate the main strategies adopted to reduce environmental impacts linked to the choice of suppliers and raw materials (upstream), to the internal production process for the creation of the product (core), and now we would like to analyse the measures adopted for maximum performance in the downstream phase as well, i.e. sustainability even during use and at the end of its life, when it is decommissioned and sent for disposal. The main features and environmental benefits of OMAL valves and actuators during use are summarised below: PNEUMATIC ACTUATORS VALVES Features and benefits Long service life Long service life (high cyclicality) (up to 1,000,000 cycles) High maintainability (easy component No maintenance required during use replacement) High recyclability of materials No need for lubrication (100% recovery of metal components) High recyclability of materials Prevention of environmental pollution (100% recovery of metal components) thanks to the outside sealing system Functional safety guaranteed up to SIL 3 Functional safety guaranteed up to SIL 3 ENERGY EFFICIENCY RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY One of the design priorities was to lower the amount of air required for operation.

ENVIRONMENT FOCUS ON END OF LIFE OMAL products are designed so that they can be completely disassembled at the end of their useful life, separating the various materials for their correct disposal. All OMAL products are accompanied by a user manual that shows the list of raw materials used and an exploded view of the product that indicates where they are and how to dispose of them. The choices made by OMAL in the design of its products make it possible to dispose of the materials and lubricants used in the category of SPECIAL NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE. This is on condition that, during their use, they have not been polluted by substances included in the list of hazardous substances.

Polyethylene bags The focus on these aspects starts from the design of a new product. OMAL has tried to define a score to assess the environmental performance of the three new products manufactured. The assessment is purely qualitative and does not seek to quantify the impact in terms of a LCA Life Cycle Assessment. 110 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 The most environmentally critical aspects in the various phases of the life cycle of these three products were taken into consideration and each was assigned a weight.

Incidence of 9% investments on turnover in 2019 6.3 RATINGS AND AWARDS CRIBIS PRIME COMPANY CRIBIS D&B, a leading company in the business information sector at international level, has recognised OMAL’s maximum economic and financial reliability by assigning it a score of 1 and a minimum “risk of failure”. The “CRIBIS Prime Company” award is the highest level of evaluation of an organisation’s commercial reliability and is issued only and exclusively to companies that constantly maintain a high economicfinancial reliability and are virtuous in their payments to suppliers. The excellent evaluation is even more significant when looking at the reference market where the average is 2 in the valve sector and 3 in the actuator sector. 120 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 CRIBIS D&B EVALUATION CRIBIS D&B RATING The CRIBIS D&B Rating is a synthetic indicator of the company’s assets and risk. The financial assets are calculated on the basis of the Net Assets (from the financial statements or estimated) and the Share Capital, while the risk is derived from the CRIBIS D&B Failure Score. The indicator ranges from 1 (minimum risk) to 4 (maximum risk). Risk assessment Score factor RATING CRIBIS D&B The financial flow is satisfactory; The company has a medium level of debt; The current account tends to be balanced; the commitments made by the company are fulfilled with slight delays; The analyses carried out over the last 12 months show that the trend in payments is 1 constant; 2A The company has been operating on the market for some time. RISK OF FAILURE FINANCIAL ASSETS MINIMUM 2A 5.235.365€ Value based on equity LEGALITY RATING The Legality Rating is an innovative tool developed by the Italian Antitrust Authority (AGCM) in agreement with the Ministries of the Interior and Justice, which rewards companies that operate according to the principles of legality, transparency and social responsibility. OMAL decided to join voluntarily in 2017 to have maximum transparency in its commercial relations. 6. ECONOMIC VALUE This is a synthetic indicator of compliance with legality standards, the score varies from one to three stars: one star the company respects legality; two or three stars the company meets additional requirements in addition to legal obligations. Each additional requirement is given a “+” and after three “+” a star is added. OMAL improved its 2017 performance by two stars, reaching the new rating: AND REPUTATION + 121 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 6.4 MARKET PRESENCE AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT T he customer is one of the most important stakeholders in measuring the effectiveness of our decisions and the adequacy of the resources employed, and their satisfaction is at the centre of the company’s efforts to achieve continuous improvement. OMAL’s philosophy expressed in the motto “EMPOWERED PERFORMANCE” sums up the company’s desire to give the market a product and service that is superior to the reference technical and quality standards in the industry concerned. OMAL differentiates its customers according to their type (i.e. distributor, machine manufacturer or engineering company, end customer, etc.), then dividing them according to their industrial sector and according to the product lines supplied. At an operational level, customers are distinguished according to their geographical area of origin and managed by the Sales Department with a dedicated Area Manager and back-office resource. Exceptions are customers defined as “executive”, who are particularly important in terms of sales or are strategic, and who are managed directly by the Sales Department. Today OMAL has a presence in about 100 countries directly or thanks to a network of distributors and agents able to serve the different industrial sectors. Turnover divided by geographic area and the trend compared to the previous year are shown below: 122 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 Turnover 2019 Italy: 52,6% 32 Europe: 26,3% Asia: 11,2% mln Americas: 6,1% € MENA: 3,5% Oceania and South Africa: 0,4% Geographic area 2018 2019 Change % Italy 52,8% 52,6% -0,2% Europe 24,8% 26,3% +1,5% Asia 13,2% 11,2% -2% Americas 5,5% 6,1% +0,6% MENA 3,4% 3,5% +0,1% Oceania and South Africa 0,4% 0,4% Our presence in Italy is stable and can count on a consolidated network of loyal customers. The diversification of products and sectors of use has allowed us to expand into foreign markets thanks to our ability to supply both valves and actuators and complete systems ready for in-line installation. 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 123 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 6.5 SALES CONFERENCES AND FAIRS A product with EMPOWERED PERFORMANCE is characterised not only by its high technical qualities, but also by the prompt assistance and technical support service always able to meet the needs of its customers (solution provider). For this reason OMAL has opened several channels of communication and commercial upgrade, to train and refresh the sales network and distributors and to satisfy our customers. The most important events include trade fairs, sales conferences and training days specific to our distribution chain. FAIRS As laid out in the strategic plan, in 2019 OMAL participated in various trade fairs and was able to show its guests the fruit of careful research and design work and the care taken in manufacturing our valves and actuators. This also leveraging cutting-edge audio-visual support tools such as 3D movies and video tutorials for the maintenance of their products. The following are the main trade fairs we attended: WLPG FORUM 2019 24 26 September 2019 Amsterdam The event combined the LPG World Forum and the annual European Congress and was held in Europe as a recognised global leader in promoting initiatives to encourage the use of alternative fuels and reduce air pollution. Attendance at the event was strong and brought together premium LPG companies, decision-makers, policymakers and users. OMAL reaffirmed its leadership as a manufacturer of valves and actuators for this sector with a number of customer visits that almost tripled compared to the previous edition and from as many as 28 foreign countries. 124 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 125 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION IVS – INDUSTRIAL VALVE SUMMIT 2019 22 23 May 2019 Bergamo OMAL participated in the third edition of Industrial Valve Summit (IVS), the most important international event dedicated to industrial valve technologies and flow control solutions, promoted by Confindustria Bergamo and Ente Fiera Promoberg, which was held in Bergamo on May 22 and 23. Visits to our stand, slightly down on the previous year’s edition, came from 18 countries in addition to Italy, with a 22% attendance of customers compared to suppliers. OMC 2019 27 29 March 2019 Ravenna OMC is the “Offshore Mediterranean Conference and Exhibition” a leading event for the energy industry, producers and users of plants, process instrumentation and offshore installations. Now in its 14th edition, it has become consolidated as one of the most important meeting places for all operators in the Oil & Gas industry (engineers, decision-makers, scientists, academia and manufacturing companies). Launched in 1993 as a Mediterranean fair, it recorded a remarkable growth in terms of conference visitors and quality, thus carving out an international value for itself. 126 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 127 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION SALES CONFERENCE AND TRAINING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN Since 2010, OMAL has established a fixed meeting with its network of Italian agents and foreign distributors, as a tool for continuous updating in order to promote new products, share commercial strategies and network with partners. In 2018 a two-day sales conference was held at the Italian headquarters to show the result of the considerable efforts made in the reorganisation of the Group’s production facilities. In 2019, on the other hand, we preferred to focus on specific training for the distribution chain, organising, almost always on our premises, some two-day events, divided by area of origin of the distributors: February 2019: Training session for a first group of distributors from different parts of the world for an update on the advantages of OMAL products and to share experiences. February 2019: we visited Otkonsaş A.S., a Turkish distributor who has been collaborating with OMAL for over 25 years. March 2019: Training session with our partner Prodim, a point of contact for the Netherlands and Belgium area. April 2019: Meeting with Italian agents to present all the news on OMAL products and tools and to collect suggestions and comments that will help us to improve further. 128 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 April 2019: OMAL process valve training session with our distributors from Russia, Ukraine and Poland. 6.6 INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND REPUTATION T he value of a company cannot only be measured with economic and sales data, but is also made up of intangible assets that contribute to determining the ability to successfully pursue organisational goals over time. These distinctive assets, difficult to imitate by competitors, have always been pursued by OMAL as strategic to create knowledge within the company, an organisational culture, a sense of belonging, the ability to create relationships with the territory and the surrounding ecosystem, promoting actions of social and environmental impact. The intrinsic and distinctive value contained in OMAL valves and actuators therefore has to do with its ability to create virtuous relationships with internal and external stakeholders and supply chain networks, to respect and protect the environment, the health and safety of our workers, the quality of 6. ECONOMIC VALUE Made in Italy products, but also to protect the social context that surrounds it. While we are writing this Report, Italy, and in particular our Province of Brescia, is experiencing a AND REPUTATION difficult moment of health emergency due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus. OMAL wanted to make its contribution by donating 50,000 euros to the Fondazione Spedali Civili di Brescia, which will be used to purchase equipment and B-PAP ventilators, which are essential to increase the number of intensive therapies available in the hospital and save lives. This is the company’s concrete response to the needs of the surrounding area, pursuing the values that have always inspired its work. 129 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION FOCUS: VALVEcampus OMAL has decided to become a member of VALVEcampus, an Italian association whose aim is to promote the valve market and the made in Italy worldwide. The reasons for this choice are many, first of all to network with associates, an opportunity for dialogue between sector technicians and to share information on the main international buyers and on the reference markets. The VALVEcampus association also has the purpose of promoting training initiatives for technicians and specialists to keep up with the developments of this constantly evolving sector. 6.7 COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA PRESENCE A t the identity level, nothing succeeds in restoring the perception of a company’s values like its communication, to the point of becoming a real strategic asset to strengthen relations with direct and indirect, external and internal stakeholders. The importance of communication is not only to be understood in relation to the strength of its message, but also in relation to the methods chosen to spread it and the channels devised to convey it. In the last two years painstaking work has been done to update and restyle all the main channels of communication to the outside world such as: 130 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 CORPORATE VIDEO > which shows the two sites in Rodengo Saiano and Passirano in 5 minutes and travels through the offices, meeting rooms, production departments, assembly and warehouse to get to the product with detailed footage that “explodes” into 3D lines, accompanied by compelling music.

ECONOMIC VALUE to align the APP with the website. AND REPUTATION 133 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN 2019 > During 2019, a corporate identity project was carried out to align all OMAL catalogues and standardise the corporate image according to a coordinated communication line for all communication channels used by the company: fairs, advertising, industry magazines, social media etc. The subject chosen for this communication campaign was born from a study of the target group to analyse OMAL’s positioning by brand reputation and brand image, as well as to examine how the company is perceived and what customers (or potential customers’) expect from OMAL products and services. From these analyses it emerged that OMAL’s typical customer is looking for a superior quality valve, in its technical specifications and construction characteristics, because they want to be certain of the product’s performance and minimise the risk that the valve will fail or become blocked within their plant. The concept of the new campaign therefore focused on the priority requirement of OMAL’s customer: to have maximum peace of mind and reliability when it comes to the performance of valves and actuators. In order to achieve the objective, a brand association process was set up in order to associate the OMAL brand with the concept of problem-free, relaxation. In terms of style and graphics, the campaign aimed to differentiate itself from other sector advertisements (mainly in magazines and exhibition stands) which are particularly technical and cold, so as to stand out both in magazine leaflets and in its presence at exhibitions. To this end, we went in search of emotional images that went beyond the sector’s visual communication standard. The focus was shifted to the emotional factor, with references to situations of relaxation, no worries, with the objective that the user, when flicking through the magazine, will find an emotional image that stands out and captures their attention. When developing the concept, the challenge of succeeding in bringing emotion to such an industrial, technical and therefore cold product (valves and actuators) with a low emotional appeal was immediately established. The objective has been pursued by placing the product -valve/actuatoralongside images that emotionally evoke a sense of tranquillity; the sensation of being able to dedicate oneself to what we like most, without thinking. Choosing, as the guiding thread of the whole campaign, the claim: “Do whatever you want. While your OMAL valves work” The aim was not so much to talk to the user in their corporate role, but directly to man; aiming to touch more intimate strings, linked to the personal and therefore emotional sphere. 134 6.

ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION THE CAMPAIGN APPLIED TO SOCIAL MEDIA > 138 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 THE OMAL CALENDAR> Every year OMAL creates a personalised desk calendar that it distributes to its stakeholders. For this year’s calendar the subject “Do whatever you want. While your OMAL valves work .” was applied to the territory where OMAL products are born: the province of Brescia and Franciacorta. All the valves and actuators produced by OMAL are in fact designed and manufactured in the factories in the province of Brescia. The calendar is a real invitation to all stakeholders to visit OMAL factories and discover the product design, production and testing processes. But at the same time it is an unmissable opportunity to discover the beautiful places that surround the company, which can be visited just a few kilometres away. The aim is to raise awareness of and promote the places in Brescia, as well as to enhance the Made in Italy or better “Made in Home” -, claim typical of OMAL products. 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 139 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION THE COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN IN NUMBERS > With this campaign, for the first time, a uniform communication plan was set up, aimed at a coherent and systematic target audience. During the year: 10 out of 10 ADV published in trade magazines were focused on the theme of the campaign. 3 out of 3 fairs OMAL attended during the year had the campaign as the main subject of the communication (or presented references to the campaign). OMAL’s trade fair presence stood out in the sector for its originality and emotional appeal. 19 out of 83 posts published on the company’s Social Media were connected to the campaign; Recording a total of: Views 36.756 Clicks on posts 4.409 Interactions 869 (reactions, comments and shares) 0 5.000 10.000 15.000 20.000 25.000 30.000 35.000 40.000 Data calculated only on the total number of posts related to the advertising campaign, published on the Facebook and Linkedin company pages. 140 OMAL Sustainability Report 2019 COMMUNICATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA > The objective of corporate communication was also to develop an editorial plan that would guarantee a constant presence on social media, an increasingly strategic communication channel to raise awareness of our company. The purpose of these communication campaigns is not only to present adverts, but also and above all to tell the story of the OMAL world, ongoing activities and projects, reports of our business trips and/ or fairs, and corporate events. The story “What’s on OMAL” is laid out not only through traditional images, but also with videos that take a few seconds to showcase a PLUS of an OMAL department or of a product in a much more effective way. What’s on OMAL 6. ECONOMIC VALUE AND REPUTATION 141 6.

After a general risk assessment, the 2020 Strategic Plan has been defined and will be based on market and organisational objectives. At the heart of the competitive strategy is the desire to be closer to the US market with the opening of a company branch there in 2020, a warehouse and the definition of a marketing plan that foresees a gradual introduction of our products to the US market. At the organizational level, new investments and activities are planned for: acquisition of new machinery; expansion of buildings and operating spaces; implementing a Safety Management System; guaranteeing maximum data security; defining ad hoc KPIs for all operations; simplifying internal processes and information flows; promptly monitoring consumption; defining milestones for the management of strategic projects; training staff to increase skills; designing new products; activating an e-commerce channel; making the website available in 7 new languages; defining the new advert and the coordinated image with videos/interviews for the launch of new products; participating in fairs; digitising controls in production and testing; exiting from strategic single-supplies; improving company filing; Upcoming fairs: 6.
