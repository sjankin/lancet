Promoting “stubborn optimism” in Sweden The summer of 2018 was one of the warmest on record. While people around the world turned up the air-conditioning and went on with their lives, Greta Thunberg began her climate strike outside Sweden’s parliament. Her words and actions inspired a global protest movement. And sparked a global debate. People in Sweden have always been environmentally aware. Yet, despite greater public interest in climate and sustainability issues since mid-2018, surveys indicated that Swedes lacked basic knowledge about them. For instance, only 40 per cent have heard of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and only 8 per cent knew that one of these goals is climate action. This knowledge gap could not only hamper the country’s ability to achieve its ambitious climate objectives, which include being carbon-neutral by 2045. It could also potentially be an impediment to E.ON’s long-term success in Sweden as an energy supplier that emphasises sustainability. each devoted to a crucial issue: common goals, technology and innovation, national interests, and the circular economy. The idea behind the campaign was to inform people about the benefits of the transition to a low-carbon future. And to convey a sense of optimism about the possibilities of tomorrow’s energy world as well as the seriousness of the challenges ahead. The speakers included Marc Hoffmann (CEO of E.ON Sweden), Christiana Figueres (former Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC), and other renowned experts. A post-campaign survey showed that more than 20 per cent of Swedes remember the series. The principal key to success is the attitude that you bring to the challenge. Optimism is the intentional choice to approach a task that has not been completed yet, with the conviction that we have everything that it takes. That’s stubborn optimism.

That’s must be reduced and fossil fuels phased out in order for good. Because Sweden, like the rest of the world, has a lot of work ahead to do its part to limit the rise in global temperatures. We’re us to reach the goals in the Paris Agreement, Sweden’s happy that our video series gave many people in Sweden more climate target, and, not least, our own targets. knowledge – and perhaps a bit more optimism – about the path Marc Hoffmann to carbon neutrality. CEO of E.ON Sweden To help to close the knowledge gap on sustainability and climate issues, in March 2019 E.ON Sweden launched the Climate Optimism Project, a series of four roughly five-minute web videos, Energy networks: We want to bring energy into the digital age. Our mission is to make the energy transition smart, reliable, a reality. And sustainable energy available to everyone. Energy networks – power lines, transformer stations, smart meters, and the data links that enable them to talk to each other – will become the internet of energy. efficient An interconnected, digitized energy system will create new prospects and new opportunities for people, companies, and communities. However, this process will also continue to make the energy system more fragmented and more complex. As rooftop solar panels and wind farms proliferate, so too does the number of feed-in points and the proportion of intermittent output in the energy mix. Grids are where the energy transition is happening. And also where it presents the most challenges. At E.ON, we’re committed to meeting these challenges and enabling the transition to a low-carbon future. Our grids connect consumers with a steadily growing number of renewable sources and enable them to use this sustainable energy to power more and more aspects of their lives: to cook their meals, heat their homes, power their devices, and charge their electric vehicles. Bringing renewable energy to consumers reliably and affordably requires continuous innovation and the use of smart technologies. Like a turbocharger boosts an engine’s horsepower, smart technologies enable us to boost our existing grid’s capacity. And control it with much greater precision. This means that we can transport more renewable power without always having to put up more lines. Which reduces our costs as well as our impact on the environment, landscape, and communities. Tomorrow’s networks Tomorrow’s power networks will be smart: they’ll continually process megabytes in order to manage megawatts. This will enable them to control power generation, consumption, and storage in real time. Energy sources In the transition to a low-carbon future, power sources are becoming more numerous, smaller, and more dependent on the weather. Advanced technology helps us to predict fluctuations in renewables output as well as consumers’ energy demand. This will enable us to continue to ensure a high degree of reliability despite increasing volatility. Distribution system Energy storage The distribution grid is where the energy transition is Increasing storage capacity will enable happening. To manage more complex energy flows, we’re the energy system to harness much continually making our distribution grids smarter, more more clean energy. An important source agile, and more robust. This enables them to draw green of this capacity will be electric vehicles power from a steadily increasing number of feed-in points (EVs). Millions of EVs on the road by day and to deliver it to consumers reliably and affordably. means millions of EVs connected to Transmission system chargers at night, soaking up renewable Wind and solar farms are often energy. located hundreds of kilometres from the big cities and industrial centres that they supply. Smart grid technology will help to bridge this gap. But grid expansion will also be necessary for Europe to harness more of its clean, renewable resource. Prosumers More and more energy consumers are also becoming energy producers: prosumers. And the energy they produce is typically lowor zero-carbon. Our role is to provide people with the technologies that enable them to be more energy-autonomous and more sustainable. And one day: carbon-neutral. Energy management system Our energy management systems are the brain of the energy transition. They can monitor complex energy flows in real time, analyse weather data, and factor in continually evolving supply and demand forecasts. And, thanks to artificial intelligence, they learn more and more each day. Customer solutions: With the takeover of innogy in September green energy 2019, we now provide energy solutions to a total of roughly 39.5 million customers across Europe. Significantly more than at any time in our company’s history. This creates an enormous platform for marketing autonomy our continually expanding portfolio of cutting-edge solutions for energy efficiency, smart homes, distributed generation and storage, and eMobility. And for partnering with our customers of all types – households, businesses, and cities – to shape Europe’s transition to a low-carbon future. Our mission is to improve people’s lives while making the energy system significantly more sustainable, digital, and flexible. We intend to achieve this by bringing visionary ideas to life and putting customers at the centre of everything we do. That doesn’t just mean providing them with individually tailored energy solutions. It also means truly understanding their needs and establishing a long-term relationship with them. Our solutions will enable people to produce their own energy, store it, and use it anywhere or share it with their friends and neighbours. This will facilitate the development of new applications that simplify and enrich people’s lives. We’ll help individuals, companies, and entire societies to achieve more: by offering them energy solutions that are as flexible and agile as the lives they lead. And we’re committed to making these solutions continually smarter and cleaner. This will help our customers to live more comfortably and sustainably. And help tomorrow’s Europe to conserve resources and, eventually, become carbon-neutral. Sustainable solutions More energyOur smart solutions enable people to use energy more efficiently and efficient companies emit less carbon. Together with our customers, we can create a greener and more sustainable energy world. We’ve already set a specific target: Cogeneration for commercial customers A gas-fired turbine produces both electricity and heat. When the heat is by 2030 we intend to halve the carbon emissions of the power we sell captured and used for spacing heating or industrial processes, no additional fuel has to be consumed to produce it. This process, called cogeneration, to customers relative to a 2016 baseline. conserves lots of energy. In 2018, for example, the cogeneration units we installed for commercial customers in Germany displaced nearly 0.7 million metric tonnes of carbon. The reduction is roughly equivalent to the emissions resulting from heating the workspaces of 2.7 million employees.3 Innovative energy solutions The innovative solution we designed for Binero Group, which operates IT infrastructure, pipes the heat from one of the company’s computer centres Lower-carbon north of Stockholm into our district heating network. This heat, which households otherwise would’ve gone to waste, meets around two thirds of the heating needs of Vallentuna, a nearby community of about 30,000 residents. eMobility Converting a fleet of 200 company cars from petrol to electric reduces its annual carbon emissions by 500 metric tonnes. If the electricity to charge them comes from 100 per cent renewable sources, the figure more than triples to 1,800 metric tonnes, which is roughly the total carbon footprint of 160 people in Germany.4 tado° Smart thermostats like tado° enable a typical family of four to emit 600 kg less CO₂e annually. That’s roughly equal to the carbon emissions of toasting 100,000 bagels. Smart meters, which make electricity usage and costs transparent, also promote energy saving. We’ve installed 4.4 million smart meters across Europe. Solar panels and battery storage Rooftop solar panels and a battery storage system enable a household to meet up to 70 per cent of its electricity needs with Greener, its own green power. And to reduce its annual carbon emissions by about 1.5 metric tonnes, roughly the emissions caused by smarter cities 4,500 loads of laundry in an energy-smart washing machine.1 Werksviertel in Munich Our innovative energy plan is helping Werksviertel, a former industrial district Green power near Munich’s East train station, to be transformed into a sustainable commercial and Switching to green power reduces the average household’s residential area.

The first decade after our exit from large-scale power generation and energy trading. And the first decade of our journey after the innogy takeover. We’re now one company with one objective: to partner with our customers for a better future. innogy takeover: stronger together Our takeover of innogy, which took effect in late September 2019, dramatically enhances our ability to work with our customers to shape the new energy world. By combining our strengths, we’ve created a company whose smart grids are bringing more and more green power to people, companies, and communities. A company that develops innovative, sustainable solutions for more than 34 million customers in 15 countries. That will provide well over 79,000 employees with future-oriented jobs. And that offers investors attractive value and growth prospects. Dr. Johannes Teyssen Chairman of the Management Board and CEO In the 18 months prior to the takeover, we worked closely with innogy – and with employee representatives – to design a fair and comprehensive integration plan. As soon as the takeover became official, we began implementing it. We’ll initially manage innogy as an E.ON Group subsidiary and then gradually adjust its corporate governance over the integration phase. Climate protection: a watershed year? Welcoming innogy to E.ON was our company’s highlight of 2019. From a global perspective, it was a Swedish teenager, Greta Thunberg, defying all odds to rally millions of people worldwide to the banner of climate protection. We hope 2019 marks a necessary turning point in society’s commitment to tackling this urgent issue. Europe, for example, has significantly decarbonised its energy industry but still made no progress in other sectors like transport and heating. A good way to begin making progress would be to remove all the taxes and levies – like Germany’s special levy on renewable energy – from green electricity, which would encourage other sectors to convert to it. Cheaper green elecContents tricity would also benefit households everywhere, especially those on low Search incomes.

And that means: more sustainable. Our core businesses – energy networks and customer solutions – are helping make it happen. Our grids are getting smarter all the time, which enables them to integrate more renewable energy while remaining reliable. We’ve worked for years to continually increase the proportion of underground cabling in our networks. This makes them even less exposed to extreme weather and further enhances supply security. Our innovative solutions help customers of all sizes – from families and small businesses to large manufacturers and entire cities – to use energy more efficiently, produce their own renewable energy, and thus reduce their carbon footprint. The most important players in tomorrow's energy world are customers.

We identified these topics by means of a materiality analysis, which we have conducted annually since 2006. This report focuses primarily on the sustainability topics that our materiality analysis indicated are of very high relevance. To meet the diverse expectations of our stakeholders and the requirements of sustainability rankings and ratings, this report also presents information about a number of other sustainability topics. Below is a description of the materiality analysis we conducted in 2018. Our materiality analysis in 2019 took the form of a thorough review. Its purpose was to determine whether there had been important changes in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), our strategy, or our policy and regulatory environment. In addition, we compared innogy’s main topics with ours. The review showed that there have been no significant changes and that the innogy takeover does not appear to necessitate a change in topics. Our main topics from 2018 therefore remain unchanged. We plan to revise our materiality analysis for 2020 to align our material topics even more closely with our new organisational structure.

In 2019 we installed 1,400 of them. Smart substations provide real-time data about the status of our networks to our regional control centres. Moreover, they're remote controlled and therefore enable us to optimise more complex power flows in tomorrow's energy system. Our customers benefit from improved supply reliability, less network expansion, and the optimal integration of both renewable generation and new applications such as eMobility and heat pumps. Predictive maintenance Predictive maintenance involves using algorithms to predict whether a gird asset will likely fail in the near future. The information enables us to optimise our asset-replacement strategy, minimise the occurrence of asset failures, and reduce replacement costs. Algorithms help us to select assets with the highest risk of failure and components whose failure would have the worst consequences. In 2018 we began using predictive maintenance for Hansewerk and E.DIS’s intermediate-voltage cables. The application, which includes visualisation tools that display the extent of possible outages on a map, has already had a positive impact on network operations and replacement costs. In 2019 we completed preliminary predictive-maintenance models for Avacon and Bayernwerk’s intermediate-voltage cables and finalised such models for predicting substation failures.

However, the most recent UN climate conference, COP25 in Madrid in December Back Protecting people and the environment Climate protection Environmental management Occupational health and safety Data protection and product safety Incident and crisis management 41 2019, didn’t live up to the expectations of many. Some of the most urgent items on the agenda ended up being deferred until COP26, which is scheduled for November 2020 in Glasgow. Despite the disappointment, several announcements made during the two-week conference indicated progress. The European Union, for example, committed to carbon neutrality by 2050, and over 70 nations announced that they will submit an enhanced climate action plan, also known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC). E.ON is an energy company focused entirely on the new energy world; climate protection is therefore a pivotal issue for us. The transition to a low-carbon economy poses challenges for our competitiveness but also creates opportunities for us to grow our business. Our core businesses reflect the key emerging energy trends and enable us to help our customers to use energy more efficiently and to generate their own low-carbon energy. Beyond this, the production or provision of all goods and services as well as customers' use of our products results in GHG emissions.

In 2018 we began to integrate the assessment and management of these risks more systematically into our overall risk management. This process is ongoing and, from 2020 onward, will reflect the TCFD’s recommendations. The status of this process is presented to the E.ON Group Risk Committee on a regular basis. For this purpose, in the second half of 2019 we conducted two workshops on specific climate risks. Our analysis encompassed physical risks (such as extreme weather and rising temperatures) as well as transitional risks (such as changes in consumer preferences, our regulatory environment, and carbon prices). • Metrics and targets E.ON’s current climate metrics consist mainly of the emission figures for its carbon footprint categories (Scope 1, 2, and 3) and the measurement of progress toward its climate targets. As stated above, in light of the innogy takeover and our intention to gradually adopt the TCFD’s recommendations, we will enhance our climate metrics and adjust our targets in 2020. In August 2019 E.ON issued two €750 million Green Bonds that mature in August 2024 and February 2030, respectively. A Green Bond is a fixed-interest security whose issuance proceeds are used to fund low-carbon infrastructure and energy-efficiency projects. The annual reporting for the bonds includes disclosures on the metric tonnes of CO2e avoided by the projects funded. In October 2019 E.ON concluded a €3.5 billion syndicated credit facility whose credit margin is linked in part to the performance of certain ESG ratings.

For example, Hohenstein, an innogy hydroelectric plant on the Ruhr River in Witten about 15 kilometres southwest of Dortmund, inaugurated a new fish ladder in April 2019. The ladder enables migratory fish to swim upstream around the plant. Hohenstein also has a downstream fish path designed specifically for silver eels, which was installed in 2018. The investments for the two additions totalled about €2 million. Similarly, in May 2019 Unkelmühle, a small innogy hydroelectric plant on the Sieg River about 30 kilometres east of Bonn, put its technologically advanced fish protection and migration facilities into regular operation after completion of a test and monitoring phase.

That’s why health and safety (H&S) is a core value of our corporate culture. Every accident, even a minor one, can endanger our employees’ health. Some types of accidents that could happen in our operating business have the potential to dramatically alter employees’ lives and those of their family members. Accidents are also bad for us as a company. They may impact the environment, damage property, cause work stoppages, and harm our reputation. For all these reasons, we demand that everyone at E.ON complies with our stringent safety standards at all times. This is particularly true for employees whose tasks are potentially risky, like those who work on our power grids, gas pipelines, and other industrial facilities or install rooftop solar panels. We also strive to foster our employees' health, including their mental health.

This infrastructure – as well as the companies’ computer systems generally – could be the target of a cyber attack. Both companies therefore strive continually to familiarise their employees with data protection and cyber security. For example, in June 2019 E.ON, with support from Microsoft, conducted a two-day hackathon involving staff from 17 units and six countries. Participants received intensive training in identifying and thwarting cyber attacks. Similar training is provided at innogy, in which more than 1,100 employees have participated. In addition, in July 2019 innogy launched CyberRange-e, multi-day training courses in cyber protection. Training encompasses attack detection, analysis, and defence as well as crisis management exercises. Participants, most of whom are employees of innogy’s distribution system operators, also have to put this theory into practice by fending off attacks by professional hackers on critical energy systems under real-world conditions. On 30 October 2019 innogy held – as a highlight of Cyber Security Month – Cyber Security Day 2019, consisting of demonstrations of live hacking and other presentations. All of these programmes are designed to enhance E.ON Contents and innogy’s ability to continue to ensure the security of the energy supply in a Search world in which cyber crime is becoming increasingly prevalent.

Equally important is helping our customers, our employees, policymakers, and other stakeholders to understand our business activities and their role in propelling the energy transition. This helps us earn stakeholders' trust and maintain our good reputation. Moreover, dialogue helps us identify stakeholders' concerns early and address them whenever we can as we expand our distribution grids, invest in digital infrastructure, and launch new businesses. Our discussions with policymakers are important for us as well: to make large, long-term investments in infrastructure and new energy solutions for customers, we need a stable policy and regulatory environment. This framework should support the energy transition, in particular the integration and use of renewables and other efficient, climate-friendly technologies. In some cases, this will require amendments to the existing framework, amendments that we believe are essential for the energy transition’s success. Although the energy transition enjoys broad public support in many European countries, transparent and constructive discussion is still necessary to achieve a reasonable balance between ambitious climate protection and the interests of stakeholders who are adversely affected by it.

The statements in this report always refer to E.ON and its majority-held subsidiaries (the E.ON Group). Any deviations from this are indicated. For example, our reporting about occupational safety also encompasses entities in which we do not hold a majority stake but over which we have operational control. Our key performance indicators (“KPIs”) include PreussenElektra’s business operations. The business operations at the Renewables segment that we transferred to RWE are included in our KPIs until late September 2019. A separate innogy segment, consisting mainly of network and sales businesses, became part of the E.ON Group on 18 September 2019. Consequently, our reporting includes a number of innogy KPIs after this date. As a rule, however, our KPIs refer to E.ON without innogy. If KPIs of innogy’s continuing operations are disclosed they and their respective time frame are clearly indicated. Time frames may differ owing to the nature of a KPI, the availability of data, and internal collection and reporting processes. Any exceptions are clearly indicated.

In consultation with the Sustainability department and tonnes of CO2e avoided by the projects funded, will be published annually in experts from Energy Networks and Customer Solutions, the Controlling and the Sustainability Report, which is available online. Finance departments compile a list of eligible projects. The Sustainability department is responsible for ensuring that eligible projects have no ESG concerns and comply with all relevant company policies and guidelines as set out in E.ON’s Green Bond Framework. Finally, the E.ON Green Bond Committee – which consists of representatives of Sustainability, Energy Networks, Customer Solutions, and Group Finance as well as other subject experts – carefully reviews the list, selects projects, and decides how much funding each will receive. The eligibility of Energy Networks’ projects is assessed using the ICMA GBP category level for E.ON’s fully consolidated networks businesses applying E.ON’s grid investment categories and considering the renewable feed-in ratio for energy-efficiency projects. Customer Solutions projects are assessed using the ICMA GBP categories on a project basis considering E.ON’s respective investment categories. The Green Bond Committee, which meets at least on an annual basis, monitors the eligible green project portfolio. It is also responsible for excluding projects that no longer meet the eligibility criteria or have been disposed of and replacing them to the best degree possible. As Green Bonds mature, the committee is tasked removing the oldest projects from the portfolio for an equivalent investment amount. This ensures that Green Bonds continue to fund new projects. E.ON ensures that the initial eligible Green Project Portfolio will not be older than three years.

Their allocation to the Green Bond is still being finalised. The most recent forecasts indicate approximately €300 million of Innogy investments will be added to E.ON’s Green Bond portfolio when allocation is finalised. 3 In 2018 E.ON’s portfolio of investments allocated to Green Bonds included E.ON SE and innogy SE investments. On 12 March 2018, E.ON SE and RWE AG reached an agreement under which E.ON acquired RWE’s 76.8-percent stake in innogy SE as part of an far-reaching asset swap and which called for E.ON to transferr to RWE substantially all of its renewables business. This agreement is effective retroactively as of 1 January 2018, so that investments made by innogy in the area of network and sales activities since this date are economically borne by and therefore attributable to E.ON. 4 Investments under application of the green feed-in ratio as defined in the GB Framework. The green feed-in ratio is displayed in the table entitled “Impact reporting for the allocated portfolio.” E.ON’s initial Green Bond portfolio consists of €2,818.5 million in eligible projects. As of year-end 2019, E.ON had issued €1,500 million in Green Bonds, leaving €1,318.5 million unallocated.
