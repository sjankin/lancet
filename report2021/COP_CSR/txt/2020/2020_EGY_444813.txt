We are ISO 14001 certified that helps us improve our environmental conscious practice by using more efficient resources and reducing waste that positively affect our stakeholders. We started this year 2020 to report our annual CO2 emission through Carbon disclosure project (CDP) that allows us to be more environmentally aware in our manufacturing practice. The annual report will be sent to us by the end of December 2020 and we will adhere to disclose the CDP report on a yearly basis. On a yearly basis, we do Research & development report (R&D) on the environmental measurements such as (noise, thermal stress and relative humidity, suspended particles, gas monitoring, intensity of lighting and gas emission). We started this year to receive our gas emission measurements from the air lab of the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population. We changed our lighting system to LED lamps to decrease the Electricity consumption using these power saving lamps. We always search for opportunities to find new ways to improve our environmental performance. In particular, we look at diverse energy sources for our production processes by seeking opportunities to use alternative technologies to achieve the same performance and jointly affect positively on the climate. As being an Egyptian company, solar heat is naturally and environmentally available and offers an energy-efficient way to power all aspects of our industry needs. Machalico S.A. is in contact and making a deal with an Egyptian leading solar energy production company to gradually shift our factory energy source in the next 3 years. The goal is to start to pilot test the reliability of this technology powering the lighting of the factory before implementing it to our production processes. This technology can be implemented in all our production steps; varying from the boilers, to extraction tanks, hexane pumps and the generators. This is Machalico S.A. long-term progressive plan. The floral waste from our production is used as compost that helps in promoting organic agriculture and eliminates the use of chemical fertilizers. We are in the process of changing our source of energy for production from diesel (gasoil) to natural gas. This shift will decrease the CO2 emission and will be more environment friendly. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ Address: 58 Kasr El-Einie Street Tel.: (+2) (02) 27951397 Garden City, Cairo, Egypt www.Machalico.com Fax: (+2) (02) 27951397 Post Code: 11451 Mobil: (+2) 01100091390 Email: Machaly2000@Gmail.Com Anti-corruption We, at Machalico S.A., strictly have no tolerance for corruption and bribery.
