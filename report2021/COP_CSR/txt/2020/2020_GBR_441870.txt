Our core business is the delivery of renewable energy solutions to help people and the planet; this means our values and activities embrace the three environmental principles. We are continually encouraging the diffusion of renewable energy technologies in areas of the world with poor power supplies particularly for the use of primary healthcare. Human rights have also always been at the heart of our business and our founding principles exclude manufacturing arms or arms related products. Labour rights and responsible management are vital to our operations and values. We are employee owned, with equal shares for all, and with no external shareholders. We are anti‐corruption and our activities are undertaken through transparent bidding processes. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Yours Sincerely, Ruth Chapman Interim Managing Director, Dulas Registered in Wales No. 1629011 VAT No. G.B. 377 7317 15
