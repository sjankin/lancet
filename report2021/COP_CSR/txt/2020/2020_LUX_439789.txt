Included in their respective budgets, these objectives are reported and reviewed during monthly Business Reviews. All sites thus actively work to reduce their energy and water consumption, and emissions into the air (CO2, NOx, SOx, VOC, etc.), and are committed to recovering as much of their waste as possible by examining all local recycling solutions. All of this data is collected each month within the HSE network, and QUALITY OF SERVICE consolidated on a non-financial reporting platform administered by TENNAXIA AND COMPETITIVENESS Monitoring of waste by type and disposal method at all sites Insourcing of bottle sorting activities on our sites in order to optimize our processes, reduce our delivery times and reduce transportation All Verescence sites are certified in accordance with all of the following standards: ISO 9001, OHSAS 18001, ISO 14001, ISO 22716 (Cosmetics GMP) Product innovations The Verescence R&D teams, positioned at group level, work to systematically improve the ecological impact of the products manufactured at all of our sites: • Development of Verre Infini® NEO: 25% PCR = “Post Consumer Recycled” (post consumer glass to be recycled and reused), 65% PIR = “Post Industrial Recycled” (internal cullet) and 10% of raw materials • Use of hydro lacquers instead of solvent-based lacquers • Use of organic inks instead of enamels or precious metals • Development of lightweight glass Measure of environmental impact -Evolution of the Verescence Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) software, taking into account the impact of our customers’ choices regarding secondary packaging and modes of transport All sites contribute through their performance to enhancing the environmental impact model that we have developed using a unique life cycle analysis tool. This tool makes it possible to compare two bottles and give our customers an objective opinion for a more environmentally responsible selection process based on eight impact indicators: Global Warming (CO2), Acidification, Photochemical Oxidation, Eutrophication, Ecotoxicity, Exhaustion of Mineral Resources, Non-renewable energy consumption and Water consumption Launch of a recyclability study for colored and decorated glass bottles in order to define a recyclability index INNOVATION AND ECO-DESIGN External communication Raising the awareness of our customers on the environmental impact of their products during Trends & Innovations presentations CSR approach rewarded by the “Luxe Pack in Green 2018” award at the world’s largest luxury packaging exhibition in Monaco in the category “Best CSR Approach” Participation in several conferences as an opinion leader on eco-design in partnership with our clients: • Conference at PCD Paris 2019 with Bvlgari: “Verescence’s eco-design solutions for luxury bottles – case study: Bvlgari Man Wood Essence in Verre Infini® NEO” • Conference at Cosmétiquemag 2018 with Guerlain: “Is luxury packaging sustainable-compatible?” • Conference at Luxe Pack Monaco 2018 with Guerlain: “Sustainable development and value creation” • Conference at the Innovation Fragrance Summit 2018 with Guerlain: “Commitment and Eco-Solutions” Sectoral collaborations to highlight eco-design solutions • “Upcycled” project in partnership with Givaudan: first eco-designed and traceable perfume • Conference at Luxe Pack Monaco 2018 with Nez, Givaudan and the brand “J.U.S.”: “Perfume & Upcycling” Each year, Verescence and all of its sites evaluate their performance in terms of climate impacts and water management according to the “CDP Climate Change” and “CDP Water” programs.
