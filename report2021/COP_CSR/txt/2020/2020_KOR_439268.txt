In case of risk weighted assets, the ratio was maintained at a stable level by an increase of 0.4% during the year. In case of common share equity, the ratio increased by 5.6% from the previous year thanks to a great increase in net profit attributable to the Group’s controlling interests. Despite the capital increase, ROE also improved during the period. Propensity to dividend rose significantly to 14.5% in 2018.
