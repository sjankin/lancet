Based on the activity in HOCHTIEF’s current greenfield PPP pipeline, we expect the North American market to show a robust trend in the coming years, helped by the increasing adoption of PPPs for infrastructure procurement in the U.S. and major project developments in Canada. The PPP market in the United States in 2020 could potentially be impacted by local and federal elections, which could delay large project procurement processes. At the same time, 2020 could be a strong year for social infrastructure PPPs. In Canada, the outlook for infrastructure procurement through PPP schemes remains positive, as recently elected governments in Alberta and Ontario confirmed their support for PPPs during 2019.

Abertis will fully consolidate RCO and will invest EUR 1.5 billion for a 50.1% stake. RCO is a high-quality asset with a good strategic fit and a source of long-term cash flow generation. With 23 years of remaining concession life it contributes to the extension of the lifespan of Abertis’ concession portfolio and provides a further geographic diversification. The closing of the transaction is expected during the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory approvals.

The focus on developing innovative uses of Building Information Modeling (BIM) remains a common long-term topic for all Group units. In this digital form of planning and execution, a 3D computer model networks all those involved in a given project. The model can be supplemented with additional data, such as timing and costs, which enables real-time monitoring of construction progress and improved planning processes, and can even simplify maintenance and operation on the basis Innovation projects: Current examples Improved information status during construction thanks to Internet of Things Technologies that communicate with one another independently via the Internet—the Internet of Things (IoT)—enable data processing without a human directing individual actions. To allow various construction-related data to be measured on an ongoing basis, HOCHTIEF Innovation Management is working with Nexplore and employees of the Technical Competence Center, HOCHTIEF Engineering, and HOCHTIEF ViCon on integrating sensors that have proven themselves in construction. The sensor data is transferred to a digital platform and made available there. A sensor box developed by Nexplore translates the various sensor signals. Information from the sensor data is sent to the platform and displayed on a dashboard. This generates additional information that facilitates decision making, especially in critical construction processes. Depending on the case in point, IoT applications give project managers an information base during construction that is invaluable in terms of both quantity and quality. In the later construction phases, IoT applications can be used for predictive maintenance with the help of artificial intelligence. Construction-related data on the condition of various elements then enables proactive maintenance. Bid preparation supported by artificial intelligence Nexplore is working with the Technical Competence Center, Risk and Quality Management, and work section managers in the HOCHTIEF Infrastructure departments on a project to use artificial intelligence in bid preparation. Two electronic tools are currently being developed using a subset of artificial intelligence known as cognitive intelligence: the Cognitive Document Risk Analyzer and the Cognitive Document Analyzer. They are intended to make bid preparation more efficient through digitalization and standardization—for example, in contract analysis or in preparing invitations to tender. A shared IT platform gives the employees involved in the process access to the applications’ services to the use of the required data.

Project highlights One example of foresighted planning and work organization is the use of easy-to-clean LED spotlights on construction sites. Instead of the halogen spotlights normally used in tunneling, whose covers quickly become soiled, LED spotlights provide good, uninterrupted illumination of the work areas—an important prerequisite for preventing accidents. Occupational safety and innovation often go hand in hand. One example is the Transmission Gully motorway project in New Zealand where CPB Contractors has developed a GPS-controlled early warning system for cranes working near high-voltage power lines. The system not only protects the crane operators but everyone else in the vicinity. Based on 3D models, this system earned the team a safety prize for technology at the New Zealand Workplace Health and Safety Awards.

Just take a look at Turner’s Watershed project in Fremont, Washington. It targets certification from the Salmon-Safe ecolabel, which focuses on protecting wild salmon and their natural habitat. The project team developed a process to retain contaminated rainwater and clean it. After passing through several tiers of bioretention planters, the water flows into Lake Union. Biodiversity: The team working on a startup information center in Munich undertook tree and species conservation measures and also integrated an area for bats into the building. As part of the Moers city hall, a PPP project, HOCHTIEF planted a “bee lawn” as a voluntary bonus service, and the company also landscaped a wildflower lawn at the Fürst Wrede military base. HOCHTIEF CZ worked on a project to reforest a former coal mine site—an area totaling some 32,000 square meters—in Silesia in the reporting year. Climate protection: For the last nine years, Turner has regularly analyzed the workplace situation of its employees in the in-house Green Zone competition. The initiative is about measurable processes to improve health and working conditions on construction sites and in offices. Examples include the use of recycled paper and automatic lighting controls as well as setting up carpools. In 2019, the competition had 258 entrants (2018: 195), 142 of whom were awarded Green Zone status (2018: 140). HOCHTIEF has developed strict criteria for the selection of company cars. In 2019, CO2 emissions from company cars in Germany averaged 119 grams per kilometer (2018: 122 grams per kilometer). When replacing company cars, there is a growing preference for engines with lower CO2 emissions—also out of economic considerations. Non-financial Group Report Various campaigns help raise awareness around this topic and mobilize people. Over a three-week period in summer 2019, for instance, numerous HOCHTIEF employees participated in the nationwide Stadtradeln (urban cycling) campaign, consciously avoiding traveling by car and cycling instead. As a result, they reduced CO2 emissions by almost 1,100 kilograms. Sustainable products and services: As part of the public-private partnership created around the A 6 highway project in Germany, HOCHTIEF created extensive new natural habitats. Furthermore, the percentage of materials recycled on such projects is especially high. Roughly 90% of the old Neckartal Bridge was processed and reused as construction material for roadworks.

Group Report 2019 155 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Accounting policies General information The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section 315e (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). There have been no changes to the accounting policies during the reporting year. Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes. For purposes of understandability, various items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Earnings. These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The Statement of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method of analysis. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros. As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, Court of Registration: Essen District Court, HRB 279, publishes its own consolidated financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS). The consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft are published in the Bundesanzeiger (Federal Official Gazette); the consolidated financial statements of ACS are published in the register of Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores. The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the 2019 reporting year, comprising the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 10, 2020. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 11, 2020. Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as well as fundamentally all German and foreign subsidiaries under its direct or indirect control. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft is normally considered to and Notes control a company when it holds the majority of the voting rights. This generally goes hand in hand with a majority shareholding. A further 11 companies are fully consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other parties are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations. Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or joint ventures deemed to be of minor overall significance from a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 9. 156 Group Report 2019 A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that make use of these exemptions is included in Note 44. The Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and a total of 45 German and 373 foreign consolidated companies as well as four special-purpose investment funds (Spezialfonds). The number of consolidated companies decreased by six compared with the previous year. The number of special-purpose investment funds stayed unchanged. A total of four German companies and 12 foreign companies were consolidated for the first time in the reporting year. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (11), the HOCHTIEF Americas division (1), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (1), and at Corporate Headquarters (3). A total of four German and 18 foreign companies were removed from the consolidated group. The companies removed from the consolidated group related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (8), the HOCHTIEF Americas division (7), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (7). An entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of. Thirty-six affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales. Sixteen domestic and 111 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number declined by a total of 19 companies, with six companies added and 25 removed. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (5), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (1). The removals related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific ­division (17), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (4), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (4). Due to their minor overall significance, a further nine companies were not accounted for using the equity method. A total of 75 joint operations are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements in relation to the interest in these joint operations. These relate to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (68), the HOCHTIEF Americas division (6), and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (1). Consolidation policies The financial statements of German and foreign companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of and Notes an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any minority interest. In accordance with the optional treatment under IFRS 3, non-controlling interest is measured at the acquisition date at either fair value or the present ownership instruments’ proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s net identifiable assets. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the reporting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any remaining positive difference is recognized as goodwill. Goodwill is not subjected to amortization, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that the carrying book value may be impaired. Any remaining negative difference arising from initial measurement is recognized in profit and loss. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when measuring disposal proceeds. Group Report 2019 157 Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies that are included in the consolidated financial statements are reversed. The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures. Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are included in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with Group accounting policies. Currency translation For currency translation purposes, the following exchange rates have been used for the main Group companies outside the euro area: Annual average Daily average at reporting date (All rates in EUR) 2019 2018 2019 2018 1 U.S. dollar (USD) 0.89 0.85 0.89 0.87 1 Australian dollar (AUD) 0.62 0.63 0.63 0.62 1 British pound (GBP) 1.14 1.13 1.18 1.12 100 Polish złoty (PLN) 23.26 23.43 23.49 23.25 100 Czech koruna (CZK) 3.90 3.89 3.94 3.89 100 Chilean pesos (CLP) 0.13 0.13 0.12 0.13 In their separate financial statements, Group companies account for transactions denominated in foreign currency using the average exchange rate on the day of recording the transaction. Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity. Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro zone operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official requirements. The same method is used to translate the equity of equity-method foreign associates following Consolidated Financial Statements equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate. and Notes 158 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Accounting policies Revenue from Contracts with Customers Sales are accounted for in the HOCHTIEF Group net of VAT and other taxes as well as expected reductions such as trade discounts and rebates. Revenue under construction contracts and under construction management and service agreements is recognized as described in the following. The contractual terms and the way in which the HOCHTIEF Group operates its construction contracts are predominantly derived from projects containing a single performance obligation. Cumulative performance to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is generally recognized as sales over time. Project progress is determined using the method that provides the best measure of progress toward completion. The input or output methods may be used consistently for similar performance obligations and in similar circumstances. The HOCHTIEF Group uses mainly input methods to determine construction revenue. For other types of project (among others in the services business), output methods such as the units-of-delivery method are better suited as they provide a more precise estimate of project execution progress and of the associated costs. Contracts are recognized as contract assets in trade receivables or as contract liabilities in trade payables according to the relationship between the HOCHTIEF Group’s performance and the customer’s payments. If cumulative performance (contract costs and contract earnings) exceeds progress payments in a given construction contract, the project is presented as a contract asset. Where the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and presented under contract liabilities. Netting is carried out at project level. Contract assets are realized within one operating cycle at the HOCHTIEF Group. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even if realization of the entire receivable or performance of the construction contract extends over more than twelve months. Part-performance already invoiced is accounted for in trade receivables. Expected contract losses are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks and immediately included in full in contract earnings. Contract income is recognized in accordance with IFRS 15 as the income stipulated in the contract plus contract modifications, meaning any claims and variation orders. Revenue is thus recognized when it is highly probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur for such modifications. Where consideration in respect of a contract is variable, the expected value of revenue is recognized (constraint requirements). The Group assesses the constraint requirements on a periodic basis when estimating the variable consideration to be included in the transaction price. The estimate is based on all available information, including historic performance. Where modifications in design or contract requirements are entered into, the transaction price is updated to reflect them. Where the price of the modification has not been confirmed, an estimate is made of the amount of revenue to recognize while also considering the constraint requirement. Consolidated Financial Statements Revenue from construction management and service agreements arises from maintenance and other services, which may involve a range of services and processes. If different services are closely related they are single performance obligation and performance over time. Related revenues are therefore recognized in the HOCHTIEF and Notes Group with progress over time. In contrast to construction contracts, output methods such as the units-of-delivery method provide a more precise estimate of project execution progress and of the associated costs. As with revenue from construction contracts, there are also incentives, variations, and claims that are subject to the same strict requirement of only recognizing revenue to the extent it is highly probable that there will be no significant cancellations. Group Report 2019 159 Contract costs incurred during a tender process are capitalized if they are both expected to be recovered and either would not have been incurred if the contract had not been won or if they are intrinsic to the delivery of the project. Costs incurred prior to the commencement of a contract (contract fulfillment costs) may arise due to mobilization/site setup costs, feasibility studies, environmental impact studies and preliminary design activities as these are costs incurred to fulfill a contract. Where these costs are expected to be recovered, they are capitalized and amortized over the course of the contract consistent with the transfer of service to the customer. Where the costs, or a portion of these costs, are reimbursed by the customer, the amount received is recognized as deferred revenue and allocated to the performance obligations within the contract and recognized as revenue over the course of the contract. The HOCHTIEF Group does not have any contracts where the period up to the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer represents a financing component. As a consequence, the Group normally does not adjust any of the transaction prices for the time value of money. Generally, construction and services contracts include defect and warranty periods following completion of the project. These obligations are not deemed to be separate performance obligations and therefore estimated and included in the total costs of the contracts. Where required, amounts are recognized accordingly according to IAS 37 as provisions. Concerning loss-making contracts, a provision is recognized for the difference of the expected cost of fulfilling a contract and the expected unearned portion of the transaction price when the forecast costs are greater than the forecast revenue. Items on the Consolidated Balance Sheet Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straightline basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized to profit or loss over a maximum of seven years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Consolidated Financial Statements Company names and goodwill are not subject to amortization. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The company names recognized in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified as intanand Notes gible assets with an indefinite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction. Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over five years. 160 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Property, plant and equipment is carried at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the contract mining business, where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis. Items of property, plant, machinery and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives: No. of years Buildings and investment properties 20–50 Technical equipment and machinery; transportation equipment 3–10 Other equipment and office equipment 3–8 Right-of-use assets 2–70 Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. Right-of-use assets are recognized for leased items of property, plant and equipment in the amount of the corresponding lease liability, taking into account any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentives received and any direct costs. Any restoration costs for an item of property, plant and equipment are included in the cost of the right-of-use asset. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured using the cost model at cost over the lease term less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. The fair values are measured using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. As with property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method. Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is defined as fair value less cost of disposal or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the Consolidated Financial Statements unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist. and Notes Group Report 2019 161 A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, in relation to its interests in a joint operation, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using the equity method. Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint venture plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. A service concession arrangement is an arrangement under which a public entity commissions the financing, design, development, construction or expansion, and the operation and maintenance of public service infrastructure (such as roads, bridges, tunnels, schools). HOCHTIEF is paid for its services as operator over the period of the arrangement. Service concession arrangements are typically for a duration of up to 30 years. From HOCHTIEF’s perspective, the consideration paid by the public entity for the services performed may constitute rights to a financial or to an intangible asset. The criterion that decides whether a financial or an intangible asset is recognized is whether the consideration is subject to demand risk. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within each company or tax group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date. Inventories are initially measured at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including proConsolidated Financial Statements duction-related depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost. Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. Should the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increase, the resulting gain must be recognized. This and Notes is done by reducing materials expense. 162 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in value only. Non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are measured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under profit or loss from discontinued operations. Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term Incentive Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed by an outside appraiser. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. Varying from one country to another, the individual benefit obligations are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2019 163 Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under other non-current assets. Amounts resulting from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component, comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income. Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and timing. Current tax expense is normally measured for the purposes of the annual financial statements in accordance with the interpretation of the law applied by the taxation authorities. Tax returns are prepared in accordance with applicable law, taking into account current case law and updated administrative instructions. If a field audit results in uncertain tax items that may give rise to payment obligations, the eventuality is accounted for by recognizing a tax provision. Risk items are assessed and, if it is found to be more probable than not that they will result in an outflow of resources, a provision is recognized in the amount of the expected tax liability. Potential tax receivables as a result of recent legal developments are accounted for by reducing the tax provision or, in the case of a reimbursement claim, by recognizing the amount receivable. Reductions in tax liability mutually agreed with the tax authorities in a field audit are accounted for by reducing the tax provision or by recognizing a receivable, as applicable. Opportunities arising from settled litigation or appeal proceedings are accounted for if the taxation authorities accept that the legal principles apply by publishing the appeal decisions. Any opportunities that arise from unpublished litigation or appeal proceedings but must first be asserted by actively litigating are disclosed to the extent that they exist and are quantifiable and not immaterial. Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any Consolidated Financial Statements rights to reimbursement. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of the estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities. and Notes Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate for discounting as a starting point. 164 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not recognized on the balance sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the amount of the liability as of the reporting date. Financial instruments The following section first outlines in brief the classification, measurement, and derecognition rules relevant to the HOCHTIEF Group with regard to financial assets and liabilities. Explanatory notes are then provided on the balance sheet items within the scope of IFRS 9, comprising other financial assets, long-term loans, receivables and other assets, marketable securities, liabilities, and derivative financial instruments. Financial assets and liabilities—except trade receivables—that are within the scope of IFRS 9 are initially recognized at fair value. Financial assets are measured subsequently at amortized cost or fair value on the basis of the entity’s business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. The following classification criteria are applied: • Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are measured subsequently at amortized cost (AC); • Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is both to collect the contractual cash flows and to sell the debt instruments, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are measured subsequently at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) after adjusting for deferred taxation. Unrealized gains or losses are reclassified to profit or loss on disposal; • All other debt investments and equity investments are measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Notwithstanding the above, the HOCHTIEF Group may make the following irrevocable designation at initial recognition of a financial asset: • The Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of an equity investment that is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination in other comprehensive income after adjusting for deferred taxation. Unrealized gains or losses are reclassified to retained earnings on disposal; • The Group may irrevocably designate a debt investment that meets the amortized cost or FVOCI criteria as meaConsolidated Financial Statements sured at FVPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch. and Notes Group Report 2019 165 With regard to measurement, expected credit losses are taken into account in the presentation of impairments of financial assets at amortized cost or FVOCI. Quantifying expected credit losses involves determining the probability of default on initial recognition of an asset and subsequently whether there has been any significant increase in credit risk on an ongoing basis at each reporting period. In making this assessment, the HOCHTIEF Group considers both quantitative and qualitative information that is reasonable and supportable, including historical experience and forward-looking information that is available without undue cost or effort. Forward-looking information includes the future prospects of the industries in which the Group’s debtors operate, obtained from economic expert reports, financial analysts, governmental bodies, relevant think-tanks and other similar organizations, as well as consideration of various external sources of actual and forecast economic information that relate to the HOCHTIEF Group’s core operations. In particular, as far as available, the following information is taken into account when assessing significant movements in credit risk: • Actual or expected significant adverse changes in business, financial, or economic conditions that are expected to cause a significant change to the borrower’s ability to meet its obligations. • Actual or expected significant changes in the operating results of the borrower. • Significant increases in credit risk on other financial instruments of the same borrower. • External credit rating. • Significant changes in the value of the collateral supporting the obligation or in the quality of third-party guarantees or credit enhancements. • Significant changes in the expected performance and behavior of the borrower, including changes in the payment status of borrowers in the Group and changes in the operating results of the borrower. • Macroeconomic information such as market interest rates and growth rates. Financial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to another entity. The HOCHTIEF Group also derecognizes financial assets if it no longer has control over an asset, although none of the substantial risks and rewards of ownership have been either transferred or retained. If the HOCHTIEF Group retains control, it continues to recognize the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement together with an associated liability for any obligations that have been retained. The interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests accounted for under other financial assets fall under the FVPL measurement category. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no active market, fair value is normally calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the discounted cash flow method. Cost may be an appropriate estimate of fair value if only insufficient recent information is available to measure fair value or if there is a wide Consolidated Financial Statements range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range. Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. and Notes 166 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans bearing interest at normal market rates are reported at cost, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always done using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost. Subsequent measurement is based on the effective interest rate method taking into account transaction costs, which are all costs that would not have been incurred had the transaction not been entered into. Receivables comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and other receivables. Accounting provision is made for expected credit losses on receivables. For trade receivables, using the simplified approach, expected credit losses can be determined on the basis of loss rates calculated from historical and projected data taking into account the client and the regional economic environment. If there is objective material evidence that a financial asset may be impaired, the effective interest rate method is applied to the net carrying amount. Such objective evidence of impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. For financial receivables and other receivables, expected credit losses are determined according to credit risk on the basis of the losses expected either in the next twelve months or over the remaining term. The effective interest rate is applied in such cases to the gross carrying amount. Significant changes in credit risk are taken into account on an ongoing basis. Receivables are derecognized in connection with factoring if substantially all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. The marketable securities shown under current assets are classified in the AC or the FVOCI measurement category, depending on business model and contractual cash flows. For marketable securities, IFRS 9 provides the option of measurement at fair value through profit or loss. These mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose funds and investment funds, as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial measurement at fair value is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses on debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are reported in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal. Accounting provision is made for expected credit losses on securities in the AC and FVOCI measurement categories. Expected credit losses are calculated according to credit risk on the basis of the losses expected either in the next twelve months or over the remaining term. Significant changes in credit risk are taken into account. If there is no objective evidence of impairment, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount. If, however, there is objective evidence that a financial asset may be impaired, the effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount. Selected marketable securities are adjusted to fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of the rules for use of the overlay approach. Consolidated Financial Statements Liabilities are recognized at amortized cost and subsequently measured using the effective interest rate method. Supply chain finance arrangements with banks match usual payment terms and do not modify the original liability toward the supplier, hence the amounts are presented under trade payables or other liabilities. and Notes Group Report 2019 167 Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of purpose and reported under other receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the trade date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness in accordance with the HOCHTIEF Group’s risk management strategy and economic risk control. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are entered into. There are also derivatives—such as a call option—which are used for economic hedging purposes but for which no hedge accounting is applied. In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 168 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following matters: • Construction/PPP and construction management/services business – determination of stage of completion; – estimation of total contract costs; – estimation of total contract revenue, including recognizing revenue on contract variations and claims only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount recognized will not occur in the future; – estimation of a customer’s preparedness to accept contract variations and claims; – estimation of project completion date; and – assumed levels of project execution productivity. • Estimation of allowance for expected credit losses on financial assets. • Determination of whether an arrangement constitutes a lease. • Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer to the lessee. • Financial assets may be measured, irrespective of measurement category, at fair value through profit or loss. • Application of the risk management strategy to hedges. • Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting Policies in these Notes. Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following: • Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for contract modifications, the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized. • Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties. • The measurement of expected credit losses. • The estimation of residual value guarantees and options for the purchase of lease liabilities. • The estimation of options to extend a lease. • Accounting for provisions. • Testing goodwill on the basis of the three-year plan or, in the case of listed companies, on the basis of the share Consolidated Financial Statements price and other assets for impairment • The assessment of the recognition of deferred taxes considering the expected future performance of the business in line with Group strategy and Notes All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised accordingly. Group Report 2019 169 Financial reporting standards applied for the first time in 2019 Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) of new and revised IFRS and IFRIC pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The changes relate to the following standards and interpretations: IFRS 16 Leases: As of January 1, 2019, the HOCHTIEF Group adopted IFRS 16 “Leases”, which replaces IAS 17 “Leases”, IFRIC 4 “Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease”, SIC-15 “Operating Leases—Incentives” and SIC-27 “Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease”. The Group adopted IFRS 16 using the full retrospective approach. HOCHTIEF did apply the practical expedient not to reassess whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the date of initial application. It applies the definition of a lease only to contracts entered into (or changed) on or after the date of initial application. The Group also exercises the option of aggregating lease and non-lease components with the exception of real estate leases and recognizing them uniformly as leases in the balance sheet. IFRS 16 sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases and requires lessees to account for all leases under a single on-balance sheet model similar to the accounting for finance leases under IAS 17. Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from the accounting under IAS 17 and has no material impact on the Group. From a lessee perspective, at the commencement date of a lease, a lessee recognizes a liability to make lease payments (“lease liability”) and an asset representing the right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (“right-of-use asset”). HOCHTIEF presents the interest expense on the lease liability separately from the depreciation charge on the right-of-use asset. Lessees are also required to remeasure the lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events (such as a change in the lease term or lease payments). The amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability is recognized as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Operating lease expenses continue to exist for short-term leases (up to 12 months) as well as for low-value assets. Consolidated Financial Statements Effects of first-time application of IFRS 16 The Group has applied IFRS 16 in full retrospectively and therefore, the comparative figures have been restated as if the new accounting policy had always been applied. The disclosure notes have also been restated where required for comparatives under new disclosure requirements. The adjustments due to the application of the new and Notes standard for the Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are presented below. 170 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Impact on Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018 Dec. 31, Restatement Dec. 31, 2018 IFRS 16 2018 (EUR thousand) (restated) Assets Non-current assets Property, plant and equipment1) 979,232 667,918 1,647,150 Deferred tax assets2) 113,894 12,504 126,398 Total assets impact 680,422 Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity Shareholders’ equity Attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders3) 1,905,992 (45,455) 1,860,537 Attributable to non-controlling ­interest 559,391 (8,602) 550,789 Total equity impact 2,465,383 (54,057) 2,411,326 Non-current liabilities Lease liabilities – 535,601 535,601 Trade payables and other liabilities 97,939 (26,850) 71,089 Deferred tax liabilities2) 51,702 (682) 51,020 Current liabilities Lease liabilities – 245,921 245,921 Trade payables and other liabilities 8,064,357 (19,511) 8,044,846 Total liabilities impact 734,479 1) IFRS 16 has led to recognized amounts for right-of-use assets within property, plant and equipment and lease liabilities on the face of the balance sheet representing the Group’s portfolio of leased assets made up by property, plant, operating equipment and vehicles utilized by the Group. 2) Adjustments under IFRS 16 are subject to tax effect accounting and therefore the net deferred tax position has been impacted. 3) At December 31, 2018, the retained earnings adjustment has increased by around EUR 3 million (EUR 45.5 million).

Under IAS 17, operating lease expenses were presented as operating expenses, whereas IFRS 16 splits the lease expense into depreciation of the right-of-use assets recognized and investment and interest expenses on lease liabilities. This has driven a decrease in the ­o perating lease expense and increases in depreciation and finance costs. Consequently, this has also impacted the Group’s EBITDA. 2) The adjusted profit has led to a marginal change in the Group’s earnings per share.

This has led to an increase in cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in 172 Group Report 2019 net cash inflows from financing activities. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Lease recognition The Group as lessee The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. In such instances, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements, except for short-term, cancelable leases that if canceled by the lessee, the losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessor and low-value leased assets. For these leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. The Group has a significant lease portfolio, comprising of predominately property, plant, operating equipment and fleet vehicle rentals. Given the Group’s operational involvement in the construction, construction management and services sectors, leasing equipment is a key component of the business. Measurement and presentation of lease liability The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate. The following items are also included in the measurement of the lease liability: • Fixed lease payments offset by any lease incentives; • Variable lease payments, for lease liabilities which are tied to a floating index; • The amounts expected to be payable to the lessor under residual value guarantees; • The exercise price of purchase options (if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised); and • Payments of penalties for terminating leases, if the lease term reflects the lease terminating early. The lease liability is separately disclosed in the balance sheet. The liabilities which will be repaid within 12 months are recognized as current and the liabilities which will be repaid in excess of 12 months are recognized as non-current. The lease liability is subsequently measured by reducing the balance to reflect the principal lease repayments made and increasing the carrying amount by the interest on the lease liability. The Group is required to remeasure the lease liability and make an adjustment to the right-of-use asset in the folConsolidated Financial Statements lowing instances: • The term of the lease has been modified or there has been a change in the Group assessment of the purchase option being exercised, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; and Notes • A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate; and • The lease payments are adjusted due to changes in the index or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using the initial discount rate. However, where the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate a revised discount rate is used. Group Report 2019 173 Measurement and presentation of right-of-use assets The right-of-use assets recognized by the Group comprise the initial measurement of the related lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the commencement of the contract, less any lease incentives received and any direct costs. Costs incurred by the Group to dismantle the asset, restore the site or restore the asset are included in the cost of the right-of-use asset. It is subsequently measured under the cost model with any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses applied against the right-of-use asset. If the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group will exercise a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated from the commencement date to the end of the useful life of the underlying asset. Otherwise, the Group depreciates the asset over the shorter period of either the useful life of the asset or the lease term. The depreciation starts at the commencement date of the lease and the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to reflect the accumulated depreciation balance. Any remeasurement of the lease liability is also applied against the right-of-use asset value. The right-of-use assets are presented within property, plant and equipment in the balance sheet. Lessor recognition The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to some property subleases as well as renting equipment to its partners, suppliers and contractors. Those leases are recognized as either finance or operating leases. lf the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. lf this is not the case, then the lease is recognized as an operating lease. The income received from the operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging operating leases are included in the carrying amount of the leased asset. Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognized as receivables. IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments HOCHTIEF applied IFRIC 23 commencing January 1, 2019. The interpretation clarifies the recognition and measurement requirements for uncertain income tax treatments. In examining uncertainty over income tax treatments, HOCHTIEF considers whether it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment or make changes. In the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements, the recognition and measurement obligations resulting from initial application of IFRIC 23 mainly resulted in changes in the presentation of tax provisions and tax liabilities only. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 174 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Further changes relate to the following standards and interpretations: • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement • Amendments to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Long-term Interests in an Associate or Joint Venture • Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation • Endorsement of Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2015–2017 Cycle: Amendments to IFRS 3, IAS 12, and IAS 23. The disclosure requirements resulting from the amendments to IAS 19, IAS 28, IFRS 9, and from the 2015–2017 cycle annual improvements had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements. For explanatory notes on standards and interpretations that do not have to be applied for 2019, please see Note 38. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2019 175 Explanatory Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 2. Sales The EUR 25,851,855 thousand (2018: EUR 23,882,290 thousand) sales figure comprises performance obligations recognized under the percentage of completion method in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining, plus products and services provided to construction joint ventures, and other related services. Contract mining sales accounted for EUR 2,796,802 thousand (2018: EUR 2,505,653 thousand). Secondly, the sales figure includes revenues from services such as construction planning, project development, logistics, asset management, and concessions and insurance business.

Provision and asset impairment in relation to Middle East exit Significant items are those which by their size and nature or incidence are relevant in explaining the financial performance of the Group, and as such are disclosed separately. On January 23, 2020 CIMIC announced to the ASX that it had completed an extensive strategic review of its financial investment of a non-controlling interest in BIC Contracting (BICC), a company operating in the Middle East ­region. As part of the review CIMIC initiated a confidential M&A process of its investment in BICC and discussions continue with a shortlist of potential acquirers for all or part of BICC. In addition, in the context of an accelerated deterioration of local market conditions, BICC is engaging in confidential discussions with its lenders, creditors, clients and other stakeholders. After thorough evaluation of all available options, CIMIC has decided to exit the region and to focus its resources and capital allocation on growth opportunities in its main core markets and geographies (Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific). In the year ended December 31, 2019 the Group has recognised a one off pre-tax impact of EUR 1,694,600 thousand relating to provisions and asset impairments in respect of the Middle East exit with an associated income tax benefit of EUR 550,106 thousand, resulting in a post-tax impact of EUR 1,144,494 thousand (“One off financial impact of the Middle East exit”).

As in the prior year, intangible assets are not subject to any restrictions. Development costs in the amount of EUR 2,431 thousand (2018: EUR 550 thousand) were capitalized during the reporting year. 184 Konzernbericht 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets include EUR 44,581 thousand (2018: EUR 43,751 thousand) for company names recognized on initial consolidation, comprising EUR 42,508 thousand (2018: EUR 41,707 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Americas division and EUR 2,073 thousand (2018: EUR 2,044 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The company names are not subject to systematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. No impairment loss was identified in 2019 (2018: impairment loss of EUR 1,695 thousand). The changes in 2019 relate to exchange rate adjustments. Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units correspond to the divisions used in segment reporting. Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF as of March 31 of the reporting year for the HOCHTIEF Americas division and the HOCHTIEF Europe division and as of December 31 of the reporting year for the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. It is ensured as of the balance sheet date that there are no material changes in the parameters for impairment testing that would result in an impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, a division’s recoverable amount is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured separately for each unit as value in use. This is the present value of expected future free cash flows from each cash-generating unit. Value in use is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method. This is applied on the basis of cash flow budgets derived as a rule from the three-year budget for the detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorporate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in subsequent years without applying a terminal-value growth rate. A sustained cash flow is determined on the basis of free cash flow in the last budget year. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital figures. Value in use is first measured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. For the purposes of the Notes disclosures, the pretax discount rate is then found by iteration. The discount rates used in impairment testing for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units are 7.02% and 8.74% before tax (2018: 6.90% and 8.20%).

The position is: • In November 2009 the Consortium was announced as the preferred contractor to construct the 2.1 kilometre Chevron Gorgon LNG Jetty and Marine Structures project on Barrow Island, 70 kilometres off the Pilbara coast of Western Australia. • The scope of work consisted of the design, material supply, fabrication, construction and commissioning of the LNG Jetty. The scope also included supply, fabrication and construction of marine structures including a heavy lift facility, tug pens and navigation aids. • The jetty comprised steel trusses approximately 70 metres long supported by concrete caissons leading to the loading platform approximately 4 kilometres from the shore. • Initial acceptance of the jetty and marine structures took place on 15 August 2014. • During the project, changes to scope and conditions led to the Consortium submitting Change Order Requests (CORs). The Consortium, Chevron and Chevron’s agent, entered into negotiations in relation to some of the CORs. • On 9 February 2016 the Consortium formally issued a Notice of Dispute to Chevron in connection with the Gorgon Contract relating to the CORs. Following a period of prescribed negotiation, the parties have entered a private arbitration as prescribed by the Gorgon Contract (Chevron Arbitration). • On 20 August 2016, in order to pursue further its entitlement under the contract, CIMIC Group commenced proceedings in the United States against Chevron Corporation and KBR Inc. The commencement of the proceedings has no effect on the contract process or CIMIC’s entitlement to the amounts under negotiation / claimed in the arbitration. • Since December 2016, the Chevron Arbitration has continued in accordance with the contractual terms. Closing submissions were completed on 6–7 November 2019 with an award from the arbitrators expected late 2020. In addition there is an arbitration procedure against Saipem pursuant to the Consortium Agreement seeking recovery of outstanding amounts.The Consortium Arbitration continues in accordance with the contractual processes; arbitrators have been appointed, orders for the conduct of the arbitration have been made, and it is anticipated that hearings will commence in 2020 with a determination thereafter.

Deferred tax liabilities totaling a gross amount of EUR 591,173 thousand (2018 restated: EUR 640,395 thousand) are entirely due to taxable temporary differences, mostly from adjustments to ensure uniform Group-wide compliand Notes ance with IFRS measurement principles. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset within each company or tax group. The EUR 1,263,150 thousand (2018 restated : EUR 715,773 thousand) gross amount of deferred tax assets includes the following tax refund entitlements arising from the expected future use of tax loss carryforwards and tax credits: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 (restated) Corporate income tax (or comparable foreign income tax) 115,620 73,750 German municipal trade tax 21,700 – 137,320 73,750 192 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Deferred tax assets are only recognized for tax loss carryforwards in so far as it is sufficiently certain that the tax loss carryforwards can be utilized. To the extent that no sufficient taxable temporary differences are available, expected taxable income for the purpose of measuring deferred taxes on deductible temporary differences and/or tax loss carryforwards is derived from budget figures, taking account of restrictions due to rules to be observed with regard to minimum taxation. Tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized amount to EUR 1,594,147 thousand (2018 restated: EUR 1,644,124 thousand) in respect of German and foreign corporate income tax and EUR ­1,439,610 thousand (2018: EUR 1,436,025 thousand) in respect of German municipal trade tax. Deferred tax assets have not been recognized for EUR 88,291 thousand (2018: EUR 62,271 thousand) in tax loss carryforwards that are subject to a time limit. The time limits range between two and nine years. German and foreign Group companies that generated losses in 2019 or prior years have EUR 650,793 thousand (2018: EUR 59,155 thousand) in unimpaired deferred tax assets relating to temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards. In the deferred tax asset surplus recognized by HOCHTIEF EUR 550,106 thousand are derived from the Middle East exit. In recognizing deferred tax assets the Group considers the expected future performance of the business in line with Group strategy, business plans as well as future capital allocation opportunities. The group analyses strategic options to maintain its strong balance sheet, including investment partnerships to grow its core businesses. No deferred tax assets have been recognized in relation to interest expense carryforwards in the amount of EUR 420,794 thousand (2018: EUR 356,591 thousand). The change in the interest expense carryforward figures relates to adjustments made on the basis of tax audits and ongoing changes. No deferred tax liabilities have been recognized on temporary differences in the amount of EUR 13,237 thousand (2018: EUR 17,049 thousand) in connection with investments in subsidiaries because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is not probable that they will reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax income of EUR 581,676 thousand recognized in the consolidated income statement is primarily the result of changes in relation to the Middle East exit (EUR 550,106 thousand) and tax loss carryforwards (EUR 59,763 thousand). The other changes in the balance of minus EUR 28,193 thousand affecting income Consolidated Financial Statements relate to other balance sheet items. The change of EUR 14,923 thousand recognized directly in equity is attributable to OCI effects of EUR 5,392 thousand (mainly exchange rate effects) and changes in the scope of consolidation of EUR 9,531 thousand. and Notes In the reporting year, EUR 4,394 thousand (2018: minus EUR 20,122 thousand) was recognized directly in equity in relation to currency translation of deferred taxes in foreign financial statements, and EUR 12 thousand (2018: minus EUR 5,976 thousand) was recognized directly in equity for the remeasurement through other comprehensive income of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. An amount of EUR 986 thousand was recognized directly in equity (2018: EUR 6,474 thousand) for deferred taxes relating to actuarial gains and losses. As of the balance sheet date, deferred taxes recognized directly in equity in connection with the measurement of financial instruments amounted to minus EUR 4,612 thousand (2018: minus EUR 4,624 thousand), while EUR 142,740 thousand (2018: EUR 141,754 thousand) was recognized directly in equity in connection with actuarial gains and losses.

Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Defined benefit plans Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 takes the form of a modular defined contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft every three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension components earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a life-long annuity. Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a company pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years. Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF (UK) in the United Kingdom. The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retirement between a life-long annuity and a lump-sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment benefits in the form of medical care for retirees. HOCHTIEF (UK) has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2019 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 139,931 84,853 12,878 Final salary [25,631] – [12,878] Not final salary [114,300] [84,853] – Vested benefits 161,985 42,865 20,470 Retirees 498,022 94,592 16,816 Consolidated Financial Statements Similar obligations 86 65,508 – Total 800,024 287,818 50,164 Duration in years (weighted) 15.0 9.7 18.8 Dec. 31, 2018 and Notes (EUR thousand) Deutschland USA Großbritannien Active members 120,006 77,178 10,428 Final salary [21,204] – [10,428] Not final salary [98,802] [77,178] – Vested benefits 141,914 35,350 16,643 Retirees 501,274 87,212 15,413 Similar obligations 92 52,413 – Total 763,286 252,153 42,484 Duration in years (weighted) 13.9 8.9 17.7 202 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Plan assets Germany There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The transferred assets are administered by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. Investment decisions are not made by the trustee but by an investment committee. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combinations. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the services of an external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation offered up to December 31, 2013 were funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e. V. as of December 31, 2019 is about 51% (2018: 52%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about 57% (2018: 58%). It should be noted in this connection that pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio is expected to significantly increase again when interest rates recover. USA The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maximize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. The pension obligations being fully funded at Turner, Consolidated Financial Statements high-risk investments in equities were reduced and investments in bonds that are more stable in value were increased in 2018. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligaand Notes tions covered by Turner’s pension fund as of December 31, 2019 is about 106% (2018: 105%); funding at Turner overall is about 82%, as in the prior year. Group Report 2019 203 UK Funding of plan assets at HOCHTIEF (UK) is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF (UK) is about 75% (2018: 76%). Defined benefit obligations are covered by plan assets as follows: Coverage of defined benefit obligations by plan assets Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Defined benefit Plan assets Defined benefit Plan assets (EUR thousand) obligations obligations Uncovered by plan assets 66,750 – 53,587 – Partially covered by plan assets 776,905 415,462 739,156 402,730 Not fully covered by plan assets 843,655 415,462 792,743 402,730 Fully covered by plan assets 294,351 309,864 265,180 279,508 Total 1,138,006 725,326 1,057,923 682,238 Actuarial assumptions The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically, the actuarial assumptions used are as follows: 2019 2018 (Percent) Germany USA UK Germany USA UK *Weighted average Discount factor* 1.30 2.98 2.05 2.00 4.45 2.90 Salary increases 2.75 – 1.90 2.75 – 2.05 Pension increases* 1.50 – 3.15 1.75 – 3.30 Health cost increases – 5.00 – – 5.00 – The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience. The following mortality tables were used in the actuarial calculation of pension obligations: Consolidated Financial Statements Germany Heubeck Richttafeln 2018 G USA PRI2012 table projected generationally with MP2019 UK S2PxA CMI_2018 [1,25 %] year of birth and Notes 204 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The present value of defined benefit obligations and the market value of plan assets have changed as follows: Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations 2019 2018 (EUR thousand) Domestic International Total Domestic International Total Defined benefit obligations at start of year 763,286 294,637 1,057,923 774,867 308,532 1,083,399 Current service cost 6,235 1,807 8,042 6,601 1,883 8,484 Past service cost – – – – 435 435 Interest expense 14,880 12,335 27,215 15,079 10,719 25,798 Remeasurements Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from ­changes in demographic assumptions 1,556 (2,666) (1,110) 7,966 (670) 7,296 Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from ­changes in financial assumptions 60,315 40,066 100,381 – (19,348) (19,348) Actuarial (gains)/losses arising from ­experience adjustments (8,933) 3,841 (5,092) (170) (1,191) (1,361) Benefits paid from Company assets (499) (3,646) (4,145) (862) (3,018) (3,880) Benefits paid from funds assets (36,684) (15,576) (52,260) (40,157) (14,276) (54,433) Employee contributions – 105 105 – 115 115 Effect of transfers (34) – (34) (38) – (38) Changes in the scope of consolidation (98) – (98) – – – Currency adjustments – 7,079 7,079 – 11,456 11,456 Defined benefit obligations at end of year 800,024 337,982 1,138,006 763,286 294,637 1,057,923 Changes in the market value of plan assets 2019 2018 (EUR thousand) Domestic International Total Domestic International Total Plan assets at start of year 442,187 240,051 682,238 479,125 241,987 721,112 Interest on plan assets 8,795 10,032 18,827 9,501 8,310 17,811 Plan expenses paid from plan assets recog­ nized in profit or loss – (1,081) (1,081) – (1,446) (1,446) Remeasurements Return on plan assets not included in net interest expense/income 29,496 31,556 61,052 (12,841) (14,646) (27,487) Difference between plan expenses expected and recognized in profit or loss – (358) (358) – 420 420 Employer contributions 9,003 2,118 11,121 6,559 10,272 16,831 Consolidated Financial Statements Employee contributions – 105 105 – 115 115 Benefits paid (36,684) (15,576) (52,260) (40,157) (14,276) (54,433) Currency adjustments – 5,682 5,682 – 9,315 9,315 Plan assets at end of year 452,797 272,529 725,326 442,187 240,051 682,238 and Notes Group Report 2019 205 Investing plan assets to cover future pension obligations generated actual returns of EUR 79,879 thousand (2018: actual expense of EUR 9,676 thousand).

Before deferred taxes, the cumulative amount is actuarial losses of EUR 499,030 thousand (2018: EUR 462,105 thousand). The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 came to EUR 65,508 thousand (2018: EUR 52,413 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,595 thousand (2018: EUR 1,630 thousand) of the current service cost and EUR 2,398 thousand (2018: EUR 2,076 thousand) of the interest expense. Group Report 2019 207 Sensitivity analysis Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to the following material risks: Interest rate risk For defined contribution plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspondingly strong impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations. Inflation risk By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan is frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made. Longevity risk The granting of life-long pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pensioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally averages out across all pension plan members and only comes into play if life expectancy is greater than expected. The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial assumptions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

Defined contribution plans Under defined contribution plans, the Company pays into a state or private pension fund voluntarily or in accordance with statutory or contractual stipulations. It has no obligation to pay further contributions. There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia. Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on most payments into the fund, although it is also possible to pay contributions from taxed income and receive the investment earnings free of tax; the investment risk is borne by employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are similar to 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. Since July 1, 2014, CIMIC in Australia has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted on top-up contributions.

Certain leases contain extension options by the Group up to one year before the end of the non-cancelable contract period. Where practicable, the Group seeks to include extension options in new leases to provide operational flexibility. The extension options held are exercisable only by the Group and not by the lessors. The Group assesses at lease commencement whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension options, and where it is reasonably certain, the extension period has been included in the lease liability. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within its control. Certain lease contracts may include an option to buy-out the asset at the end of the lease term or include contingent rental guarantees where the Group could be exposed to the variability of returns in relation to return conditions at lease expiry. The Group will include the payments for the contingent rental guarantee or the buy-out option only if it is reasonably certain that the payment will occur at the end of the lease term. The Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within its control. The maturity analysis of lease liabilities is shown in Note 34. 31. Trade payables and other liabilities Consolidated Financial Statements Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 (In Tsd.

Trade payables include payables to equity-accounted companies in the amount of EUR 4,809 thousand (2018: EUR 10,906 thousand). Group Report 2019 213 The EUR 1,711,755 thousand (2018 restated: EUR 1,454,302 thousand) contract liabilities represent construction contracts with a net negative balance in favor of customers where progress payments received exceed incurred contract costs including a pro rata allocation of contract net profit. Other liabilities are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 (restated) (EUR thousand) Non-current Current Non-current Current Liabilities to employees – 78,345 – 84,145 Deferred income 48,796 45,893 20,417 25,695 Tax liabilities (excluding income taxes) – 42,535 – 48,608 Liabilities under derivative financial instruments 10,814 7,896 – 747 Social insurance liabilities – 2,155 – 2,412 Sundry other liabilities 138 40,023 100 237,464 59,748 216,847 20,517 399,071 Deferred income mainly comprises insurance premiums received in advance for subsequent years (these are reversed to income over the life of the policies) and rental payments. Sundry other current liabilities in 2018 included EUR 198,777 thousand in liabilities to clients of the Turner Group that are accounted for in provisions for project losses as of December 31, 2019. 32. Current income tax liabilities The EUR 43,983 thousand (2018: EUR 12,955 thousand) in current income tax liabilities comprises amounts payable to domestic and foreign tax authorities. EUR 1,477 thousand of this amount relates to prior periods (2018: EUR 37,952 thousand). Other disclosures 33. Basic and diluted earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the Group share of profit after tax attributable to the shares by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not have any dilutive effect. Diluted and basic earnings per share are consequently identical. 2019 2018 (restated) Consolidated Financial Statements Profit after tax attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR thousand) (206,247) 542,995 Number of shares in circulation in thousands (weighted average) 70,620 65,444 Earnings per share attributable to HOCHTIEF shareholders (EUR) (2.92) 8.30 and Notes Dividend per share (EUR) 4.98 Proposed dividend per share (EUR) 5.80 214 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 34. Reporting on financial instruments Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative. Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of financial assets classified in the at fair value through profit or loss category and in the at fair value through other comprehensive income category are determined with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, using accepted valuation methods. Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost. According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other assets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for the hedging of existing transactions and in asset management. Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet; the maximum risk of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted for with impairment losses or expected credit losses. Risk management strategy All finance activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial directive. This is fleshed out by function-specific operating work instructions on issues such as currency and collateral management. These lay down the risk management strategy and the principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk. The primary objective of financial risk management is to safeguard Group liquidity at all times. For the HOCHTIEF Group, liquidity not only means solvency in the strict sense, but also the long-term availability of the financial headroom needed for the basic operating business (such as collateral management/bank guarantees). Safeguarding liquidity at all times therefore requires integrated management of all Group financial resources, including its credit standing and hence borrowing capacity. A further objective is to minimize financial risks affecting the value and profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group (currency, interest rate, exchange rate, and commodity price risks of all kinds, as well as counterparty risks). Consolidated Financial Statements The HOCHTIEF Group’s operating business gives rise to new or changing financial risk exposures all the time. Risk minimization therefore does not mean excluding all financial risk, but substantially reducing, within specified bounds, financial risk exposures quantifiable at any time. This serves to ensure rapid response and adaptation capability in the event of unforeseen situations. and Notes Group Report 2019 215 Management of liquidity risk HOCHTIEF uses largely centralized liquidity structures—notably cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among other things to avoid cash flow bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of the marketable securities and loans portfolios. The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guarantees issued by the Group. The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst-case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables). These cover most of the cash outflows shown. Maximum payments as of December 31, 2019 (EUR thousand) 2020 2021 2022–2023 after 2023 Total Non-derivative financial liabilities 8,822,915 284,950 624,846 2,130,254 11,862,965 Lease liabilities 255,879 488,766 30,238 9,972 784,855 Derivative financial instruments 7,896 33 – 10,780 18,709 Loan commitments and financial ­guarantees 30,074 511 5,881 4,609 41,075 9,116,764 774,260 660,965 2,155,615 12,707,604 Maximum payments as of December 31, 2018 (restated) (EUR thousand) 2019 2020 2021-2022 after 2022 Total Non-derivative financial liabilities 7,058,120 999,157 408,174 869,290 9,334,741 Lease liabilities 245,921 486,545 36,892 12,164 781,522 Derivative financial instruments 747 – – – 747 Loan commitments and financial ­guarantees 73,358 – – – 73,358 Consolidated Financial Statements 7,378,146 1,485,702 445,066 881,454 10,190,368 In addition, Group liquidity is adequately secured for the long term with cash in hand and on deposit, marketable securities holdings, and undrawn revolving credit facilities. The following table shows the main liquidity instruand Notes ments: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Cash in hand and on deposit 3,181,857 2,489,689 Marketable securities 1,432,074 1,150,408 Undrawn revolving credit facilities (nominal) 2,986,464 2,682,008 7,600,395 6,322,105 Undrawn guarantee facilities 1,777,635 1,459,432 216 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements No refinancing risk is currently seen with regard to the long-term guarantee and credit facilities in light of the broad international syndication in each instance, the refinancing of the syndicated credit and guarantee facility ahead of schedule in August 2017, and the early second extension to the term of the syndicated credit and guarantee facility in July 2019 until mid-2024. The authorized capital in the amount of up to EUR 65,752 thousand, the authorized capital II in the amount of up to EUR 24,675 thousand, and the conditional capital in the amount of up to EUR 46,080 thousand provide appropriate scope for raising additional capital as needed. Financial assets and financial liabilities are presented net in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts. There must also be an intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the amount of EUR 116,724 thousand (2018: EUR 51,973 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 8,565 thousand (2018: EUR 19,297 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net amount of EUR 108,159 thousand (2018: EUR 32,676 thousand). The Group enters into various factoring agreements with banks and financial institutions. These agreements only relate to certified receivables, acknowledged by the client with payment only subject to the passage of time. The factoring of these receivables is done on a non-recourse basis for which the Group may incur a fee in certain instances. The amounts are de-recognised where risks and rewards of the receivables have been transferred. The level of non-recourse factoring across the Group was EUR 1.7 billion as at 31 December 2019, consistent with December 31, 2018. The Group also enters into supply chain finance arrangements with financial institutions for suppliers which may elect to receive early payment for goods and services to improve their liquidity. The terms of the arrangements mirror normal credit terms and do not modify the original liability, therefore the amounts continue to be classified within trade and other payables. The level of supply chain finance across the Group was EUR 656,3 million as at 31 December 2019 (2018: EUR 466,8 million). Management of currency risk HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (transaction risk) arising from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group company concerned in each instance. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. The prospective effectiveness between the hedged item and the hedging instrument has been confirmed for all hedging relationships using the critical terms match method. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk from foreign currency transactions. Consolidated Financial Statements Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. A binding guideline clarifies their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out under a binding, Group-wide financial directive. As a matter of policy, the counterparties for derivatives and Notes entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. Group Report 2019 217 The following table shows the fair values and nominal values of currency derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Assets Forward exchange contracts/cross currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 7,518 5,476 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 3,928 4,134 11,446 9,610 Liabilities and s ­ harehold­ers’ equity Forward exchange contracts/cross currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 18,672 670 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 6 77 18,678 747 Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income (11,742) 319 of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss 4,814 6,383 Nominal amounts Forward exchange contracts/cross currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 522,423 303,106 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 311,813 262,504 Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) 115 26 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 21 14 Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When interpreting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. The average hedging rates for forward exchange contracts are 1.1040 EUR/USD and 4.435 EUR/PLN. Consolidated Financial Statements In the case of cross-currency interest rate swaps, the cross-currency basis spreads that are part of the hedging instrument are not included in the hedge and HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft accounts for the cost of hedging in other comprehensive income. and Notes The table below shows both the reconciliation of the cash flow hedge reserve and the reconciliation of the cost of hedging in which the non-designated cross-currency basis spreads that are part of the cross-currency interest rate swaps are included.

Two apand Notes proaches are used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest rate risk from non-derivative financial instruments on the assets and liabilities sides. The second method is to use interest rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual financing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. The prospective effectiveness between the hedged item and the hedging instrument has been confirmed for all hedging relationships using the critical terms match method. As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and a guideline, and derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. As a matter of policy, the counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. Group Report 2019 219 The following table shows the fair values and nominal values of interest rate derivatives, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Assets Interest rate futures/Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 52 – 52 – Liabilities and s ­ harehold­ers’ equity Interest rate futures/Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 32 – 32 – Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income – – of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss (107) (374) Nominal amounts Interest rate futures/Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 50,481 – Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) 19 – The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a one percentage point change in the respective market interest rate would have had on equity and profit.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital markets at an early stage and take appropriate action. The changes relative to the prior year result from ongoing active portfolio management as part of Group-wide risk management. Derivatives are used to control other price risk only in exceptional instances. The following table shows the fair values and nominal values of equity options and stock forward contracts, changes in their fair values, and their maximum remaining maturities: (EUR thousand) Dec. 31, 2019 Dec. 31, 2018 Assets Equity options and stock forward contracts for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – 3,185 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – 46,890 – 50,075 Liabilities and sharehold­ers’ equity – – Changes in fair value of derivatives held for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized in other comprehensive income – (1,431) of derivatives held for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – recognized immediately in profit or loss – 1,776 Nominal amounts Equity options and stock forward contracts for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – – for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – – Maximum remaining maturity (months) for hedging purposes (cash flow hedge accounting) – 3 for hedging purposes (no cash flow hedge accounting) – 108 The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on HOCHTIEF Group equity and profit that would result from a 10% fluctuation in the market value of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.

The carrying amount of securities subject to the overlay approach as of December 31, 2019 amounts to EUR 33,271 thousand (2018: EUR 242,164 thousand). Changes in fair value recognized through other comprehensive income in the reporting period amounted to EUR 11,776 thousand (2018: negative EUR 10,587 thousand). Group Report 2019 221 Management of credit risk The HOCHTIEF Group is exposed to credit risk from operations and from certain financing activities. HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional level. For trade receivables, using the simplified approach, expected credit losses can be determined in accordance with IFRS 9 on the basis of loss rates calculated from historical and projected data, taking into account the client and the regional economic environment. The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, minimizing the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maximum risk exposure on financial guarantees issued by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF. The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2019, the maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 41,075 thousand (2018: EUR 73,358 thousand). No recourse has ever been made to these guarantees provided by HOCHTIEF and, in light of the financial circumstances, none is currently anticipated for the future. HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obligations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF work instruction. Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements. The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted. HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (such as rating agencies) to assess credit standings where possible. The fair values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they generally cannot be measured reliably. The following tables show the gross carrying amounts, as of the balance sheet date and in the prior year, of trade receivables past due and not past due for which impairment losses are recognized either on the basis of an impairment matrix (simplified approach) or without an impairment matrix. Contract assets are included in trade receivables. The fact of payments being more than 30 days past due does not imply an increase in credit risk.

Receipt of payment depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the trade receivables that are past due are from public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings, meaning that they are mostly subject to low credit risk. The opening balance of impairments on trade receivables at the beginning of the reporting period was EUR 169,076 thousand. Changes within the 2019 reporting period relate to additions, reversals, utilizations, exchange rate adjustments, and consolidation changes, and come to a total of EUR -3,965 thousand (2018: EUR -8,468 thousand), as a result of which impairments on trade receivables amounted to EUR 165,111 thousand as of December 31, 2019. In percentage terms, the loss rate on the gross carrying amount of trade receivables is 2.68% (2018: 3.37%). Most of these expected credit losses on trade receivables consist of impairments typical for the industry. Impairments of contract assets in this context are classified as non-material. The following tables show, for 2019 and 2018, changes in the expected credit losses (ECLs) on financial assets that come under the general impairment model in accordance with IFRS 9: Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Total 12-month ECL lifetime ECL lifetime ECL gross carrying net carrying (EUR thousand) amount amount Financial receivables Jan. 1, 2019 14,472 24,453 372,727 411,652 Remeasurement (changed measurement parameters) 188 (7,364) (347,437) (354,613) Transfer to stage 1 – – – – Transfer to stage 2 – – – – Transfer to stage 3 – – – – Newly acquired/issued financial assets – – – – Repaid or derecognized financial assets – – 699 699 Other changes* 14 – 2,977 2,991 Dec. 31, 2019 14,674 17,089 28,966 60,729 Other current receivables and other current assets Jan. 1, 2019 225 – – 225 Remeasurement (changed measurement parameters) 110 – – 110 Transfer to stage 1 – – – – Transfer to stage 2 – – – – Transfer to stage 3 – – – – Newly acquired/issued financial assets – – – – Repaid or derecognized financial assets (1) – – (1) Consolidated Financial Statements Other changes* – – – – Dec. 31, 2019 334 – – 334 *The other changes relate to exchange rate adjustments and consolidation changes. and Notes Group Report 2019 223 Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3 Total 12-month ECL lifetime ECL lifetime ECL gross carrying net carrying (EUR thousand) amount amount Financial receivables Jan. 1, 2018 21,270 25,313 377,428 424,011 Remeasurement (changed measurement parameters) 2,252 2,337 45,302 49,891 Transfer to stage 1 – – – – Transfer to stage 2 – – – – Transfer to stage 3 – – – – Newly acquired/issued financial assets – – – – Repaid or derecognized financial assets (9,042) (3,197) (12,239) Other changes* (8) – (50,003) (50,011) Dec. 31, 2018 14,472 24,453 372,727 411,652 Other current receivables and other current assets Jan. 1, 2018 177 – – 177 Remeasurement (changed measurement parameters) 47 – – 47 Transfer to stage 1 – – – – Transfer to stage 2 – – – – Transfer to stage 3 – – – – Newly acquired/issued financial assets 1 – – 1 Repaid or derecognized financial assets (1) – – (1) Other changes* 1 – – 1 Dec. 31, 2018 225 – – 225 *The other changes relate to exchange rate adjustments and consolidation changes.

The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as to maximize shareholder returns. The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (defined as current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and equity. The overall capital risk management strategy did not change in the reporting year compared with the prior year.

Non-current securities are measured at fair value through profit or loss at fair value; as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value. Where insufficient recent information is available for fair value measurement of shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests, cost may be used as an appropriate estimate of fair value. In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value as set out below, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. The following three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts. Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair value determined by business valuation.

This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3. and Notes The Group’s forward exchange contracts are not traded in active markets. The fair values of these contracts are estimated using a valuation technique that maximises the use of observable market inputs, e.g. market exchange and interest rates. Therefore they are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 228 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements In Level 3, the fair value of investments in unlisted entities is measured using generally recognized valuation techniques based on discounted cash flow analysis. The unobservable inputs used for this purpose are an internal rate of return of 9%, growth rates of between 2.5% and 3.0%, and required discount rates of between 10% and 15%. Call options were measured using Monte Carlo simulation. Assumed inputs were an expected exercise period of one to ten years, an EBITDA multiplier of six to twelve times, and a 15% discount factor. Changes in the unobservable inputs had no material effect on total comprehensive income, total assets and liabilities, or equity.

The facility with an initial term to August 2022 and extension options of up to two more years was extended to August 2024 on the basis of the second extension option in July 2019. The EUR 1.2 billion guarantee facility tranche was drawn in the amount of EUR 859 million as of the reporting date (2018: EUR 944 million). A new USD 300 million syndicated guarantee and credit facility in favor of Flatiron Construction Corporation and several subsidiaries was agreed with an international banking syndicate in August 2019. The facility, which runs to August 2024, replaces the old CAD 350 million syndicated guarantee and credit facility that ran to November 2019. Consolidated Financial Statements Drawings on the facility as of the reporting date were USD 6 million as a result of guarantees issued (2018: guarantees of CAD 75.7 million). Likewise in August 2019, HOCHTIEF, again acting as guarantor, entered into a bilateral guarantee facility together with Flatiron Construction Corporation for CAD 100 million. Drawings on this total EUR 58 million (CAD 84 million) as of the reporting date. and Notes Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 83,624 thousand (2018: EUR 106,331 thousand) and mostly relates to the CIMIC Group in the amount of EUR 83,107 thousand (2018: EUR 106,162 thousand). In the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division, there are additionally cash call commitments to non-consolidated entities in the amount of EUR 9,566 thousand (2018: EUR 9,433 thousand). Legal disputes HOCHTIEF Group companies are involved in various legal disputes and arbitration proceedings in the context of their operating activities. As currently assessed, however, HOCHTIEF does not anticipate that the disputes and arbitration proceedings will have any material adverse impact on the Group’s business and financial situation. 230 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 36. Segment reporting HOCHTIEF’s structure reflects the operating focus of the business as well as the Group’s presence in key national and international regions and markets. Segmental reporting in the HOCHTIEF Group is based on the Group’s divisional operations. The breakdown mirrors the Group’s internal reporting systems. The Group’s reportable segments (divisions) are as follows: HOCHTIEF Americas encompasses the construction management and construction activities of operational units in the USA and Canada; HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific pools the construction activities, contract mining and services in the Asia-Pacific region; HOCHTIEF Europe brings together the core business in Europe as well as selected other regions and designs, develops, builds, operates, and manages real estate and infrastructure; Abertis Investment comprises the investment in Spanish toll road operator Abertis Infraestructuras S.A., which is accounted for as a separate segment from 2019. It was previously presented under Corporate and the prior-year segment information has been restated accordingly. Corporate comprises Corporate Headquarters, other activities not assignable to the separately listed divisions, including management of financial resources and insurance activities, plus consolidation effects.

Essen, February 10, 2020 HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft The Executive Board Marcelino Fernández Verdes Peter Sassenfeld Consolidated Financial Statements José Ignacio Legorburo Escobar Nikolaus Graf von Matuschka and Notes 244 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Translated Reproduction of the Independent Auditor’s Report Based on the results of our audit, we have issued the following unqualified audit opinion: Independent Auditor’s Report To HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report Opinions We have audited the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, and its subsidiaries (the Group), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2019, and the consolidated statement of earnings, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the financial year from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. In addition, we have audited the combined management report (in the following: “group management report”) of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft for the financial year from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of those components of the group management report specified in the „Other Information“ section of our auditor‘s report. In the section “Corporate Governance and Compliance”, the group management report contains a cross-reference to the Company’s website. In accordance with German legal requirements, we have not audited the content of this cross-reference or the information to which it refers. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the IFRSs as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB [Handelsgesetzbuch: German Commercial Code] and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, and financial position of the Group as at 31 December 2019, and of its financial performance for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2019, and Consolidated Financial Statements the accompanying group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position. In all material respects, this group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future develand Notes opment. Our opinion on the management report does not cover the content of those components of the management report specified in the „Other Information“ section of the auditor‘s report. In the section “Corporate Governance and Compliance”, the management report contains a cross-reference to the Company’s website. Our opinion on the management report does not cover the content of this cross-reference or the information to which it refers. Pursuant to Section 322 (3) sentence 1 HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. Group Report 2019 245 Basis for the Opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation (No 537/2014; referred to subsequently as „EU Audit Regulation“) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer [Institute of Public Auditors in Germany] (IDW). Our responsibilities under those requirements and principles are further described in the „Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report“ section of our auditor’s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article 10 (2)(f) of the EU Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services prohibited under Article 5 (1) of the EU Audit Regulation. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from 1 January to 31 December 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The recognition of revenue from customer-specific construction contracts For details of the accounting and valuation principles applied, please refer to the explanations in the section “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” as well as “judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies” in the accounting and valuation principles in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Information on the amount and breakdown of revenue can be found in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the section „Explanatory Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings“ under „Sales“ (Note 2). THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK Consolidated Financial Statements The group’s sales in the financial year 2019 amount to EUR 25,852 million. A material part of the business activity of HOCHTIEF Group refers to the handling of customer-specific construction contracts. These primarily relate to the construction business, construction project management and contract and Notes mining. Revenue is recognized for contractual revenues and contract modifications, i.e. contract variations and additional claims. In accordance with the degree of completion as a measure of the transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized over time, including the proportional profit or loss from the respective construction contract. 246 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The most significant estimates of the legal representatives in this connection relate to: • Determination of the degree of completion as ratio of work already performed to the entire forecasted order volume; • Estimation of the entire contract performance and total contract costs including forcasted cost increases; • Estimate of the total contract revenue, taking into account contract variations and subsequent claims for which it is highly probable that they will not be cancelled to a significant extent in the future The Group’s significant markets are located in Australia, the US and in Europe. Various and to some extent complex contractual conditions are agreed by the Group’s companies for their worldwide activities. Due to the use of varying contractual agreements in different markets for customers and estimates in assessing the timing of the transfer of control to the customer, there is financial statement risk that the amount of accrued revenues at the balance sheet date is inaccurate. OUR AUDIT APPROACH On the basis of our process understanding we have gained, we have assessed the design and implementation of the internal controls identified, in particular relating to the accurate determination of the degree of completion of projects. Insofar as we have relied on the identified controls, we have also assessed their effectiveness. Our focus is on the controls for approving project plans and reviewing project invoices. The most significant estimates, such as the existence of a legally enforceable claim for payment including an appropriate margin for services already rendered as well as the selection of the measurement basis and the estimation of the degree of completion, were assessed for appropriateness on the basis of contracts selected on a risk-oriented approach. Key criteria for the risk-oriented selection included the project history with regard to the total contract size, the order volume in the current fiscal year, the amount of revenue from contract modifications and the forecasted project result as well as changes in project margin recorded or expected in the current fiscal year. Consolidated Financial Statements In addition, our audit procedures included obtaining an understanding of the underlying contracts, interviewing project managers on the development of the projects, corroborating the Company’s estimates of the probability of occurrence of legal contract risks, reviewing the incurred and forecasted costs by means of respective evidence, and Notes and examining the anticipated losses from loss-making projects. Furthermore, we obtained evidence from third parties for selected projects and, with the involvement of our engineers, visited construction sites. On the basis of the knowledge previously obtained, we assessed the appropriateness of the determination of the respective degree of completion as well as the accounting for construction contracts within the balance sheet and the statement of earnings. Group Report 2019 247 OUR OBSERVATIONS The HOCHTIEF Group’s approach to to recognizing sales on an accrual basis is appropriate. The assumptions and methods underlying the accounting are overall appropriate. Recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill For details of the accounting and valuation principles applied, please refer to the explanations in the sections “intangible assets” and “impairment losses” in the accounting and valuation principles in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Information on the amount of goodwill can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the explanations to the consolidated balance sheet in the section “intangible assets” (Note 13). Information on the economic development of the business segments can be found in the combined management report in the section “segment reporting”. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK As at 31 December 2019, goodwill totaled EUR 1,049 million thereby comprising 66% as of the Group’s equity and thus having a significant impact on the net assets. In 2019, the company did not identify any need for impairment loss. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the level of the operating segments (Divisions) HOCHTIEF Americas, HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific and HOCHTIEF Europe. The carrying amount is thereby compared with the recoverable amount of the respective operating segments. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment is recorded. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less the costs to sell and value in use of the operating segment. The recoverable amount of the Division HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific is determined on the basis of the fair value derived from the stock market value of CIMIC Group Ltd., North Sydney/Australien (hereunder briefly „CIMIC“). The impairment test for the Divisions HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe was carried out as at 31 March 2019, while the impairment test for the Division HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific was performed as at 31 December 2019. The goodwill impairment test is complex and is based on a number of judgemental assumptions. These include, among others, the expected sales and cost development, which is also dependent on new projects of the busiConsolidated Financial Statements ness segments for the next three years, and the discount rate used. There is the risk for the financial statements that the required impairments were not sufficiently recorded. and Notes OUR AUDIT APPROACH With the support of our valuation specialists, we assessed, among other things, the appropriateness of the significant assumptions as well as the Company’s valuation models. This included a discussion of the expected development of the business and results as well as of the assumed underlying long-term growth rates with those responsible for the planning process. In addition, reconciliations were made with other internally available forecasts as well as the budget for the HOCHTIEF group approved by the board and acknowledged by the Supervisory Board. Furthermore, we assessed the consistency of the assumptions with external market assessments. 248 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements We also assessed the Company’s planning accuracy by comparing projections for previous financial years with the actual results realized and analyzed deviations. We have compared the assumptions and parameters underlying the discount rate – in particular the risk-free rate, the market risk premium and the beta factor – with own assumptions and publicly available information. To provide for the mathematical accuracy of the valuation models utilised, we recalculated the Company’s calculations on the basis of elements selected in a risk-orientated manner. To reflect the existing uncertainty with respect to forecasts as well as the earlier valuation date for the impairment test of the Divisions HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe, we have assessed possible changes of the updated planning and the discount rate on the recoverable amount as at the balance sheet date by calculating alternative scenarios and comparing these with the Company’s valuation results (sensitivity analysis). As the recoverable amount for the Division HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific is determined using the fair value derived from the stock market value of CIMIC, we have compared the stock market prices used by the HOCHTIEF Group with publicly available market data as of the balance sheet date. OUR OBSERVATIONS The underlying valuation models used in the impairment test of goodwill are appropriate and consistent with the applicable accounting principles. The Company’s assumptions and parameters underlying the valuation are overall appropriate. The recognition and measurement of obligations and impairment losses on assets in relation to the Middle East exit We refer to the information on the obligations and asset impairment recognized under „Provision and asset impairment in relation to the Middle East exit“ in the notes to the consolidated financial statements (Note 8). In addition, explanations are provided in the Group Management Report in the section „Financial Review”. Consolidated Financial Statements THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK Following the completion of the review of its strategic options regarding its financial investment BIC Contracting and Notes LLC (“BICC”), HOCHTIEF’s majority holding CIMIC announced on 23 January 2020 to exit the Middle East region. Expenses totaling EUR 1,695 million were recognized in this connection, mostly comprising EUR 740 million in impairment losses on assets, in particular shareholder loans granted, and EUR 925 million in recognition of obligations for commitments to provide financial support. Loan receivables initially measured at amortised cost must be reduced in value if it is not likely that they can be realised in full or in part. The assessment of the realizability of loan receivables is complex and is based on a number of discretionary assumptions. In addition to the estimation of the basic collectability, these include the timing and amount of future cash flows. Group Report 2019 249 Commitments to provide financial assistance must be recorded as liabilities if the general and specific recognition criteria of the relevant regulations are met. The measurement of significant obligations depends to a large extent on the estimates and assumptions made by the Company‘s legal representatives, particularly with regard to the utilization of these financial commitments and the probability of an outflow of funds. The risks for the consolidated financial statements are that the criteria for the recognition of obligations and asset impairment in connection with the the Middle East exit are not met or are incorrectly assessed. OUR AUDIT APPROACH To examine the conditions for recognizing obligations and impairment losses in connection with the Middle East exit, we conducted interviews with legal representatives and acknowledged internal and external communications, in particular the ad hoc announcements by CIMIC and HOCHTIEF dated 23 January 2020. With regard to the assessment of the realizability of loan receivables, we have taken into account the assessment of the legal representatives with regard to collectibility as well as the timing and amount of future cash flows. When examining the valuation of the obligations, we assessed the estimates and assumptions made by the legal representatives of the company, in particular with regard to the claims arising from the financial commitments granted and the probability of payment. OUR OBSERVATIONS The assumptions of the legal representatives are overall appropriate. Recognition of deferred tax assets in connection with the Middle East exit With regard to the accounting and valuation methods applied, we refer to the explanations in the section „Deferred taxes“ in the accountingand valuation methods in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Information on the amount of deferred tax assets recognised can be found in the notes to the consolidated financial stateConsolidated Financial Statements ments in the sections „Provision and asset impairment in relation to the Middle East exit“ (Note 8), „Income taxes“ (Note 11) and „Deferred taxes“ (Note 21). THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RISK and Notes As of 31 December 2019, the Company has capitalized deferred tax assets of EUR 550 million in connection with the recognition of obligations and asset impairments resulting from the Middle East exit. In this respect, we refer to our comments on the key audit matter “The recognition and measurement of obligations and impairment losses on assets in relation to the Middle East exit.” In accounting for deferred tax assets, the HOCHTIEF Group estimates the extent to which existing deferred tax assets can be utilized in subsequent reporting periods. Realization of these claims is conditional on sufficient future taxable income being generated. If there are reasonable doubts as to the future usability of the deferred tax assets calculated, deferred tax assets are not recognised or deferred tax assets already recognised are written down. 250 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The recognition of deferred tax assets depends to a large extent on the estimates and assumptions made by the legal representatives with regard to the future development of CIMIC as well as the fulfillment of tax law requirements and is therefore subject to significant uncertainties. The risk to the Consolidated Financial Statements is that HOCHTIEF‘s assessment may not be appropriate and that the recognized deferred tax assets may not be fully recoverable. OUR AUDIT APPROACH In order to assess the tax issues, we involved our tax specialists in the audit and relied on an external expert. We assessed the competence, skills and objectivity of the external expert and evaluated the content of statements made. We have assessed the appropriateness of the tax calculations and their compliance with IFRS and national tax legislation. We have had HOCHTIEF‘s assessment of CIMIC‘s future development explained to us by its legal representatives. We have assessed the recoverability of deferred tax assets on the basis of the Company‘s internal forecasts of future taxable income and have critically reviewed the underlying assumptions. OUR OBSERVATIONS The assumptions of the legal representatives are overall appropriate. Other Information Management and the Supervisory Board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the following components of the Group management report. Its content has not been audited by us: • the combined corporate governance statement of the Company and the Group, which is referred to in the Group management report, and Consolidated Financial Statements • information extraneous to management reports and marked as unaudited The other information also includes the separate non-financial Group report and the other parts of the Annual Reand Notes port (Group Report). The other information does not include the consolidated financial statements, the Group management report information audited for content and our auditor‘s report thereon. Our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. Group Report 2019 251 In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information • is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited group management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or • otherwise appears to be materially misstated. In accordance with our engagement we have performed a separate limited assurance engagement on separate non-financial group report. With regard to the type, scope and results of this limited assurance engagement we refer to our audit opinion dated 10 February 2020. Responsibilities of Management and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Group Management Report Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply, in all material respects, with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and financial performance of the Group. In addition, management is responsible for such internal control as they have determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. They also have the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, they are responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, management is responsible for the preparation of the group management report that, as a whole, provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportuniConsolidated Financial Statements ties and risks of future development. In addition, management is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as they have considered necessary to enable the preparation of a group management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the group management report. and Notes The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report. 252 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the group management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group’s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section 317 HGB and the EU Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (IDW) will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this group management report. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the group management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of these systems. Consolidated Financial Statements • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by management and the reasonableness of estimates made by management and related disclosures. • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on and Notes the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the group management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective opinions. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern. Group Report 2019 253 • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section 315e (1) HGB. • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the group management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our opinions. • evaluate the consistency of the group management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with [German] law, and the view of the Group’s position it provides. • perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by management in the group management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by management as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of Consolidated Financial Statements most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. and Notes 254 Group Report 2019 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes: Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Further Information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation We were elected as group auditor at the annual general meeting on 7 May 2019.

This text is a translation of the Independent Assurance Report issued in Aktiengesellschaft, Essen German, whereas the German text is authoritative. We have been engaged to perform an independent limited assurance engagement on the qualitative and quantitative disclosures on sustainability performance in the section “Sustainability HOCHTIEF” in the group report 2019 combined financial report and sustainability report (further “Sustainability Report”) for the period January 1 to December 31, 2019 of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen (further “Company”). It was not part of our engagement to review product and service related information, references to external websites and information sources, as well as future-related statements in the Sustainability Report. Management’s Responsibility The legal representatives of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft are responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft applies the principles and standard disclosures of the Standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (option “Core”) as Reporting Criteria (further “Reporting Criteria). The responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the Sustainability Report and the use of assumptions and estimates for individual qualitative and quantitative sustainability disclosures which are reasonable under the circumstances. Furthermore, this responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the Sustainability Report in a way that is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements. Independence and Quality Assurance on the Part of the Auditing Firm We are independent from the company in accordance with the requirements of independence and quality assurance set out in legal provisions and professional pronouncements and have fulfilled our additional professional obligations in accordance with these requirements. Our audit firm applies the legal provisions and professional pronouncements for quality assurance, in particular the Professional Code for German Public Auditors and Chartered Accountants (in Germany) and the quality assurance standard of the German Institute of Public Auditors (Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer, IDW) regarding quality assurance requirements in audit practice (IDW QS 1). Practitioner’s Responsibility It is our responsibility to express a conclusion based on our work performed within a limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Report. Further Information 264 Group Report 2019 We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information” of the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). This standard requires us to plan and perform the assurance engagement to allow us to conclude with limited assurance that no matters have come to our attention that cause us to believe that the Sustainability Report was not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. We do not issue a separate conclusion for each sustainability disclosure. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement and therefore less assurance is obtained than in a reasonable assurance engagement. The choice of audit procedures is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. Within the scope of our engagement, we performed amongst others the following procedures: • Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for the materiality analysis to get an understanding of the process for identifying material topics and respective report boundaries of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft • A risk analysis, including a media research, to identify relevant information on HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft sustainability performance in the reporting period • Evaluation of the design and implementation of the systems and processes for the collection, processing and control of disclosure on environmental, employee and social matters, respect for human rights as well as combatting corruption and bribery matters, including the collection and consolidation of quantitative data • Inquiries of personnel who are responsible for determining disclosures and for compiling the disclosures on concepts, due diligence processes, results and risks, the conduction of internal controls and consolidation of the disclosures • Evaluation of selected internal and external documents • Analytical evaluation of data and trends of quantitative disclosures which are reported by all sites on group level • Assessment of local data collection and reporting processes and reliability of reported data via a sampling survey at the site in Essen (Division Europe) • Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures As described in the Sustainability Report, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft engaged an external provider to perform assessments in order to ensure compliance with company’s requirements concerning sustainability in the area of environmental protection, labor and human rights, fair business practices and supply chain. The adequacy and accuracy of the conclusions from these external assessments were not part of our limited assurance engagement. Further Information Group Report 2019 265 Conclusion Based on the procedures performed and the evidence received, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the sustainability information in Sustainability Report for the period January 1 to December 31, 2019, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
