Royal Unibrew supports national and international trade associations, such as Brewers’ of Europe’s views and guidelines on responsible drinking. We also participate actively in innovation partnerships looking at ways to reduce calorie content in soft drinks. In addition, we support a large variety of sports and health initiatives through sponsorships regionally and locally. In Finland, for example, all beer sponsorships will be converted into 0.0% alcohol beer. Royal Unibrew strives to offer consumers and customers sustainable enjoyment through a broad variety of beverages, complementing the setting/situation whether the individuals find themselves at a music venue, dining with family and friends, exercising, travelling or at other occasions.

Optimizing resource consumption by reducing, reusing and recycling is relevant for all materials, including energy, water and waste (residuals from brewing) both at our production sites but also very importantly in other parts of our value chain such as raw materials, malting, packaging and distribution. Several projects were implemented in 2019 and many will follow in 2020 and beyond. More information is available in “Future proofing Royal Unibrew”. Royal Unibrew’s efficiency on energy per produced volume has improved by 12% compared to 2015 irrespective of the acquisitions in 2018 and 2019. The performance on water consumption has also improved, however, the effect of the recent acquisitions was more significant on our water efficiency than on our energy efficiency.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY MANAGEMENT REPORT 72 People Employee well-being A good working environment is a safe and healthy working environment, and that is a top priority for Royal Unibrew. We focus on minimizing risks and raising awareness about health and safety for all our employees and take preventive measures to avoid employees being worn out and incurring work-related injuries – and we recognize that one accident is one to many. Ensuring well-being and promoting job satisfaction is a priority as well. At most production sites near-misses are registered and followed up daily in order to establishing preventive measures as quickly as possible to avoid accidents. When accidents with or without lost time unfortunately occur, we conduct thorough root cause assessments and implement the necessary improvements. At all production sites, occupational health and safety (OHS) activities are adapted to the local production site and work area. In Denmark, for example, joint OHS discussions, an OHS day as well as courses with focus on stress were carried out in 2019. At group level, project execution in operations includes an OHS assessment. In 2019 and 2020, expansion and capacity driven projects will reduce heavy lifting and improve access for safe operations, maintenance and cleaning further.

Royal Unibrew’s ethics policy and our Code of Conduct provide guidance for our employees, third parties acting on behalf of the Company and suppliers regarding anti-corruption, environment, human rights and labor standards but also GDPR, competition and marketing law.

To ensure this, continuous assessment is made to determine the appropriate capital structure of Royal Unibrew. It is the target that the Group’s net interest-bearing debt should not exceed 2.5 x EBITDA and that an equity ratio of at least 30% should be maintained at year end. At the operational level, continuous efforts are directed at optimising working capital investments. Subject to adequate capacity and capability, investments in production facilities will be limited to replacement of individual components, related to specific products or to optimisation of selected processes as well as maintenance. Commodity risks The commodity risk relates primarily to the purchasing of cans (aluminium), malt (barley), hops and packaging materials (cardboard) as well as energy. The commodity risk is actively hedged commercially and financially in accordance with the Group’s Treasury Policy. The objective of managing Royal Unibrew’s commodity risk is to achieve a smooth and time-differentiated effect of commodity price increases, which is primarily achieved by entering into fixed-price agreements with the relevant suppliers. As regards to the Group’s purchase of cans, financial contracts have been made to hedge the risk of aluminium price increases. Exchange rate changes with respect to the settlement currency of aluminium (USD) are an element of the overall currency risk management. The most significant part of purchases for the next 12 months has, in accordance with Royal Unibrew’s policy, been hedged by entering into supplier agreements and financial contracts. A +/-10% change in the price of aluminium would have a P/L effect at Group level of approx +/DKK 4,2 million (2018: DKK 2 million).

The fair value of the hedging instruments is included in current liabilities under other payables. The derivative financial instruments applied in 2019 and 2018 may all be classified as level-2 instruments in the IFRS fair value hierarchy. The determined fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on observable market data such as yield curves or forward rates. ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 98 Note 3 Financial risk management (continued) Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value and are subsequently remeasured at their fair values. Positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments are included as other receivables and other payables, respectively. Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges of a recognised asset or a recognised liability are recognised in the income statement as are any changes in the value of the hedged asset or the hedged liability. Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income. Income and expenses relating to such hedging transactions are transferred from other comprehensive income on realisation of the hedged item and are recognised in the same entry as the hedged item. For derivative financial instruments which do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, changes in fair values are recognised on a current basis in financial income and expenses in the income statement.

ROYAL UNIBREW ANNUAL REPORT 2019 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 124 Note 25 Acquisition of subsidiaries (continued) Business combinations On acquisition of new enterprises the purchase method is applied, under which the identifiable assets and liabilities of newly acquired enterprises are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition. Upon business combinations, positive differences between cost and fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are recognised as goodwill in intangible assets. At the time of acquisition, goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating units that subsequently form the basis of impairment tests. Goodwill and fair value adjustments in connection with the acquisition of a foreign enterprise with a functional currency that differs from the presentation currency of the Group are treated as assets and liabilities belonging to the foreign entity and are translated to the functional currency of the foreign entity at the exchange rates at the dates of transaction. Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries and associates are calculated as the difference between the sales sum and the carrying amount of net assets at the time of sale (including the carrying amount of goodwill) net of expected expenses and adjusted for exchange adjustments previously recognised in equity. Recognition of acquisition of subsidiary Royal Unibrew acquired in 2019 three businesses, Bev.Con ApS (Cult), Bruce Ashley Group Inc. and SIA Bauskas Alus by purchasing shares in the companies wherein the businesses were established. The businesses assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities have been recognised under the purchase method in the Financial Statements of Royal Unibrew. The key assets of the businesses are goodwill, trademarks, customer relations, property, plant and equipment, inventories, receivables, deferred tax and payables. Especially with regard to the intangible assets acquired, there are no efficient markets to be used to determine fair value. Management has therefore made an estimate in connection with the calculation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition and has allocated the purchase price on that basis.
