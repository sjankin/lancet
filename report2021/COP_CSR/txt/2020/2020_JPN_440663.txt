While cars may look like hunks of metal, in fact they use a lot of rubber parts. Rubber supplied by Zeon plays an important role in the auto industry. Rubber used around the engine in particular must be highly resistant to oil and high temperatures. Zeon offers specialty rubbers with performance that meets various customer requirements, including acrylic rubber, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber, epichlorohydrin rubber, and hydrogenated nitrile rubber. Of them, Zetpol® hydrogenated nitrile rubber developed with proprietary Zeon technology has received very positive reviews for its heat resistance. Zeon contributes to society with specialty rubbers that improve vehicle performance Raw material rubber such as Zetpol® produced by Zeon gets assembled in cars through rubber compound manufacturers, parts manufacturers, and car manufacturers. With its high heat resistance, Zetpol® improves parts performance, leading to improved vehicle performance and lighter weight.

Improving the performance of one of these properties, however, results in a trade-off of degraded performance for the other properties. Conventional hydrogenated nitrile rubber reduces the carbon–carbon double bonds through hydrogenation to increase heat resistance, but this reduces durability (compression set). Zetpol® specialty cross-linked type adds specialty cross-linking to achieve both heat and compression set resistance. Specialty cross-linked type Adding this cross-linking CH2 CH CH2 CH2 CH2 CH CH CH2 CH point improves performance CN l m n X x Carbon–carbon Specialty Acrylonitrile saturated bond Carbon–carbon unsaturated bond cross-linking point Conventional product CH2 CH CH2 CH2 CH2 CH CH CH2 CN l m n Acrylonitrile Carbon–carbon Carbon–carbon saturated bond unsaturated bond What is compression set, for which Zetpol® is recognized? The sealability of gaskets, packing, and seal materials are evaluated using compression set. Rubber is compressed under high temperature, and its compression set, or the percentage that does not recover its original shape, is measured. Zetpol® Increased production specialty cross-linked type is able to offer improved heat capacity of Zetpol® resistance of 10°C or more over conventional products in specialty cross-linked type compression set. This makes it possible to manufacture To meet the high demand for Zetpol® high-temperature resistant products that have longer life. specialty cross-linked type, the production capacity of the Kawasaki Plant is being increased, with construction scheduled to be completed in September 2019.

Correlation between the SDGs and Zeon’s business activities A large number of people and organizations are involved in the supply chain, from obtaining the raw materials to production and product supply that form Zeon’s business activities. In this process, there are areas where we can exercise our influence. Many of our products are also used in other products, including automobiles and buildings. There are ways in which our value can contribute to resolving issues faced by society. Zeon is a company that provides materials to companies, and we contribute to resolving issues faced by society throughout all of our business activities. A.
