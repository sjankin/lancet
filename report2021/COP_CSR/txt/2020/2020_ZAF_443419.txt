Twelve years on, Woolworths remains deeply committed to procuring all seafood from sustainable fisheries and responsible farming operations through the implementation of our Sustainable Seafood Policy. 2008 2009 2010 During the year, we embarked on a comprehensive review of our Fishing for the Future programme. There have been significant worldwide improvements in seafood sustainability over the past 10 years, but critical risks remain and new challenges such as climate change and ocean plastics pollution are emerging. It has become clear that the global seafood sustainability narrative is changing and that going forward, in addition to considering ocean health aspects, our programme will have to consider a wider set of environmental, social, and economic issues. We also have to integrate seafood sustainability into a broader global food system context and extend the focus of improvement beyond producer practices, to multiple nodes in the seafood value chain. Going forward, we, therefore, intend to address both responsible sourcing and First retailer in SA to sign the Official launch of the programme Introduced several new sustainable responsible consumption as well as focusing on traceability and proactive transparency.
