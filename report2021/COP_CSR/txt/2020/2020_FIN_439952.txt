During the year, Sampo Group signed the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and joined the UN Global Compact. We also introduced new strategies for responsible investment and requirements for investment processes, such as sectorand norms-based screening and active ownership through pooled engagement. These new strategies came into effect in 2020. By joining the Global Compact, we emphasized the Group’s continued support for and commitment to important themes, such as human rights, labor rights, anti-corruption, and the environment, including climate change. We work continuously on integrating the ten principles of the Global Compact into our policies and business practices, and we want to encourage businesses worldwide to embed these matters into their operations. During the year, we also completed a project relating to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Responsible investment management and ­operations are important in managing long-term investment risks and in mitigating potential adverse impacts on the Group’s reputation. Therefore, Sampo Group companies take environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues into account when assessing the security, quality, liquidity, profitability, and availability of investments. Potential investment opportunities are carefully analyzed before any investments are made, and ESG issues are considered along with other factors that might affect the risk/return ratio of separate investments. ESG issues have an impact on the long-term performance, risk, and value of all companies. Taking these issues into consideration in the investment process is an important means of improving the risk-return profile of investments, and it is a critical success factor in investment activities. Depending on the asset class, Group companies use different ESG strategies to ensure the effective consideration and management of investment risks arising from ESG issues. The strategies used include, for example, ESG integration, sector-based screening, norms-based screening, and active ownership.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2019 93 RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBLE RESPONSIBILITY INTRODUCTION BUSINESS MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT APPENDICES CORPORATE CULTURE IN COMMUNITIES AND PRACTICES AND OPERATIONS Carbon Footprint of Investments For Sampo Group companies, investment activities are the most significant way of mitigating climate change. Sampo plc measured the carbon footprint of the Group’s direct equity and fixed income investments again in 2019. The analysis included If, Topdanmark, Mandatum Life, and Sampo plc’s investments at the end of 2019. The carbon footprint calculations included 98.3 per cent of Sampo Group’s total direct equity investments and 84.6 per cent of direct fixed income investments as at 31 December 2019. The equity and fixed income portfolios included in the carbon footprint report had market values of EUR 15,018 million and EUR 2,897 million, respectively. That means that the carbon footprint analysis covered 66.8 per cent of all Sampo Group’s investments at the end of 2019. Global ETFs were used as benchmarks: iShares MSCI World ETF for the equity portfolio, and Xtrackers iBoxx EUR Corporate Bond Yield Plus UCITS ETF for the fixed income portfolio. Both ETFs are well-known, and they have carbon footprints and weighted average carbon intensities that are clear and easy to calculate. However, it should be noted that the benchmarks aim to provide a general baseline for analysis and should only be considered as suggestive. The used ETFs do not directly reflect Sampo Group’s equity or fixed income portfolios. More information on the calculation method is available in Appendix 1: Calculation Principles (page 117).
