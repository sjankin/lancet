Responsible banking Arion Bank is a strongly capitalized bank which provides universal banking services to companies and individuals with the aim of creating future value for the benefit of our customers, shareholders, partners and society as a whole. Arion Bank’s sustainability policy bears the title Together we make good things happen and indicates that the Bank intends to act as a role model by promoting responsible and profitable business practices, which take into account the environment, the economy and the society in which we live and work. Further information on sustainability at Arion Bank and the Bank’s main focuses can be found in Annual and sustainability report 2019. Sustainability at Arion Bank At Arion Bank we aim to ensure that sustainability is part of the Bank's day-to-day activities, its decision-making and processes. At the beginning of 2020 the executive committee of Arion Bank approved six Sustainable Development Goals which the Bank intends to focus on. These goals are number 5 on gender equality; number 7 on affordable and clean energy; number 8 on decent work and economic growth; number 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure; number 12 on responsible consumption and production; and number 13 on climate action. The Bank’s operations, including action on gender equality, our policy and targets on environment and climate issues, support for innovation and the business sector as a whole, state-of-the-art digital services and active participation in the development of the economy closely align with these sustainable development goals. The diagram below shows the main stakeholders and our key sustainability focuses. 1 Our commitments, certifications, qualifications and participation in sustainability UNEP FI and Principles for Responsible Banking – PRB In July 2019 Arion Bank became a signatory to UNEP FI, United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative which is a partnership between United Nations Environment and more than 250 financial institutions across the world working to understand today’s environmental, social and governance challenges. In September Arion Bank became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Banking (PRI) which were devised by UNEP FI and 30 international banks. These principles, presented during the autumn at the start of the UN General Assembly, align banking with international goals and commitments such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Climate Agreement. Arion Bank was one of the first banks to announce its support for the principles, with 130 banks from 49 countries signing up. FURTHER INFORMATION ON ARION BANK’S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PRINCIPLES Forum for climate action and green solutions – Green by Iceland In September 2019 Arion Bank became one of the founding members of a joint business and government forum on climate action and green solutions called Green by Iceland. The role of Green by Iceland is to strengthen the partnership between the business sector and the government in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to bring about carbon neutrality by 2040. The forum will also work with Icelandic companies to market green solutions internationally and to underpin Iceland's reputation as a global sustainability leader. United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment, UN PRI In late 2017 the Bank became a signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN PRI). The principles are designed to help investors understand the effect of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues on investment and thereby encourage signatories to the principles to take non-financial factors into account when making investment decisions. In 2019 the first progress report by the Bank’s Asset Management division on responsible investment was published. For more information on responsible investment see the Asset Management section. 2 UN Global Compact, the UN’s initiative on sustainability Arion Bank has been a signatory to the UN Global Compact, the UN’s initiative on sustainability, since the end of 2016 and we submit a progress report to the UN every year. The compact sets out 10 principles on human rights, the labour market, the environment and anti-corruption. Ministry of Welfare’s equal pay symbol In the autumn of 2018 Arion Bank was awarded the Ministry of Welfare’s equal pay symbol after having been certified by the standards agency BSI á Íslandi, the first Icelandic bank to gain this recognition. The Bank first gained equal pay certification in 2015 and has since undergone a pay assessment annually. The Bank has achieved a great deal in equality issues in recent years and this subject is covered in more detail in the section on Human Resources and Non-financial Information.

This recognition is given following a comprehensive audit by an independent assessor of corporate governance at the Bank, such as governance by the Board of Directors, sub-committees and management. It applies for three years. For further information see the sections on Corporate Governance at Arion Bank and on Nonfinancial Information. Festa – sustainability centre For a number of years Arion Bank has been an active partner of Festa, a sustainability centre. Festa’s role is to add to the expertise on sustainability at companies, institutions and organizations so that they can adopt sustainable business practices. UN Women/UN Global Compact Empowerment Principles The Bank has supported the UN Women/UN Global Compact Empowerment Principles since 2014. These are international declarations and treaties under the auspices of the United Nations which companies and institutions can use as guidelines when implementing responsible working practices, irrespective of geographic location or sector and primarily concern advancing gender equality.

ESG reporting guide for Nasdaq The ESG Reporting Guide for the Nasdaq Nordic and Baltic exchanges provides guidance on data disclosure and the environmental, social and governance impact of listed companies.

For further information see the section on Non-financial Information. 4 Kolviður In 2019 Arion Bank and Kolviður reached an agreement on offsetting the carbon emissions produced by the Bank's activities. Kolviður will fix the carbon in plants and soil through soil reclamation and forestry to offset the carbon emissions resulting from the Bank's activities in 2019. Kolviður is expected to plant up to 5,000 trees for the operating year. This refers to emissions produced, for example, by vehicles used in the Bank's operations, its business premises, waste and business flights. GRI Global Reporting Initiative Global Reporting Initiative has developed a standard which helps companies and institutions report their progress in environmental, social and economic issues in such a way that it enables a direct comparison of data between companies. For the second time the Bank is presenting information on sustainability in the Bank’s operations in accordance with the GRI Core standard. See Arion Bank’s GRI index here.

These goals are number 5 on gender equality; number 7 on affordable and clean energy; number 8 on decent work and economic growth; number 9 on industry, innovation and infrastructure; number 12 on responsible consumption and production; and number 13 on climate action. 5 Sustainability reporting At Arion Bank we aim to ensure that sustainability is part of the Bank's day-to-day activities, its decision-making and processes. Information on sustainability has once again been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative standard, GRI Core, which helps companies and institutions share information relating to sustainability transparently and in a way which enables comparisons.
