To date, our company has never received a staff complaint relating to a violation of Human Rights or a potential risk of their violation. Measurement of outcomes We regularly organize meetings between the employees of our various subsidiaries to encourage mutual respect and cultural exchange, so that, physical distances notwithstanding, they actually get to know each other.

Principle 6: Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Assessment We ensure freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining in our company. Any form of forced or compulsory labour is strictly forbidden. This also applies to child labour: we support its full eradication, in whatever guise, and refrain from engaging business with a company suspected of child labour. Implementation We are strongly committed to ensuring the labour rights of all employees and that all employees are treated and evaluated according to their skills, qualifications and abilities. We remain committed to fostering a harmonious working experience within our corporate culture. Timely and accurate payment of wages and medical benefits are part and parcel of this effort. All employees receive equal training opportunities according to their job. No illegal employment is tolerated. All of our employees are either nationals or hold a valid work permit. Work performed in excess of normal hours is duly compensated.

Principle 8: Businesses should undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility. Principle 9: Businesses should encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Assessment Nowadays, sustainable development, energy saving and environment protection are part of our everyday life. As a company dedicated to renewable energy services, we are particularly aware of environmental issues and try to minimize our impact on the environment. Implementation We encourage all employees to have a responsible attitude towards the environment. They are required to switch off lights and air conditioners when leaving the office. Our entire equipment (computers, printersâ€¦) is low energy. Besides, we separate waste so that it can be recycled. For example, used coffee pads and printer cartridges are returned to a special collection site. We also recycle paper, try to reduce as much as possible the printing of documents and systematically practice double-sided printing whenever possible. Measurement of outcomes Our staff members are more aware of the waste they produce and try to reduce its quantity. If it appears that our environmental policy is not followed by everyone within the company, a general email is sent to all staff members to inform them of the incident and remind them of the different measures enforced by the company to preserve the environment. 5/6 UN Global Compact COP 2020-2021.doc ANTI-CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.

Additionally, we require prospective partners and clients to provide an anticorruption statement before doing business with them. Measurement of outcomes CTE Wind Civil Engineering has never had to face any charges of corruption within the company. Should this occur, the issue would be dealt with immediately with the utmost thoroughness? 6/6
