This is the concept from which the Daiwa House Group started. 001 DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2020 2005 — 50th Anniversary — Guided by our founder’s spirit Group’s symbol message Creating Dreams, Building Hearts The Daiwa House Group symbol—the Endless Heart— represents our vision of building endless emotional connections with each and every one of our customers, as well as the solidarity of the Daiwa House Group. As a group that co-creates value for individuals, communities and people’s lifestyles, we aim to think outside the box and always to create new value in each successive generation. We will continue to pass on the ideals on which the Company was founded, and work to help realize a sustainable society. DaiwaHouseGroup Sustainability Report 2020 002 Business Philosophy Guided by Our Founder’s Spirit Editorial Policy Purpose of Publication  To realize management sustainability, the Daiwa House Group has divided the Sustainability Report 2020 (hereafter “this report”) by three purposes. ➀ Accomplish accountability: As a group that maintains the stance of Co-creating a Brighter Future, we will take accountability for contributions to society and the environment as well as reduction in environmental impacts through business. ➁ Acquire appropriate third-party evaluations: We will disclose information based on requests from stakeholders who are particularly interested in corporate ESG, including corporate assessment agencies, long-term investors, NGOs, and experts. We especially understand that ESG assessment items of corporate assessment agencies are “a collection of the expectations and demands of a global society and stakeholders,” and are aiming to acquire appropriate evaluations. ➂ Utilization for improvements in management: As part of the “third-party checks” that we use in the PDCA cycle of management, we make improvements by implementing the points cited in third-party ESG evaluations and dialogues reported herein. We feed back the results of ESG evaluations through important meetings to persons in the company like the sustainability representatives from each department who were involved in the preparation of this report, in addition to the key officers who have close relationships with stakeholders, department managers and others who were interviewed for this report.

Amid the current situation, in which the global economy is being heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, it is increasingly important for the managements of business corporations to make continuous efforts to raise corporate value from a long-term perspective. During the sixty-five years that have elapsed since the founding of Daiwa House Industry Co., Ltd., we have positioned social issues at the core of our business operations. Now, more than ever, I believe that we must—in every way possible—display the spirit that motivated our establishment, enabling us to tackle social issues head on.

In addition, the impact could manifest not only in the short term, but also over the medium-to-long term. Therefore, we have classified the factors involved in the various changes in the external environment associated with climate change into “transitions” and “physical changes,” estimated the period that will be impacted, and assessed the financial impact at three levels—large, medium, and small—to identify the significant risks and opportunities. Society Moreover, in order to formulate a business strategy that can adapt flexibly to future changes in the external environment based on these risks and opportunities, we evaluated the impact on business using several scenarios. In conducting the scenario analysis, we referred to the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as the scenario for “transitions” and Representative Concentration Pathways Innovation Base (RCP) 8.5 (high-emissions scenario) as the scenario for extreme “physical change” to verify the rationality of our business strategies. In the recently conducted simplified scenario analysis, demand for the net-zero energy houses and buildings provided by Daiwa House Industry as well as its environmental energy business are expected to expand under any scenario, and we confirmed that the revenue growth is likely to exceed any negative financial impact, reaffirming the rationality of our response to risk and the importance of recognizing business opportunities more proactively. The scope of the simple analysis was limited to the significant risks and opportunities for the housing, commercial and office building businesses, and the environmental energy business, which are the Group’s core businesses. Human resources Going forward, we will strive to further expand the businesses included in the scope of analysis as well as to increase the comprehensiveness of the risks and opportunities and refine the scenario analysis. Base ■ Main Risks and Opportunities Related to Climate Change Level of Period of Type Details financial impact impact Technology and • Strengthening of Japan’s Building Energy Efficiency Act Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the household and business sectors is considered a pressing issue in Japan. In light of this, the Building Energy Efficiency Act came into force in April 2016, making it mandatory for large-scale buildings to comply with energy conservation standards starting in April 2017. At present, only large-scale buildings with a floor area of 2,000 m2 and more are subject Short Medium to the regulations, so the impact on the Group’s business is minimal. However, should the scope for mandatory compliance with the term Manufacturing Base Building Energy Efficiency Act be broadened or the energy conservation standards be raised, more businesses and properties will be subject to the regulation, increasing the burden on business, which could also lead to an increase in the cost of the houses and Policy, buildings we provide. Transitions laws and regulations • Expansion of carbon tax or emissions trading system With commentators predicting that, on the current trajectory, it will be difficult for Japan to achieve its NDC under the Paris Agreement, which is a reduction of 26% in GHG by 2030 compared with the 2013 level, it is possible that new regulations and mechanisms, such as a carbon tax or emissions trading system, will be introduced in Japan. Although a green tax has already been introduced in Japan, Medium Customer Base Small observers say that the rate is low by international standards, and so there is a high possibility that the rate of tax will be increased as term a carbon tax in the future. Therefore, should there be a large increase in the rate of a carbon tax or an expansion in the emissions trading system, operational costs will increase and additional business measures associated with regulations will be necessary, which could lead to a decrease in operational efficiency. Risks • Rise in summer maximum temperatures In Japan, it has been pointed out that the number of heat stroke patients increases significantly when the wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) is over 28°C (extreme caution), and it is possible that the risk of heat stroke for workers at the construction sites of the Group, Short Chronic Small which focuses on the Japan market, will increase further in the future. Therefore, should summer maximum temperatures rise, it is term possible that the risk of heat stroke will increase for workers at construction sites where outdoor work is unavoidable, which could lead Communication Base to longer construction periods and lower productivity for onsite work. • Damage to our facilities due to natural disasters and increase in insurance premiums Physical When natural disasters like storms and floods occur as climate change becomes increasingly severe, there is a high possibility that changes various company facilities, including offices, plants, and distribution facilities owned by the Group, will be damaged.

Innovation Base Aiming to strengthen directors’ roles by separating oversight and executive functions Turning to the issue of corporate governance for the whole Daiwa House Group, we are currently working to reform the structure of Human resources the Board of Directors as part of a rethinking of our decision-making system at the organizational level. The basic idea underlying this is the separation of oversight and executive functions. Hitherto, issues for Base resolution by the Board have been dealt with adequately, but it appears that matters to be reported—such as risks involving management, and materiality assessments relating to sustainability—may have been insufficiently debated. Technology and That being so, we have decided to ensure that the Board becomes a forum for discussion and debate on such matters as decision-making relating to the framework of management policy and related issues, Manufacturing Base the materiality of various corporate activities, risks that are likely to affect the entire corporate group, and so on. Meanwhile, authority for decision-making regarding investment projects and the execution of other such individual operations will be delegated to Executive Directors. By these means, the involvement of the Board of Directors Customer Base in day-to-day business execution will be reduced as much as possible, and this will allow the directors to exercise oversight of the Group’s business from a broader perspective. There is also a need for further diversification of the Board membership. Of the current 14 members, five of them are outside directors, of whom the majority have experience in corporate Communication Base management. Going forward, we are also considering recruiting Board members with academic experience, and from the legal profession. Needless to say, considerations of gender and nationality will play no part in our decisions as to whom to appoint, and we will seek only those persons whose personal experience and talents make it likely that they will perform well as members of the Group’s management. Moreover, by acquiring knowledge, experience, and know-how from outside the Risk Group, we believe we will be able to strengthen our organizational control and our oversight function, and create a board of directors that Countermeasures Base will be more active, more transparent, and more effective. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we will undoubtedly have to contend with an extremely serious business environment during the current fiscal year, ending March 31, 2021. But it is precisely in such circumstances that the true worth of the Daiwa House Group—which we owe to the example set by our founder Nobuo Ishibashi—will be Governance revealed. By fulfilling our mission, as represented by the Group’s Endless Heart symbol—to create bonds of empathy—all employees and executives of Daiwa House will unite to achieve continuous growth for the good of all people.

We launched a carbon-free working group in collaboration with suppliers in our pursuit of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the P034, 038, supply chain, and have shared this goal of going carbon free. As a result, the rate of goal setting by major suppliers reached 71%, and 80% 90% 187, 197 we achieved our target. Innovation Base We achieved our goal by promoting energy conservation at each company and each division, and by expanding the use of renewable 30% reduction 35% reduction P038, 187, energy. Going forward, we will introduce photovoltaic systems and other reusable energy systems to Company facilities, and keep an 197, 198 eye out for new energy conservation technologies, verifying results and spreading them laterally. 1.3 times 1.4 times In addition to photovoltaic systems for in-house energy consumption, the result of promoting the new introduction of RE100 electricity at construction sites was that we were able to reach our target. Looking ahead, while putting to use our environmental 7% 10% energy business within the Group, we will press forward with expanding the installation of photovoltaic systems for in-house energy consumption and the purchasing of RE100 electricity. P040, 189, Human resources 198 We newly added a wind power plant (16MW) in Seiyo, Ehime Prefecture, to the DREAM Project that the Group has been working on, and have achieved our goal with solar power generation of 352MW, wind power generation of 26MW and hydroelectric power 100% 100% generation of 2MW. Base By developing support tools for sales and designing, and implementing training, we were able to achieve a year-on-year improvement in the ZEH sales rate of 41%, and a ZEB sales rate of 36%. However, we were unable to reach our target for greenhouse gas P038, 191, emissions (per floor area). Going forward, we will work to significantly raise ZEH and ZEB sales rates by enhancing our lineup of ZEH 4% reduction 6% reduction 197 products and by holding ZEB seminars for customers, and will strive to offer homes and facilities that offer both comfort and energy savings. Technology and We launched “Lifegenic,” a new steel-frame product, offered a simple ZEH assessment tool, and strengthened measures and structures that are connected to the promotion of ZEH proposals. This in turn led to a ZEH sales rate higher than fiscal 2018, although 55% 60% we were unable to achieve our goal. P041, 042, 191, 192 Manufacturing Base By offering education and holding ZEB seminars for technicians, we bolstered our ZEB proposals, and the result was a 35% 35% significantly higher ZEB rate for large-scale logistics facilities, enabling us to meet our target. While we pursued acquisition of certifications with regard to family-oriented hotels, obtaining certifications for logistics and elderly care facilities did not progress and we were unable to achieve our goal. We will thoroughly instill, and work to 50% 70% P042, 192 promote a policy of acquiring green building certifications at our business sites nationwide. For timber deemed in the previous fiscal year’s timber procurement survey to have a “C” rank and timber that we were unable to 96% 97% Customer Base sufficiently confirm traceability back to its source area, our response was to work with suppliers and change sources of procurement P047, 048, and other efforts in our aim to conduct timber procurement that paid consideration to sustainability. As a result, in the fiscal 2019 050, 199 survey, although the rate of S-ranked timber was essentially unchanged from the previous fiscal year and fell below the target, the rate 0.5% 0.0% of C-ranked timber fell to 0.6%, an improvement that helped us reach our target. The Company achieved its goal with acquisition of certifications for one forest-side housing unit, and three commercial facility units of P047, 048, the Group’s Daiwa Lease Co., Ltd. We will continue to secure sufficient green spaces at the Company’s newly constructed facilities, 8 (cumulative) 9 (cumulative) 052, 199 while contributing to the preservation of regional biodiversity. We worked to develop and create communities that adhere to our self-imposed criteria at all of our projects, and we have reached our P048, 051, Communication Base 100% 100% target. 199 We made timber members that had varied by section to be as uniform as possible, as by enabling the effective use of end materials 62 kg/million 62 kg/million we achieved our goal. yen yen By using roofing tiles that have coating on their entire surface for the roof hips on single-family and rental house divisions, we were 19kg/m2 19kg/m2 able to substantially reduce waste emissions to reach our target. P053, 054, 202, 203 We achieved our goal by thoroughly classifying waste, and also by revising our waste processing route. 97% 97% Risk We achieved our goal by thoroughly classifying waste, and also by revising our waste processing route. 90% 90% Although we made recommendations for reusable “eco bags” at stores and hotel shops, and considered switching to paper bags, Countermeasures Base we were unable to achieve our objective. Together with actively making queries about the necessity of shopping bags so as to reduce 2% reduction 5% reduction P056 plastic, we will continue to consider charging for shopping bags. Newly introducing water-saving devices at hotels and other facilities progressed steadily. On the other hand, water usage at 33.0% 34.0% P054, 057, construction sites, where reduction measures are difficult, increased and we could not attain our target. reduction reduction 204 At properties that are single-family and rental house divisions, or have hotel applications, we promoted the adoption of water-saving 96% 97% P058, 205 devices in order to protect water resources. However, with the installation rate stalled at 89%, we were unable to achieve our goal.

The result is that we have been able to enter into contracts Figures are not disclosed P083–085 pertaining to collaboration with multiple companies and research organizations, and that will work toward the creation of innovation. Given this, we were able to achieve our fiscal 2019 goal. We have been successful in planning for the fiscal 2020 operation of the “planning assistance tool,” so as to build a management structure in P083, 084, 70% 70% which inclusive designs will be an integral part of real estate development. 087 Environment Initiatives we have tackled are the selection of issues with regard to “work-style reform” and studying and planning for new systems. As many P095, 096, adjustments are required until we can build and operate a system that contributes to “an awareness of job satisfaction,” numerical figures 70% 80% 098 were flat. While the retention rate of young workers improved from fiscal 2019, we fell short of our goal.

The 0.21 0.21 112 Base result has been an accident frequency rate lower than benchmarks, and we achieved our target. 100 days 112 days We are undertaking ICT-utilization and automation-related projects at both construction sites and at our plants. Through these, we are striving (7 days-off for (8 days-off for P109–111, to raise productivity and to educate employees of business partners, and the result of these efforts has been the ability to achieve the annual every 4 weeks) every 4 weeks) 114 target for days off from construction. 114 days 117days Both the compliance rate and response rate to our CSR Procurement Guidelines were below targets. As underlying factors for this, there 60% 70% P109–111, Technology and were the second implementation of the self-check and a low awareness. In addition, compared to the supplier companies that are the 117 Manufacturing Base “upstream” of the supply chain, there are the partner subcontractors that are the “downstream,” and many of those are small-scale business operators that may be unable to satisfy the criteria for the “vision” that the Company expects.

Fiscal 2019 was a year in which we responded to support customers for the off-specification issue and dealt with the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis, the 19th named typhoon of the year. We P121, 122, 60% 70% also took action for our Livness business, which is a business that starts with customers with whom we have existing relationships. In this 125 way, we built a framework that made it easy for customers to contact the Company. Communication Base At our ESG small meetings and other venues, our CFO had the opportunity to directly discuss management strategy based on integrated thinking, and our management team also took the initiative toward facilitating an understanding of “integrated management.” We were able to ➃ Launch ➃ Launch P127–129 move forward on practice and preparation to convey a consistent message. The Company has commenced to transform communication in its information systems. In addition to enhancing and facilitating the use of Risk our “MyPortal” intranet site that consolidates important internal Company information, we prepared for the operational launch of an internal P127, 128, data cross-search scheme. We have been working according to plan, moving forward to put in place a communications environment in ➃ Launch ➃ Launch 131, 132 which we promote the use of the “Teams” communication tool, and construct a “property site” which aggregates essential property (building) information by collaborating with external stakeholders. Countermeasures Base ➃ Launch ➃ Launch ➃ Launch ➃ Launch The BCM Subcommittee has a role to play in each of the divisions involved across the Company’s value chain. This enabled progress to further strengthen BCM in the six themes that make up the Business Continuity System score, and paved the way for us to achieve our goal. P137, 138, 60% 100% Through verification in BCM operations dealing with the water damage from Typhoon No. 19 and other natural disasters, we have firmly put in 141 Governance place a management structure that anticipates further spread of natural disasters in the future. In fiscal 2019, we focused efforts on preventing harassment within the Company, and promoting CSR procurement at construction sites and among our suppliers. Given this, we were unable to advance on human rights due diligence at plants in the way we had initially anticipated. ➂ Building the P137–139, On the other hand, as part of a new management structure, employees of business partners working at our plants need not go through their ➃ Launch system 143 own companies to make proposals with regard to the work environment, as we have put in place a structure in which they can approach the Company directly. Figures fell from fiscal 2018. Underlying factors for this are that while the number of training sessions on corporate ethics and compliance P137–139, are included as part of the score calculation, the impact of the novel coronavirus from the end of fiscal 2019 and the shift toward e-learning 436 447 144 caused a decline in the number of times training was carried out. Third-Party Assessment / As we consider measures to strengthen the structure of governance throughout the Group, fiscal 2019 saw Group companies outside of Japan move forward on their considerations to strengthen internal control. In order to bolster the mediumto long-term management foundation in overseas businesses, we have established the Overseas Business Headquarters, and with the intent to develop a management Benchmarks + P137–139, Launch structure for each respective region, we have begun to study establishing a corporate function on a regional basis, starting with North 5pt 147 America.

Customer Base We exclude GHG other than CO2 originating from energy. Specifically, these are CO2 from non-energy sources, as well as methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide (N2O), and the fluorinated gases of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). With regard to these, as the result of the Group’s calculation of emissions based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures, we have determined that these gases accounted for less than 1% of our total GHG emissions, and the degree of their impact on our activities was nominal. Communication Base CO2 emission factor Regarding fuel, etc., we use values based on the Energy Efficiency Act (Act on the Rational Use of Energy) and the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. For both domestic and internationally purchased electric power, we use the alternative values to power supplier emission factor based on the GHG emissions calculation, report, and disclosure initiative for use in Japan. · Purchasing power 0.488 t-CO2/MWh · Kerosene 2.489 t-CO2/kl · Gasoline 2.322 t-CO2/kl · City gas 2.234 t-CO2/1,000m3 (N) · Light oil 2.585 t-CO2/kl · LP gas 2.999 t-CO2/t Risk · No. 2 fuel oil 2.710 t-CO2/kl · Cold, Warm Water 0.057 t-CO2/GJ The calculation of CO2 is affected by inherent uncertainty resulting from the incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emission factors and numerical data. Heat quantity conversion factor Countermeasures Base In the Daiwa House Group, energy consumption is calculated using the Joule (J), a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI), and the following heat quantity conversion factors are used for each energy type. Regarding renewable energy (consumed in-house), it is assumed that electric power purchases have been reduced by its use; therefore, the same heat quantity conversion factor used for purchased electric power is used. In addition, we use the same factors at overseas locations as well.

We then calculate the contributed reduction in GHG emissions by subtracting the result from the GHG emissions generated by a comparable equivalent product. As for the contributed reduction of an ESCO business*, the value is calculated by the existing home base method, and the annual GHG emissions of all facilities subject to ESCO services during the fiscal year (cumulative amount for an existing house) are calculated.
