The reduction of waste products by minimizing production scrap by adopting an ISO 9001 quality management system and increasing the waste recovery rate is therefore a priority. Raising staff awareness and facilitating the sorting of waste also are among the actions that will allow us to maximize the recovery of waste.

This approach highlights a positive dynamic and will result in the gradual extension of the scope for these indicators and their adoption. Methodological explanations and limitations The process for collecting information and indicators will be correctly updated, notably in light of the scope of the changes, and by raising the awareness of contributors in order to reinforce the quality and materiality of the information. Reporting on certain indicators may have limitations due to:  the absence of national and/or internationally recognized definitions;  t he necessary estimates, representativeness of the measures or limited availability of external data required for calculations;  the practical procedures for collecting and recording this information. For that reason, whenever possible, definitions, methodologies and, where applicable, the associated margins of uncertainty, are specified for the corresponding indicators. GUIDELINES AND REPORTING SCOPE Topics excluded from our Non-Financial Statement Considering the nature of Esker’s activities as presented in this document and, in particular, its business model, it would appear that the implications of the law on sustainable food (combating food insecurity, respecting animal well-being, responsible fair and sustainable practices and combating food waste) are limited for the company. In addition, with respect to the responsible conduct of its activities, Esker Group ensures the compliance with all rules applicable in the country where it is present, including those governing tax evasion. Today, no Group entity has been subject to a tax audit. Employment indicators Employment indicators are those derived primarily from the internal reporting guidelines used to produce corporate social responsibility report for the entities concerned. For the Group, headcount data (incoming, outgoing, seniority) is centralized in the HRIS. Concerning absenteeism, accidentology, training, each subsidiary submits its own report to its entity for consolidation purposes. 26 NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT (NFS) Information on employees (number, gender, contract, seniority, recruitment, resignation) are derived from the HRIS used by the administrative department of the subsidiaries and the human resources departments. Apprentices and work-study program students are included in the headcount and interns and IBVs are excluded. Rates are calculated on the basis of the average permanent workforce over a 12-month period (641.7 in 2019). The resignation rate includes contracts terminated at the employee’s initiative. The dismissal rate includes contracts terminated at the employer’s initiative. The end of trial periods and negotiated terminations are included in a separate category: “Other reasons for termination.” Resignations and dismissals concern only permanent employment contracts. The absenteeism rate is based on the consolidation of absences derived from data provided by the subsidiaries and, for France, from an absence management tool linked to our HRIS. The frequency and severity rate of occupational accidents are calculated on the French reporting scope using data provided by the payroll service which centralizes accident reports. The absenteeism rate is calculated as follows: the total number of hours of absences of each subsidiary / the total theoretical number of hours worked in each subsidiary or 33,450.25 / 1,179,300. This excludes annual holidays and includes the number of days of absence for working days for the following category of absences:  illness (Group), commuting and occupational accidents (France)  maternity and paternity leaves, adoption, birth (Group)  family events: birth, marriage, family death (Group)  o  ther causes: unjustified leave without pay, educational leave and training rights, transfer days, authorized leave, absence for a sick child, disabled worker absence, recovery days (Group) Frequency and severity rates concern only France The accident frequency rate represents the number of lost time injuries per million hours worked. The severity rate of lost time injuries is expressed in number of lost time calendar days per lost time injury divided by thousand hours worked. These two rates increased significantly in 2018 following the transfer of the company to the new premises. They then decreased significantly in 2019, after employees became accustomed to their commuting routines. Concerning training, the indicators concern only France. Outside training provided by a service provider is included in this data as is our in-house training. Data on training derived from the HRIS enabled us to total the number of hours and the number of employees who participated in one or more training programs, external and/or in-house, organized in France in 2019. For internal training, Esker has a training platform, Esker University, and a training department with seven employees in 2019 (six in France and one in the United States). Interns and external consultants are excluded from this data, as is e-learning training. The results of the Great Place To Work survey are provided by the Great Place To Work Institute, an independent organization and reference for workplace quality-of-life. The presentations of the company’s results are available at the website: https://www.esker.com/investors/. The number of meetings with employee representatives (délégués uniques du personnel) was calculated from minutes of the Social and Economic Committee meetings. The number of recruitments is based on reports established from the HRIS, based on the starting date of employees in 2019. Employment indicators The availability rate of the platform is available in real time at the Trust Esker site to which customers of the Esker on Demand platform have access. Our internal training tool Esker University is able to monitor the number of employees who receive training and successfully completed the online training about the importance of data security and protection. As part of our confidentiality policy, no complaints were received by our DPO. The amounts paid in connection with this sponsorship agreement are justified by contracts signed with organizations supported by Esker. The number of Esker customers and transactions on the Esker on Demand platform are based on reports issued by the company’s CRM system. The number of the platform’s users is determined by queries submitted by the development teams, indicating the number of identifiers having access to the cloud platform. Environmental indicators Environmental indicators concern the French reporting scope only. This includes the offices located at 113 boulevard Stalingrad in Villeurbanne, the Décines mail production facility, the offices of CalvaEDI in Paris and all data centers in France (internal IT of Esker France, Calva EDI, and the EoD servers), as well as all employees in France. The production activity of CalvaEDI was recognized for the carbon assessment, though excludes electricity consumption for their Paris premises and waste management for their offices as this is considered non-material (7 employees at the end of 2018). The indicator selected by Esker to measure its performance in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is the number of grams of CO2 emissions by a document processed by the Esker on Demand production platform, all media combined. CO2 emissions per document processed were calculated by an external consultant, taking into account the following factors:  T  otal kg CO2 Scope 1: 230,893 Includes emissions from fixed sources of combustion (gas or generators), direct emissions from mobile sources with combustion engines (fuel consumption of company vehicles), direct fugitive emissions (leakage from cooling equipment). NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT (NFS) 27 Esker is not concerned by direct emissions originating from non-energy sources and biomass (soil and forests).  T  otal kg CO2 Scope 2: 10,469 Includes indirect emissions from electricity consumption (lighting and consumption). Esker is not concerned by indirect emissions linked to electricity consumption (heating / air-conditioning inseparable common expenses for Décines; production : machines / computers / servers), indirect emissions linked to the consumption of steam, heat, cold (consumption linked to the heat or cooling distribution networks).  T  otal kg CO2 Scope 3: 1,911,429 Includes the purchase of products and services (raw materials, subcontracting of printer maintenance; security services for the surveillance of sites or servers, food services), the manufacture of goods , waste management (Villeurbanne site and the Décines production facility), inbound transportation of goods (transportation of raw materials), professional travel (professional travel of employees by their private vehicles; professional travel by plane/train) and employee commuting to and from work.Esker is not concerned by emissions linked to energy not included in categories 1 and 2 (extraction, production and transportation of fuel; emissions associated with the transport and distribution of electricity; extraction, production and transport of fuel consumed for production by the company), upstream leased assets, investments, transportation of visitors and customers, downstream transportation of goods, use of goods sold, the end of life of products sold, downstream franchises, downstream leasing. Total greenhouse gas emissions from the different Esker sites in France in 2018 amounted to 2,153 tons. In 2018, the number of documents processed on the Esker on Demand production platform for France amounted to approximately 219.27 million documents including 42.14 million letters. The benchmark indicator for 2018 in consequence equals 10 grams of CO2 per document processed. With respect to GHG emissions, for 2019, because data is not yet available, only information for 2018 is provided. A carbon assessment was performed in 2018, even though this is not required for the company; In addition, negative emissions corresponding to activities including recycling have a more important positive impact than the activity itself on the environment. For 2019, there is no specific item able to explain a more important increase other than the increase proportional to the company’s activity. A marginal decline is even expected in 2019, as the number of documents processed has increased whereas energy consumption did not increase in this same period. The number of hybrid cars in the Esker automobile fleet is determined by the information on the vehicle mentioned in our long-term leasing contracts with the company ALD Automotive. Vehicles actually delivered in the period are taken into account not only those made available by the service provider (there sometimes exists a small gap between these two figures) for employees of the head office and the Décines plant. Electricity consumption is calculated from the invoices provided by our electricity supplier, EDF, for the head office and the Décines plant. ELISE, which manages waste recycling for Esker provides reports every quarter on the activity and the quantity of waste recovered. The annual amount corresponds to the addition of these quantities. 28 NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT (NFS) NFS STATEMENT Report by one of the statutory auditors designated as the independent third-party assurance service provider on the consolidated non-financial statement Fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 To the annual general meeting of the shareholders In our capacity as Esker’s statutory auditors designated as the independent third-party assurance service provider certified by COFRAC under No. 3-1048 (for details on the scope refer to www.cofrac.fr), we hereby present our consolidated nonfinancial statement (hereafter the Statement ) presented in the group management report prepared for the period ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with the provisions of article L. 225 102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French commercial code. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY The Executive Board is responsible for issuing a Statement in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions that includes a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies applied with regard to these risks and the results of these policies, including key performance indicators.

INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY CONTROL Our independence is defined by the provisions of Article L. 822-11 of the French commercial code and the Code of Ethics (Code de Déontologie) of our profession. We have also implemented a quality control system comprising documented policies and procedures for ensuring compliance with the codes of ethics, professional doctrine and applicable legal and regulatory texts. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATUTORY AUDITOR DESIGNATED AS THE INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY Based on our work, our role is to formulate a reasoned opinion expressing moderate assurance as to:  the Statement’s compliance with the provisions of Article R. 225-105 of the French commercial code;  t he sincerity of the information provided in application of Paragraph 3 of Section I and II of Article R. 225-105 of the French commercial code, namely the results of the policies, including key performance indicators, and the actions relating to the main risks (hereinafter referred to as the “Information”). However, it is not our responsibility to express an opinion on the company’s compliance with other applicable legal and regulatory provisions, particularly with regard to anti-corruption measures and taxation, or on the compliance of products and services with the applicable regulations. NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE WORK Our work described above was performed in compliance with the provisions of articles A. 225-1. of the French commercial code determining the procedures according to which the independent third-party assurance service provider performs its engagement and according to professional doctrine of the of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this mission as well as the international standard ISAE 3000 (Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information). W  e carried out checks allowing us to assess the Statement’s compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions and the fair presentation of the Information:  W  e duly noted the activity of all entities included in the consolidation scope, their exposure to the main social and environmental risks.  W  e assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, impartiality and comprehensibility and taking into account best industry practices where appropriate.  W  ith verified that the Statement covers each category of information provided for in Section III of Article L. 225-102-1 on social and environmental matters as well as respect for human rights and the combating of corruption and tax evasion.  W  e verified that the Statement discloses the information provided for in II of Article R. 225-105, where this information is relevant to the main risks and that it provides, where applicable, an explanation of the reasons for non-disclosure of the information required by the 2nd Paragraph of III of Article L. 225-102-1.  W  e verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the main risks linked to all the entities included within the scope of consolidation, including, whenever relevant and proportionate, the risks engendered by business relations, products or services as well as the policies, reasonable diligence procedures and results, including key performance indicators. NON-FINANCIAL STATEMENT (NFS) 29  We consulted the documentary sources and conducted interviews to: Assess the process for selecting and approving the main risks as well as the consistency of the results, including the key performance indicators presented, in terms of the main risks and policies described; and corroborate the qualitative information (action and results) we deemed the most important1 for qualitative information related to certain risks (corruption and taxation), our review was performed at the level of the consolidating level, and for others at the level of the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities.  W  e verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e., all the companies included in the scope of consolidation in compliance with article L. 233-16 of the French commercial code, with the limits specified in the Statement.  W  e have taken note of the internal control and risk management procedures implemented by the entity and assessed the data collection process used by the entity to ensure that the Information is both complete and accurate.  F  or the key performance indicators and the other quantitative results2 that we considered to be the most significant, we implemented: analytical procedures consisting in verifying the correct consolidation of collected data as well as the consistency of changes in them; detailed tests based on sampling, consisting in verifying the proper application of definitions and procedures, and in reconciling data with supporting documents. This work was conducted with a selection of contributing entities3 and covers between 54% and 100% of the consolidated data of the key performance indicators and results selected for these tests.  We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of the entity. We consider that the work we carried out by exercising our professional judgment allows us formulate a conclusion of moderate assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive verification work. RESOURCES AND METHODS Our work made use of the expertise of four persons in April 2020. In the performance of this engagement, we were assisted by our sustainable development and social responsibility specialists. We conducted around ten meetings with persons responsible for preparing the Statement. CONCLUSION Based on our work, and bearing in mind the scope of our responsibility, we did not observe any significant misstatement likely to call into question the statement of non-financial performance's conformity with the applicable regulatory provisions or the fair presentation of the Information, taken as a whole, in accordance with the Guidelines. COMMENTS Without qualifying the above conclusion, and in accordance with the provisions of article A. 225-3 of the French commercial code, we draw your attention as an emphasis of matter to following comment: as specified in the methodology note of the consolidated non-financial statement, for the environmental indicators and certain employment-related indicators, the reporting boundary is limited to activities in France.
