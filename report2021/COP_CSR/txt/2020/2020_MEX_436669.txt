The growth of tourism in recent years confirms that this sector is one of the most powerful engines of global 19 20 1 economic development. 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET 2 01 0 188 / /M ESMUOSRTIA A ID I L I TE N NEA SBOST Y I BRI LEI PDA ODR T/ /G RGURP O U PXC O AXRC E TA R E T North America led the growth in the continent with an increase of 4%, compared to South America and Central America and the Caribbean. Mexico received 41.4 million international tourists mainly from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Colombia, Argentina, among others; which represents an increase of 5.5% compared to the previous year, according to the Secretariat of Tourism. This allowed the country to remain at sixth place in the world ranking of arrivals. For the national economy, tourism is the third largest generator of foreign exchange in the country and a key to growth and development by causing an economic spill of 22.5 billion dollars. Quintana Roo has positioned itself as one of the best destinations in the entire Caribbean because of its great natural and cultural wealth, its excellent air connectivity and its wide range of hotels and tourist services. Without a doubt, it is the state of the Mexican Republic that attracts the most tourists; in 2018, $16’911,163 tourists were received, 4% more compared to 2017. Globally, the tourism industry will continue to grow, which must be accompanied by constant innovation and sustainable management that permeated the real benefits of tourism to host communities to ensure the prosperity of all, leaving no one behind. 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET 21 XUSTA I NABI LITY 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET 22 COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY For us, sustainability is the balanced creation of economic, 23 24 sociocultural and environmental value that guarantees the harmonious growth of our business, the well-being of the 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET communities and the environment in which we operate. Sustainability has been inserted in the strategic agenda of our group and is one of the elements that are part of our unique management style. This understanding of the concept, even before being called that, allowed us to realize our vision of “being unique in sustainable tourist recreation”. Today, it constitutes a true path that the founding partners have drawn for our group. This vision is based on the principles included in the Sustainability Policy and in the Xustainability Model, which describe how we implement it at a corporate level and in each business unit. SUSTAINABILITY POLICY Grupo Xcaret’s management is based on a model that ensures the conservation, dissemination and development of natural, socio-cultural and economic heritage for future generations. X U S TA I N A B I L I T Y M O D E L Our Xustainability Model allows us to easily communicate the 25 actions aimed at the performance of a prosperous business, 26 the generation of social welfare and the conservation of our environment, based on three pillars identified as the “3P”: people, 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET 2018 / SUSTAINABILITY REPORT / GRUPO XCARET planet and prosperity. The reach of our actions has two perspectives: internal and external. The internal includes all the actions that are carried out within the company and that are related to the development of the business; and the external one considers all the actions that have an impact on the environment where the company operates. In the planet pillar we include the programs and projects that support the conservation of the environment and cover the aspects: environmental management, care of the ecosystems where we operate, monitoring and research, conservation of species and animal welfare. This pillar reflects that through our actions, we can achieve a responsible and constructive relationship with the natural environment. In the pillar of people, we focus on social aspects that are related to respect for human dignity, quality of life, as well as preservation and dissemination of cultural heritage. In the prosperity pillar, we consider the profitability of the business and the generation of value to society. It covers four aspects: economic performance, responsible commercialization, promotion of the Mexican economy and business ethics.

CULTURAL HERITAGE The rescue and valuation of the Intangible Cultural Heritage is one of the priorities of Grupo Xcaret.

We highlight two events that have this purpose: the Sacred Mayan Journey and the Festival of Life and Death Traditions. SACRED MAYAN JOURNEY The Sacred Mayan Journey represents the effort of Grupo Xcaret to recover a pre-Hispanic tradition that was abandoned, practiced 65 66 before for more than five centuries.

Today our parks and tours are emblematic attractions of Mexico. That is why in 2010, our partners began to think up the idea of consolidating a resort that gave continuity to the tourist vocation within the land of 370 hectares where the Xcaret and Xplor parks were so far. This dream would develop according to the group’s philosophy, which keeps in balance people, the planet and prosperity. It would include a hotel project of six thousand rooms, a convention center, an Xtadium for events with capacity for 12 thousand spectators, and a commercial area of more than a mile that would integrate entertainment, shops and restaurants. It would offer more than 15 thousand direct jobs and 60 thousand indirect jobs. In this terrain, all the attractions and requirements that tourism seeks in a destination would be combined. A unique opportunity to transcend the tourist activity of our country: to turn Xcaret into a destination by itself. That is why we decided to call this resort: Xcaret Destination. Thus, the seed sown by Miguel Quintana and his partners Oscar, Marcos and Carlos Constandse, has transcended a new generation that today takes the responsibility of driving the business to a new level, under the premises of innovation and service excellence but, above all, the full satisfaction of its visitors, and now guests and members.

A nursery, a vacation club, the place in all its splendor. a restaurant with a wonderful view, and a chapel installed at the highest point, all fit within this beautiful construction.
