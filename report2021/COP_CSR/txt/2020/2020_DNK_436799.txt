Our DNA emerges from the regulated pharmaceutical industry and significantly reflects our approach to quality and business ethics as well as our definition of corporate responsibility. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Policy integrates and reflects our business objectives and our core business values: open and honest, conscience driven, and value adding – while keeping in mind that corporate responsibility must be carried out through the mutual commitment of management and employees as an integrated part of our daily work. In 2019, NNIT has taken steps to work with selected goals to contribute to the achievement of the UN sustainable development goals. We have decided to focus on SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 5 (gender equality), but acknowledge that all SDG’s are important and interconnected. The company’s ’Business Ethics’ outline the responsibilities of employees and directions to protect NNIT from malpractice that may undermine NNIT’s business integrity. Approved by NNIT’s management board and the Board of Directors, it provides the fundamental guidance for responsible and proper business conduct at NNIT. With this document, we confirm our support of the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the principles in our business. Best regards, Per Kogut, President and CEO 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 3 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 2 One world, one NNIT NNIT is a leading provider of digital transformation services and consultancy. NNIT offers a broad range of winning solutions to serve client groups in Denmark and internationally.

Although we acknowledte that all SDG’s are 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 5 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 interconnected, it is important that we focus on matters where we can maximise the positive impact and reversly reduce the negative impact. Consequently, we have decided to focus on SDG 4 (quality education) and SDG 5 (gender equality). In NNIT, we have for years supported initiatives that revolve around children and education, in particular within IT and technology. The scarcity of IT competences is a social and societal challenge, and NNIT hence supports initiatives that sustain society and its growing digitization. We are aware that such initiatives can best be meet in partnerships. Such partnerships and initiatives include for example Coding Class and Engineer the Future. Together with the IT industry association (IT Branchen), NNIT contributes via Coding Class to teaching coding in the Danish primary school. Coding Class is offered as a training course to 6th grade school classes, concluded with visits to a company. NNIT is a partner in Coding Class and has ongoing classes on company visits. The aim of Coding Class is primarily to inspire children and young people and evoke a potential interest in IT and technology, while also giving them a better understanding of the world that surrounds them now and in the future. Our partnership with Engineer the Future entails among other things that NNIT makes company mentors available to promoting technical studies with the aim of consistently growing the number of applications for these. Promotion is done through videos, presentations, school visits and similarly. In 2019, continuing into 2020, employees in NNIT has taken part in the UN Young SDG Innovator Program. The goal is to rethink traditional business models and develop new, sustainable solutions. In 2020, all selected groups will travel to New York, New York and present their solutions to an audience of business leaders from around the world. More on the SDG 5, gender equality, can be found in the Diversity sections below. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 6 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 2.1.1 KPI’s and target achievement 2019 KPI’s Quality education (SDG 4) Ambition Target Achievement External interactions (from ≥ 2 large IT events for 2020) – in Denmark school children External interactions (from ≥ 10 events for school 2020) – NNIT globally classes Internal indicators (from > 20% internal transfers 30% in 2019 2019) and job rotations each year Number of certifications ≥130% of entire NNIT work 145% force KPI’s Gender equality (SDG 5) Ambition Target Achievement Proportion of female ≥ 32% 33 % end 2019 employees in NNIT (from 2019) Proportion of female ≥ proportion of female 27% end 2019 leaders in NNIT within 2025 employees in NNIT (32%) Proportion of female ≥ proportion of female 45% of participants in the NNIT employees included in the employees in NNIT (32%) DYLP programme in 2019 were ’Develop Your Leadership per year female employees Potential’ (DYLP) program (from 2019) Board of Directors (from At least two female, In 2019 NNIT had two female, 2019) shareholder-elected Board shareholder-elected Board members members represented in the Board of Directors 2.1.2 KPI’s and target setting 2020 NNIT will continue mesuring on the achievements on the SDG 4 (Quality eduction) and SDG 5 (Gender equality) in 2020 and we will further expand our SDG engagement including SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) in 2020. As it pertains to SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) we work with this overriding ambition: In line with our overall aspiration and strategy we want to improve sustainability through innovation and we want to help society by improving focus on the importance of cyber security. Specific KPIs are under development. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 7 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 As it pertains to SDG 12 (Responsible consumption and production) we work with this overriding ambition: We want to minimize our negative environmental footprint and we want to encourage our employees to act responsibly with regard to sustainable reuse and recycling both as employees and as private individuals. Specific KPIs are under development. 2.2 Risk related to Corporate Social Responsibility NNIT operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. In order to sustain profitable growth, NNIT considers risk management a necessity and has adopted a structured approach to address this area. In NNIT, risk management contains four elements: risk identification, risk assessment, identification of mitigating actions and risk reporting. NNIT identifies risk using a combination of a bottom-up and a top-down approach. Key risks are initially identified within each divisional area and reported to Group Management together with information on what has been done and what is intended to be done. High risks are aggregated and a broad list presented in an annual risk report and challenged by Group Management and finally by the Audit Committee of the Board as well as the Board of Directors. Group Management continuously follows up and reports monthly on risk development with mitigating actions to the Board of Directors. The main drivers for NNIT’s actions on corporate social responsibility are business related. Employee recruitment and retention issues are important focus areas. Thus, failing to implement and preserve sound social responsibility may impair our attractiveness as an employer and consequently put our business at risk if we are not fully equipped to meet our customers’ demands. NNIT considers the risk related to negative climate and environmental impact to be limited as activites related hereto are limited to energy consumption at data centres and offices as well as business travel which is primarily client related. NNIT also considers the risks related to anticorruption to be limited as NNIT has implemented and operates with strict business ethics and codes of conduct. As such, the main risks identified in relation to Corporate Social Responsibility are related to company brand and reputation and our ability to attract and retain the required talent. Measures installed to mitigate such risks are described below as well as in the Annual Report 2019, pages 29-31. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 8 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 9 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 3 Human Rights Principles 3.1 Commitment NNIT acknowledges the requirements of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and The United Nations Convention against Corruption, and we ask of all our employees that they work actively to ensure continued compliance in all their work. In all aspects, NNIT respects and acknowledges cultural difference and disassociates itself with discrimination based on race, religion, gender, age, nationality or sexual orientation. NNIT places high priority on a sound and healthy work environment, as it is a precondition for flexibility, adaptability and personal development. 3.2 Implementation NNIT only work with suppliers that respect human rights of workers and treat employees with dignity and respect. NNIT requires its suppliers to adhere to the following requirements on labour practices (but not restricted to):  Wages and benefits: Suppliers shall pay employees at least the minimum wage required by law or the prevailing industry standard in the country, and shall provide all legally mandated benefits, including medical insurance, social insurance and pensions, in full and on time.  Working hours and holiday: Suppliers shall not breach local regulations on working hours and shall remunerate overtime in accordance with local laws and regulations as a minimum.  Child labour: Suppliers shall not recruit or employ child labour. The minimum age of workers shall be 15 years or the minimum age set by the national laws in the country of manufacturing, whichever is higher. Young workers, i.e. those above the minimum age and below the age of 18, may only be employed for non-hazardous work.  Freely chosen employment: Suppliers shall not use forced or involuntary labour (e.g. forced, bonded, indentured or involuntary prison labour).  Freedom of association and collective bargaining: Suppliers shall respect the rights of employees established in local law to join or not join labour unions, seek representation and join worker organisations. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 10 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019  Non-discrimination: Suppliers shall not discriminate in their hiring or employment practices on grounds of race, caste, national origin, religion, age, disability, gender, marital status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, union membership or political affiliation.  Treatment of employees: Suppliers shall treat their employees with respect and dignity, and shall not subject them to any kind of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, physical, verbal or sexual abuse, or threat of abuse or harassment.  Business integrity: Suppliers shall comply with all laws and regulations on bribery, fraud, corruption and prohibited business practices applicable in the specific country. Suppliers shall not engage in any form of bribery, facilitation payments, corruption, extortion or embezzlement.  Minerals from conflict-affected and high-risk areas: Suppliers that supply products or parts hereof that contain metals or minerals (Minerals) must comply with OECD’s “Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas”. Moreover, as part of the company’s internal processes, NNIT has developed a Working Environment Process that covers all activities that are required to ensure a healthy working environment. A Working Environment Council was established in NNIT in 1999 and has since continuously worked to create optimal work conditions for employees and secure the absence of work place accidents. Following Danish legislation, NNIT carries out the mandatory APV (workplace assessment survey) every two years. Actions based on the results of the survey are taken. 3.3 Performance evaluation In accordance with NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published on the company’s website, NNIT has committed itself to proper and diligent conduct in its entire operations. An APV (workplace assessment survey) is carried out at least every third year. In May 2017, it revealed no critical items, nor any cross-organizational issues. A new APV will be carried out in 2020. NNIT has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving human rights violations in 2019. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 11 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 4 Rights Principles 4.1 Commitment NNIT acknowledges the requirements of the International Labour Organization’s conventions and declarations, including the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, convention no. 155, as well as the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 4.2 Implementation NNIT’s Code of Conduct forms the basis for diligent and proper conduct of business in NNIT. All employees are trained in the Code of Conduct, and all suppliers undergo an approval process to ensure they meet NNIT’s safety and quality requirements as well as our business standards. NNIT expects all suppliers and subcontractors to share the fundamental principles of NNIT’s responsible sourcing standards and that they meet and comply with the requirements of United Nations Global Compact. All employees in NNIT further participate in annual performance reviews, and individual development plans are made for all employees. Also in 2019, NNIT has monitored absence related to sickness on a monthly basis to be able to react if a negative trend is discovered. 4.3 Performance evaluation NNIT employs more than 3,000 people, located in 14 different locations, covering over 60+ nationalities. Individual development plans and performance reviews have been carried out for all employees in all locations. NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy is publically available from the company’s website, confirming NNIT’s commitment to sustainable and socially responsible behavior. A total of 7 work place accidents were reported in 2019 (seven in 2018), none of which involved terminal or permanent injuries. In 2018, 6 cases was reported in the Annual Report. However, the correct number of reported cases was 7 as one case from 2018 was reported after publishing of the Annual Report. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 12 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 5 Environmental Protection Principles 5.1 Commitment NNIT’s business activities comprise IT and advisory services, including general office activities and business travel, primarily in connection with servicing clients. Although these services and business activities do not directly affect the environment, the associated energy consumption, first and foremost, and business travel do have an impact. While such activities are necessary when working in a global business, NNIT continuously aims to reduce the use of resources and the environmental impact of its business activities. The company thus maintains focus on how to reduce energy consumption in all business areas. 5.2 Implementation The company’s headquarters in Copenhagen as well as its established datacenter have been constructed with emphasis on sustainability and energy efficiency. Wherever possible, NNIT makes use of technology solutions, including virtual meetings via the Internet, to reduce the need for travel. Further, NNIT promotes sustainable and low-energy devices. Also in 2019, the company car fleet included stipulations to only select cars that are fuel-efficient and environmentally optimized. 5.3 Performance evaluation In accordance with NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published on the company’s website, NNIT has committed itself to proper and diligent conduct in its entire doings. NNIT has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving environmental protection violations in 2019. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 13 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 6 Anti-Corruption 6.1 Commitment NNIT’s policy on business ethics considers corruption and bribery wrong and illegal, and not acceptable. The company’s business ethics and code of conduct clearly lay forward the consequences of engaging in such unlawfulness. NNIT’s Business Ethics and Code of Conduct form the basis of NNIT’s business in its entire operations. They provide guidance, and outline the responsibilities of the employees and management to protect NNIT from any malpractice that may undermine the company’s business integrity and impact its long-term business success. Giving or accepting business gifts, hospitality or entertainment is not allowed, however minor gifts and moderate entertainment may be part of customary business dealings and hence considered acceptable. To avoid that gifts, hospitality and entertainment have undue influence on business decisions a maximum amount is defined by NNIT’s management board and applies to all employees in the group. 6.2 Implementation NNIT’s DNA emerges from the regulated pharmaceutical industry as a former subsidiary of Novo Nordisk A/S. The company’s origin reflects its approach when it comes to quality and business ethics. Also in 2019, all employees were trained in the company’s business ethics and code of conduct, including rules for gifts, hospitality and entertainment. If and when the documents are updated, all employees will receive notification to familiarize themselves with the content of the documents and officially sign that they have read and understand and comply with the guidelines. 6.3 Performance evaluation In accordance with NNIT’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy, published on the company’s website, the company’s business ethics and code of conduct, NNIT has committed itself to proper and diligent conduct in its entire doings. NNIT has not been subject to any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving anti-corruption violations in 2019. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 14 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 7 Diversity – Board of Directors 7.1 Commitment NNIT recognizes the value of diversity and hence the importance of promoting diversity at management levels, including gender-related diversity. It is NNIT’s ambition to increase diversity at management levels by providing equal opportunities for men and women, promoting international experience, and maintaining the management’s capability to effectively undertake its managerial responsibilities considering the company’s international profile. NNIT aims to employ the best candidates, and the candidate’s qualifications must therefore always be the decisive factor in external and internal recruitment processes. 7.2 Implementation In accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, section 99 b, the Board of Directors set its diversity ambition in 2013 to include:  At least two shareholder-elected Danish Board members  At least two shareholder-elected non-Danish Board members  At least two female and two male shareholder-elected Board members by 2019. 7.3 Performance evaluation The Board of Directors initially resolved to meet its diversity ambition by 2017, but later decided to postpone the target timeline to 2019 to maintain a level of stability during other changes to the Board of Directors. However, in 2018 NNIT met its diversity target with the election of one new shareholder-elected female board member. Currently, the Board of Directors thus consists of two shareholder-elected female board members, one of which is also a non-Danish board member. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 15 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 8 Diversity – other management levels 8.1 Commitment NNIT recognizes the value of diversity and hence the importance of promoting diversity at management levels, especially with focus on gender-related diversity and supporting the Sustainable Development Goal 5, Gender Equality. It is NNIT’s ambition to increase diversity at all management levels by providing equal opportunities for men and women, promoting international experience, and maintaining the management’s capability to effectively undertake its managerial responsibilities considering the company’s international profile. 8.2 Implementation The company’s general procedures for employment seek to provide equal career opportunities for men and women and they are actively used when seeking to employ persons to management positions with the Group. Consequently, job descriptions, job advertisements, screening of applicants and job interviews are never aimed at a particular gender. Also in 2019, engaged search and selection firms were requested to identify at least one female candidate for all management positions. All internal and external searches for vacant positions must include at least one female candidate on the short list. Also in 2019, succession planning was carried out for all management positions, aiming to identify female successors for management level positions. Further, an internal training course, ‘Discover Your Leadership Potential’, is aimed at talented employees with a clear potential for becoming a people manager. Participation in the program in 2019 was based on the manager’s recommendation. Finally, awareness of women in leadership at top management level in the company is addressed at least annually, as it is a recurring topic at a board meeting and at a meeting of the Executive Management. 8.3 Performance evaluation At the end of 2019, NNIT employed a total of 3,207 staff globally. Of these were 33% women, 67% men. This is a small increase in female employees campared to the numbers of 2018 and vastly in line with the candidate pool from where NNIT recruits. Approximately 27% of NNIT leaders are currently female leaders. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 16 of 17 Statutory Statement pursuant to sections 99 a NNIT and 99 b of the Communication on Progress 2019 Danish Financial Statements Act for the UN Global Compact financial year 2019 Activities in 2019 focused on female participation in the ‘Discover Your Leadership Potential’ training program. The training program aims to identify talented employees’ management potential and clarify a possible manager career path. As part of ‘Discover Your Leadership Potential’ all female participants get a mentor from NNIT management. These activities will continue in 2020. NNIT will continue to address issues related to diversity. In 2018, NNIT established ‘Fostering Women Leaders’ which is a special mentor program to support female managers and their aspirations to advance. The program was contined in 2019, when all newly appointed female managers were allocated a female mentor. The program aims at a broader professional exposure of female managers in order to place them on top of mind of those responsible for promotions in the organization. The program focuses on existing female managers, but may eventually be extended to also cover female employees, who wish to move into a managerial role. Further, in 2018 NNIT introduced a new line of network meetings for female leaders in NNIT. The first meeting was held in June 2018 in NNIT HQ. The program continued in 2019, as the company hosted network meetings for female leaders in Denmark og China, prespectively. 2020-01-28 Version: 1.0 Page 17 of 17
