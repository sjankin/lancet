But the situation changed in the second half of the year. The trade conflict between the United States and China worsened as the risk of currency wars increased. The IMF estimated that total damage from the use of import duties in the global economy would stand at USD 700 bln by 2020 (roughly 0.8% of global GDP). In the fall of 2019, the PMI1 dropped to its lowest level since 2012. As a result, the IMF slashed its estimate for the prospects of the global economy: global GDP growth in 2019 was estimated at 2.9%, the lowest level since the financial crisis a decade ago. The greatest pressure has been felt in the eurozone, where leading economies, particularly Germany, 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 are on the verge of a recession.

Russian GDP increased by 2.5% in 2018 (Rosstat adjusted the figure from 2.3%). The greatest impact on growth An unusually warm winter, including in December 2019, resulted in the physical volume of GDP came from an increase in the added value in adjustments to the typical home heating system in certain regions of the mining and manufacturing industries, at 2.7% and 1.6%, respectively. of Russia.
