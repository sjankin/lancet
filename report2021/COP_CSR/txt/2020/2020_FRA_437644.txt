Olivier Aldrin CEO Expleo 3 avenue de Prés 78180 Montigny-Le-Bretonneux Paris, January 24th 2020 Letter of commitment to the United Nations Global Compact Dear Mr. Secretary-General, In an ever-changing environment, it is Expleo’s ambition to be the next-generation technology partner for innovative companies, helping them to quickly and successfully develop large-scale innovations that will shape a more sustainable world for everyone. At the very heart of our mission, we are about finding solutions to ensure sustainable growth at the service of technological and human progress. We are convinced that this challenge must be carried out in accordance with our values of courage, excellence, collaboration, respect and accountability. These same values are reflected in our Research and Development policy which is based on 4 principles: acting ethically, innovating at the service of society, developing our talents, and contributing to the protection of the environment. These principles guide our daily actions with our clients and our investments in innovative projects to meet social and environmental challenges. It is therefore only natural that Expleo supports the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact on human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. With this communication, we express our intent to renew our commitment as Expleo and to implement those principles. We are committed to making the UN Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects, which advance the broader development goals of the United Nations, particularly the Sustainable Development Goals.
