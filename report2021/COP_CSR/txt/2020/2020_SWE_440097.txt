Committee employees Our success is in the hands of our Value 153 employees. We create stimulating and qualified jobs in a healthy and safe environment. Employee attendance was 96.9 per cent. In 2019, we paid SEK 128 million in salaries and remuneration. Satisfied tenants By focusing on relationships we have further improved our dialogue with our tenants, and this is reflected in an increased customer satisfaction score. In 2019, we invested SEK 787 million in developing modern, energy-efficient premises for our tenants. We provide 3,000 tenants with fit-for-purpose premises in the right locations and offer housing to 1,750 residential tenants. Society By running a responsible business we contribute to the tax system that finances public welfare. We paid SEK 79 million in income tax, SEK 101 million in property tax and SEK 43 million in value-added tax. We contribute to the local economy by being a major employer, which creates employment both directly and indirectly. Energy use was down by 3 per cent in 2019 and 17 per cent of the total floor space of our portfolio has now been environmentally certified. We sponsor sporting and cultural activities and offer traineeships and opportunities for degree projects. Suppliers We work with a total of around 2,000 suppliers. We are continuously reviewing the quality of the work and products supplied in terms of business ethics, working conditions and working environment. Purchases for the year totalled SEK 506 million. Lenders Access to capital is essential to our ability to run an expanding property business. Our financial strength and risk management ensure our creditworthiness. In 2019, we paid SEK 147 million in interest and principal to our lenders. Shareholders We create value for our shareholders through continued growth and dividends. Our property management income per share increased by 7 percent to SEK 7.07, which exceeds our target of a 5 percent increase. Diös’ dividend policy remains the same: to distribute around 50 per cent of the profit for the year to the shareholders. The proposed dividend of SEK 3.30 per share and the increase in Diös’ share price over the year result in a total return of 58.1 per cent. The total dividend distribution will be SEK 444 million.

This points to a strong underlying trend and high level of activity in all our cities. We have signed several contracts that lead to project development, which will have a positive impact on growth in our cities. Major leases signed during the year include those with the Transport Administration in Borlänge and Luleå, Webhelp in Östersund, the Police Authority in Umeå and WSP in Gävle. Intagan 1, Borlänge. Construction starts and new projects A natural part of our urban development activities is the creation of new spaces. In 2019, we initiated the construction phase of two hotel projects in Sundsvall and Umeå as well as the Söderbo residential project in Östersund. These three new build projects will add around 33,000 sq.m of centrally located floor space. We also signed agreements on the construction and development of a further 58,000 sq.m. Visualisation of Gustav III:s torg, Östersund. Green properties and loans Improving and raising the efficiency of our properties is integral to our business, and by obtaining environmental certification for our properties we receive confirmation of the value of our efforts. In 2019, Diös certified 20 properties, which means that 17 per cent of floor area of the portfolio has now been environmentally certified. Through our green properties and other green projects, we also open up the possibility of obtaining green loans. In the autumn, we established a green financing framework and issued SEK 300 million in green commercial bonds. DoSpace, Gävle. Renewable energy renewable! With access to large roof areas on our properties, we are in a good position to install solar panels. In 2019, we invested in several solar panel installations and now have 540 kWp of installed capacity. We are also joint owners of a wind turbine that generated 4.3 GWh in 2019. During the year, we produced 183 MWh of solar energy for our properties and thus helped to improve the supply of renewable electricity in the market. Solar cells on the Åre Station building, Åre.

We acquire strategic properties and development rights while divesting assets that no longer fit into our strategy. In-house developed business concepts such as PickPackPost make life easier for our tenants and local residents. By working to increase the flow of people through the city we improve the safety of residential areas and the city as a whole and increase the attractiveness of retail and office spaces. Through a clear strategy, we create growth in our cities in the short, medium and long term. A growth that benefits all our stakeholders, not least our tenants. If our tenants thrive, this will create value for our shareholders in the form of capital appreciation and increased cash flows.

DIÖS FASTIGHETER AB Annual Report 2019 15 Case: Sundsvall Genuine urban development Sundsvall can serve as an example of “genuine urban development”. Here, out-of-town shopping centres have been pushing flows and commerce out of the city centre. This has affected the trading environ­ ment for retailers and rents for offices.

City blocks, experiences and flows The In:gallerian shopping centre, which is spread across three buildings in the centre of Sundsvall, is undergoing a refurbishment. New concepts will be included and launched, access will be improved and the focus is on enhancing the experience. We are opening up and creating access to previously hidden spaces and creating new prime locations. Through colocation, synergies can be created. Increased density through new builds In the very heart of town, in a previous car park, we are building a new hotel that will be run by Nordic Choice. The hotel will become a meeting place for visitors as well as local residents, with inspiring environments in the form of a restaurant, bar and spa. Planning permission also exists for an adjoining plot, where opportunities to further increase density are being explored. We are confident that increased density, the right content and inspiring environments will increase the flow of people. This creates a safer city and a more attractive city centre as well as good prospects for growth.

For Diös, the goal is to make life in the city better fore everyone, round the clock. To be clear, we try to encourage bold, hands-on leadership with a sense of responsibility for the employees and for the company’s development. Committed and inspiring employees with the right focus, coupled with clear leadership, will help us achieve the level of growth we are striving for.

Risks and risk management Effective prevention, identification and management of risks is crucial to our ability to generate the greatest possible value for our stakeholders. Risks can arise in other areas of the business and can be due to internal as well as external factors. Ultimate responsibility for the company’s risk management rests with the Board of Directors. The CEO and senior management are responsible for ensuring that the Board’s instructions are exe­ cuted, and that procedures and processes exist and are complied with. Our risk universe is divided into three categories: strategic, operational and financial risks. A presentation of risks (to the left) that are considered to have the greatest impact on the Group and how they are managed (to the right) is given below. Strategic risks Strategic risks can affect our ability to implement our business strategies, achieve our long-term goals and create value for our stakeholders. Strategic risks include external as well as internal factors. These risks are identified and managed by the Board of Board members and senior management, and are normally discussed at Board meetings. External risks Political and macroeconomic events can have a direct or indirect impact on our A decentralised organisation with a local presence can adapt the business to new market and on the property industry.

The financial operations must be conducted so that the costs for financial risk management are minimised. This means that financial transactions are based on an estimate of the Group’s requirements for funding, liquidity and interest rate risk. An inter-company transaction, such as an internal loan, does not therefore necessarily mean that an identical external loan transaction is also carried out. External loans are taken up once the Group’s aggregate borrowing requirements have been assessed. A group accounts system enables net management of the Group’s payment flows. The Group’s interest rate risk is managed cost-effectively by assessing the interest rate risk that arises when an individual loan with a short fixed-interest term is raised. Interest-rate derivative transactions will subsequently be carried out as needed to achieve the desired fixed-rate term for the Group’s overall loan portfolio. 102 DIÖS FASTIGHETER AB Annual Report 2019 Cecilia Östlund, Property Manager, Diös tenant Elin Bogren, Site Manager DoSpace, and Daniel Jansson Westblom, Letting Agent, Norr 31:9 in Gävle.

OPERATING RESULTS The operations are governed based partly on the objective of generating capital growth by increasing the surplus ratio and thereby the cash flow from operating activities, i.e. increased income from property management. We also report the alternative performance indicators property management income and EPRA earnings, as these are deemed to be relevant for investors and analysts, and provide additional information on the company’s operating results. The indicators provide a picture which excludes factors that are partly beyond the control of the company, such as changes in the value of properties and derivatives. 2019 2018 12 mths 12 mths Property management income Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Profit before tax 1,302 1,597 Reversal Change in value, properties -350 -687 Change in value, derivatives -0 -16 Property management income 952 894 EPRA earnings (property management income after tax) Property management income 952 894 Reversal, current tax property management income -78 -77 Minority share of earnings -9 -3 EPRA earnings 865 814 EPRA earnings per share, SEK 6.43 6.05 FINANCIAL RISK Our strategy is urban development. Diös seeks to run its business in a sustainable manner with a stable financial risk. This is expressed in the ambition to ensure that the loan-to-value ratio does not exceed 55 per cent over extended periods and to maintain an equity ratio in excess of 35 per cent. The loan-to-value ratio and equity ratio show the company’s financial stability while the interest coverage ratio shows the company’s ability to pay interest. Net debt to EBITDA shows our ability to generate cash flow in relation to our liabilities. These key ratios are deemed to be relevant for investors and analysts from a financial risk perspective. Our loan-to-value ratio, equity ratio and interest coverage ratio also constitute covenants from the company’s lenders and the Board has defined targets for these key ratios, which are used to govern the company’s activities. 2019 2018 12 mths 12 mths Loan-to-value ratio Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Interest-bearing liabilities 12,145 11,099 Investment properties 22,885 20,802 Loan-to-value ratio, % 53.1 53.4 Equity ratio Equity 8,484 7,839 Total assets 23,187 21,057 Equity ratio, % 36.6 37.2 Interest coverage ratio Property management income 952 894 Reversal Net financial items 170 183 Total 1,122 1,077 Financial costs 170 183 Interest coverage ratio, times 6.6 5.9 112 DIÖS FASTIGHETER AB Annual Report 2019 KEY RATIOS, GRI AND DEFINITIONS FINANCIAL KEY RATIOS CONT. 2019 2018 12 mths 12 mths Net debt to EBITDA Jan–Dec Jan–Dec Interest-bearing liabilities as per balance sheet 12,145 11,099 Cash and cash equivalents Overdraft facilities 206 198 Net debt 12,351 11,297 Operating surplus as per income statement 1,187 1,140 Central administration as per income statement -73 -71 Reversal Depreciation and amortisation 5 2 EBITDA 1,119 1,071 Net debt to EBITDA 11.0 10.5 NET ASSET VALUE Net asset value is the total capital which the company manages on behalf of its owners. Based on this capital, we aim to generate returns and growth while maintaining a low risk. Net asset value can also be calculated on a long-term and short-term basis. Long-term NAV is based on the balance sheet after adjusting for items which involve no near-term outgoing payments, which refers, for example, to the fair value of financial instruments (derivatives) and deferred tax on temporary differences. The current net asset value consists of equity according to the balance sheet after adjusting for the market value of the deferred tax liability. EPRA NAV and EPRA NNNAV are designed to show the size of the company’s equity in case of a liquidation in the short and long term. These performance indicators can be compared with the company’s share price to obtain a picture of how the shares are valued in relation to equity. 2019 2018 12 mths 12 mths Net asset value Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Equity as per balance sheet 8,484 7,839 Minority share of equity -58 -49 Reversal Fair value of financial instruments 0 -1 Deferred tax on temporary differences 1,450 1,299 EPRA NAV (long-term net asset value) 9,876 9,088 EPRA NAV (long-term net asset value) per share, SEK 73.4 67.6 Deductions Fair value of financial instruments 0 1 Estimated actual deferred tax on temporary differences, approx. 4%1 -270 -242 EPRA NNNAV (short-term net asset value) 9,606 8,847 EPRA NNNAV (short-term net asset value) per share, SEK 71.4 65.8 1 Estimated actual deferred tax has been calculated at approx. four per cent based on a discount rate of three per cent. The calculation is based on the assumption that the property portfolio will be realised over a period of 50 years, with ten per cent of the portfolio being sold directly subject to a nominal tax rate of 20.6 per cent, and the remaining 90 per cent being sold indirectly through companies subject to a nominal tax rate of six per cent. DIÖS FASTIGHETER AB Annual Report 2019 113 KEY RATIOS, GRI AND DEFINITIONS FINANCIAL KEY RATIOS CONT. OTHER KEY RATIOS Other key ratios refer to a number of measures of return which are used to describe various aspects of the statement of financial position and to give investors and analysts further information about the operations. We report return on equity, equity per share and cash flow per share, as these performance indicators show the company’s results and profitability, equity on a per share basis, and the company’s ability to fulfil its obligations and pay dividends to the shareholders. These alternative performance indicators supplement the picture given of Diös’ financial performance and enable investors and analysts to gain a better understanding of the company’s return and results. Yield is a measure of the results generated by the properties in relation to their market value. It shows the profitability of the properties and is considered to provide supplementary information for investors and analysts concerning the risk in the portfolio. The debt/equity ratio is presented in order to supplement the picture of the company’s financial situation. It shows the ratio of interest-bearing liabilities to equity. The measure is considered to enhance investors’ and analysts’ ability to assess the company’s financial stability. 2019 2018 12 mths 12 mths Jan-Dec Jan-Dec Return on equity, % 12.8 18.2 Equity per share, SEK 63.1 58.3 Cash flow per share, SEK Profit before tax 1,302 1,597 Reversal Unrealised change in value, properties -331 -678 Unrealised change in value, derivatives 0 -16 Depreciation and amortisation 5 2 Current tax -79 -90 Total 897 815 Average number of shares (‘000) 134,512 134,512 Cash flow per share, SEK 6.67 6.05 Earnings per share, SEK 7.74 9.94 Debt/equity ratio, times 1.4 1.4 OTHER INFORMATION We also report data for economic occupancy, surplus ratio and vacancy rate, as these performance indicators provide a more in-depth picture of the company’s financial performance with regard to revenues in the properties and thus also in the company.
