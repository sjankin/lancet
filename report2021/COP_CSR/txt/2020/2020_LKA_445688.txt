The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns (i.e., by geography, product type, customer type and rating, and coverage by letters of credit and other forms of credit insurance). The provision matrix is initially based on the Group’s historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. For instance, if forecast economic conditions are expected to deteriorate over the next year which can lead to an increased number of defaults in the relevant sectors, the historical default rates are adjusted. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed. The assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Group’s historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer’s actual default in the future. The information about the ECLs on the Group’s loans and trade receivables is disclosed in Note 22 to the Financial Statements. 130 Overview I Leadership I Governance I Sector Performance I Financial Statements 6.

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such Plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to Mature. Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC The fair value of matured managed trees were ascertained in accordance with SLFRS 13. The valuation was carried by Messer’s Sunil Fernando & Associates (Pvt) Ltd, chartered valuation surveyors, using Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, a physical verification was carried out covering all the estates. Kelani Valley Plantations PLC The fair value of managed trees was ascertained in accordance with SLFRS 13. The valuation was carried out by Messer’s KPMG Sri Lanka, using Market Approach. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, a physical verification was carried out covering the estates on sample basis. 16.1 Information About Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Talawakelle Tea Estates PLC Non Financial Asset Valuation Unobservable inputs Range of unobservable inputs Relationship of Unobservable technique (Probability weighted average) Inputs to Fair Value 2020 2019 Consumable managed Discounted Discounting Rate 17.5% 17.5% The higher the discount rate, the biological assets cash flows lesser the fair value Optimum rotation 25-35 Years 25-35 Years Lower the rotation period, the (Maturity) higher the fair value Volume at rotation 25-85 cu.ft 25-85 cu.ft The higher the price per cu. dcm., the higher the fair value Price per cu.ft.

The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long term exploitation of the timber plantations. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long term price projections are highly unpredictable. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations are as follows; It does, nevertheless, concern the directors that no estimate of fair value can ever be completely accurate. Moreover, in the case of the group’s biological assets, small differences in valuation assumptions can have a quite disproportionate effect on results. Another concern is that, as shown from an international benchmark, there is currently no uniform approach within the plantation sector when it comes to defining the major variables, such as selling price and/or discount rates, in the DCF models resulting in the LKAS 41 values. The carrying amount of biological assets pledged as securities for liabilities as at the date of the statement of Financial Position is Rs. Nil. (2019 Rs. Nil).

Rs.140 to Rs.450 to The higher the price per cu. ft., the Rs.2,800 Rs.9,000 higher the fair value Other key assumptions used in valuation 1. It is assume that the felling of trees will be undertaken at maturity for the period not covered under the Forestry Management Plan. Majority of the timber trees which have reached their maturity at the date of valuation are valued using the adjusted market prices based on the location and accessibility. Remaining timber trees which have not come up to a harvestable age are valued considering their future incremental growth in the coming years and discounting the future value of such trees by appropriate present value discount ratio, which is assumed as the Expected Rate of Return (ERR) of a rationale investor, i.e. 15.0%. 2. The price adopted could vary based on the species and the girth of the respective species and are on the spare net of expenditure. 3. Though the replanting is a condition precedent for harvesting, yet the cost are not taken in to consideration. 4. Pre commercial stand are valued on cost approach and 15 years is taken as per merchantable depending on the growth. 5. Contiguous area of trees with trees a similar specie silviculture and other characteristics. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on market values, take into account the possible market conditions and long-term exploitation of the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the active market prices and other variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that active market price projections are highly unpredictable. The sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations are as follows, 152 Overview I Leadership I Governance I Sector Performance I Financial Statements 16.2 Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity variation sales price Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to price changes with regard to the average sales prices applied.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: • The carrying value of available for sale financial instruments at fair value through OCI and financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss at fair value. • Cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits, trade and other receivables, amounts due to/from subsidiaries, amounts due from equity accounted investees and trade and other payables approximate their carrying values largely due to the short term maturities of these instruments. • The Fair value of financial assets at amortised cost and financial liabilities at amortised cost is not significantly different from the value based on amortised cost methodology. 20 Other Non Current Assets Consolidated Company As at 31st March 2020 2019

(7,989,127) 201 Hayleys PLC Annual Report 2019/20 Notes to the Financial Statements 42 Financial Risk Management The Group has exposure to the following risk from financial instruments: 1 Credit risk 2 Liquidity risk 3 Market risk This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated Financial Statements. Financial Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Group’s Financial risk management policies. The Group’s Financial risk management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor Financial risks and adherence to limits. Financial Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by Group Treasury that have the appropriate skills and experience. The Group Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the financial risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Group Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by the Management Audit System Review Department(MASRD). MASRD undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of Financial risk management policies and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Group Audit Committee. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that a counter party will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from trade receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. Trade and other receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, when available, and in some cases bank references. Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Management; these limits are reviewed quarterly. Customers that fail to meet the Group’s benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis. Outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored at the individual sector and Group Management Committee (GMC) level. Further SLECIC cover or other forms of credit insurance is obtained for most exports or in the instance this is not obtained, specific GMC approval is obtained prior to the export. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, including whether they are an individual or legal entity, whether they are a wholesale, retail or end-user customer, geographic location, industry, ageing profile, maturity and existence of previous financial difficulties. Trade and other receivables relate mainly to the Group’s wholesale customers. Customers that are considered as “high risk” are placed on a restricted customer list and future sales are made on a prepayment basis. The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments. For trade receivables and contract assets, the Group applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs. 70 bn ( 2019 Rs. 67 bn) which is recorded at Note 22 to the Financial Statements. 202 Overview I Leadership I Governance I Sector Performance I Financial Statements Investments Credit risk from invested balances with the financial institutions are managed by the Group’s treasury department in accordance with the Group’s policy. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counter parties and within credit limits assigned to each counter party. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counter party’s failure. Treasury bills Singer Finance (Lanka) PLC invests not less than 7.5% of the public deposits in Treasury Bills to comply with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Direction No. 1 of 2009. Cash and cash equivalents The Group held cash in hand and at bank equivalents of Rs. 8 bn at 31 March 2020 (2019 -Rs. 9 bn) which represents its maximum credit exposure on these assets. Respective credit ratings of banks which group cash balances held are as follows; • People’s Bank – AA+(lka) • Standard Chartered Bank – AAA (lka) • Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC – AA(lka) • Sampath Bank PLC – A+ (lka) • Nations Trust Bank PLC – A( lka) • Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC Bank– BBB( lka) • Hatton National Bank PLC– AA-(lka) • Bank of Ceylon– AA+(lka) • DFCC Bank– AA-( lka) • Citibank -AAA( lka) • Seylan Bank PLC -A-( lka) • National Development Bank PLC A+ (lka) • Union Bank of Colombo PLCBB+ (lka) Source http://www.fitchratings.lk Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, and finance leases. The Group assessed the concentration of risk with respect to refinancing its debt and concluded it to be low. Access to sources of funding is sufficiently available and debt maturing within 12 months can be rolled over with existing lenders. Group Treasury receives information from other business units regarding the liquidity profile of their financial assets and liabilities and details of other projected cash flows arising from projected future business. The liquidity requirements of business units and subsidiaries are met through central cash management by Group Treasury to cover any short-term fluctuations and longer term funding to address any structural liquidity requirements. The Group Treasury monitors the cash flows in subsidiary and Group level and obtains adequate bank facilities to meet the funding requirements. The Group does not concentrate on a single financial institution, thereby minimising the expose to liquidity risk through diversification of funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and group level by funding the long term investment with long term financial sources in terms of equity, debenture or long term loans. Short term investments are funded using short term loans. Group has been successful in arranging long term funding from overseas as measure to diversify its funding sources which enabled reducing the sole dependency on domestic market for project financing. The Group also issued a debentures in domestic market as a measure to reduce its dependency on local banking system for all its financing requirement and thereby freeing available banking lines for future projects. 203 Hayleys PLC Annual Report 2019/20 Notes to the Financial Statements 42 Financial Risk Management (Contd.) The monthly liquidity position is monitored by the Group Treasury. All liquidity policies and procedures are subject to review and approval by Board of Directors.

Market prices comprise four types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk and other price risk, such as equity price risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings, deposits, financial assets designated at fair value through OCI, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return. The sensitivity analysis in the following sections relate to the position as at 31 March 2020 and 2019. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group mainly borrows in the short term to fund its working capital requirement which are linked to floating interest rates. For other funding needs the Group maintains a proper mix of interest rate based on the basis of the predictability of future cash flows. Group Treasury closely monitors the interest rate fluctuations in the market and advices the sectors of the Group on a regular basis. Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s profit before tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows: Consolidated Company Increase/decrease Effect on profit Effect on profit in base point before tax before tax Rs.’000 Rs.’000 2020 + 150 (165,960) (38,922) 150 165,960 38,922 2019 + 150 (167,065) (35,499) 150 167,065 35,499 Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings and net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group. These currencies primarily are the Euro, US Dollars (USD), Bangladesh Taka, Pound Sterling (GBP), Indonesia Rupiah and Thailand Baht. The Group hedges its exposure to fluctuations on the translation of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps, forwards contracts and hedge accounting. Group Treasury closely monitors the exchange rate fluctuations and advices the sectors on a regular basis. Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar and Euro exchange rate, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s profit before tax is due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. The Group’s exposure to foreign currency changes for all other currencies is not material. 205 Hayleys PLC Annual Report 2019/20 Notes to the Financial Statements 42 Financial Risk Management (Contd.)

Its operating activities require the ongoing purchase and manufacturing process. Due to the significantly increased volatility of the price of the underlying, the management has developed and enacted a risk management strategy regarding commodity price risk and its mitigation. The sectors constantly monitor the Raw material price levels of Charcoal, Rubber, Aluminum and Yarn for downwards trends and invest in bulk purchase when low prices are prevalent. Management may revise the selling price based on the commodity prices whenever possible. Equity price risk The Group’s listed and unlisted equity securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. The Group manages the equity price risk through diversification and by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments. Management of the Group monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market indices. Material investments within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decisions are approved by the GMC. Equity price risk is not material to the financial statements. Capital Management The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business. Capital consists of share capital, reserves, retained earnings and non-controlling interests of the Group. The Board of Directors monitors the return on capital as well as the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.

The details of the computation of risk weighted assets, capital and the ratios of the Singer Finance PLC are given below: Capital Adequacy of Singer Finance PLC Capital adequacy is a measure of financial institutions financial strength and stability. This widely accepted concept tries to specify the limit up to which a business can expand in terms of its risk – weighted assets. Finance companies in pursuit of business expansion, could engage themselves in activities that regularly change their risk profile. In light of this, regulatory capital requirements have been established to avoid undue expansion beyond specified limits keeping a hold on companies’ exposure to risk. Capital serves as a comfort to absorb unexpected losses, providing a degree of security to depositors and other key stakeholders. This measure has been introduced by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to protect the interest of the various stakeholders of the Company while ensuring the maintenance of confidence and stability of the financial system. The capital adequacy ratio is calculated as a percentage on company’s capital to its risk weighted assets as specified by the direction No 03 of 2018 with effect from 1st July 2018 . Previously, Capital Adequacy ratio was computed based on the Direction No.02 of 2006 and by the circular issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka dated 15/03/3017. Based on the Direction No. 03 of 2018 the Listed Finance Companies which are having asset base less than 100 Billion need to be have minimum Core Capital Ratio (Tier-I) of 6.5% and 10.5% based on the Total Capital Ratio (Tier-II) . This minimum requirement will increase to 7% and 11% respectively with effect from 1st July 2020. The core capital represents the permanent shareholders’, equity and reserves created or increase by appropriations of retained earnings or other surpluses and the total capital includes in addition to the core capital, the revaluation reserves, general provisions and other hybrid capital instruments and unsecured subordinated debts. The Risk Weighted Assets have been calculated by multiplying the value of each category of asset using the risk weight specified by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. Details of the computation and the resulting ratios are given below: Total Risk-Weighted Assets Computation Balance Risk-Weighted Risk-Weighted Factor Balance As at 31st March 2020 2019 2020 2019 Rs.’000 Rs.’000 % Rs.’000 Rs.’000 Assets Risk Weighted Amount for Credit Risk Notes and Coins 67,950 99,121 0% Cash Items in the Process of Collection 28,565 186,978 20% 5,713 37,396 Fixed Assets 796,211 221,001 1.00 796,211 221,001 Other Assets/Exposures 654,518 518,007 1.00 654,518 518,007 Investment in Government Securities 789,889 623,372 0% Bank deposits 101,394 83,324 20% 20,279 16,665 Retail claims in respect of motor vehicles and machinery 11,169,782 7,935,770 100% 11,169,782 7,935,771 207 Hayleys PLC Annual Report 2019/20 Notes to the Financial Statements 42 Financial Risk Management (Contd.)

The new capital adequacy framework covers both credit risk and operational risk.

Impact of COVID-19 Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hayleys PLC and its subsidiaries have been operating with strict adherence to the guidelines issued by the Government to curtail the spread of the virus. In this context, ensuring the health and safety of the Group employees is of paramount importance and we have facilitated appropriate work-from-home and remote working measures for our office employees. Sanitizing and other safety measures have also been implemented at all operating locations including manufacturing facilities and estates. In ensuring continuity of business in these challenging times, the Group launched “Haysmart Initiatives”, which sets out clear guidelines for cost rationalisation, external support and exploring new opportunities. Accordingly, the Group has introduced numerous cost saving measures, including deferment of all recruitment, capital expenditure and advertising/promotion expenses. Further the Group has widened in marketing capabilities through enhancement of Digital Marketing as well as active social media presence. The Hayleys Group Executive Directors and the Members of the Group Management Committee (GMC) have voluntarily taken a reduction on their remuneration. The board having recognised that these are challenging times for everyone, and despite the extremely difficult operating conditions, the Group has thus far decided to maintain full salaries of all employees. The Group is also pursuing measures to reduce debtor exposure and inventory levels and proactively engaging with banks and suppliers to renegotiate terms in order to effectively manage liquidity levels. Impact of COVID-19 on our Key Business Sectors • Global Markets and Manufacturing: Comprising the Group’s interests in Hand Protection, Purification, Textiles and Eco Solutions this subgroup of sectors which are export-oriented businesses collectively contributes to 28% of the consolidated Revenue. The Group anticipates a degree of resilience for certain products in the Purification and Hand Protection Sectors, given the increasing importance of health and safety considerations. Similarly, the Textiles Sector on the other hand, has seen a shift in orders from fashion and sport centric to fabric suitable for the health sector which is presently in large demand. Manufacturing operations in Sri Lanka which were temporarily halted following the imposition of curfew in the 3rd week of March, have recommenced, and are rapidly ramping up production with some manufacturing plants, now at full operating capacity, whilst production facilities in other regions such as Indonesia and Thailand are also fully operational. Order books in the Hand Protection, Purification and the Textile sectors remain strong, and we will continue to fulfil customer requirements. • Transportation and Logistics: Restrictions imposed on imports to the country, global decline in trading activities and the reduced domestic demand and distribution has had a direct impact on the International Freight Management and Integrated Logistic sub-segments; while a significant impact was also seen in the Marine services sub-segment, in trading bunker fuel due to the sudden crash in world bunker prices. • Consumer and Retail: The Group’s Consumer and Retail arm, Singer Sri Lanka recorded a downturn in volumes reflecting limited consumer mobility and closure of outlets in line with the imposition of curfew. Meanwhile the sharp depreciation of the Sri Lankan Rupee since endMarch 2020, and expectations of declines in disposable incomes is likely to have a considerable impact on the Sector performance over the medium term, while this could be further compounded if import restrictions on non-essential items persist. On the other hand, we anticipate more favourable pricing and credit terms from suppliers given the global market conditions. Meanwhile, Puritas, which manufactures Oxypura face masks, has seen higher demand levels, reflecting increased emphasis on health and safety considerations. • Plantations and Agriculture: This sub-sector comprises the Group’s interests in Agriculture and Tea and Rubber Plantations (through two regional plantation companies). Agriculture sector answered the government’s call to facilitate the crop establishment and farming as a responsible corporate stepping forward to produce and distribute the agricultural inputs navigating through border restrictions and the sector continues to manage operations during trying times. In Plantations, Estates are operational at normal levels at the moment and considerable investments have been directed towards preventive/curative health and safety measures in line with all recommended health, work place safety and sanitation protocols recommended by the authorities. Tea Auctions were conducted electronically after a lapse of two weeks, which saw an improvement in prices although it should be noted that quantities were very low due to crop losses arising from the prolonged drought in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the anti-viral properties of black tea, particularly in Ceylon Tea which has a relatively high level of Polyphenol is likely to result in a higher demand given the current prevalence for healthy beverages which has antidote properties. The Rubber prices continue to remain at the same levels before the COVID pandemic but it is expected that demand will escalate due to the increased requirement for health and safety related products. Key downside risks are the rising cost of production and possible disruptions to the global distribution and supply chains. 210 Overview I Leadership I Governance I Sector Performance I Financial Statements • Leisure: The most distinct impact of the pandemic will be felt in the Group’s leisure sector. Most of the Group’s hotel properties have recorded zero/near minimum occupancies over the past few weeks due to travel restrictions, border closure and limited mobility and the medium-term outlook for the sector remains bleak. Even though a debt moratorium has been granted to this sector, further assistance may be required towards meeting the cost of staff salaries to avert salary reductions and layoffs that would cause considerable hardship to these employees who have already lost a significant portion of their monthly income due to the loss of service charge. The Group is also currently exploring means of consolidating operations and optimising resources in a bid to stem losses and manage liquidity levels. • Construction: The Segment consists of operations involved in manufacturing of aluminium extrusions & aluminium fabrication and also offers integrated engineering solutions. Sector Performance is directly linked to the country’s construction industry which has recorded a sharp decline as both residential and commercial projects have been halted/ delayed due to lockdown measures and liquidity shortfalls. As organisations seek to defer capital expenditure, demand is likely to be considerably impacted over the short-to-medium term. Meanwhile, the cost of imported raw material will be impacted by the sharp depreciation of the Rupee and disruptions to global supply chains, although this could be partially offset by the softening of the global metal prices. • Industry Inputs and Power and Energy: Demand for industrial material have recorded a decline reflecting the downturn in industrial activity. However, the Group expect orders for life science/ healthcare solutions to be somewhat resilient, given the current focus on health and safety. Operations in Power & Energy continuing without interruption, although we foresee delays in receiving payments from the Government due to escalating pressure on government finances. Future outlook Given the current uncertainty regarding the duration and intensity of the pandemic in Sri Lanka and globally, more time is required to assess and quantify the exact impact of COVID-19 on the Group’s operations. However, our diversity in terms of businesses and geographies is likely to enable a degree of resilience. Strategies implemented to preserve liquidity and curtail losses are being reviewed on a weekly basis by the Group Management Committee and with the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Further measures may be introduced to effectively address emerging business realities. Details of sector wise impact of COVID-19 are given in pages 54 to 65 to the Financial Statements. 211 Hayleys PLC Annual Report 2019/20 Ten Year Summary As at 31st March 10-Year 2020 2019 2018 2017
