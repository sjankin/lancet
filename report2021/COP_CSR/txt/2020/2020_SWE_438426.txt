The amount of steel that SSAB supplies above standard practice in the respective industry is calculated for each application (e.g. a truck). This allows determination of the weight saving achieved in the end product by using these higher-strength steels. The resulting fuel savings are estimated by using typical values for fuel consumption, driving distance, useful life, etc. Finally, the CO2 emissions saved are then calculated based on these fuel savings.

Sustainable offering Potential of SSAB´s products and solutions, including high-strength steels Why the topic is material Climate change underlines the need for SSAB to develop resource efficient, green solutions, which will also improve the competitive position of SSAB and its customers. SSAB’s sustainable offering is what we offer our customers. The core of SSAB’s business is to develop and produce Advanced High-Strength Steels (AHSS) and Quenched and Tempered Steels (Q&T) that are stronger than ordinary steels. This in turn helps our customers to produce lighter and stronger products, thus reducing their environmental footprint. This is SSAB’s most important contribution to mitigating climate change. How the topic is managed SSAB works with our customers to upgrade their products using high-strength steels. This means using less steel while reducing weight, improving fuel economy and extending product lifetime – all of which significantly contribute to reducing a product’s environmental footprint. SSAB’s vision – “A stronger, lighter and more sustainable world” – serves as the basis for how we manage this topic. Our vision means that together with our customers, we will go further than anyone else in realizing the full potential of lighter, stronger and more durable steel products. SSAB’s “Taking the Lead” strategy continues to drive the strategic decisions and actions of the company. One of the main themes in the strategy is the “Global leadership in high-strength steels.” Read more in BR p. 22-26. SSAB’s sustainability strategy supports SSAB’s “Taking the Lead” strategy with three focus areas – Sustainable Offering, Sustainable Operations and Responsible Partner. Read more in SR p. 48. By using SSAB’s high-strength steels, which result in lower weight and improved fuel economy, customers can achieve significant CO2 savings during their end products’ use-phase. The objective for Sustainable Offering is that, by the end of 2020, these annual customer CO2 savings will reach 10 million tonnes, which is slightly more than SSAB´s own direct CO2 emissions. To remain at the forefront in the industry, SSAB will continue to invest in research and development, technical customer support and joint innovation initiatives to get the most out of SSAB’s high-strength and advanced high-strength steels, and premium steels.

(probability of occurrence) based on a specific classification system. SSAB’s insurance function is tasked with procuring group-wide protection for the insurable risks. The management of financial risks is centralized on the Group’s treasury function. SSAB has an internal control function that supports operations in identifying risk areas and, based on a risk analysis, establishes control processes to mitigate identified risk areas. Also, SSAB has an internal audit unit which, among other tasks, based on a risk analysis conducts audits of internal controls and processes followed by recommendations for improvements within these areas. The internal audit unit reports directly to the Audit Committee. For full information about the Group’s internal audit function, see the Corporate Governance Report. Sustainability risks are integrated into the strategy and risk management processes, and hence there is no separate process for identifying or mitigating sustainability risks. All SSAB production sites are certified according to ISO 14001, in which risks are addressed. Certification also means that all our sites have been audited by a third party.

Subsequent measurement of the right-of-use asset is at acquisition value less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment, and taking into account any remeasurements. Depreciation is Spot purchases and sales of financial assets are reported on the Settlement day, i.e. the day on which the asset recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term or over the economic life of the asset if it is reasonably is delivered.

In the contribution-based plans, payments are recognized as an expense during the period when the employees have performed the services to which the fees relate. Blue collar Inventories employees in Sweden are covered by such a contribution-based plan. Inventories are valued at the lower of acquisition cost and net realizable value. In the benefit-based plans, compensation is payable to employees and former employees based on salary at the The Group applies the FIFO method (first in, first out) or weighted average value method to estimate the time of retirement and upon termination of employment and the number of years in service.

The average figures can be calculated periodically or at each additional delivery, depending on the conditions of the individual company.

With respect that increase their entitlement to future compensation. The obligation is calculated by independent actuaries to products in the trading operations, the replacement cost with an added estimated gross margin is used as the and constitutes the present value of the anticipated future disbursements. The discount rate that is applied best gauge of the net realizable value. In respect of raw materials, the replacement cost is used as the best gauge corresponds to the rate of interest on high-quality corporate bonds with a term to maturity which corresponds to of the net realizable value.
