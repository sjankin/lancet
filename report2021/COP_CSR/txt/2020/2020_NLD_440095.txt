We follow the guidelines of local governments in the countries we operate strictly and have taken the necessary measures to keep our employees and external stakeholders safe. B&S highly values the engagement with its various stakeholders. The partnerships we form with our suppliers and customers are essential to our successful long-term growth. In delivering our products, we adhere to strict standards regarding food safety and customs compliance and seek to minimise the impact we have on our environment. B&S is a value adding distribution partner of consumer goods in specialised niche markets worldwide. We provide capillary distribution services for hard to reach locations including Maritime, Remote and specific Retail (B2B) markets in over 100 countries. Our overall focus lies on long-term value creation by pursuing sustainable and profitable growth. In 2019 we initiated a review of our multiple year strategy to keep in tune with market developments and capture growth opportunities both organically and through strategic M&A. This resulted in four strategic focus areas with corresponding direction for the coming years: centralisation of our operations, digital transformation, focus on growth markets and organic expansion of our business. B&S is highly committed to maintain high ethical, social, environmental and governance standards and creating sustainable value for all our stakeholders. In order to advance our commitment to sustainability and corporate citizenship, we signed up as a member of the United Nations Global Compact in September 2010. Being part of the UN Global Compact highlights our commitment to the ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor rights, the environment and anti-corruption. With this letter I am pleased to reiterate our continued support for the principles of United Nations Global compact (UNGC). We intend to continue, to embrace, support and implement these principles within our sphere of influence. We remain committed to making the Global Compact and its principles part of the strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company. We support accountability and transparency. Our company continues to make a clear statement of its commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. On behalf of B&S Group J.B.

UNITED NATIONS GLOBAL COMPACT Sustainable business UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 13 4. SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS Sustainability is a vital part of our corporate culture, which is necessary to continue to increase our long-term success and to minimise our future development risks. Our CSR policy is based on three pillars: Environmental Responsibility, Social Engagement and Economic Enhancement. Developing and maintaining sustainable relationships with our stakeholders along the value chain is key to our success. The partnerships we form with our suppliers and customers are essential to our successful long-term growth, which is why we are committed to be a responsible, well-respected and reliable organisation, maintaining high ethical standards in all aspects of our business. Our employees are key to maintaining these partnerships, which is why significant attention is paid to providing a safe and secure working environment. In 2019, specific focus areas included corporate Safety & Security and Food safety & compliance. In 2018, B&S Group installed a Corporate Safety & Security department on a centralised level to support and advise on Safety & Security matters at segmental level, while maintaining focus on the specific characteristics of each of the business segments and operations. The main focus on the department is the wellbeing of employees and protection of information and property. The overarching principle is: preventing, limiting and controlling unwanted events. It is important to be “in control” based on all available safety, security and integrity risks. To achieve this, an integrated approach in collaboration with various departments such as logistics, human resources, finance, ICT and facilities is crucial. We’ve created a specific house style and internal campaign to emphasize the importance of safety and security within our organisation. 14 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 4.1.

Employee empowerment We provide a workplace that is free from discrimination harassment and victimisation, where everyone receives equal treatment. Our people are given autonomy in performing their tasks, and we encourage them to act as pioneers and entrepreneurs. Keeping a positive working atmosphere is also about creating a healthy workplace, giving people energy and self-confidence. To that end, we provide free access to a gym and organize several sport events each year, encouraging employees to exercise during and TopDesk after working hours. In 2020 we implemented TopDesk. A self-service portal through which employees can submit requests for support or report issues concerning IT, safety and security or facilities. We want to give employees an easy way of making reports, which resulted in a portal where employees can send in a ticket and manage their report in one place. Complaints, malfunctions, wishes and requests for information can now be reported via Topdesk’s Self Service Portal. When an employee reports an issue, the report will also immediately enter the system of the relevant department. Automating this process allows us to cut-short the lead time of the handling of an issue. The employee will also automatically receive updates about their report and see if the issue has been resolved. This helps the company to better map all reports, keep employees up to date faster and provide them with the right information. Together we ensure a clean, whole and safe B&S where everyone gets the opportunity to be part of the solution.

B&S’ approach in the Netherlands is based on recommendations made by the government, including the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as the local Public Health Service. For employees working at airports we are following airport policy and recommendations of the local government. From the 11th of March, parts of our offices were closed. T h i s w a s s h o r t l y fo l l o w e d b y s t r i c t e r r u l e s , w h e re b y all the office staff were required to work from home. In May 2020 the Dutch government softend the COVID-19 measures. In the meantime B&S has been working on rearanging our office and warehouses workspaces to allign with the 1.5m social distancing norm in the Netherlands. To offer a safe and healthy workspace we have implemented physical measures and rules. Therefore we appointed a special taskforce, that among other things made a special corona handout, where colleagues can read all the rules that are applicable on location. In this way we can slowly and safely return back to the office. Measures at the shops in Afghanistan/Mali All shops are normally open for 7 days a week, from 09.00 till 20.00pm. Although the opening hours remained the same as from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the new situation asks for a lot of extra precautionary measures from our colleagues. Both the teams in Afghanistan and Mali have completed the COVID-19 prevention online training with Highfields online training with a certificate to confirm. At the shops, we follow almost the same social distancing rules applicable in regular stores in many parts of the world, such as:  Limiting the number of customers to a maximum of 4 persons at one time  Mandatory facemasks when entering the shop  Continuous disinfection of door knobs, shopping baskets, the areas around cash registers, etc.  Makeshift Handwashing and sanitizing at the entrance All these measures require extra manpower. Only in that way are they able to constantly control people when entering the shop and keep the shops safe for both clients and our own staff. Our staff is handling the situation very well and with the utmost care. 28 UN Global Compact Communication on Progress 6.4.
