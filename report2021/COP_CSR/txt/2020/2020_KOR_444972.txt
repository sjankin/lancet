KOWEPO identified four major strategies and eight implementation programs to secure facility Economy GRI 201-1, 203-2 reliability. Achieving the Highest Reliability of Facilities through The Importance of Economic Issues Goal Realizing 4 Zeros (zero faults, zero accidents, zero defects, zero losses) via CORE Activities Stable power supply by power-generation companies is highly important. Today, electricity has become an indispensable and essential energy source, and interruptions of power-supply result in enormous economic and social costs in our society. At the same time, seamless power supply requires sustainable management by the power-generation company. Accordingly, power-generation companies should ensure a stable operation of facilities and continuous profit generation, as well as strengthen the ability to develop new businesses for future growth. In addition, power-generation companies should proactively respond to paradigm shifts in the energy industry by supplying electricity in an eco-friendly manner.
