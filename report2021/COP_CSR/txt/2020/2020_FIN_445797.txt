These focus areas are put into practice through action plans that are followed at all levels of the organization. Theme owners have been appointed by the Ensto Management Team. These persons are responsible for developing and enhancing these themes. Best Employee Experience: The target of Best Employee Experience is to attract, develop and retain the best talents. Smart Solution Creation: Smart Solution Creation concentrates on supporting customers in sustainability by creating smart and safe solutions with low environmental impact. Responsible Sourcing: In Responsible Sourcing we concentrate on increasing transparency in sourcing activities. Lean Manufacturing and Delivery: Within the theme Lean Manufacturing and Delivery we concentrate on eﬃcient operation by reducing energy consumption and material wastage, minimizing environmental impacts and utilizing circular economy. 10 Ensto and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Ensto has selected seven United Nations Sustainable Development Goals that we have the most impact on. The UN Sustainable Development Goals are a worldwide action plan – the 2030 UN Agenda – to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. By integrating the selected goals to our business, we can better assess our impact on sustainable development and ﬁnd new business opportunities. At Ensto, we see electricity as a solution to make life better and we believe that electrical industry has a signiﬁcant impact in reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals. 7. Aﬀordable and clean energy: We develop solutions for solar electricity production and develop microgrid technology which enable integration of renewable energy sources to rural communities. 8. Decent work and economic growth: Our business has a positive economic impact on communities through employment and taxes. We take care of our employees by developing health and safety working environment. We manage human and labor rights risks in our own operations and in our supply chain. 9. Industry, innovation and infrastructure: We provide smart and safe solutions with low environmental impact and minimum life cycle energy demand. 11. Sustainable cities and communities: We oﬀer smart, human-centric and ﬂexible electriﬁcation, lighting and EV charging solutions, which increase eﬃciency and functionality in buildings and help them to respond to user’s needs. We are building an advanced smart grid with solutions for network automation, power quality and network monitoring. 12. Responsible consumption and production: We constantly try to minimize our waste generation and increase recycling rate. We design our products taking material eﬃciency into account. We aim to high quality and produce robust products with long life time. 13. Climate actions: We aim to decrease our own electricity consumption and lower our indirect emissions (e.g. from logistics). We increase environmental awareness of our own employees. 17. Partnerships for the goals: We work closely with our suppliers to increase quality and increase environmental awareness. We work with our partners to research and develop new technologies. 11 Ensto’s Sustainability targets In 2020 we have clariﬁed our sustainability work by determining short-term sustainability targets for the year 2020. These targets are set for each sustainability theme which are described in the chapter Sustainability themes. The targets concern the whole company and they help us to focus our work and prioritize our sustainability projects. The targets are presented in a nutshell in Ensto’s sustainability one-pager (below). As similar targets were not set for 2019 we report the current status of themes in 2019. We are planning to set long term sustainability targets, which will be reported in the Sustainability report 2020. 12 Best Employee Experience At Ensto we see our employees as the greatest asset of the welcome new employees warmly to the Ensto family.

We want to be an attractive employer for both current and meaningful work. We treat each other with respect and and potential employees. Our people At the end of 2019 Ensto employed 1,341 people of which 1298 (96 %) had full-time employment contract. Ensto has employees in 19 countries from which production in 7 countries and R&D in 5 countries. The majority of our employees are located in Estonia (32 %), Finland (23 %) and France (21 %). Our employee base is relatively evenly distributed in terms of age and gender and there have not been big changes over the years. At the end of 2019, 43% of our employees were female and 57% male. We value all people and factors like one’s gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality or age have no weight in our recruiting decisions. We also consider factors such as nationality, ethnicity, physical ability, in addition to education, and work experience, as important aspects of diversity. We provide equal opportunities to all of our employees, but do not actively gather data on aforementioned factors. 13 Healthy and safe working environment At Ensto we want to provide a healthy and safe working enis reviewed at least once a year by the Ensto Management vironment for our employees.

The surveys help us received our own LIT Index. The LIT Index is used to describe gather valuable information about our employees’ opinions the passion and motivation levels of employees, i.e. how “on and what are the most important things for our people.

The LIT Index is an average of survey gives us a tool to develop our activities and identify the realization of factors, which are of importance to the empractices that will make Ensto a better place to work. ployee (the selected 5 things in total) at the workplace. The index does not take into account what the signiﬁcant things In 2019 the Best Employee Experience survey was carried out selected by an employee are, but how they are realized in the in the end of the year after the big organization changes had employee’s experience. The LIT Index of Ensto people show been completed. Response rate was 78 %, which was slightly that on average 69% of us are “on ﬁre” of our work.

The chart presents overall job satisfaction in more Response rate 78 %, overall satisfaction 72 %, detail. LIT index 69, eNPS -10 15 In our Best Employee Experience survey we also measure Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), which is internationally comparable score showing how engaged employees are. It is measured by asking how likely is it that you would recommend your employer to a friend or acquaintance. eNPS is calculated as follows: promoters (9-10) – detractors (0-6) / all respondents. In 2019 eNPS was -10, which has slightly declined from last year (-6). It basically means that only 29 % of our employees are willing to promote Ensto as a workRespondents answer to the question: Evaluate on a scale 0-100 how satisﬁed are you with your work place. This number can be anything beand workplace at the moment. The report shows the percentage of respondents ranked on a scale. tween -100 – 100, a number 20 already being good. The decrease of eNPS results most likely from big organizational change, where we had to farewell a number of employees. Ensto Council Another tool to hear our employee’s opinion is Ensto Council. The Ensto Council is a consultative committee and a co-operation forum that includes employee representatives of Ensto oﬃces and sites as well as representatives of Ensto’s board, owners and management as invited guests. The Council meets once a year on a subject determined in advance in order to express participants’ views on the matter. In addition, the Council acts as a Groupwide discussion and information forum. 16 iGROW discussions for individual and company growth Discussions with our employees, hearing what they have to iGROW Team Discussions = Ensto’s vision and strategy, disay and acting accordingly have a high importance in creatrection, a team’s role in Ensto’s strategy, values, behaviors ing the Best Employee Experience. and a team’s well-being will be discussed To increase employee engagement and to ensure employiGROW Individual Discussions = Well-being of an employee ee well-being iGROW development discussions are held at / Siqni-results, his/her role in Ensto’s strategy, values and beleast once a year to each employee.

In addition to the traditional solar power systems functionality, the new system will stabilize the local direct current (DC) microgrid. This DC microgrid will be utilized in the next step when battery storage integration will take place. A system with an accessible DC microgrid allows easy connection of almost any DC generation source or even DC load. An example of a DC load with an increase in popularity would be DC fast charger for electric vehicles. The DC chargers can also be bidirectional to further increase the system ﬂexibility due to the possibility to function as a source and a load. All of these separate DC sources and loads would traditionally have an individual active front end. With the described system the grid connection interface can be centralized. Due to the DC microgrid, the eﬃciency when transferring energy between DC sources and loads are expected to be much higher since two conversion stages can be eliminated. With the designed structure, the system can be constructed more ﬂexibly by adjusting the power rating of the building blocks to suit the target application. Furthermore, this type of system’s operation can be very well deﬁned and optimized by software to meet the changing daily requirements. The advantage of ﬂexible power systems is its ability to get the most out of renewable energy sources and manage local energy most eﬃciently and sustainably. 21 Responsible Sourcing Through collaboration with our stakeholders, we aim to enbeneﬁcial partnerships with our suppliers and partners as sure the highest quality and create a sustainable supply well as seek innovative ways of working together. chain. We set strict requirements for our suppliers to uphold high standards for responsible business practices. To support the above, we have following policies; Supplier Code of Conduct and Conﬂict Mineral Policy and generWhen selecting suppliers we look for quality, reliability, al purchasing terms and conditions which are published on transparency and ability to foster innovation.

Working with our suppliers Ensto’s suppliers are an important part of our supply chain. Suppliers by country Ensto currently has active co-operation with around 3,000 external suppliers who supply us raw materials, components, modules, services etc. Out of these 185 are classiﬁed as key suppliers. Ensto´s suppliers are mainly located in Europe and Asia. 22 Supplier Management Ensto is committed to improving the sustainability of our based on performance quality of suppliers’ products and supply chain.

Our focus is to assess and reduce the negative environmental impacts of our own operations. Environmental management system ISO 14001 covers 6/10 of our factories. In 2019 we started the implementation of ISO 14001 in Cormano, Italy and Gurgaon and Haryana, India.

Propane the electricity and heating consumptions. is used in heating, forklifts and in owned machinery. Natural gas is manly used in heating. 27 Waste We are striving to ﬁnd ways to prevent waste generation by recycling and reusing materials and components. Majority of the produced waste is metals (40 %), which are recycled and reused. We have set ourselves a goal of 0 % landﬁll waste and have gained this target in majority of our locations. In 2019 still around 8,5 % of the waste ended up to landﬁll. Ensto in Estonia has been developing a concept of a paperless production that aims to reduce paper consumption, paper waste and time loss and provides faster information exchange about setbacks in production. Paperless production a broad concept that embraces both environmental, social and economic aspects. Early response allows us to plan and acquire the necessary resources more eﬃciently, involving internal and external suppliers. In the future we are planning to implement this concept to Ensto´s others locations. Waste water Majority of the water is used at Ensto in Finland in our surface treatment process. A lot of water is needed to keep high quality standard since better ﬁnished products require more water. Ensto is located in Porvoo, where there is no scarcity of the clean water. At Ensto in Porvoo a water saving project was conducted in 2019. The goal was to reduce the water consumption of the heat shrink department by changing the open water cooling system to a closed circulation system. Due to this project clean water usage was decreased from 6 250 m3/a to 220 m3/a. Increasing environmental awareness In 2019 Ensto arranged two theme weeks to raise environmental awareness; Earth Day and Energy Awareness Week. The main idea of these weeks is to share knowledge, raise common environmental awareness and encourage to more sustainable behavior at work and at home. The weeks are a mean of getting people to think and act in favor of sensible use of energy and environmentally conscious way in their daily life. During the theme week facts about environmental choices were presented in our intranet and on posters. Our own employees also shared their own ways to save energy. 28 Stakeholder engagement We believe in transparent and open relationship with our stakeholders. As part of our sustainability work we identify and evaluate our stakeholders, their needs and expectations. We analyze how our actions aﬀect to our stakeholders and how our stakeholders impact on Ensto. The latest update to or stakeholder analysis was done on 2017 and it was carried out internally. We value our customer’s opinion In 2019 we have started to measure loyalty or Ensto customers by collecting customer feedback. The customers were asked “How likely are you to recommend Ensto?” It is widely known as Net Promoter Score (NPS), which gives relevant information, what is the actual sentiment of customers to Ensto. The feedback is gathered constantly which allows us to react quickly, to satisfy our customers even more. The range of NPS starts at -100 and ends up at +100. Every number above “0” is positive. At the end of the year Ensto´s overal NPS was +27, which means that our customer were satisﬁed with us. 29 We share our knowhow Customer trainings are a vital part of our operations.
