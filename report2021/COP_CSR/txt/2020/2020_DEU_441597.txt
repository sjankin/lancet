Peppler GmbH Gießen, 17th July 2020 Marburger Str. 251 D-35391 Gießen To our Stakeholders We recognize that a key requirement for participation in the UN Global Compact is the annual preparation and posting of a Communication on Progress (COP) that comprises of a CEO statement of continued support for the UN Global Compact, a description of practical actions with regard to the principles of the UN Global Compact, and a measurement of outcomes or expected outcomes. We are late in creating, sharing and posting our COP report due to internal reviews with our tax lawyers and certified public accountant. We hereby ask for an extension period in order to be able to post a COP that describes our company’s efforts and progress to implement the principles of the UN Global Compact. Our new COP report will be posted on the UN Global Compact website by September, 30th 2020 at the latest. Yours faithfully
