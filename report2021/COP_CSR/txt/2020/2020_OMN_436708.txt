For more information about the company and data regarding the operations, refer to be’ah’s Progress Report: https://www.beah.om/Knowledge-Center/Report Human Rights Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Implementation be’ah is committed to providing a comfortable, safe and healthy work environment. This can be demonstrated throughout be’ah by implementing strategies to protect our staff, raise awareness about their rights and making sure all of our staff are aware of be’ah’s commitment to having a healthy and safe working environment. To ensure workers are provided safe, suitable and sanitary work facilities, we implemented the following: ● Environmental Control Mechanism of Air Conditioning, Ventilation, and Lighting to configure safe work environment ● Offices are equipped with fire alarm and fire protection systems ● Providing safety (instruction boards), emergency exits & assembly point signs ● Conducting continuous and periodic HSE induction/awareness to staff ● QHSE Policy & Evacuation Maps are installed throughout the main building, as well as other facilities ● Provide Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to ensure protection of staff at all times. ● Provision of first aid kits and fire extinguishers on each floor ● Train staff in each floor on fire safety and first aid ● Organizing “HSE Week” in late 2019 for all employees to raise awareness. This included: ○ Multiple general HSE awareness sessions ○ Insurance information session ○ HSE quiz and competition ○ Tree planting ● Regular HSE inspection at be’ah’s main building and facilities ● In order to maintain international standards in managing QHSE requirements, be’ah converted all its documentation utilizing the ISO 45001 framework for all operations ○ Awareness sessions for ISO 9001, ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 ○ Training employees on the transition into the ISO 45001 format ● Initiated indoor air quality monitoring at be’ah’s main building measuring PM 2.5 particulates to ensure adequate air quality with reference to World Health Organization (WHO) standards. ○ Early readings have shown adequate air quality ○ Average concentration readings came around 8.8 µg/m3, below the maximum daily average limit of 10 µg/m3 as per the WHO standard ○ We will continue to monitor air quality and make adjustments as needed Due to be’ah’s nature of work, there are no measurement taken to eliminate ingredients, designs, defects or side effects that could threaten human life and health during manufacturing, usage or disposal of products, as there are no products being designed or produced by the company. The QHSE policy, procedures, and guidelines have been provided with the mechanism of risk assessment and control. In addition, HSE plans are prepared and constantly reviewed by the HSE team; inspections and trainings are conducted in order to sustain quality & safety of operations. be’ah is committed to protect workers from workplace harassment. Harassment of any kind is strictly prohibited by the Oman Labor Law issued by the Ministry of Manpower. be’ah’s HR Policy fully reflects the same laws for its employees and ensures the prevention of any harassment-related issues in the office. All employees have the right to access all external and internal laws and regulations documents. We continuously organize educational sessions to update any changes in manuals and laws to raise awareness among employees. We have formulated an effective grievance procedure for submitting such complaints through which any flagged incidents will be handled as follows:  Internal disciplinary hearing  Labor Court  Civil Court  Police complaints Measurement of Outcomes be’ah has not been involved in any legal cases, rulings or other events related to human rights abuses Labor Principles Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Implementation As part of the government’s endeavors towards the improvement of its workforce, Oman introduced an enhanced Labor Law in 2012 to regulate the employment relationship for employees at all sectors. The Labor Law provides a balanced relationship between employers and employees, while laying stringent conditions for the timely payment of wages, mandatory leaves, and protection against unfair termination, medical insurance and workers compensation on one hand, and regulating employees’ Code of Conduct on the other hand. be’ah in principle doesn’t encourage any kind of bonded labor as it is fully complied with the law which stipulates the minimum provision in the employment contracts. We proudly state that all employment related administration, actions, decisions are governed with the HR Policy & Procedure Manuals, Manual of Authority and Oman Labor Law. We have integrated the Ministry of Manpower decision number 222/2013 regarding the minimum wage standards while designing our grading structure and benefits. We confirmed that entry-level position wages at be’ah are above the minimum wages set by the above decision. Similarly, we ensure that all new employees are within the approved salary and grading structure and that these figures are consistent between both genders as per the Labor Law of the country. Measurement of Outcomes be’ah has not been involved in any legal cases, rulings or other events related to forced and compulsory labor, child labor or discrimination. Environment Principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Implementation Environmental Protection System: solid waste systems To avoid environmental damage, we implemented the following: ● Policies and progressive legislations (internal and external) to ensure effective implementation by educating stakeholders regarding environmental impacts and monitoring compliance ● Develop, cascade and monitor goals and key metrics for reporting sections ● Plan and lead initiatives to promote awareness, at all levels in be’ah, of the impact of emerging environmental concerns or issues that could arise from various waste management processes, and their implications on be’ah and to ensure their effective communication ● Follow up on performance of contractors in be’ah’s various waste management operations and validate the quality of their work through site visits, monthly reporting and reviewing of their operation Emergency Procedures Building an HSE culture inside be’ah’s offices, service facilities and sites have always been a top priority for be’ah and its stakeholders and contractors. After conducting a study, the team has noticed inadequate awareness of QHSE among be’ah employees, as a result, the year 2017 marked the start of the HSE’s emergency mock drills and awareness campaigns. Now, the HSE department conducts emergency mock drills for employees on a regular basis. These emergency mock drills allow opportunities for improvement in be’ah’s ability to respond to emergencies by having the employees provide feedback at the end of each drill. Leachate and Gas Collection in our Landfills Through our operations, leachate is produced at our landfills and these go through a procedure to ensure none of it seeps into the ground and affect nearby ecosystems and groundwater. Leachate ponds are set up for evaporation and the remaining residues are then landfilled. This process also ensures that our liners are not damaged and can protect the soil underneath. In Al Multaqa landfill, a leachate treatment plant has been set up to fully filter the leachate and output clear water that is then utilized for landscaping and vehicle sanitation purposes on-site. This year, be’ah has also started testing gas collection systems that are produced from MSW landfills that have reached maturity. In Al Multaqa landfill, the first trail for gas extraction wells commenced and the company will test their effectiveness and asses their feasibility to be implemented in our other landfills. Measurement of Outcomes be’ah has not been involved in any rulings related to environmental lawsuits in the past year. Anti-Corruption Principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Implementation Upon joining, new employees are required to review and sign the Code of Conduct, which includes the following: ● Declaration ● Anti-bribery Clause ● Conflict of Interest Clause A dedicated Risk Management team is responsible for assessing corporate and operational risks: ● Corporate Risk Management ● Operational Risk Management Part of the Corporate Risk Management is assessing Fraud Risk where we assess the Fraud Triangle and the components of fraud (like asset misappropriation, conflict of interests, corruption, bribery and identity theft etc.) and we highlight any Fraud Indicators. The following was set in order to ensure ethical behavior in contracts with business partners: ● Developed be’ah Tender policies that are based on fairness & transparency ● Adhering to Tendering Policies and Procedures Manual Also, to ensure that internal procedures support the company’s anti-corruption commitment, the following was established: 1.

Three lines of defense (process owners, Risk Management section and Internal Audit department) are in place to ensure the implementation of the internal controls 3. be’ah houses a comprehensive Governance Risk & Compliance (GRC) body which includes the Internal Audit department, Compliance function, Risk Management and Legal department.
