SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2019 It wasn’t so very long ago we decided to put sustainability at the very heart of our business strategy. Yet, I can’t tell you how pleased I am to let you know that we have come a long way over the two years that have passed. Our 70-year-old heritage and Elfa spirit certainly got us a head start, but it didn’t stop us from improving. Sustainability is not just what we aspire to do, it’s what we always have done. During fiscal year 2019, we turned words into action. All of us, every single employee, participated in training where we discussed sustainability and ethics. Making sustainability an integral part of our daily operations made us highly aware and deepened also our understanding of why this is so important. What is so positive is that effects are already apparent. As shown in this report, Elfa has reduced its overall environmental footprint, and we have done so despite the fact that from 2016 to the present, production volume has increased with about 20% in terms of turnover. In addition, as proof of our commitment to shoulder our share of the global responsibility, we are a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2018. Inside these pages you’ll get all the figures and numbers, as required. It is a sustainability report, after all. But we will also present our business philosophy, how we see ourselves, our customers, partners, and employees. We will get into actions we have taken to implement the ten principles within each of the four areas we are focusing on, Environment, Social responsibility and employees, Respect for human rights, and Ethics. Now, as I’m signing off our sustainability report for fiscal year 2019, I would like to send a thought of gratitude to every employee, customer and partner for their contribution to our success. We have every reason to be proud, and I hope you’ll find so too. Enjoy the read.

During fiscal year 2019 Elfa stepped up its efforts in support of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). One of the more important activities was the training in sustainability and ethics that all Elfa’s employees participated in. This have made us even more aware of the importance of these matters and deepened our understanding. It also made sustainability an integral part of our daily operations. With that, we daresay that Elfa is well equipped to continue making further improvements along these lines. This report follows Elfa’s fiscal year and covers the period April 1st 2019 to March 31st 2020. Elfa’s Sustainability Report encompasses Elfa International AB and its subsidiaries. As signatory to the UN Global Compact, Elfa will submit this report to the UN Global Compact as its Communication on Progress Report 2019. 4 ABOUT ELFA Elfa’s mission is to create space in everyday life with ingenious storage solutions. Something that has become possible with the ingenious ideas we have developed since 1948, when Arne Lydmar founded Elfa. Ever since then, we have been embracing the challenges of everyday life by offering individual, clever solutions for big and small storage needs. Since 1999 the company is owned by The Container Store, the USA’s largest storage products retail chain. The Container Store is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Today Elfa has three factories and seven sales companies in Europe. The group reported turnover of approximately 1 203 MSEK in the 2019 fiscal year and by the end of fiscal year 2019 the group had 501 employees. Core values for Company core values do not differ from personal values, generally speaking. Values drive every major decision we make. When weighing all the factors that go into the the better decision, we give higher importance to matters that chime with our core values, whether we are aware of it or not. At Elfa we do not explicitly state being sustainable as a core value. Being sustainable rather comes as an effect of our decisions and actions, in turn influenced by our values. We truly believe our values help us being more sustainable. When we say we are customer focused, striving for exceeding their expectations, we are talking about matters such as superior quality and life-long durability. We always try to be innovative and open-minded to new ways of working, taking any measures to invest in and sustain our society’s future. When we say we act professionally in all we do, it translates directly to how we conduct our business, ethically and in compliance with the law. We fundamentally believe in simple humane values and appreciate that we are all different. We act as one company and share a holistic view of our business. This business includes an entire eco-system of suppliers, partners and customers. Our values are the cornerstones of this company and we refer to them as ONE Elfa. In fact, ONE Elfa is so important it forms the basis for our company’s Code of Conduct. Our position on the Elfa provides storage systems created to fit individual needs throughout life. Our assortment includes both flexible storage solutions and made-to-measure sliding doors – all in market and key sustainable and functional design of the highest quality. differentiators Elfa’s competitive edge is the customizable, durable and ingenious storage solutions. In addition, we enjoy the advantage of having a long history, strong financials and various patents, making Elfa a good and reliable business partner. 5 SUSTAINABILITY The main objective of Elfa’s engagement in sustainability is to reduce our company’s impact on the environment and resource consumption. It is also to steadily improve AT ELFA working environment and raise awareness about the matter of ethics. Areas covered by Elfa’s sustainability efforts are centered around four main areas environment, social responsibility and employees, respect for human rights and ethics. The ultimate responsibility for sustainability rests with Elfa’s Chief Executive Officer, and the issues are regulated via a number of policies, of which the most important are: n ONE Elfa – Expresses our core values of being customer focused, innovative, professional, humane and have a holistic approach. n TCS Business Code of Conduct and Ethics, Elfa Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct n The 10 principles outlined in the UN Global Compact n Environmental policy – Outlines the ways in which Elfa strives to reduce environmental impact at all stages of our products’ life cycle: from product development and production to waste and recycling of products and packaging. n Work environment policy and the policy of diversity, equality and inclusion Targets and KPIs To assure progress and compliance with policies, performance for main aspects of sustainability is measured against key indicators, which are reviewed in this report. These KPIs are followed up on a quarterly basis by the Group Management team. SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS n Building product declaration on 100% of new products n All wood-based products fulfil the demands of formaldehyde emissions according to Carb 2 n In Sweden, registration of our project sales assortment in Sunda Hus, Byggvarubedömningen and, when applicable, Svanen Husproduktportal SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION n Reduce energy consumption, water consumption, CO2 emissions SUSTIANABILITY IN SUPPLY AND ALL OPERATIONS n 85% of the suppliers of direct material have signed Elfa’s Supplier Code of Conduct n 100% of employees have received basic training on sustainability WORKING ENVIRONMENT n Reverse the current trend and reduce both short and long-term sickness absence n Keep the employee satisfaction index at the current level HUMAN RIGHTS AND ETHICS n Zero tolerance of ethical breaches n All employees are trained in ethics 6 Dialogues with Understanding the expectations of key stakeholders, in our case employees, owners, customers and partners, is crucial for being able to meet current and future customer stakeholders and needs. In 2018 a systematic stakeholder dialogue was conducted where we jointly materiality analysis identified essential sustainability aspects. The result is creating the basis for a materiality analysis. Based on the stakeholder dialogue, impact analysis and internal workshops, the following aspects of sustainability have been identified and are prioritized: n The strive for designing and manufacturing durable products, hence of high quality and where components can be recycled and reused n The strive for sustainability throughout the supply chain, hence ensuring social, environmental and ethical practices n The strive for maintaining highest standards of health and safety of employees, to embrace diversity and equality as well as to provide competence development and training to its employees In fiscal year 2020, it is again time for stakeholder dialogues and an update of the materiality analysis will be conducted. Risk assessment and By proactively assessing and mitigating risks related to sustainability, we ensure increased resilience for the company. In this report, you find detailed descriptions of risk mitigation assessed risks and how these are mitigated. The risk assessments are broken down by the four main aspects of sustainability; environment, social responsibility and employees, human rights and ethics. 7 ENVIRONMENTAL Elfa has a strong commitment to work towards a sustainable future. Our contribution to a more sustainable society is to continuously reduce the environmental impact our SUSTAINABILITY products have over its life cycle. We aim to continually improve the environmental performance of our projects, products and services, to reduce the environmental footprint of our business. This means that we: n Develop products with long life cycles and which consume a minimum of natural resources n Develop products using materials that are possible to recycle and reuse n Evaluate and reduce significant environmental aspects in the supply chain n Work systematically to reduce energy in our operations n Work systematically to reduce or eliminate the use of hazardous substances in our products n Require suppliers, sub-contractors and transport companies to comply with legal requirements in environmental legislation and chemical restrictions as well as other environmental requirements and environmental targets from the Elfa group Durable products UN’s sustainable development goal number 12 highlights the importance of moving towards sustainable production and consumption. We believe this can only be achieved if products are easy to reuse and recycle and which contain as large a proportion of recycled materials as possible. In fact, Elfa has developed products in this way for more than 70 years, resulting in today’s variety of durable products with a high proportion of reused material. If you have an old Elfa storage system at home and want to get new brackets, you can be certain the new ones will fit. This is why Elfa’s hang standards are of such high quality and still look the same as they did in the 1950s. 8 Sustainable We strive continuously to reduce the environmental impact at all stages in our products’ life cycle – from product development and production, to waste and recycling of production products and packaging. We comply with applicable environmental legislation and pay attention to the environment in accordance with other requirements and regulations. Elfa’s environmental work is characterized by continuous risk assessment and a preventative approach to the business. We have defined performance indicators for observing developments in energy and water consumption, carbon dioxide emissions and waste. In this report, figures are shown on an aggregated basis. However, it should be noted that from 2016 to the present, Elfa’s production volume has increased with about 20% in terms of turnover. This increase relates to both own-produced and sourced components, and has the effect that the amount of material running in our processes has significantly increased. ENERGY, WATER, CO 2 AND WASTE To reduce the environmental impact of the group, Elfa has implemented a number of group-wide policies and activities. However, when measuring our environmental impact, we focus specifically on our three manufacturing facilities: n Elfa Sweden AB (ESAB) – Västervik, Sweden n Elfa Doors AB (EDAB) – Mullsjö, Sweden n Elfa Manufacturing Poland (EMP) – Koszalin, Poland This makes perfect sense while these sites are accountable for over 95% of the group’s environmental impact, in terms of energy and water consumption, carbon dioxide and waste. ENERGY Energy consumption 2016 2017 2018 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Total 16 977 15 352 15 431 14 766 -4% Electricity 11 939 10 621 10 485 10 061 -4% Oil 1 195 1 296 1 272 1 285 1% District heating 2 061 1 641 1 842 1 624 -12% Gas 1 783 1 794 1 832 1 796 -2% Energy consumption in relation to production 2016 2017 2018 2019 2019 vs. 2018 ESAB – Västervik1 0,96 0,84 0,84 0,85 1% EMP – Koszalin1 1,17 0,99 1,01 0,94 -7 % EDAB – Mullsjö2 11,3 9,5 8,7 8,4 -4 % 1) MWh/MT of steel through the process 2) MWh/door During 2019, the overall energy consumption at Elfa’s manufacturing facilities decreased by 4%. This can be explained by a number of improvements. We reduced for instance the amount of material running in our processes by changing the design of one of our high-volume products. We invested, moreover, in more energy-efficient equipment by installing equipment to recover heat in one of our packing and painting departments and by installing LED light in several of our facilities. 9 WATER Water consumption in m 3 FACTORY 2016 2017 2018 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Total 8 201 6 472 6 874 6 800 -1 % ESAB – Västervik 5 775 4 262 4 605 4 647 1% EMP – Koszalin 1 923 1 851 1 890 1 813 -4% EDAB – Mullsjö 503 359 379 340 -2% During 2019, the overall water consumption at Elfa’s manufacturing facilities decreased by 1%.

This is thanks to the many improvements we made to lower our energy consumption. The CO2 emissions was as well lowered as a result of changes in the mix of sources of heating, from district heating to electricity. This was due to the reduced number of operating hours at ESAB’s washing station, which is heated with district heating. 10 WASTE AND RECYCLING Compared to last year, we generated 8% less of waste. Improved waste sorting of combustible materials accounts for most of the decrease. Some of the reduction can also be derived from that we in 2019 discontinued one of our brands. Most of the waste that Elfa’s manufacturing operations produce is either recycled or used to recover energy. According to Stena Recycling, the company that handles waste from the manufacturing sites in Sweden, is 83,5% of our waste recycled, 15,8% used in energy recovery, and 0,8% deposited. Waste at the manufacturing facility in Västervik, Sweden (ESAB) in kg 2016 2017 2018 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Iron 1 103 639 978 950 1 020 013 934 471 -8% Hazardous waste 392 903 381 342 294 894 339 627 15% Wood 190 307 178 960 168 230 179 341 7% In 2019, ESAB generated more hazardous waste. The reason for this was that the water in one of our washing systems had to be changed more than once. While in 2018, we managed to use the same water all year. Steel waste is produced when the raw material is shaped into its final form. One reason behind the decrease in iron waste is that the new design of one of our highvolume products, has resulted in less scrap. Wood waste derives primarily from wornout load carriers (pallets) that can no longer be used. Waste at the manufacturing facility in Koszalin, Poland (EMP) in kg 2016 2017 2018 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Hazardous waste 187 512 269 050 245 975 228 976 -7% Iron 127 435 150 436 225 173 288 210 28% During the autumn of 2019, EMP started to manufacture Avera, a completely new product line. The production of sheet metal increased as well the waste from cutting and stamping operations. However, despite the added volumes of Avera required more from the painting operation, EMP managed, overall, to reduce of hazardous waste in the painting operation. Waste at the manufacturing facility in Mullsjö, Sweden (EDAB) in kg 2016 2017 2018 2019 2019 vs. 2018 Wood 542 000 585 000 627 750 570 600 -9% Glass 339 280 334 790 335 560 285 140 -15% At EDAB wood and glass account for the largest share of waste in our manufacturing operations. The reduction in wood waste is explained by the discontinuation of the Lumi brand, which has entailed less goods of wood. The reduction in glass waste is due to improved quality of glass from the supplier, leading to less waste. 11 Sustainable RESPONSIBLE HANDLING OF CHEMICALS The use of chemicals is an inevitable part of manufacturing Elfa products. We need them production (cont.) both as building blocks in our products and in our different manufacturing processes. The use of chemicals can, if not used in control, harm the environment and also jeopardize the health of customers and employees. Needless to say, violating environmental legislation and in particular legislation regarding the use of chemicals can also lead to long-lasting and costly legal processes. Elfa has clear procedures and established control mechanisms for how to use chemicals in our operations. We are constantly working on finding ways to replace chemicals that may be harmful to people or the environment, with less harmful alternatives. We have full control of what materials and chemicals our products are made of. To further reduce negative impact on the environment or harmful effects on health, we have drawn up procedures that ensure the use of hazardous substances in Elfa’s products remains below the limits specified in REACH (the EU’s chemical legislation) and Proposition 65 (chemical legislation in California, USA). To ensure we are on the right track, we continuously analyze our products according to standardized test methods and require written declarations from our suppliers. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Elfa Doors AB (EDAB) is ISO 14001:2015-certified. Elfa Sweden AB (ESAB) and Elfa Manufacturing Poland (EMP) are in progress to be ISO 14001:2015-certified in FY20. Sustainable suppliers Elfa collaborates proactively with its suppliers to promote lawful, professional, and fair practices that integrate the respect for human rights, safe work place, business ethics and the environment. Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards of what we expect from the suppliers in terms of business behaviour. All suppliers to Elfa must have processes in place to monitor and maintain these standards. We updated the Code in 2019, and the aim is that by the end of fiscal year 2020, at least 85% of our suppliers of direct material have signed the code. We qualify all new suppliers of direct material by requiring a “self-assessment” including questions on sustainability. To ensure suppliers remains qualified, Elfa schedules regularly audits with existing suppliers. We conducted during fiscal year 2019, five audits on new and existing suppliers of direct material. Risk assessment & It is our responsibility to make sure that neither our products, nor our production cause any harm to people’s health or the environment. risk mitigation To minimize the risk of hazardous substances being administered to our products, we impose high environmental requirements on materials and components used. To verify suppliers’ compliance with these requirements, we follow up with audits and tests. We do risk assessments of both materials and suppliers. To mitigate the risk of environmental incidents, such as leakage, spillage or errors in production processes at our manufacturing premises, we have established strict procedures for how to handle waste and chemicals. All concerned people at these sites are continuously trained. 12 SOCIAL Indisputably, employees are any company’s most important asset. To Elfa it is therefore a given to endorse the UN Sustainable Development Goal number 8, which addresses RESPONSIBILITY the need to promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and AND EMPLOYEES productive employment and decent work for all. In our continuous strive towards a fair, healthy and safe workplace where people grow as individuals, Elfa places great emphasis on the systematic work environment management, health and safety for all employees as well as risk handling. Progress in the matter of working environment is assessed by carefully monitoring and analysing indicators such as sickness absence, accidents, near accidents and staff turnover. In addition, an employee satisfaction survey is conducted every two years. The previous survey, conducted in October 2018, revealed that Elfa employees in general are satisfied with the company culture, leadership, strategy and working environment. We believe this is a result of Elfa’s pervasive work on our shared core values, of clear policies, procedures and educational initiatives and of the many years of systematic work on health, safety and working environment. Systematic work To steadily progress towards a fair, healthy and safe workplace, Elfa works on a longterm basis with health enhancing, preventive and rehabilitative measures such as environment appraisal talks, employee surveys, safety rounds, employee communication and management management of occupational injuries and incidents.

It also involves systematic work and a long-term approach. Thus, to safeguard its employees and reduce the risk of accidents and injuries, Elfa attaches high importance to preventative measures. To quote a few examples, job rotation is introduced at the manufacturing entities, we invest in ergonomic solutions, sound insulation and heating control. A very practical example is the additional breaks and access to modified water ducts that employees in Poland get on high temperature days. Elfa also emphasis on health promotion, for instance by providing flu vaccinations and facilitating for employees to attend physical exercises. As a means of measuring progress on health and safety, we carefully monitor and analyze overall sickness absence, the number of accidents, near accidents and overall well-being of our employees. SICKNESS ABSENCE Sickness absence at Elfa is relatively high at the manufacturing entities. However, Elfa is actively working towards reversing the trend and reducing sickness absence. For example, we take early actions in case of repeated short-term absences and do rehabilitation investigations when there is a risk the absence will be more than 60 days. In addition, we are placing a significant emphasis on measures such as skills development, clear and realistic targets and appraisals. Elfa’s target is to have a short-term absence of no more than 3% R12 by 2023. For overall sickness absence we have a target of less than 4% by 2023. To achieve this, we carefully monitor all sites and take further steps where needed. Overall sickness absence FY19 % Overall sickness absence 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 Apr Ma y Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Ja n Feb Ma r 2019 2020 Overall sickness absence Target SAFETY Employees’ safety always comes first, and Elfa’s approach is clear an injury-free working environment where each and every employee that leaves home for work, comes back home in good health. A lot of work therefore goes into raising awareness amongst employees, as well as to ensure a culture where risks are properly addressed and where everyone takes a serious approach to risk handling. Two of the more important activities in this work are continuous communication on safety matters and regular management meetings dedicated to safety. To ensure all safety risks are brought to light and handled properly, all employees are granted access to TIA, a web-based tool for risk handling. TIA allows employees to quite easily report any observed risk or hazard. And, it allows managers to work systematically with reported risks and hazards, analyse data, handle risks and do the reporting. 14 At Elfa, we believe in simple humane values and appreciate that we are all different. We Fair and inclusive therefore take great pride in being a workplace where all employees are treated with workplace respect and have the same rights, obligations and opportunities, irrespective of their gender, age, nationality or ethnicity, religion or belief, disability, sexual orientation, and union affiliation. To ensure everyone respects and supports Elfa’s viewpoint on diversity, equality and inclusion, these matters are an important part of the annual ethical training that all employees participate in. A further step is the development of a diversity training program for all leaders. The aim is, by the end of fiscal year 2021, all leaders managing personnel have undergone the training. The employee satisfaction survey conducted in October 2018, revealed that Elfa employees in general are satisfied with how Elfa is working on matters related to diversity. However, this is an ever-continuing undertaking, and Elfa is therefore steadily taking actions to promote an inclusive culture. Employment and As an employer, Elfa strives for a balance of skills including internal talent and external expertise, and we note that the balance of skills currently fulfils the company’s strategy staff turnover as desired. In selected entities, we use recruitment agencies to handle increases and decreases in production rates. This provides security for Elfa’s employees, the majority of whom are permanently employed full-time. In Poland, we have managed to reduce the turnover ratio by 50% compared to last year, mainly due to the introduction of an internal recommendations program and improvements made in the onboarding process. Our aim is to have fully standardized introduction and training procedures in place by end of March 2021, allowing all new recruits to become self-sufficient within 90 days.

It is reported as a percentage. Employees – The number of people who have been employed at any point during the business year. The average number of employees is calculated for the period during the business year in which people have been employed. If an employee was employed for less than 60% of the date range, they are counted as 0.6 people. Risk assessment & Safety and equal treatment for all employees are fundamental and we need to ensure risks are dealt with notwithstanding where someone work, or which position they hold. risk mitigation Elfa is therefore in the process of unifying risk assessment norms and the definitions of types of hazards. In addition, we are working to streamline how risks are measured and communicated as well as how to mitigate reported hazards. The risk of accidents or somebody getting injured are mitigated by steadily raising awareness amongst all employees on matters of safety, by ensuring all managers undertake work environment trainings, and by systematically report, analyze and handle risks. The risk of employees being stressed and overworked, which may result from high sickness absence, is mitigated by taking early actions in case of repeated short-term absences, doing rehabilitation investigations when there is a risk the absence will be more than 60 days and by working on health promotion. 15 RESPECT FOR Our respect for human rights is founded within one of our core values, being humane. It stands for our firm belief in humane values and our appreciation of our differences. HUMAN RIGHTS We respect each other. We protect and promote equal value and the rights of all people, no matter our gender, age, nationality or ethnicity, religion or belief, disability, sexual orientation, and union affiliation. We have a thorough understanding of how Elfa as a corporation has a responsibility in our society that goes beyond our operations. To act upon this, we signed the UN Global Compact in 2018. The ten principles of the UN Global Compact have been integrated into our business strategy, policies and procedures. We are actively driving awareness and action in support of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by 2030. Sustainable Out of the 17 goals that the UN Global compact defines, we have chosen to focus on the three we can impact most: Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), Responsible Development Goals consumption and production (SDG 12) and Peace justice and strong institutions (SDG16). DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH SDG 8 is about promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Elfa contributes by: n Striving towards ensuring fair dealing, combating corruption, creating a fair, healthy and safe workplace and ensuring zero tolerance regarding all forms of offensive treatment, harassment and discrimination n Requiring that suppliers of direct material sign and align with Elfa’s Supplier Code of Conduct RESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION SDG 12 is about ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. Elfa contributes by: n Striving towards reducing the environmental impact at all stages in the life cycle of our products, from development and production to waste and recycling of products and packaging n Working systematically towards reducing or eliminating the use of hazardous substances in our products n Having an environmental management system in place at all three manufacturing sites n Requiring that suppliers of direct material sign and align with Elfa’s Supplier Code of Conduct PEACE, JUSTICE AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS SDG 16 is about promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Elfa contributes by: n Raising awareness of the importance and deepening the understanding of these matters within the company and our supply chain n Making clear how to report concerns, with information available both internally and for external parties n Making charity contributions 16 Preventing As a direct consequence of Elfa’s core values, to respect and value our differences, we have a zero-tolerance policy regarding all forms of offensive treatment, harassment and harassment and discrimination. To enforce this policy, we continuously run trainings for all employees. offensive treatment We actively measure and follow up on their adherence. All managerial issues are acted upon. There are clear rules of how the employee, manager and company should react if the policy is violated. As employees, we are all responsible for our work environment. It is all employees’ duty to secure a good working climate and react if a work colleague’s rights are violated at work. It is however the line manager’s responsibility to prevent harassment and violation of human rights. To secure the objective handling of severe cases, Elfa provides the parties involved an option of having external assistance, this to ensure an impartial judgement and to provide trust in the process. The ways of reporting suspected or known offensive treatment, harassment or discrimination are communicated via the intranet, posted at our workplaces, in our Code of Conduct and in educational material. Risk assessment & At Elfa we are steadily striving to protect and promote equal value and the rights of all people. To mitigate the risk internally, all employees are trained in the Code of Conduct risk mitigation and ethical dilemmas are regularly discussed in groups. However, we do recognize the risk our suppliers are not working with Human rights in the same way. To mitigate, Elfa’s suppliers of direct material are required to sign the Supplier Code of Conduct and we pursue proactive collaboration and assessment. There is also a risk of discrimination in recruitment and promotion processes.

All employees get training in ethics at least once per year. It is well-communicated in the organization that as Elfa employees, we are each and every one responsible and accountable for reporting suspected or known misconduct. The ways of how to do this are communicated via the intranet, posted at our workplaces, in our Code of Conduct and in educational material. Codes of Conduct Central to our ethos is our focus on conduct. The following lines come from Elfa’s Code of Conduct: “Elfa does not participate in or endorse any corrupt practices, including offering or accepting kickbacks, bribes, excessive gifts or hospitality, or facilitation payments – directly or indirectly, such as through a third party. We will not accept suppliers, vendors or partners that offer bribes and we will take necessary action if such actions are uncovered. At Elfa we want to ensure independence in our business relation decisions, therefore Elfa employees may not offer or receive gifts or excessive entertainment.” As a whole-owned part of the TCS group, Elfa’s business and ethical guidelines include as well the TCS Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
