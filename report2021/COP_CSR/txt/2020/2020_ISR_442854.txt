I hereby certify that Mizrahi-Tefahot Group is in compliance with the scope of disclosure and reporting required for this level and is compliant with the three aforementioned principles. This seventh report continues to show a notable trend of professional improvement. Comments on the report: Expansion of materiality analysis through systematic analysis of disclosure requirements by global rating agencies – Mizrahi-Tefahot, similar to major corporations world-wide, regularly provides data to global ESG rating agencies. The findings of such ratings allow investors around the world in their decision-making process, in conjunction with a policy of socially responsible investment. As part of preparation of this report and in conjunction with enhancing and expanding of the materiality analysis, the Bank conducted a comparative study of various disclosure requirements, identified the material issues and incorporated these insights in the report. Finally, this report continues to reflect a deep organizational commitment to values of corporate social responsibility, sustainability and transparency. There is no doubt that adding this value to the Bank's Code of Ethics makes for important progress in the organizational deployment process.
