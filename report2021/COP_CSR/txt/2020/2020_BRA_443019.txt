The results of the follow-up are presented to the Board of Executive Officers and the Board of Directors. It is worth noting that, in 2019, no adjustment needs were reported. The average annual budget applied is R$ 2.75 million. As technological resources, all necessary for full management and monitoring are used, such as firewall, anti-spam, antivirus, password safe, proxy, among others. In 2019, our main actions in relation to cybersecurity were: developing and formalizing an appropriate information security framework, including the clear definition of roles and responsibilities; developing policies and procedures for managing vulnerabilities, including remediation; developing, implementing and exercising the incident response (IR) plan; including the topic of information security as part of corporate risk assessment; developing a classification program for sensitive information and adopting appropriate tools; developing a privacy policy; implementing firewalls (technological protection barrier) in substations and power plants; and implementing layer 7 firewalls for operation centers.
