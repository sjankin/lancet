Ôºú22Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Science Based Targets (SBT) The Sumitomo Forestry Group has announced the formulation of SBTi*1 and set new greenhouse gases reduction target for the entire Group in June 2017 and was certiÔ¨Åed as SBT in July 2018. 1. Scope 1&2*2: 21% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2017 (base year) by 2030. 2. Scope 3*2: 16% reduction of total greenhouse gas emissions from Category 1 and Category 11*3 compared to 2017 (base year) by 2030. *1 The SBTi was established in 2015 as a collaboration of four organizations CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi deÔ¨Ånes and promotes best practice in sciencebased target setting, to help companies determine a pathway for reducing their emissions in line with what is required to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial temperatures. In Japan, the Ministry of the Environment has translated this in Japanese as ‚ÄúCorporate 2‚ÑÉ Target‚Äùand is supporting company eÔ¨Äorts. *2 Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions of a company, including emissions from fuel consumption. E.g. CO2 emissions from the use of gasoline for company vehicles. Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity and heating. E.g. CO2 emissions from the use of electricity by oÔ¨Éces. Scope 3: GHG emissions occurring in the supply chain. E.g. CO2 emissions generated during the use of products sold. *3 Category 1: Greenhouse gas emissions during collection, manufacture, and transport of purchased or acquired goods and services included in Scope 3. Category 11: Greenhouse gas emissions during use of sold products and services included in Scope 3. Saving of Energy and Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Business Activities RE100 Sumitomo Forestry joined the international RE100* initiative in March 2020 that aims for 100% renewable energy in power used for business. Our goal is to transition fuel to generate power to 100% renewable energy in Sumitomo Forestry Group power and power generation businesses by 2040. * RE100 is an international initiative run jointly by The Climate Group, a global environmental NGO, and the CDP. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú23Ôºû Sustainability Targets of Our Group 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan and Material Issues Formulation of the 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan to Promote Further Integration of ESG initiatives In 2015, Sumitomo Forestry Group identiÔ¨Åed Ô¨Åve Material Issues related to sustainability and established a Mid-Term CSR Management Plan that speciÔ¨Åed strategies and targets for each issue. With Ô¨Åscal 2020 set as the target year, each company and division within the Group has been working toward achieving those goals. Interest in ESG is higher than ever from attention to technological innovations driven by the evolution of IT and signiÔ¨Åcant industrial transformation driven by rapid globalization to concerns about climate change and human rights risk measures as well as stronger governance systems. Companies must contribute to the SDGs by addressing these issues in the pursuit of growth. In response to the changing business environment, the Sumitomo Forestry Group sees a need to promote sustainable management to an even greater extent. We formulated new Mid-Term Sustainability Targets that incorporate the sustainability strategies and material issues within the 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan (FY2019 to FY2021). This plan includes the further promotion of integration between business operations and ESG initiatives as one of the basic policies. We will strengthen our management platform and further promote future businesses through sustainable management that creates synergy between business and ESG initiatives. Sumitomo Forestry Group 2021 Medium-Term Management Plan -Four Basic PoliciesÔºú24Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Formulation of Mid-Term Sustainability Targets ‚ÄúThe Mid-Term Sustainability Targets‚Äù announced in May 2019 is a revision of our previous Mid-Term CSR Plan based on our contributions to achieving the SDGs and the Ô¨Åve material issues related to sustainability. Deliberations have been held in each business division and at management level, resulting in the expansion of our list of qualitative targets from 12 to 15 items. Incorporating speciÔ¨Åc non-Ô¨Ånancial targets into our 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan has enabled us to further strengthen the link between our business and sustainability strategies. Not only does this enable us to meet the expectations of society such as SDGs, we believe it will also lead to an increase in corporate value which cannot be determined from a Ô¨Ånancial perspective alone. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú25Ôºû IdentiÔ¨Åcation of Material Issues Related to Sustainability Following the changes in the economic, environmental and social situation, in March 2015, the Sumitomo Forestry Group identiÔ¨Åed material issues related to sustainability. The Group surveyed both internal and external stakeholders as well as outside experts, receiving responses from about 2,700 people. In preparing the questionnaire, 27 issues most closely related to the Sumitomo Forestry Group were speciÔ¨Åed, based on the Sumitomo Forestry Group ºs Corporate Philosophy and Our Values, and taking into account such matters as ISO 26000, the international standard on the social responsibility of organizations, and evaluation points linked to socially responsible investment (SRI). After incorporating management perspectives, the survey results were mapped out against axes of ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù and ‚Äústakeholders,‚Äù before determining the materiality of each issue. 12 of these issues were identiÔ¨Åed as being highly material, and rearranged into 5 issues related to sustainability. In conjunction with the formulation of Mid-Term Sustainability Targets in 2018, we also revised some of our material issues in light of new demands from the society. Ôºú26Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Management of Mid-Term Sustainability Targets In Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, we establish 15 qualitative targets based on contributions to achieving SDGs and on our Ô¨Åve material issues. In addition, we speciÔ¨Åed evaluative indexes (quantitative goals) for each qualitative target item, which serve as our targets for Ô¨Åscal 2021. Each group company and department has set ‚ÄúSustainability Budget‚Äù with numerical targets set for the Ô¨Åscal year and commenced initiatives toward achieving these goals. The Sumitomo Forestry Group fully implements a PDCA cycle for the progress and achievements of each target at the Sustainability Committee convened two times a year in addition to providing reports to the Board of Directors.

The SDGs work to solve various global issues raised as principles toward building a better international society that leaves no one behind. The Sumitomo Forestry Group will promote further integration of business operations and ESG initiatives as one basic policy in the 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan announced in May 2019. We recognize the correlation between the creation of new business opportunities and business growth as well as initiatives that work to solve social issues deÔ¨Åned in the SDGs to build a sustainable society. We do recognize the risks of not fully executing these initiatives as well, such as delays in compliance to laws and regulations and a harmed reputation. With this awareness, our Mid-Term Sustainability Targets deÔ¨Åne 15 qualitative targets associated with Ô¨Åve material issues according to relevance with the SDGs and clarify what can be done now by our Group to achieve the SDGs that outline an ideal form for 2030. We will aim to contribute to the SDGs by reaching the 15 qualitative targets of our material issues. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú31Ôºû Material Issues and SDGs To integrate the materials issues and SDG initiatives, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has associated SDGs (goals and targets) with the 15 qualitative targets of material issues as shown below.

Ôºú36Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Dissemination of SDGs Sumitomo Forestry Group believes that it is crucial to disseminate and foster an understanding of SDGs in each and every employee to contribute to the SDGs through business. We conduct various initiatives to raise employee awareness (examples below). Cosponsoring the Nikkei SDGs Forum Sumitomo Forestry Group is cosponsoring the Nikkei SDGs Forum, a project run by the Nikkei Group to support companies in their eÔ¨Äorts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations, from Ô¨Åscal 2018. Committing to the Shizuoka City SDGs Declaration The Shizuoka Branch of the Housing and Construction Division at Sumitomo Forestry is committed to the Shizuoka City SDGs Declaration which has been encouraging SDG activities through oÔ¨Éces and associations in Shizuoka City in addition to develop and broadly share excellent case studies since November 2019. As a target of initiatives in Ô¨Åscal 2020, we have set an 80% standardization rate for Net Zero Energy Houses (ZEH). In January 2019, the Shizuoka Branch participated in the symposium ‚ÄúLocal Communities and SDGs: Furthering SDGs Together‚Äù held by Shizuoka City. They exhibited a booth that provided information on broad topics from installing solar panels and strengthening tree-planting proposals to providing environmentally-friendly housing. Holding a Greenery and SDGs Seminar Jointly with Kumagai Gumi In July 2019, we jointly organized the Sumitomo Forestry and Kumagai Gumi Greenery and SDGs Seminar at the head oÔ¨Éce of Kumagai Gumi, which has a business and capital alliance with Sumitomo Forestry. Roughly 250 people from both companies participated in the seminar that introduced environmental real Estate business examples that aim to integrate construction and greening technologies with expertise possessed by both Sumitomo Forestry and Kumagai Gumi. Environmental experts also provided keynote speeches on the perspectives of SDGs. By taking advantage of the strengths of both companies, we will propose sustainable construction and spaces that leverage the power of greenery. Implementation of SDGs Dissemination Workshops and Training The Sumitomo Forestry Group holds employee workshops and training by external lecturers for employees to provide learning opportunities that link SDGs to business operations. As one example of our workshops, participants play a card game in which participants envision the achievement of their life goals at the year 2030, such as wealth acquisition, comfortable leisure lifestyle, and environmental conservation in light of economic, social and environmental barometers that reÔ¨Çect global circumstances. Participants were divided into groups, which then used Lego blocks as a tool to discuss what they can do based on the results as members of the Sumitomo Forestry Group to help realize a world in which Workshop Using Lego Blocks ‚ÄúNo one will be left behind.‚Äù Workshop and training sessions were held four times in Ô¨Åscal 2019 with 101 participants, mainly among employees working on housing, construction, production, and distribution. The General Manager Meeting convened in October 2019 also gathered 171 general managers together for a lecture with theme SDGs change companies by Hiroko Kuniya, newscaster and goodwill ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The workshops and other eÔ¨Äorts at the Sumitomo Forestry Group aim to further disseminate SDGs understanding and action toward achieving the goals, both internally and externally. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú37Ôºû Material Issue 1: Ongoing Timber and Materials Procurement that Considers Sustainability and Biodiversity Basic Policy With businesses centered on wood, Sumitomo Forestry Group promotes sustainable forest management and timber procurement both domestically and abroad. In procuring wood and timber products, we engage in management under speciÔ¨Åed numerical targets, placing it as an important theme of sustainability that encompasses environmental aspects such as climate change measures and biodiversity conservation as well as social aspects such as human rights. With increase in concern about forest depletion as one of the causes of climate change, demand for sustainability in procurement is on the rise. Amid these circumstances, Sumitomo Forestry Group has declared the goal of handling all of its timber and timber products to be sustainable by Ô¨Åscal 2021. We have heightened our evaluation criteria for sustainable timber procurement as we work to step up our conÔ¨Årmation system. As we continue to contribute to solving social issues, we have deÔ¨Åned KPI to establish timber procurement that achieves both forest resource utilization and biodiversity conservation. Contributions to the SDGs and Material Issues Management of Material Issue 1 Material Issue 1 of our Mid-Term Sustainability Targets is ‚ÄúOngoing timber and materials procurement that considers sustainability and biodiversity.‚Äù We have derived three targets from this issue, which we incorporate into our management practices through inclusion in annual activity policy and measures for each department.

President and Representative Director Toshiro Mitsuyoshi The Sumitomo Forestry Group ºs Long-term Biodiversity Targets (summary) Group-wide Targets 1. (Aim to achieve sustainable forests) In all timber-related businesses, from upstream to downstream, we will work to prevent a reduction in forest areas and pursue forest sustainability. We will strive to regenerate forests through reforestation and natural regeneration and logging a planned, sustainable manner that takes into account the forest ºs ability to grow. We will increase the procurement and use of sustainable timber, such as forest certiÔ¨Åed timber, plantation forest timber and Japanese timber. We will promote the eÔ¨Écient use as well as the recycling and reuse of timber. 2. (Increase the amount of CO2 absorbed by and sequestered in forests and timber) By cultivating healthy forests and promoting the use of timber through the greater use of timber construction materials and the construction of wooden buildings, we will strive to increase the amount of CO2 absorbed by and sequestered in forests and timber to contribute to the protection of biodiversity and the alleviation of climate change. Individual targets 3. (Forests) We will promote forest management that regenerates, maintains and increases biodiversity. We will carry out zoning to protect ecosystems and the habitats of living creatures. We will ensure that in terms of area, 20% or more of our Company-owned forests in Japan are environment forests that emphasize environmental conservation. We will maintain that 100% Company-owned forests remain forest-certiÔ¨Åed. We will maintain and increase biodiversity at our operation sites based on results of our biodiversity monitoring of Company-owned forests in Japan. We will conduct operations at plantation forests overseas while considering how best to contribute to local communities, economies and education. 4. (Products) We will provide products and services that take into account biodiversity, such as forest-certiÔ¨Åcation and products and services that have undergone environmental assessment. 5. (Design) We will work to develop homes and communities that are in harmony with the natural environment and their surrounding urban landscapes. 6. (Construction) We will manage and minimize the generation of waste by promoting a zero-emissions policy in building and construction. 7. (Greening) We will be considerate to the surrounding ecosystems and tree species and actively cultivate native species. 8. (Plants) We will manage and minimize pollutants, waste and noise, and reduce their impact on biodiversity. 9. (Public relations) We will actively communicate the importance of biodiversity to all stakeholders, including customers, business partners, and local communities. Ôºú72Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 10. (Research) We will gather the latest information and develop conservation technologies to implement biodiversity initiatives. 11. (Social contribution) We will protect trees that are historically and culturally important and also preserve their genetic material. Policy on Biodiversity Conservation in Company-Owned Forests in Japan (excerpt) 1. Diversity of ecosystems We will properly manage strictly protected areas designated under the Natural Parks Law of the Japanese government and other legislation in a manner stipulated by the law. In other areas, we will ensure continuity of forests by limiting the area of forest harvested, particularly when clear cutting is conducted. 2. Diversity of species We will work to prevent a decline in the number of species existing in natural forests by refraining from expansive planting projects and other extreme activities involving the replacement of species that would have a major impact on existing ecosystems. We will also give the utmost consideration to the protection of rare Ô¨Çora and fauna in all operations, making reference to the Sumitomo Forestry Red Data Book. 3. Genetic diversity Genetic variation and the maintenance of populations to support them will become issues in the future. However, analysis is complicated and therefore we will closely watch monitoring activities carried out by government and public institutions and their Ô¨Åndings.

Directors and Executive OÔ¨Écers Analysis, Assessment and Results for the EÔ¨Äectiveness of the Board of Directors 1. Assessment Method We assessed the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the Board of Directors in Ô¨Åscal 2019 by checking whether the Board has been fulÔ¨Ålling its role with respect to our Basic Policy on Corporate Governance (hereinafter ‚Äúprogress check‚Äù), and exchanging opinions with the outside directors and outside statutory auditors about the Board of Directors, in addition to conducting questionnaires for all directors and statutory auditors (anonymous questionnaire conducted directly by a third-party agency to ensure anonymity) while receiving advice from external bodies on self-assessments and analysis. 2. Assessment Results The results of the questionnaires, progress check, and exchange of opinions with outside oÔ¨Écers found that the functions of the Board of Directors were eÔ¨Äective overall. As eÔ¨Äorts to address issues discovered as a challenge in the Ô¨Åscal 2018 assessment, we strengthened monitoring of the Board of Directors by revising the Board of Directors discussion standards and clarifying the impairment procedures for Ô¨Åxed assets as part of enhancements to defensive governance. Sumitomo Forestry also conÔ¨Årmed that discussions on our human resource strategies and corporate culture reforms were held at the informal meeting of executive oÔ¨Écers including outside executives. As future challenges, the exchange of ideas touched on needs for a response to issues pointed out in questionnaires, such as improvements to operational procedures of the Nomination and Remuneration Advisory Committee and better utilization of informal discussions between executive oÔ¨Écers to enhance Board of Director deliberations, in addition to the necessity for further debate on the ideal form of future business strategies in light of the COVID-19. We will strive to further improve the eÔ¨Äectiveness at Board of Directors meetings by continually working to heighten the level of discussion with awareness toward highlighted topics in the future. Board of Statutory Auditors The Board of Statutory Auditors meets to discuss and make decisions on important matters regarding audits. The Ô¨Åve statutory auditors, including the three outside statutory auditors, utilize the deep insights and diverse perspectives they have acquired from their various business backgrounds to provide oversight for the directors' execution of duties.

Risk Management Framework Sustainability Committee In response to matters including SDGs, Ô¨Ånal recommendations of TCFD and human rights issues, the Sustainability Committee was established in Ô¨Åscal 2018 based on the growing requirements for medium to long-term initiatives and informational disclosure about the Environment, Society and Governance (ESG). The Sustainability Committee is made up of executive oÔ¨Écers also appointed as director, and divisional mangers with the President acting as the Committee chairperson. The Committee is convened four times a year to formulate and promote initiatives for medium to long-term ESG challenges related to the sustainability of the Sumitomo Forestry Group including climate change in addition to analyzing risks and opportunities, conducting progress management of the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, which incorporate business strategies toward achieving the SDGs, including monitoring of implementation and eÔ¨Äectiveness of the Our Values and Code of Conduct. The content of all committee proceedings is reported to the Board of Directors to enable our business operations to become part of the solution for social issues. Risk Management Framework Responding to TCFD Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú81Ôºû Internal Audits Sumitomo Forestry's Internal Audit Department draws on risk assessments in selecting about 60 business sites from among the roughly 200 business sites, including subsidiaries, each year to conduct internal audits. The sites are selected by specifying an order of priority based on the two perspectives of operational risk (business results, size, complexity of business, etc.) and control risk (risk management framework). In the internal audits, the department checks on how a site is executing its operations and managing its oÔ¨Éce work, including its compliance with laws and regulations, and it reports its Ô¨Åndings to the President, the executive oÔ¨Écer in charge of internal audits and to internal statutory auditors, as well as to the manager responsible for the site and the executive oÔ¨Écer or director in charge of the business site. Furthermore, if any indications have been made, the department checks the improvement eÔ¨Äorts implemented at the site, such as by examining documents and conducting quarterly follow-up reviews, in accordance with the necessary compliance to laws and internal regulations, and reports on these to the President and to the executive oÔ¨Écer in charge.

Total Remuneration Paid to Outside Executives (FY2019) Number of Personnel Total Amount (Million yen) 5 55 Ôºú82Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Content Disclosed Regarding Remuneration Amount or Determination Policy of the Calculation Methods The Sumitomo Forestry Group regards the establishment of an executive remuneration system as fundamental for directors and statutory auditors to fulÔ¨Åll the duty expected of them by all of its stakeholders toward achieving the Group's Corporate Philosophy. 1. Remuneration for Directors (Excluding Outside Directors) With the exception of outside directors, remuneration for directors comprises three types: monthly remuneration as basic remuneration, shares with restriction of transfer, and bonuses tied to business performance. We determine remuneration for each directorship position according to roles and responsibilities. While basic remuneration is paid as a Ô¨Åxed cash amount determined by directorship position, a certain percentage of the amount is paid in shares with restriction of transfer. The scope of the cash payment amount is determined by a resolution of the general meeting of shareholders, while the monetary amount to be paid in the form of shares with restriction of transfer is to be determined by the general meeting of shareholders at no more than 100 million yen per year. The purpose of remuneration in the form of shares with restriction of transfer is to provide medium to long-term incentive that heightens the desire to increase our corporate value and the sense of pride and motivation, while establishing a sense of values held in common with shareholders. Remuneration tied to business performance is determined with the approval of the general meeting of shareholders, with consideration given to consolidated recurring income excluding diÔ¨Äerences in actuarial calculations used in retirement beneÔ¨Åts accounting, and current net income levels for parent company shareholders. 2. Remuneration for Outside Directors Remuneration for outside directors comprises only basic monthly remuneration. 3. Remuneration for Statutory Auditors Remuneration for statutory auditors comprises only basic monthly remuneration. 4. General Meeting of Shareholders Resolution on Remuneration for Directors The amount of remuneration for directors of no more than 40 million yen per month (no more than 5 million yen per month for outside directors) was approved at the 76th General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 24, 2016. A limit on remuneration for directors (excluding outside directors) through the allocation of shares with restriction of transfer of no more than 100 million yen per year was approved at the 78th General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 22, 2018. The amount of remuneration for statutory auditors of no more than 8 million yen per month was approved at the 74th General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 20, 2014. The retirement bonus system for directors was abolished at the conclusion of the 65th General Meeting of Shareholders held on June 29, 2005. In addition, we use the results of a survey conducted by a third party of directorship remuneration at domestic corporations in order to set directors' remuneration at levels that are appropriate from the perspective of ensuring objectivity and appropriateness. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú83Ôºû Risk Management Risk Management Framework In order to reinforce its framework for managing business risks for the entire Group, Sumitomo Forestry has created the Risk Management Basic Regulations and has appointed the President of Sumitomo Forestry as the highest authority on risk management for the Sumitomo Forestry Group, executive oÔ¨Écers in charge of head oÔ¨Éce departments and each division headquarters have been appointed authorities on risk management of their department, and general managers have been appointed to promote risk management. The Regulation encompasses risks in environmental, social, and governance aspects, comprehensively. Based on these regulations, the Company also places the Risk Management Committee, comprised of the Company president as the chairperson, together with all of executive oÔ¨Écers. Each executive oÔ¨Écer identiÔ¨Åes and analyzes the priority risks to be addressed in their respective area of responsibility as well as drafts and executes response plans at all relevant workplaces. The progress of measure against these risks is also shared and discussed at a committee held periodically each quarter. This committee mainly deliberates on short-term risks and risks that have already manifested, including anti-corruption and other compliance-related matters. The Committee primarily discusses responses to compliance-related risks and other short-term risks, as well as risks that have already emerged. Executive OÔ¨Écers and Directors attend this committee as it outlines and reports about the content of the activities to the Board of Directors to put in place systems representative of the business. A Compliance Subcommittee and a BCM Subcommittee* have also been established under the command of the Risk Management Committee. These are chaired by the general manager of the General Administration Department, and are comprised of the executives in charge of risk management at each Group company. These subcommittees carry out speciÔ¨Åc activities for increasing eÔ¨Äectiveness against ‚Äúcompliance risk‚Äù and against ‚Äúbusiness interruption risk‚Äù, which are both regarded as cross-sectional risks aÔ¨Äecting the Group. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the Risk Management Committee met four times, and conÔ¨Årmed the state of progress with respect to 45 priority risks. Also, the Compliance Subcommittee and BCM Subcommittee met twice and four times, respectively, and reports on the proceedings were also submitted to the Board of Directors four times. Against risks in environmental, social, and governance aspects speciÔ¨Åed in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct, tangible actions have been taken to increase eÔ¨Äectiveness. With respect to climate change, for example, the latest information is considered together with information obtained from each department in order to evaluate risks and opportunities that are thought to have a severe Ô¨Ånancial impact at the corporate and departmental levels. Since Ô¨Åscal 2018, each business department joined together in conducting TCFD-based scenario analyses. Items determined through this process to be priority risks in the medium to long term are discussed in the Sustainability Committee. The results are outlined and reported to the Board of Directors to build a system to reÔ¨Çect this information into the execution of our businesses. At the beginning of Ô¨Åscal 2020, we reassessed management target risks by analyzing the scale and inÔ¨Çuence of relevant risks from the likelihood of occurrence in order to properly respond to the changing risks faced by the Sumitomo Forestry Group. In this way, we will strengthen our risk management framework by following the PDCA cycle to make continuous improvements with respect to the priority risks selected at the beginning of each period. * The BCP Subcommittee was renamed to BCM Subcommittee in April 2019 in order to promote and strengthen the BCM system of the entire group, in and outside Japan. Corporate Governance and Internal Control Business Continuity Management System Sustainability Committee Responding to TCFD Ôºú84Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Risk Management Structure of the Sumitomo Forestry Group Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú85Ôºû Risks in Operations The following risks have been identiÔ¨Åed in operations as stated on the Security Reports. 1. Risks related to trends in housing markets worldwide 2. Legal and regulatory risks 3. Foreign exchange risks 4. Quality assurance risks 5. Credit facility risks of business partners 6. Overseas business risks 7. Risks of mountain forests and plantation forest operation locations held and managed 8. Risks of informational leaks 9. Risks in accounting retirement beneÔ¨Åts 10. Climate change risks 11. Risks of emergency situations caused by natural disasters, etc. 12. Risks of the COVID-19 impact on business Risks associated with quality assurance Sumitomo Forestry Home Tech Co., Ltd. (‚ÄúHome Tech‚Äù), a renovation service subsidiary of Sumitomo Forestry, which published the incidents of non-conformance with the building standards laws and regulations in its detached house extension works (the ‚ÄúIncidents‚Äù) on September 18, 2019, conducted an on-site examination of the extension works to the detached houses in the prefectures of Aichi, Mie and Gifu (the ‚ÄúThree Tokai Prefectures‚Äù) that it had contracted for in the past. Furthermore, on September 27, 2019, Home Tech established a special investigation committee composed by members including outside experts (the ‚ÄúSpecial Investigation Committee‚Äù) and requested that the Special Investigation Committee investigate the facts, analyze the causes of the Incidents and propose recurrence prevention measures. As a result, on August 11, 2020, Home Tech received a written report (the ‚ÄúReport‚Äù) from the Special Investigation Committee, and based on its substance, the board of directors of Home Tech adopted, at its meeting held on August 12, 2020, a resolution conÔ¨Årming the causes of the Incidents and the recurrence prevention measures to be taken, as follows: 1. Outline of the results of investigation by Home Tech Certain input from outside parties gave rise to a suspicion that non-conformance with the building standards laws and regulations (the ‚ÄúLegal Non-conformance‚Äù) existed in part of the properties in the Three Tokai Prefectures whose extension works had been contracted for by Home Tech. In response, Home Tech conducted an exhaustive investigation of all of the 361 properties that had received construction conÔ¨Årmation, from among the detached houses in the Three Tokai Prefectures regarding which Home Tech had contracted for extension works since April 1997, when Home Tech started its business as a company specialized in renovation, in order to identify whether those properties conformed to the building standards laws and regulations as of the survey date (the ‚ÄúLegal Conformance‚Äù). As a result of such investigation, Home Tech conÔ¨Årmed that as of July 31, 2020, the Legal Non-conformance existed in 206 out of the 333 properties whose investigation had been completed. All of those incidents of Legal Non-conformance arose from the failure to appropriately implement design work to make the enlarged houses conformant to the building standards laws and regulations and the failure to incorporate in the design the works required to be performed to ensure conformance to laws and regulations. Home Tech will endeavor to promptly carry out the necessary repair works for the 206 properties with respect to which the Legal Non-conformance has been conÔ¨Årmed. The impact of the Incidents on our results of operations has already been reÔ¨Çected in the consolidated Ô¨Ånancial statements disclosed in the annual securities report of Sumitomo Forestry for the 80th term that was Ô¨Åled with the Director of the Kanto Local Finance Bureau on June 23, 2020. Ôºú86Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 2. Causes of the Incidents On the basis of the analysis of the causes of the Incidents contained in the Report and the results of the investigation of the properties conducted by Home Tech, Home Tech believes that the combination of the problem indicated in (4) below with the existing problems speciÔ¨Åed in (1) through (3) below was the main cause of the occurrence of the Legal Non-conformance in part of its extension works to detached houses in the Three Tokai Prefectures. (1) Building designers lacked suÔ¨Écient knowledge and experiences and had a low regard for ensuring the Legal Conformance; (2) No organizational checks had been conducted to ensure the Legal Conformance of design work; (3) The managing architects stationed at each of the branches, who were supposed to supervise the technical matters in the architectural oÔ¨Éce, were not in a condition to fulÔ¨Åll their functions to oversee the design work by the architects belonging to their respective branches; and (4) With respect to checking of the Legal Conformance of the design drawings, the scope of the tasks outsourced to independent architectural oÔ¨Éces was not clear, and the deliverables of the outsourced tasks had not been suÔ¨Éciently checked. 3. Recurrence prevention measures based on the Incidents Home Tech takes seriously the Special Investigation Committee ºs proposals for prevention of recurrence as described in the Report and will seek to implement the following recurrence prevention measures: Raising of awareness of compliance of design work with laws and regulations, acquisition of pertinent knowledge and accumulation of relevant experiences; Reinforcement of organizational checking systems to ensure the Legal Conformance of designs; Improvement of outsourcing to independent architectural oÔ¨Éces; and Enhancement of communications between the head oÔ¨Éce and branches as well as sharing and accumulation of technical and technological information. Securities Reports/Internal Control Reports (in Japanese) Compliance Business Continuity Management Risks Associated with Illegal Logging and Conversion Timber Illegal logging is recognized as a crucial issue globally, and progress is being made to strengthen related laws and regulations in a number of countries and regions. Japan has announced the Act on Promotion of Use and Distribution of Legally-Harvested Wood and Wood Products (The Clean Wood Act) on May 20, 2016, which was enacted on May 20, 2017. Addressing stronger control of illegally harvested timber not only responds to the requirements of the world but it is also extremely important for the Sumitomo Forestry Group to continue businesses sustainably. In addition to legality of the procured timber and timber products, sustainability of forests that produce timber has been in question recently. ‚ÄúConversion timber‚Äù is timber generated during the conversion of natural forest areas to non-forest use (such as oil palm plantation). While the conversion to farm land is often discussed from the commodity side (oil palm, soy, rubber and cattle), conversion timber now poses sustainability risks to forestry industry. Smooth Response to the Clean Wood Act Impact on the Sumitomo Forestry Group The Sumitomo Forestry Group could jeopardize its own businesses that handle wood resources if it neglected its duty and dealt in illegally logged timber. Moreover, these actions would harm the image of the company and could directly damage our business performance such as compensation for damage and turnover. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú87Ôºû Risk Countermeasures The Sumitomo Forestry Group has been committed to responsible timber procurement, pioneering legislation in Japan and having established the Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy in 2005, to bring contributions to a sustainable society via business activities of ‚Äúwood‚Äù -a renewable resource. In 2015, Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy was extended beyond timber and became subject to procurement of building materials, raw materials of products, and end products, and reestablished as Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy. The Group's economically, socially and environmentally responsible procurement today is being carried out based on the policy. Furthermore, in order to tackle this emerging issue surrounding conversion timber, Sumitomo Forestry has set a target in its Mid-term Sustainability Targets, targeting FY2021, to 100% procure ‚Äúsustainable timber,‚Äù which eliminate conversion timber. Procurement Initiatives Emerging Risks Associated with Carbon Accounting on Biomass Fuel Biomass power generation using wood chips as fuel has long been considered as ‚Äúcarbon neutral‚Äù and as clean energy. While burning wood fuel generates methane and N2O and thus it is not ‚ÄúGHG neutral,‚Äù it is only required to report emissions other than CO2. However, SBT initiative announced its updated criteria this April; Bioenergy accounting: Direct emissions from the combustion of biomass and biofuels, as well as GHG removals associated with bioenergy feedstock1, must be included alongside the company ºs inventory and must be included in the target boundary when setting a science-based target and when reporting progress against that target. If biogenic emissions from biomass and biofuels are considered climate neutral, the company must provide justiÔ¨Åcation of the underlying assumptions. Detailed information is not yet available from the initiative, nor the guidance on what could be the justiÔ¨Åcation for biomass to be considered climate neutral. Impact on the Sumitomo Forestry Group Sumitomo Forestry operates four wood biomass power generation plants in Japan and is currently planning to add another in 2021, which would generate total of 177MW. If it is required to add CO2 emissions to currently reported methane and N2O from the biomass power generation operation, Sumitomo Forestry Group ºs SBT emission reduction target would be extremely challenging. Climate-related regulation changes in each regions/countries are unpredictable and may cause the company additional payment if carbon pricing incurs additional tax payment. Sumitomo Forestry ºs corporate brand image of being an environmentally friendly company may also be negatively impacted. Risk Countermeasures Sumitomo Forestry continues to strive to reduce carbon emissions based on its Mid-term Sustainable Targets for each business units. Also, Sumitomo Forestry is becoming more active in lobbying through the Forest Solution Group of the WBCSD (World Business Council for Sustainable Development) and CDP Japan Club, where Sumitomo Forestry serves as member. Risk Associated to IPCC 1.5 Degree-C Special Report Based on IPCC º 1.5 Degree-C Special Report published in October 2018, SBT initiative announced its updated criteria in April 2019; new scope 1+2 targets shift from 2 degree-C to well below 2 degree-C or 1.5 degree-C. The companies will need to have their targets reviewed every 5 years to make sure these are in line with the latest climate science. By the end of 2024 at the latest, based on the current criteria, updated targets will need to be aiming at well below 2 degree-C. Ôºú88Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Impact on Sumitomo Forestry Sumitomo Forestry ºs targets that were approved as an SBT targets in July 2018 is reportedly considered as ‚Äú2 degree-C‚Äù target. Targets review every 5 years for Sumitomo Forestry is July 2022 at the latest. Currently approved target of reducing 21% by FY2030 compared to FY2017 is already a challenging one, requiring the company to invest heavily for overseas manufacturing facilities and to purchase renewable energy. In order to align with the updated criteria, each business units of the company, especially manufacturing and biomass energy power generation, faces additional cost and investment. Risk Countermeasures In addition to current eÔ¨Äort to reduce energy consumption, the company started actions to secure electricity from renewable energy sources. One of the sources would be to purchase electricity from solar-panels on each detached houses sold by the company in the past. Under the FIT Act of Japan (Feed-in TariÔ¨Ä for Renewable Energy) residential PV system owners have signed up for 10-year contract, which expires in November 2019 at the earliest. While the current regulation does not allow Sumitomo Forestry to directly contract with each residential PV system owners, the company is undertaking studies for future plan as well as potential utilization of the ‚Äúenvironmental value‚Äù from portion of power generated and consumed in-house. New Business Plan Risk Assessment All new business and project plans that are brought for deliberation to the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee, which is the advisory body to the president, Sumitomo Forestry conducts risk assessment for the following categories, taking into account the entire supply chain. If a risk is conÔ¨Årmed, a report is made regarding the risk and measures to deal with it, which is used to determine implementation. In addition, the same risk assessment is recommended for new business projects that are not brought for deliberation to these meetings because they can be implemented under the jurisdiction of the respective division or aÔ¨Éliated company. ‚ñ† Environmental Aspects 1. Greenhouse Gases 2. Biodiversity Conservation (Including VeriÔ¨Åcation of Protected Regions) 3. Waste 4. Water Resources 5. Soil Contamination 6. Noise 7. Other ‚ñ† Social Aspects 1.

Impact on Local Communities (Including Concern for Local Residents and Administrations, Industry Organizations, NPOs, Municipal Citizens' Groups and Indigenous People) Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú89Ôºû Risk Education As ways to increase the sensitivity of risk in the executives and employees and in the corporate culture of the Sumitomo Forestry Group, the Group conducts e-learning each year for executives and employees as well as a risk management training for newly joined employees. In 2019, the Group introduced and shared examples from risks emerged in the past that should be noted beyond speciÔ¨Åc business departments at the Compliance Subcommittee as a venue for people in charge of risk management at the Company and each Group company. Rapidly Comprehending and Dealing with Risks The Sumitomo Forestry Group operates Two-hour Rule system designed to quickly and accurately communicate information to management in the event of an emergency situation that may have a grave impact on company management. In addition to the regular reporting line, it utilizes communication via the Division responsible for risk management. Through this system, management can take the best decision speedily, ensuring an initial response which avoids loss and controls the situation. Moreover, it serves a role in collecting and accumulating reported cases and assists in improved business practice and prevention of recurrence. Furthermore, the structure is organized so that, by sharing information with the public relations departments, important situations are disclosed to stakeholders properly and in a timely manner. Two-Hour Rule and Use of Risk Information Ôºú90Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Compliance Basic Policy The Sumitomo Forestry Group established the new Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct as a foundation for its policies and regulations based on its Corporate Philosophy and Our Values. The Sumitomo Forestry Group uses the Code of Conduct for compliance not only at its Group companies but also at its suppliers to prevent corruption such as bribery, engage in fair business practices, maintain informational conÔ¨Ådentiality, build healthy relationships with politicians, and respect human rights. Compliance Promotion Sumitomo Forestry established the Compliance Subcommittee as a subordinate organization under the Risk Management Committee, chaired by the general manager of the General Administration Department and comprised of the persons responsible for risk management, including those from the responsible departments at each Group company. As a cross-cutting organization across the Group, the subcommittee promotes responses to compliance risk. It has established the Group standard risk management system and tools to ensure compliance with the Construction Business Act of Japan and other laws throughout the Group, for eÔ¨Écient response to compliance risk. During Ô¨Åscal 2019, the subcommittee met twice, and continuing on with its Group-wide initiatives from the previous Ô¨Åscal year, it worked to make continuous improvements to its compliance system, such as making a comprehensive examination of risks with respect to legal requirements, such as for business activities requiring government permits and licenses. In addition, by acquiring the latest knowledge in the Ô¨Åeld through compliance seminars featuring external expert instructors, the Company endeavors to align the perspectives of those persons throughout the Group who are responsible for compliance, working bottom-up. These activities are outlined and reported to the Board of Directors once every quarter to build a system to reÔ¨Çect this information into the execution of our businesses. In addition to making monthly activity reports to auditors and internal audit divisions, any particularly important initiatives or risk information that is common to the Group is shared with the auditors in each Group company via the meetings of Statutory Auditors of Sumitomo Forestry and its subsidiary companies. Thus, the Group has developed a system for promoting compliance in its lines of business execution using internal and external approaches. Based on the Sumitomo Group Procurement Policy, Sumitomo Forestry Group responds to compliance risks in supply chains by working with suppliers to ensure that timber procurement is performed legally and in a sustainable manner with consideration of legal compliance, human rights, labor practices, biodiversity conservation, and local communities. The Timber Procurement Committee convened four times in Ô¨Åscal 2019 led by the director and managing executive oÔ¨Écer in charge of sustainability promotion as chairperson and procurement managers from the Timber and Building Materials Division, Housing and Construction Division, and each department procuring timber and wood products as members. This committee receives reports on results from local interviews and the Sustainability Procurement Survey, including the level of supplier compliance awareness, and requires corrective actions to rectify any supplier issues found. Compliance Training In order to heighten awareness among each and every employee about compliance, Sumitomo Forestry Group conducts compliance training for new employees to promote their understanding about general compliance issues, such as traÔ¨Éc safety, and information security. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, training was administered to a total of 385 new graduate recruits (Group total in Japan), and to 70 mid-career recruits (Sumitomo Forestry). Compliance training was also provided to groups of employees at speciÔ¨Åc levels, including ‚ÄúTraining for New General Managers.‚Äù Furthermore, two e-learning courses, ‚ÄúCompliance and Risk Management‚Äù and ‚ÄúInformation Security‚Äù have been set as parts of compulsory courses to be taken by all employees who can use the internal website, and employees are required to take these courses annually (requires passing the test to measure eÔ¨Äectiveness of the training). In addition, each Group company in Japan and overseas also has its own arrangements for training, such as for new employees. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú91Ôºû Compliance Hotline The Sumitomo Forestry Group is committed to creating a workplace environment equipped with a self-corrective function for catching any misconduct concealed in day-to-day operations at an early stage. To this end, the Group established the Compliance Hotline (advice desks) in 2002 in order to prevent corruption such as anti-bribery, deÔ¨Åned in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct. The Group has two Compliance Hotlines, one within the Group (general manager of the General Administration Department is responsible) and one external to it (lawyer), ready to provide advice and receive reports via telephone or a dedicated email address. The Hotlines not only assist Group company employees but are available for anyone who works continuously for the Group, such as employees at partner building contractors, through cooperative safety meetings with contractors and the distribution of portable guides on risk. As well as stipulating in the relevant regulations and user manual about the protection of rights for persons seeking advice or making reports, and informing this on the Sumitomo Forestry intranet, the user manual is also distributed to all Group employees. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the Compliance Hotlines were contacted with 19 times about such topics as the workplace environments and management of working hours. In cases where the facts were conÔ¨Årmed, in addition to implementing the necessary corrective measures, initiatives were promoted aimed at preventing recurrence including using these examples in training for managers. The company instructs managers and all persons to protect whistleblower rigorously if anyone reported. In October 2019, we put in place a whistleblowing mechanism shared with some Group companies under the General Administration Department to strengthen compliance overseas as our Group expands businesses around the world. Furthermore, an external multilingual operator is used for this whistleblowing mechanism. Anyone can report an issue in English, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese.

Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú95Ôºû Business Continuity Management Business Continuity Management System To counter risks which could signiÔ¨Åcantly impact Head OÔ¨Éce functions and are beyond a company's capacity to prevent, such as natural disasters and pandemic inÔ¨Çuenza, Sumitomo Forestry has established the BCM Subcommittee*. The subcommittee sits under the Risk Management Committee, is chaired by the general manager of the General Administration Department and is comprised of the persons responsible for risk management including Group company, which enhances business continuity management system (BCM) and promotes initiatives based upon business continuity plans (BCP). Since Sumitomo Forestry Group companies are an integral link in the supply chain of one another's business, each Group company is committed to constantly improving the BCP Simulation Training resilience of the whole Group, and tackling Group-wide issues with the intention of enhancing business continuity. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, Sumitomo Forestry held four BCM Subcommittee meetings. Critical initial responses in the event of a powerful earthquake, such as Tokyo Inland Earthquake was reviewed; in the meantime various training programs were planned and implemented. * The BCP Subcommittee was renamed to BCM Subcommittee in April 2019 in order to promote its BCM system in the entire Group, and improving business continuity with responding to variety of crises, expanding alternative locations, and strengthening disaster recovery headquarters functions. Measures for Employee Safety and Systems for Business Continuity Portable Guide for Risk Responses, Safety ConÔ¨Årmation and Information Communication System Sumitomo Forestry Group distributes Portable Guides for Risk Responses to all Group employees in Japan, promoting the basic response procedure to take in the event of a disaster. A safety conÔ¨Årmation system has also been introduced, allowing the safety of employees to be checked quickly in the event of a natural disaster. Safety conÔ¨Årmation drills are conducted at domestic Group companies every year, and in Ô¨Åscal 2019, a sum of 14,669 employees have participated in them. Furthermore, we have been operating a crisis management portal site since October 2016 as an information communication tool indispensable to business continuity from the Portable Guide for Risk Responses moment disaster strikes through the recovery. This portal site allows employees Groupwide to conÔ¨Årm notices from the company and disaster information with only access to the Internet even when verbal communication networks and transportation infrastructure are down. Members and other staÔ¨Ä entrusted with the responsibilities at each division, base and aÔ¨Éliate company can also share information through SNS functional1ity on the portal site to regularly conÔ¨Årm safety and conduct information communication training. Ôºú96Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Disaster Prevention and Damage Mitigation Measures By way of preparation for employees walking long distances back home on foot or those stranded at the oÔ¨Éce unable to return home in the event of a massive earthquake, Sumitomo Forestry has stipulated a minimum stockpile of common emergency supplies for each workplace, and has had these distributed to all Group bases. In particular, at bases in large metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya), where it is expected there would be large numbers of stranded employees, enough supplies have been stored for employees to stay at the oÔ¨Éce for up to three days. Also, when selecting new oÔ¨Éces and other facilities, rather than deciding merely on cost and convenience, the person responsible for disaster prevention at Head OÔ¨Éce gets involved, and measures for preventing disasters and reducing damage are implemented, such as measures for preventing oÔ¨Éce equipment from falling over and multifunction printers on wheels from rolling. Furthermore, Sumitomo Forestry has also implemented measures from a perspective of data integrity, such as backing up data at locations physically distant from the data center. BCP Simulation Training In order to overcome the chaos immediately after a large-scale earthquake strikes and to transition quickly to action for business continuity, it is vitally important that the people in charge can make an initial response and can make decisions according to the situation at hand. For this reason, since Ô¨Åscal 2011, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has continued to conduct BCP Large Scale Earthquake Countermeasures Simulation Training, targeted at the persons in charge at each Group company. The aim of this training is to get participants to experience a simulated ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù in an earthquake and to acquire an awareness of the issues, by getting them to make spur of the moment decisions again and again based on rigorous hypothetical scenarios. During the training, since Group First response and rescue training companies from neighboring areas are assembled together in one place, another aim of the exercise is to share an awareness of risks and to strengthen cooperation among them in an emergency. To date, a cumulative total of more than 590 people have participated in this training. Systems have also been developed so that, in situations where employees Ô¨Ånd getting to work diÔ¨Écult, payment of salaries, payments to business partners and other important business operations can still be carried out from a site designated in advance, an employee dormitory, their home or other remote locations while maintaining a high level of security. Simulation drills to check back-up oÔ¨Éce operations are also conducted every year. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we conducted Ô¨Årst-response and rescue training to learn techniques using crowbars on-site (simulating the aftermath of serious earthquakes when no immediate emergency dispatch can be anticipated), simple triage and rapid treatment (JumpSTART Triage) for injured victims, and transport techniques for injured victims. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú97Ôºû Strengthening Supply Chain Business Continuity Plan In readiness for potential disruption of its housing and construction business supply chain following a disaster, Sumitomo Forestry shares the speciÔ¨Åcations and processes for property construction along with site progress status information with business partners including component makers and building contractors. By enabling advanced procurement of materials and production in this way, the Company is striving to reduce the risk of a disruption to operations. However, there were some delays in material procurement and constructions due to the worldwide spread of the COVID-19 in 2020. In light of this situation, we are examining reporting methods for suppliers to report the status of disaster and systemization of history management in cases the suppliers are aÔ¨Äected by natural disasters such as earthquakes or calamities such as Ô¨Åres. We plan to take measures to prevent delays in procurement materials caused by the COVID-19 through discussions with suppliers. In preparation for a second wave, we are reducing risks by increasing inventory at each material supplier where delays occurred as a short-term measure and decentralization of production facilities as a mediumto long-term measure. Sumitomo Forestry also reviews its suppliers of building and construction materials, with supplier evaluations conducted every year for determining whether to continue business with them. Business continuity items, such as systems for ensuring alternative supply routes during a disaster, have been added to these evaluations. These eÔ¨Äorts will work to further reduce risks that may interrupt business operations in the future. Continuity of Customer Service Sumitomo Forestry has setup call centers in Tokyo and Okinawa, thereby facilitating 24-hour after-sales service. Sumitomo Forestry has also developed a mechanism whereby any call center can back up the functions of another call center in the event it is aÔ¨Äected by a disaster. Through a uniÔ¨Åed emergency system, the Group can share damage information pertaining to owners nationwide, enabling us to respond quickly to disaster and requests for repairs.

Relevant Sustainability Initiatives Communication with Our Customers Ôºú112Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Procurement Initiatives Basic Policy The Sumitomo Forestry Group has been committed to responsible timber procurement and having established Timber Procurement Standard and Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy in 2005 and 2007 respectively, to bring contributions to sustainable society via business activities of ‚Äúwood‚Äù -a renewable resource. In July 2015, Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy were extended beyond timber and became subject to procurement of construction materials and other items, and reestablished as Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy. The Group's economically, socially and environmentally responsible procurement today is being carried out based on this policy. Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy Green Procurement and Sustainable Procurement The Sumitomo Forestry Group formulated the Green Procurement Guidelines in 2002. The Guidelines establish standards for procuring products from two perspectives: the supplier's stance toward the environment (corporate activities assessment) and the product's impact on the environment throughout its life cycle (product assessment). In 2013 and again in 2020, the Group revised the Green Procurement Guidelines and added items to ensure even broader progress of sustainability initiatives concerning occupational health and safety and human rights under ‚Äúthe corporate activity assessment.‚Äù Green Procurement Guidelines (extract) Environmental Consideration and Legal Compliance in Responsible Material Procurement The Sumitomo Forestry Group procures materials for the Housing and Construction Business in accordance with the Green Procurement Guidelines. When adopting new products or reforming existing products, we create green procurement ledgers as well as waste disposal conÔ¨Årmation forms (product/packaging) in addition to product speciÔ¨Åcations which deÔ¨Åne the speciÔ¨Åcations, standards and quality criteria of products. Green procurement ledgers conÔ¨Årm aspects of procurement such as verifying the timber procured has been legally logged, conÔ¨Årming the no occurrence no volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as well as use of certiÔ¨Åed chemicals such as insecticides when adopting new products. Regarding materials made of wood, documentations such as legal certiÔ¨Åcation are conÔ¨Årmed to ensure that procured wood materials comply with the Clean Wood Act. The waste disposal conÔ¨Årmation forms (product/packaging) verify aspects such as the type of oÔ¨Äcuts, disposal methods and processing facilities. We create two copies of each form and suppliers and we each keep copies. Status of Sumitomo Forestry Group Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation/CoC CertiÔ¨Åcation (FSC-C113957) Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú113Ôºû Communication with Procurement Partners and Partner Evaluation Sumitomo Forestry's Housing and Construction Business worksites are found in every region of the country, and they rely on support from the many business partners that the Sumitomo Forestry Group collaborates with. The Company considers communication with these companies to be vital in order to share with them its philosophy of improving the quality of homes while protecting the environment. Main Communication Activities with the Business Partners of Sumitomo Forestry's Housing and Construction Division Name/Scale Description Material suppliers of the Housing and Construction Business (suppliers excluding on-site equipment manufacturers, precut factories, building material operators and frame centers) are evaluated every year per type of material based on items including corporate overview, quality, cost, delivery period, environmental response as well as services. We provide feedback from the evaluation results as a way of bettering our procurement. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we provided 245 feedbacks, a 100% implementation Evaluation and feedback based on the Supplier rate. In addition, we regularly audit supplier plants as part of the Evaluation Standards evaluation. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, Sumitomo Forestry audited 117 plants Implementation rate: 100% (FY2019) although these audits have been suspended since February 2020 due to the spread of the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). If buildings are constructed with materials, which are not conÔ¨Årmed for performance quality, it would pose various risks for the people and the buildings. Therefore, we have formulated methods for auditing plants that focus on quality management to conÔ¨Årm whether material we procure are manufactured based on our quality standards and other aspects. Responsible Material Procurement Sustainable procurement practices throughout the supply chain have come to be expected in material procurement that goes beyond checking on quality, cost and delivery dates to conÔ¨Årming eÔ¨Äorts made by the suppliers with respect to the environment, society and other sustainability aspects. The Mid-Term Sustainability Targets announced in May 2019 set an annual implementation target for sustainability procurement survey implementation rate in the supply chain of the domestic housing department and conducted questionnaires about initiatives related to issues such as human rights, occupational health and safety, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable wood materials at each supplier. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, more than 80% of suppliers were surveyed, exceeding the target set for questionnaires with suppliers (subject to the survey*) that make up 65% of our purchasing ratio. We will expand the scope of supplier surveys from Ô¨Åscal 2020 with a plan that calls to implement surveys at suppliers (subject to the survey*) that make up 90% of our purchasing ratio by Ô¨Åscal 2021. * Manufacturers that are direct or indirect suppliers HIGHLIGHT 1: Enhancing Our Timber and Materials Procurement to More EÔ¨Äectively Embrace Human Rights and the Environment Ôºú114Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Housing and Construction Business Initiatives for Sustainability in Timber and Wood Products The Housing and Construction Division newly set a 100% target for the rate of sustainable timber used as primary building material in the Mid-Term Management Plan announced in May 2019. This target aims to put sustainable timber procurement into practice, including conÔ¨Årmation of legal compliance of timber procurement, compliance with human rights and occupational health and safety, biodiversity conservation, and considerations of the local community, especially for timber used in housing as outlined in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy.

Framework for Product Safety and Quality Control Undertaking development such as new technology, materials, housing products and lifestyle proposals based on consumer needs and owner surveys. The Housing and Construction Division and Tsukuba Research Institute are collaborating in experiments at validation facilities and testing of prototypes, promoting the creation of products that incorporate customer feedback, including even in the details of guarantees. Sumitomo Forestry uses a unique system to check design and structure at the time of contracting and through the Ô¨Ånal design stage. A dedicated designer responsible for the work The Materials Selection Subcommittee, which meets once every month to decide upon all materials, conducts design reviews. All materials are checked to ensure that they meet the acceptance and quality standards set by the Tsukuba Research Institute and the Materials Selection Subcommittee. After approved by the Materials Selection Subcommittee, materials are subjected to a further design review after actual on-site use (approximately two years later) to conÔ¨Årm whether the planned quantity can be shipped and whether or not there are any quality defects. Ôºú118Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Sumitomo Forestry centrally manages and shares up-to-date information on the construction, process management, quality control and safety management of each building through its own site management system. Each on-site operator, contractor manager and construction manager during such stages as foundation, construction and completion, conducts inspections which are managed using a construction management record. Additionally, the Head OÔ¨Éce inspection division checks the status of the inspection and Construction Management management. Sumitomo Forestry includes 30 years of free regular inspections with its homes. After the Ô¨Årst 30-years, Sumitomo Forestry provides paid maintenance constructions according to maintenance plans and, if customers extend the building warranty every 10 years, these free regular inspections continue for up to 60 years to ensure the long life of these valuable homes. Sumitomo Forestry has developed a 60-year Maintenance Program that oÔ¨Äers renovation and maintenance proposals and Regular inspection manages maintenance records in order to support its customers. Renovation The performance and reliability of Sumitomo Forestry's proprietary materials used in anti-seismic reinforcement and so on are veriÔ¨Åed at the Tsukuba Research Institute. In addition, we are advocating seismic retroÔ¨Åtting by undergoing a technological evaluation of the Japan Building Disaster Prevention Association. Seismic Resistant Housing The Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake and the Great East Japan Earthquake as well as a recent major earthquake in Kumamoto have been among the disasters that have wrought enormous damage in Japan. In addition, major earthquakes are forecast to occur in the Nankai Trough, resulting in year-by-year increase in demand for seismic resistance for wooden houses. In response to customer need for seismic resistant houses, Sumitomo Forestry Home Tech has developed original construction methods that enable heightened seismic resistance without diminishing high levels of the home's structural strength, workability or insulation eÔ¨Éciency. Development of K-type Corner Braces and RGS Panels K-shaped corner brace bearing walls use 24 mm thick structural plywood that is in order to store 75 mm thick glass-wool insulation inside. This method has great workability because the materials are light, and it underwent a technological evaluation by the Japan Building Disaster Prevention Association (6.0KN/m¬≤ standard bearing wall). GS panels for renovation (RGS panels) are used as a seismic resistance method to limit deformation by installing these right and left panels (structural plywood with a 24 mm thickness) made of special metals sandwiching highly rigid and highly damping rubber in vertical members. Even greater workability is provided by dividing these panels into top and bottom pieces as well. The method underwent a technological evaluation by the Japan Building Disaster Prevention Association (6.1KN/m¬≤ bearing wall). Moving forward, we plan to develop new vibration dampers that can reduce earthquake damage to buildings to the greatest possible extent. RGS Panel Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú119Ôºû BF Method Sumitomo Forestry started selling the Big-Frame Construction Method (BF Method) as a product for three-story building products in February 2005 and expanded this method to two-story products in October 2009 as well as to products with Ô¨Åre-resistant speciÔ¨Åcations in four-story buildings in April 2015. Thereafter, as awareness of customers grew about risks such as disasters, the BF Method that had further evolved to provide greater strength in high seismic resistance matched customer needs and is now one of Sumitomo Forestry's main products. The proprietary BF Method from Sumitomo Forestry is the Ô¨Årst in Japan to realize the wooden beam Rahmen structure, which is used in high-rise buildings, in wooden houses. The Rahmen structure is designed to stand up to horizontal forces such as earthquakes and wind through rigid-joints that unify the columns and beams with the Ô¨Åxings. The BF Method uses big columns with a large cross-section of 560 mm which is equivalent to roughly Ô¨Åve standard 105 mm columns and incorporates structural materials in addition to a combination of metalto-metal joints to achieve a robust Rahmen structure. The beams and bases of the big columns join strongly thanks to the metal-to-metal joints. This brings about horizontal vibration resistance equal to a 22.4 (times/meter) shear resistance of walls. We ensure seismic resistance while being able to provide both large spaces and wide openings. In addition, expanding and introducing a variety of original technology can support an even wider range of design requirements. Twin-bolt columns (shear resistance of walls equivalent to 33.6 times/meter) that doubles metal joints as well as double-large columns that layer two large columns (shear resistance of walls equivalent to 44.8 times/meter) provide freedom in Ô¨Çoor plans and more spaciousness even on land with many restrictions. The pre-stressed timber beams are large-span beams enable the design for built-in garages ready for parking multiple vehicles, large open living rooms, multi-dwelling homes in addition to a wide range of other purposes. Sumitomo Forestry conducts vibration tests on veriÔ¨Åcation models of structural framework, using the BF Method as well as fullscale structures to examine seismic resistance in anticipation of a large-scale earthquake. The full-size veriÔ¨Åcation model for a three-story building constructed with the BF Method cleared testing for vibrations of a maximum acceleration of 2,699 gal, which is equivalent to the Great East Japan Earthquake (3.3 times the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake). Our technology has been proven tough through a total of 22 harsh vibration tests; two of which were conducted at a magnitude of 7 equal to the Great East Japan Earthquake and 20 of which at a magnitude of 7 equal to the Great HanshinAwaji Earthquake. We also estimate strong aftershocks after a massive earthquake by implementing a repetition of a total of 246 vibration tests. We have repeatedly conducted testing with strong vibrations from a magnitude of 4 to a magnitude of a weak 6 and beyond to magnitude of 7 to ensure continued seismic resistance of the structural framework. In this way, the BF method responds to the needs of customers with powerful structures to bring security as well as Ô¨Çexible designs able to provide comfortably spacious spaces.

By promoting ZEH-speciÔ¨Åcation housing, Sumitomo Forestry reduces each household's primary energy consumption while also providing living spaces that are disaster-resistant and comfortable to live in year-round. We provide environmentally friendly houses that meet the needs of each customer while contributing to the realization of a sustainable society. Promotion of Net Zero Energy House (ZEH) SpeciÔ¨Åcations The household sector in Japan still has high level emission of CO2 although the trend has slowed down. Japan has launched policy targets that aim for more than half of all ZEH Standardization custom-built detached houses constructed by housing manufacturers and other Target (FY2020) companies to be ZEH compliant by 2020 in the measure to counter global warming approved by Cabinet decision in May 2016. The Fifth Strategic Energy Plan approved by 80%*2 Cabinet decision in July 2018 sets a goal that ‚Äúaims to achieve ZEH (net zero energy houses) for more than half of the ordered detached houses newly constructed by homemakers, etc. by 2020 and for all newly constructed houses on average by 2030.‚Äù ZEH is a scheme for housing to provide less than zero annual net primary energy ZEH Standardization consumption by combining equipment to generate energy such as high thermal Performance (FY2019) insulation eÔ¨Éciency, energy-saving equipment, and solar power generation. This standard responds to many of the Sustainable Development Goals, including not 51%*2 only Goal 7: Ensure access to aÔ¨Äordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all and Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts but also Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages and Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. The standardization of ZEH will contribute to building a sustainable society. Wood is conventionally a renewable natural resource that absorbs and stores CO2 during its growth process. As well as using wood for its principal structural members, Sumitomo Forestry has oÔ¨Äered housing proposals where residents can live comfortably all year round by incorporating its own unique Ryouonbou design, which takes advantage of natural blessings such as the wind and sun. The Company's expertise in utilizing these unique characteristics of wood and blessings of nature together with its technologies for the reduction of energy consumption, such as improvements in thermal insulation as well as the adoption of energy-saving equipment, and its technologies for the smart use of energy, such as equipment for generating and storing energy and HEMS*1. Given the ZEH targets established by the Japan, Sumitomo Forestry has set a ZEH standardization target of 80%*2 by Ô¨Åscal 2020, and had reached 51%*2 as of Ô¨Åscal 2019. We are making greater insulation eÔ¨Éciency in buildings and around openings as well as built-in solar power generation systems basic speciÔ¨Åcations as of April 2017 in our new housing. *1 Home Energy Management System‚Äî a system whereby residents can visualize the amounts of energy they generate and use Ôºú122Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 *2 Values include Nearly ZEH and ZEH Oriented while they exclude Hokkaido and Okinawa Pref. respectively.

Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú127Ôºû Moving Higurashi Bettei, Shisakajima, Reopened as a Commemorative Hall Higurashi Bettei was designed by Magoichi Noguchi, a renowned architect of the Meiji period. Built as a guest house and other purposes for the Sumitomo family in 1906, it is located on the island of Shisakajima in the Seto Inland Sea, about 20km oÔ¨Ä the shore of Niihama(where the copper mine was located). As one of 20 Sumitomo Group companies involved in the project to move the structure to a hilltop location in the city of Niihama, Sumitomo Forestry Home Tech was engaged in the reconstruction of the structure, which opened to the public in November 2018 as the Higurashi Bettei Museum and conveys the history of Sumitomo. The history behind the construction of Higurashi Bettei is that it was built as an adjacent structure when Sumitomo's copper smelter was moved to Shisakajima in order to overcome the smoke pollution in Niihama caused by the Besshi Copper Mine operation. More than 110 years after its construction, the building was deteriorating despite its many invaluable design features inside and out. In the relocation construction work, we used timber produced in Ehime Prefecture to build the structure with improved seismic resistance. Design features such as Ô¨Åreplaces, ceilings and Ô¨Çoors were carefully dismantled from the original structure, and reconstructed upon relocation. Exterior view Interior Cleaning drainage water stains Research and Development Related to Life Cycle CO2 (LCCO2) Sumitomo Forestry has been engaged in the development of Life Cycle Carbon Minus (LCCM) housing to achieve negative CO2 emissions across the entire life cycle of homes. Today, we are underway with research and development for the purpose of reducing CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle in wooden structures besides housing. The new research wing constructed at the Tsukuba Research Institute in 2019 achieved dramatic reductions in CO2 emissions thanks to an air-conditioning system with an absorption water chiller-heater base load heat source that uses energy from power generation from solar panels on the roof and wood pellets as renewable energy fuel. These technologies reduce the environmental impact in anticipation of zero energy buildings. By designing an inner courtyard with a three-story atrium at the center of the building with indoor greenery, and a skylight at the top, the new wing adopts technology to deliver sunlight to the plants on the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çoor throughout all four seasons in an eÔ¨Äort to actively use daylight. In addition, we have achieved reductions to the heating and cooling load by introducing natural ventilation that takes advantage of this atrium. In the future, Sumitomo Forestry intends to further these energy reduction eÔ¨Äorts during operation founded in measurement data provided by an instrumentation system. We have also begun cross-department initiatives throughout Sumitomo Forestry to reduce CO2 emissions from material procurement to construction and renovations similar to LCCM housing. Ôºú128Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Carbon Stock in the Housing and Construction Business Trees retain CO2 as carbon even after they are turned into products. Constructing wooden houses can therefore be likened to building forests in the city. The total domestic carbon stocks* in timber that was used in construction of the houses in the MOCCA (timber solutions) business in Ô¨Åscal 2019 reached 193,000 t-CO2. The Sumitomo Forestry Group contributes to measure to counter global warming by increasing carbon stocks for forests and cities. * CO2 Ô¨Åxation is calculated by categorizing the actual amounts of timber used per tree species for new detached houses, rental housing, and MOCCA business, and calculating carbon content from Carbon stock of the timber used in the speciÔ¨Åc gravity of each tree species. the construction of houses and MOCCA (timber solutions) business in Japan in Ô¨Åscal 2019 Housing Sales Adapted to Climate Change Disaster Recovery Guidelines were put in place in the Housing and Construction Division and measures and action guidelines for operations were deÔ¨Åned to quickly and accurately respond to damages from natural disasters to our customers' houses as they become more prevalent due to climate change. As one measure, we established a new Disaster Prevention Department in April 2020 as an oÔ¨Éce to guide disaster prevention measures that prepare for emergencies during ordinary times while taking the lead of each division and aÔ¨Éliated company in an emergency in order to minimize damage as much as possible. On November 2016, BF-Si Resilience Plus was released to pursue security, safety and comfort when disasters such as earthquakes or Ô¨Çooding strike. The BF Method that boasts structural strength only oÔ¨Äered by Sumitomo Forestry ensures the safety of buildings and provides functionality for an uninterrupted lifestyle until recovery even when lifelines are cut thanks to equipment such as enhanced storage space, solar power generation systems, wall-mounted electrical boards and water tanks. A video intercom with a network camera allows the interior to be clearly seen with a wireless camera as well as gives owners the ability to check the state of their house in a disaster even while out-and-about. The large storage space helps keep rooms clean in daily life while the original built-in furniture eÔ¨Äectively prevents the furniture from toppling in an earthquake and can achieve a space in harmony with the interior.

In monetary terms, Japan accounts for 17% of the worldwide total of damage caused by natural disasters. In the 20 years until 2015, the total cost of damages was a staggering 47 trillion yen*. Of course, the bigger the disaster, the longer the recovery eÔ¨Äorts, and it now takes more time to assess the situation as well. For the Kumamoto earthquake that occurred in April 2016, it took about one and a half months for the government to conduct emergency safety checks of buildings aimed to prevent secondary disasters. Disaster victims expressed their anxieties, saying, ‚ÄúIt takes too much time to get the information we need,‚Äù highlighting one of the biggest hurdles in speedy recovery eÔ¨Äorts. * Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters database (EM-DAT) Quickly Gathering Data About Damaged Homes Using Sensing Technologies Sumitomo Forestry is responding to such issues by developing services that promote quick recovery after disasters. Since 2017, we have been conducting trials of IoT services that utilize our analysis technologies. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we are conducting trial experiments using sensors to measure, gather and analyze data of buildings to determine their condition. We place several sensors throughout a house to acquire data, such as the magnitude of an earthquake ºs tremors, Ô¨Çooding or other conditions, and gather this data through a network to analyze. At our Tsukuba Research Institute, we combine this data with the vast amount of data about earthquake resistance of wooden houses for high-precision A sensor installed inside a wall of a house analysis to create a technology that is uniquely ours. We have expanded the proof of concept that began in the Kanto region to all 100 sites as of August 2020. In addition to further heightening the decision accuracy for service provision, we aim to engage in initiatives to ready infrastructure to ensure comprehensive collection and processing of enormous amounts of data while working hard toward actual implementation to ensure customer peace of mind and safety in the event of a disaster. Overview of How Data Is Gathered Ôºú130Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Supporting the Speedy Recovery of Customers and Regions AÔ¨Äected by Disasters If sensors installed in homes can be used remotely to determine the level of damage, we will be able to more quickly grasp, report and respond to the situation and arrange for repairs or other work to provide our customers the support they need. As engineers would no longer have to check each and every house, it would resolve the problem of taking too much time and can even be used for areas made inaccessible after a major disaster. In addition, by utilizing this gathered data in diÔ¨Äerent ways, we can develop new services that would give more people a sense of security. For example, we could collaborate with casualty insurance companies to provide quick damage assessments necessary for insurance beneÔ¨Åts, which would help people rebuild their lives more quickly. In addition, we could provide data to customers and local governments for emergency risk assessments that would help prevent secondary disasters. Furthermore, our data analysis One example of how gathered data results could promote development of technologies that enhance earthquake resistance can be utilized and durability.

Therefore, we raise awareness about information and important items about safety in employees of the Sumitomo Forestry Group of course but also every worker involved with Sumitomo Forestry Home houses, such as on-site construction contractors. Occupational Health and Safety on Construction Sites At the beginning of every Ô¨Åscal year, the Divisional Manager of the Housing and Construction Division formulates an Occupation Health and Safety Policy to provide notiÔ¨Åcation based on circumstances such as the accidents that occurred in the previous period, the state of occupational health and safety promotion as well as compliance with relevant laws. In addition, permeating a safety culture has been designated as a basic policy, and we are working to achieve this in primarily three ways; compliance with the law, promotion of occupation health and safety education and eradication of occupational injuries. Safety check at construction site Always raising awareness toward the recognition of safety Ô¨Årst permeates this safety culture. OÔ¨Éces, branches and building contractors set important management targets for the Ô¨Åscal year to eliminate Ô¨Åve-types of major accidents; falls, accidents with tools, things tipping over, accidents with heavy machines and heat strokes.

In addition, training is designed for maintaining safety such as when workers use grinders*, which are fraught with great hazard, and when they work with circular saws, which are susceptible to accidents due to misuse despite being simple and easy to use. Training for circular saw work * Operation with an electric tool to cut by rotating a grinding stone Together with Construction Contractors Sumitomo Forestry publishes monthly safety and environment information that includes information and topics about safety and the environment to help prevent accidents and avoid risks by repeatedly raising awareness at branches and construction contractors. Safety Training for Construction Contractors Sumitomo Forestry conducts safety training throughout Japan by visiting building and demolition contractors throughout Japan. Directly instructing the people working on-site advances our initiatives toward on-site safety and the environment by building understand about instructions from our company such as permeating a safety culture. Education for Construction Contractors Sumitomo Forestry holds monthly health and occupation councils at branches for the purpose of preventing construction accidents by promoting health and safety. On-site health and safety patrols help bring awareness about safety to construction contractors and provides advice to enhance knowledge, such as conÔ¨Årming the state of sites and improving guidance. The District Safety Improvement Committee launched in Ô¨Åscal 2018 is advancing system development to raising awareness and verify policies and measures in divisions related to safety by strengthening links with oÔ¨Éces, divisions, and branches. Ôºú134Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Environmental Consideration on Construction Sites Basic Policy Sumitomo Forestry is working to advance toward building a sustainable circular society. Particularly at construction and building sites, where the environmental impact of industrial waste is relatively high, we endeavor to mitigate this environmental impact through initiatives to restrict the production of industrial waste, reuse and process materials for recycling. Initiatives to Reduce Industrial Waste Initiative for Reduction of Industrial Waste Generated at New Housing Construction Sites FY2019 Initiatives to Reduce Industrial Waste In July 2014, Sumitomo Forestry set up the Waste Reduction Working Group comprising representatives from the product development, material procurement, production management and environment divisions. The working group has been planning and implementing a wide range of measures to reduce waste on new housing construction sites. We discovered two-thirds of all our waste is made up of wood waste, gypsum board and cardboard from detailed data about the waste that is produced aggregated from the industrial waste management system used under this inter-region certiÔ¨Åcation, which has been in operation since 2012. We are working to reduce waste by concentrating on these three primary forms of waste. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we strove to standardize sub-Ô¨Çoor gypsum board that uses new curing methods and revised standard sizes adopted in Ô¨Åscal 2018. In particular, the new curing methods can realize approximately 150 kg reduction of waste (cardboard) per home by replacing conventional disposable curing materials with reusable curing materials. The usage rate in properties completed by the end of Ô¨Åscal 2019 increased to 83% for reusable curing materials and 91% for sub-Ô¨Çoor gypsum board, which is gradually showing eÔ¨Äective reductions of industrial waste. We are also furthering pre-cut initiatives related to roof slate, siding, and Kizure panel materials that have been measured and processed on sites. Practical introduction in stages of these measures begins in Ô¨Åscal 2020. We expect these pre-cut materials to drastically reduce emissions since pre-cutting is eÔ¨Äective in reduction of industrial waste with heavy weight. Furthermore, we strive to raise awareness on construction sites and conduct educational activities by providing feedback of data about waste emissions from each property to the sites. Reduction Rate of Industrial Waste Generated at New Housing Construction Sites The Sumitomo Forestry Group has also set an 18% reduction in the volume of industrial waste generated per household at new construction sites by Ô¨Åscal 2021 compared to Ô¨Åscal 2017 levels in the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, this initiative achieved gradual results, reducing the amount of industrial waste per new house by 10% from the Ô¨Åscal 2017 level, and we are well on our way to achieve our Ô¨Åscal 2021 target.

We will raise awareness through mediums such as posters including speciÔ¨Åc waste information to make sorting of the 11 categories of waste easier. We have also engaged in eÔ¨Äorts to reuse rather than dispose of wood base and packing materials used when transporting precut structural and other materials. The Sumitomo Forestry Group set a goal of achieving 98.0% waste recycling rate for new construction sites by Ô¨Åscal 2021 as part of the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets. Recycling rate was 94.3% in Ô¨Åscal 2019 since recycling on some intermediate processing sites in some regions did not work well, but we will work to consider the adoption of new processing sites that can execute the recycling to improve our recycling rate.

This certiÔ¨Åcation enabled us to build our own industrial waste recycling system by allowing transport of waste by proprietors other than waste disposal operators. Our industrial waste management system for new housing construction sites helps contribute to the rationalization of waste disposal by using returning transportation for collecting waste while also securing traceability by applying bar codes to waste and collecting accurate data about the volume of waste generated. Operations at the Metropolitan Area Recycling Center Sumitomo Forestry used the acquisition of the inter-region recovery and recycling certiÔ¨Åcation to establish the Metropolitan Area Recycling Center in Kazo, Saitama Prefecture for advanced sorting and data collection. The Metropolitan Area Recycling Center started full operation in Ô¨Åscal 2012 and has been collecting and processing waste produced by new housing construction sites of the metropolitan and six prefectures of Kanto (Metropolitan Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures). Metropolitan Area Recycling Center Setting up the Metropolitan Area Recycling Center brings data feedback to product development, material procurement and production management divisions by facilitating the collection of speciÔ¨Åcations, construction branches as well as the detailed status and trends of waste generation in each region. This data is being leveraged in our initiatives to reduce waste. This initiative works to expand operation under the certiÔ¨Åcation for the inter-region recovery and recycling, build processing routes led by Sumitomo Forestry, and further promote recycling even in regions outside the metropolitan area. Flow of Industrial Waste Collection Using the Inter-Region Recovery and Recycling CertiÔ¨Åcation Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú137Ôºû Waste Management for Demolition Work We are strengthening management by building a system able to conÔ¨Årm the type, quantity and packaging of waste to transport from demolition work sites using mobile phones and smartphones which is adopted by all of our demolition partners. The delivery conÔ¨Årmation invoice sent thanks to input into an electronic manifest checks whether the issuance is correct via our system. Together with Construction Contractors Sumitomo Forestry publishes monthly safety, environment and quality inspection information that includes information and topics about safety and the environment to help avoid industrial waste-related risks by repeatedly raising awareness at branches and construction contractors. Joint Environmental Training with Business Partners In Ô¨Åscal 2017, we began conducting joint training for personnel in charge of industrial waste management and administration personnel at branches and the person in charge at demolition contractors. This joint training aims to raise legal understanding, such as laws related to waste treatment and cleaning (Waste Disposal & Public Cleaning Law) and laws related to the recycling of materials in construction work (Law Concerning Recycling of Materials from Construction Work), share information about industrial waste management risks, and create consistent management methods, such as input procedures of digital manifests to eliminate industrial waste risks. The joint training also helps facilitate smooth communication between personnel in charge of administration at Sumitomo Forestry and demolition contractors as well as improves the management of digital manifests that are vital to industrial waste management.

Sumitomo Forestry Call Center Inquiry Breakdown (Trends) Ôºú142Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Customer Surveys Sumitomo Forestry conducts resident surveys three times from the second to tenth year from when residents move in to collect opinions and feedback of owners in order to deliver greater satisfaction and services to customers. The survey questions primarily elicit responses about speciÔ¨Åcations, design, building materials, systems and Ô¨Åxtures, and the support service provided by the staÔ¨Ä. The Company then statistically processes and analyzes these results, and applies any Ô¨Åndings to product development and employee training. We strive to improve customer satisfaction through direct customer contact gained from the comments received in these surveys, which are then shared with all of our relevant departments. Each branch collects and ranks items determined by the people in charge of sales, design, interiors, production, and housing exteriors to judge the level of customer satisfaction. Our headquarters forwards the results of these rankings to each branch every three months. Each branch then aims to improve overall customer satisfaction while doing everything in their power to revise measures accordingly based on the results. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the satisfaction ratio for overall satisfaction was 95.9% in the survey of new owners, and 96.3% in the survey of second-year owners. Furthermore, Sumitomo Forestry has adopted the Net Promoter Score (NPS)* advocated by the housing industry for the purpose of enhancing customer satisfaction. In October 2017, we revised the Ô¨Åve stage evaluation to an 11 stage evaluation for the questions above. We will continue to provide high-quality products and services which bring sensation to our customers by further leveraging customer feedback through the NPS survey analysis. * NPS is a new index used to measure customer loyalty (the amount of trust and aÔ¨Énity for the company and brand).

In addition, we create living spaces which take advantage of wood through our expertise in the various properties of wood worldwide. By dramatically furthering wide-ranging experience, knowledge and technology, we propose wider use of wood and timber in non-residential buildings, such as medium to large-scale construction. Sumitomo Forestry is promoting MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business in which proposes wider use of wood in non-residential buildings such as industrial and public facilities. In 2009, the Japanese Government formulated the Forest and Forestry Basic Plan as a forest and forestry recovery policy. This plan sets a timber self-suÔ¨Éciency rate of at least 50% by 2025 as an ideal approach and positions the expansion of wood use as national policy, including the Public Buildings Wood Use Promotion Act enacted on October 1, 2010. Through the MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business, Sumitomo Forestry will bring out the excellence of wood and cultivate new value and potential such as warmth, tranquility, and comfort in addition to aligning the passion of companies, individuals, countries, municipalities and others to expand the transition to wood as a new building method worldwide. This is the mission Sumitomo Forestry must fulÔ¨Åll as a company involved with wood since its founding. Basic Concept of Product Safety and Quality Control in MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business Sumitomo Forestry is promoting MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business in which proposes wider use of wood in non-residential buildings such as industrial and public facilities. The Construction Market Development Department provides high-quality buildings with consideration for users' health, safety, and comfort via wooden architecture, and obtained ISO9001 in September 2015 in response to customer expectations. Complying with this international standard, policies were established as shown in the following. Each plant sets tangible quality targets and a business expansion plan adhering to the policy to attain maintained safety and enhanced product quality. Quality Policy We will strive in the eÔ¨Äorts below as an organization that loves wood because we believe it is the path to respond to the expectations of our customers by consistently providing high-quality buildings with consideration to people's health, safety, and comfort via wooden architecture. 1. Continually better quality and improve customer satisfaction We will work to heighten our quality performance and improve customer satisfaction while continually bettering the eÔ¨Äectiveness of our quality management systems by conforming to standards and meeting the requirements of our customers. 2. Complying with the law We will have full knowledge of applicable laws and other requirements we see as a duty for the company in the design and construction of buildings. 3. Establishing policies We will set quality targets and periodically evaluate our success and revise those targets and goals to speciÔ¨Åcally promote this quality policy. 4. Conducting education and training We will conduct education and training for the staÔ¨Ä involved with the MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business that we employ to raise awareness so that all of our employees working in the Construction Market Development Department and the Company will understand this quality policy. 5. Publishing this policy We will publish this quality policy externally on the Housing and Construction Division's Construction Market Development Department website. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú145Ôºû Product Safety and Quality Management System in MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business Sumitomo Forestry Construction Market Development Department consolidates the quality management system under the aforementioned policy and is building a strict process management system. The Department also conducts biannual internal audits at all construction sites to follow the PDCA cycle incorporated in the quality management system as stipulated by ISO9001. Quality Management MOCCA (Timber Solutions) Business Initiatives Using Wood in Buildings to Help Transform Work StylesKokubunji Head OÔ¨Éce Building of Flavor Life Co. Ltd. Flavor Life Co., Ltd., which has its head oÔ¨Éce in Kokubunji City, Tokyo, provides aroma products that incorporate blessing of nature into daily life. It is a company that creates lifestyles with fragrance and smiles through aromatherapy. As a company that handles products made of natural materials, wish for a building that used natural materials it is a matter of course to wish above all else, the company wanted an environment in which employees could work comfortably. A wooden-hybrid building was realized in July 2017 with the passion of the proprietor. Time spent in a workplace is no Ô¨Çeeting moment for the working people. It is surely fair to say that bringing comfort and coziness to a living space in which so much time is spent to be an important element of in promoting work style reform. The eÔ¨Äects of a peaceful workplace incorporating wood, in which employees say they can relax while working, and communicate more with coworkers, has begun to be reÔ¨Çected in employee satisfaction levels and productivity of work. This wooden-hybrid building has a steel frame structure for the Ô¨Årst three Ô¨Çoors and a wooden-hybrid structure for fourth through seventh Ô¨Çoors. Its most distinctive characteristic is its use of hybrid laminated engineered wood which the steel frame is completely covered in wood. Featuring a combination of the soft texture of wood and the strength of steel, it enables the wood to protect the steel from heat as a Ô¨Åre-resistant coating, contributing to disseminate incorporation of wood as a material for buildings. The aim of Sumitomo Forestry is to create vistas lined with buildings that provide a sense of the warmth of wood in cities, where contact with wood is rare. We apply our knowledge and experience in using wood to propose new ways of doing so. Head oÔ¨Éce building of Flavor Life with full use of quality of wood * This project was selected as a pilot program for sustainable buildings (wood type) of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Ô¨Åscal 2015. Ôºú146Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Participating in Building Energy-eÔ¨Écient, Environmentally-friendly Convenience Stores Sumitomo Forestry designed and built the energy-eÔ¨Écient, environmentally-friendly Numata Interchange Family Mart convenience store which opened in Numata City, Gunma in December 2019. This store was a pilot test that aimed to save energy by combining the strengths of various environmentally-friendly products from participating companies. Sumitomo Forestry proposed and employed Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) materials made from domestic wood for the walls of the structural framework. Use of Sumitomo Forestry ºs original S-100 coating material (powerful water repellent silicone coating) on an exposed timber* style even improved weather resistance. Nelson Pine Industries Ltd. (NPIL), a Sumitomo Forestry subsidiary in New Zealand, even took charge of the beam construction by manufacturing the Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) that was used. As of May 2020, our Group has completed a total of 204 stores by proposing this type of wood construction. Trees continue to stabilize CO2 as carbon even after they are turned into products. Wood structures help reduce CO2 emitted by these stores throughout the entire life cycle from material procurement to construction, renovation, repair, demolition, and disposal better than light gauge steel used for columns and beams. We also took advantage of a grant for the CLT materials used in this store through an individual proof-of-concept project for expanding the use of JAS structural materials, which is a Forestry Agency subsidy program. Sumitomo Forestry will promote further use of wood by providing total solutions from the procurement and supply of materials to the construction. * A Ô¨Ånishing technique in wooden constructions which structural members such as columns and beams are exposed to view. External wall CLT Timber Wood CLT Convenience Store Construction Wood CLT Convenience Store Construction Toward the Future -Aiming for the Timberized Eco Cities with W350 PlanSumitomo Forestry announced its W350 Plan in February 2018. The W350 plan is a research and technological development roadmap aiming to build a 350-meter-tall wooden high-rise building in 2041, which will mark the 350th year since foundation of business in 1961, in preparing to create Timberized Eco Cities. The plan is intended to develop future technologies that contribute to people's lives, society and the global environment, including building construction methods, environmental technologies, wood for building materials and resources. The new three-story wooden research building completed in October 2019 at the Tsukuba Research Institute will help further this plan as a research and development base. Toward Realizing the W350 Plan Managed mainly by our research and development center, Tsukuba Research Institute, the W350 Research and Technological Development Plan is a roadmap for future technologies; to develop building construction methods, environmental technologies, wood for building materials and resources. This roadmap will expand the possibilities of wooden structures. This plan of creating Timberized Eco Cities centered on wooden high-rise buildings will revitalize the forestry industry with increased demand of timber and mitigate climate change with increased Ô¨Åxation of CO2; in essence, Sumitomo Forestry will contribute to invigorate the community and to realize coexistence with the global environment.

The deterioration of the main research building and increase in staÔ¨Ä have become issues needing to be addressed. The new research building completed in October 2019 adopts new Post-tensioning*1 technology related to the wooden structures. Other technologies used in this building will also form foundation for the W350 Plan. Energy saving technology and renewable energy will also be used with a view of achieving a zero energy building (ZEB). The new research building is a three-story building with a Ô¨Çoor area of 2,532.67m¬≤. The exposed beams, pillars, and wall structure has been designed using the semi-Ô¨ÅreprooÔ¨Ång technique. Full building evacuation safety veriÔ¨Åcation [Route C (Minister's certiÔ¨Åcation)]*2 makes it possible to reduce restrictions on wooden interiors so that spaces with the qualities of wood can be presented. The building greatly reduces CO2 emissions by installing solar panels on the roof and adopting absorption water chiller-heaters Ô¨Åred using wood pellets. With roofs, balconies and exterior walls used as areas to test greening, the research and development of green technologies for non-residential wooden architectural structures will be conducted while oÔ¨Éce space will be used for veriÔ¨Åcations such as green layouts that seek to improve intellectual productivity. This facility has been accepted as a pilot program for sustainable buildings (wood type) in Ô¨Åscal 2017 promoted by Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. This includes an oÔ¨Éce for housing 140 persons and a gallery that provides information about timber. With the new research building positioned as the cornerstone of the W350 Plan, we also began a construction plan for a six-to eight-story wooden building (20m to 30m tall) as the next actual step forward. This plan has been named ‚ÄúW30‚Äù and is currently under way. *1 Technology where high-strength steel poles and wire ropes running through load-bearing members are tensioned to increase the Ô¨Åxation of position between members. *2 A method for verifying safety performance where everyone within a building is able to evacuate safely to the ground level given a predetermined Ô¨Åre scenario. If safety can be conÔ¨Årmed, some of the regulations of the Building Standards Act of the Japanese government are eased, enabling greater freedom of design, such as exposing wood structural members to view. Route C designation requires certiÔ¨Åcation by the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, but since evacuation safety performance is conÔ¨Årmed using sophisticated calculation methods not stipulated by the notice, it allows for the highest level of design freedom.

Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú149Ôºû Contributions to Eco Cities Through Greening Basic Policy The use of as many plants as possible which are native to the region in property development is a growing trend as society shifts toward a goal to co-exist with nature. In the midst of these trends, Sumitomo Forestry Landscaping has deÔ¨Åned Harmonic Plants¬Æ guidelines for selecting plants species based on greening areas with the concept that using indigenous and local species in greening plans is in the best interest of natural revitalization. The Company has been promoting this model up until now. There are plants that have grown in Japan since long ago (native plants) and plants that have come to Japan from abroad (migration plants) for trees. Among these migration plants, there are species that will overrun areas where native plants live due to their characteristics, which endanger the biodiversity of the region (invasive plants*). Garden vegetation plans are separated into four areas that take into account the conservation level (protected areas, conservation areas, satoyama areas, urban areas) to select plant species based on these areas. For example, in urban areas when building gardens for residences, the colorfulness is represented by selecting a balance of greening plants from non-invasive migration plants around a main selection of native plants, including garden variety plants. In addition, the Group has in place a policy of not using invasive plants that clearly have an adverse impact on local ecosystems and a division responsible for coordinating technology at Sumitomo Forestry Landscaping Co., Ltd. checks that such species are not used. * SpeciÔ¨Åed alien species and alien species requiring caution as stipulated by the Invasive Alien Species Act Ôºú150Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Contributions to Property Development Project to cultivate leaders to form an ecological network for corporate green zones along the coastal area of the Chita Peninsula received a special jury prize at the Environmental Awards 2019 In the industrial zone along the northern coast of the Chita Peninsula in Aichi Prefecture, this conservation initiative brings together corporation green zones as regional ecological sites to unify students, companies, NPOs, and government agencies. In June 2019, these Chita Peninsula ecological conservation eÔ¨Äorts provided an excellent example of an initiative to conserve the ecosystem through a consortium honored with a special jury prize in the 46th Environmental Awards (held by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan and Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun with the support of the Ministry Connecting Life Student Project of the Environment). Sumitomo Forestry Landscaping joined this project as an advisor and consultant with MS&AD InterRisk Research & Consulting, Inc. and Regional Environmental Planning, Inc. We cooperated broadly by providing advice such as methods for greening renovations that increase biodiversity and methods to monitor life with the participation of students and employees. As the recovery of biodiversity becomes of major interest today, Sumitomo Forestry will not only further deepen but also broaden its consulting capabilities related to biodiversity conservation. Assisting Nakashinden Green Area of Aichi Steel Corporation and the Central Negishi ReÔ¨Ånery Garden of the ENEOS Corporation to Receive ABINC CertiÔ¨Åcation The Nakashinden Green Area of Aichi Steel Corporation (Aichi Prefecture) that Sumitomo Forestry assisted in obtaining the ABINC certiÔ¨Åcation* is a roughly 2 ha corporate green zone adjacent to the plant in the head oÔ¨Éce district of the company. The area had originally been used for a plant, but this plan set out to open the zone as a local ecological site. The project was able to take advantage of the marshy and grassy environment to create a natural ecological garden. Employees, local citizens, student volunteers, and many others are helping build this green area to nurture even greater biodiversity. In the same way, the central garden at the ENEOS Corporation reÔ¨Ånery (Kanagawa Prefecture) that Sumitomo Forestry assisted in obtaining the ABINC certiÔ¨Åcation* is a large-scale green space 100 meters wide and 800 meters long with three biotope ponds. In recent years, the initiative has been aiming to create green areas friendly to biodiversity by linking to nearby lush natural areas, such as the Sankeien Garden. Undeveloped woodlands on plant premises are expanding diverse environments, such as the water lands attracting kingÔ¨Åshers and grasslands Ô¨Ålled with common bluebottle butterÔ¨Çies. As shown by these two examples, eÔ¨Äorts to try and transition production plant gardens into green areas where biodiversity Ô¨Çourishes are booming. In the future, Sumitomo Forestry will emphasize consulting related to the biodiversity conservation even more. * This system certiÔ¨Åes results of biodiversity preservation activities of companies to promote coexistence of nature and people.

Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú155Ôºû Overseas Housing and Real Estate Business The Sumitomo Forestry Group is expanding housing and real estate businesses in the United States and Australia that have large, mature wooden house markets, as well as in Asian regions where signiÔ¨Åcant growth is expected in the future. We not only sell housing that matches the needs of the climate and natural features as well as markets in each region but also engage in various initiatives to create shared value through our business activities by respecting employees, local residents, corporate organizations, society and every other stakeholder. Respect for Regional Culture for Housing, Lifestyle, and Architecture Sumitomo Forestry has built a proven track record in wooden house construction in Japan, and its overseas housing and real estate businesses also place value on construction that adapts to the living customs and culture of each region. We respect the business policies of our local Group companies that are well versed in the culture, needs and characteristics of each region. This approach allows us to create a system that is able to provide products and services best suited to each region. United States Business Sumitomo Forestry is expanding a multifaceted housing and real estate business in the United States where stable population growth and strong housing demand are expected to continue in the future. We entered the U.S. housing market‚Äîthe biggest in the world‚Äîin 2003. Initially, it provided single family homes in Seattle, Washington, which is our base for trading timber and building materials for more than Ô¨Åfty years. Today, we have Ô¨Åve home builder companies in a broad area from the west to east coast that are expanding the subdivision business and providing highquality wooden houses. Through careful marketing in the business regions of each company, we supply various types of housing in a broad price range, such as detached houses, town homes and condominiums, to adeptly respond to the ever more diverse range of needs. Housing Construction Business Areas We started a multi-unit residential development business in 2016. In 2018, two companies joined the Sumitomo Forestry Group to expand business domains; Crescent Communities, a general real estate company which develops multi-unit residential, oÔ¨Éces, logistics centers and other commercial and mixed use complexes, and Mark III Properties, a land development business. We are establishing a more stable and diverse revenue base in the United States, while building a framework that can provide a wider variety of housing and real estate products.

By adding Scot Park Group in Western Australia, in 2019, the Group built an operation network with coverage from eastern to western Australia and provides quality wooden housing at a broader scope. Australia is expecting long-term population growth in light of its immigration policies, and we will provide homes that are aÔ¨Äordable to a various income groups by developing business using multiple brands with varying price ranges according to each region. Asian Business Sumitomo Forestry engages mainly in the large-scale real estate development business in South East Asia. By employing a joint venture scheme, we are promoting the provision of high-quality homes by taking advantage of the functionality and resources of local partners and integrating the technology and expertise possessed by Sumitomo Forestry and its aÔ¨Éliated companies. In China, Sumitomo Forestry is also providing outsourcing service that produces residential blueprint data. This business plays a role in heightening operational eÔ¨Éciency and quality in the housing industry overseas. Ôºú158Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Understanding and Assessing Development Risks Properly understanding the geological and geographical risks unique to each property is vital in the development of housing and real estate. The Sumitomo Forestry Group has put in place the necessary systems to verify whether there are any issues through careful surveys at the assessment stage of development in addition to other multistage checks done before determining how to implement a project. We Ô¨Årst select the land to develop and then outsource soil survey and environmental surveys to external research Ô¨Årms to fully understand the risks from an objective standpoint. We not only ask local aÔ¨Éliated companies to give their input on risks but the Sumitomo Forestry head oÔ¨Éce also conducts property inspections and environmental and social impact studies using its own CSR risk assessment sheet for projects larger than a certain scale. Management also provides feedback through meetings at the Sumitomo Forestry head oÔ¨Éce to analyze risks from diverse multistage perspectives. We only engage in projects determined to be acceptable through this process. Construction also comes with the risk of occupational accidents during the construction phase. Sumitomo Forestry complies with occupational health and safety laws and works to prevent occupational accidents at local aÔ¨Éliated companies and also puts in place systems to immediately report any accident that occurs to the headquarters so it can quickly understand what happened as well as plan and execute measures to prevent recurrence. Community Development to Enhance the Value of Living Spaces Each Group company works to heighten the level of enhancements to lifestyle and environmental aspects when developing housing, commercial complexes and other facilities. We strive to provide robust common areas in addition to residential units through Ô¨Åve home builder companies in the United States that sell single-family spec homes, such as the installation of green areas and promenades formed to Ô¨Åt the size, landscape and surrounding environment of the property. Large-scale developments heighten community value and satisfaction of lifestyle environments by installing information centers built alongside pools, parks, tennis courts, caf√©s and other amenities. Crescent Communities, a real estate developer, provides living and community spaces that oÔ¨Äer more value than just a home to residents by incorporating the distinct characteristics and history of the surrounding environment in building speciÔ¨Åcations, spatial design, and resident services with the participation of the neighbors and everyone else involved when planning the concept for each project. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú159Ôºû Sales of Environmentally-conscious Housing Henley Properties drove forward eÔ¨Äorts to enhance energy-saving performance in the Australian housing industry, such as pioneering its own standard speciÔ¨Åcations ahead of competitors, by recommending a Ô¨Åve-star energy rating*1 for the standard energy-saving performance in 2001. EÔ¨Äorts toward the environment accelerated further after the involvement of the Sumitomo Forestry Group in 2009. We conducted a variety of initiatives to reduce the environmental impact, including the realization of the Ô¨Årst zero emission house*2 for the general consumer as a major home builder company in the country. In Victoria, Henley Properties also uses low carbon concrete by replacing approximately 20% of cement, the primary ingredient in concrete used in foundations of homes, with Ô¨Çy ash (waste produced when burning fossil fuels) and blast furnace slag (byproduct separated from iron ore in the iron manufacturing process in blast furnaces). The low carbon concrete reduces CO2 emissions by about three tons per home in the construction stage. More than 80% of new homes built in Australia uses veneer glass because multi-layered glass has not become as popular for use in homes as in Japan due to cost. However, in 2018, Henley Properties was the Ô¨Årst in Victoria to make multi-layered glass a standard speciÔ¨Åcation in order to increase the insulation eÔ¨Éciency of homes*3. Henley Properties also leads the industry in eÔ¨Äorts to improve airtightness. A survey conducted in 2019 showed homes built by Henley Properties have shown airtightness roughly three times higher than the average home in Australia*4. This level of airtightness can reduce the power consumption necessary for heating and cooling the average home by approximately 25%. Henley Properties is not only improving environmental performance but is also pioneering the development of residential properties that consider the health of the people living there. The Company is also developing a system to provide ventilation while mitigating construction, lighting, and heating costs to improve the air quality inside the home. Moreover, Henley Properties reviewed primary construction and Ô¨Ånishing materials and adopted interior coatings with ultra-low VOC*5 in accordance with the advice from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia. These measures achieve housing that suppresses rising costs, maintains high quality, and protects the health of the people living there. *1 An evaluation metric of the energy burden for heating and cooling the inside of a building in Australia. Insulation, windows, the type, size and orientation of the building, and the climatic zone are all items included in this metric. *2 Environmentally-friendly housing expected to have an energy-saving eÔ¨Äect of more than 70% compared to conventional housing. *3 Multi-layered glass is eÔ¨Äective in improving insulation eÔ¨Éciency of homes by limiting the thermal reÔ¨Çux to approximately 35% less compared to veneer glass. *4 The average value for Henley Properties is 5.9 ACH where the average housing in Australia is 15.4 ACH (ACH is an index that indicates the air leakage per hour at a 50 Pa indoor-outdoor air pressure diÔ¨Äerence.

Building Positive Work Environments In the United States, federal and state laws prohibit any employment discrimination for reasons such as race, gender, religion, birthplace, or health condition. Sumitomo Forestry Group companies in the United States strive to share the same philosophy in prohibiting discrimination and providing fair opportunities, by including these topics in the employee handbook. Each of these companies also engages in various other measures, such as consultation hotlines to report harassment and discrimination in the workplace. Crescent Communities has put in place initiatives to provide comfortable environments for employees to work beyond strict legal compliance, such as the adoption of a system whereby a corporate insurance policy covers 60% of the salary of an employee who cannot work for seven days or more due to reasons such as injury, illness, or mental disease.

To do so, we engage in responsible timber procurement activities in accordance with our Timber Procurement Basic Policy formulated in 2005 and our Timber Procurement Principles and Policies formulated in 2007. To deliver legal and sustainable timber, we only engage in responsible timber procurement. In 2015 with the Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy, we expanded our scope beyond timber to include a wide range of other procured products, such as metals, ceramics, resin and other building materials, and based on this policy, are engaged in procurement activities that take into consideration the economy, society and environment. Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy Promotion System of Timber Procurement Management Sumitomo Forestry Group established the Timber Procurement Committee, chaired by the oÔ¨Écer in charge of sustainability promotion at Sumitomo Forestry (director and managing executive oÔ¨Écer) and comprising managers from departments in charge of timber procurement. The committee discusses issues related to group-wide timber procurement, including procurement standards and risk assessments for illegal logging. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the Timber Procurement Committee met four times and conÔ¨Årmed legality and conducted a Sustainability Survey for suppliers of imported timber products at all 162 direct import source companies who are covered in the study and 48 companies that our overseas group companies (distribution) procure from. Regularly (once a year or once Timber Procurement Committee every two years), we conÔ¨Årm legality and sustainability of both new and ongoing parties meeting we conduct business with. Sustainable Timber Procurement Initiatives Promoting Initiatives Adhering to the Procurement Policy Procurement Policy Under the Sumitomo Group Procurement Policy, Sumitomo Forestry Group carries out due diligence on timber procurement to ensure that the procurement is performed in a sustainable manner with consideration of legal compliance, human rights, labor practices, biodiversity conservation, and local communities. Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy The Sumitomo Forestry Group utilizes wood as a renewable natural resource in its business operations. To contribute to a sustainable society, we are committed to procurement activities that take into account economic, environmental and societal interests and comply with the following policy: 1. Procurement based on legal and highly reliable supply chains Our procurement activities will strictly adhere to all relevant laws, regulations and societal norms, and be built on mutual understanding and trust with our business partners. Furthermore, to provide the highest quality products and services, we will work with our business partners to ensure that our procurement takes place within a sound and fair supply chain. Ôºú166Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 2. Procurement based on fair opportunity and competition We will provide all our suppliers, both Japanese and foreign, a fair opportunity for business. Selection of our business partners will be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the company ºs reliability and technological expertise, the product ºs quality, economic eÔ¨Éciency, delivery date and environmental performance, and the company ºs CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives, such as advocacy of basic human and worker rights, anticorruption eÔ¨Äorts and so on. 3. Procurement of sustainable timber and wood products Wood is a renewable natural resource. To actively utilize it, we will work with our business partners on the following initiatives related to the procurement of timber and wood products: Procure timber from forests that are sustainably managed Work to improve the traceability of procured timber and wood products Strictly adhere to the laws and regulations of the countries and regions we log in, protect biodiversity and forests with high conservation value, and respect the cultures, traditions and economies of regions that coexist in harmony with forests. 4. Communication To ensure the transparency of our procurement eÔ¨Äorts, we will disclose information appropriately. In addition, we will communicate with our stakeholders to further improve our procurement activities. Revised July 23, 2015 Compliance Timber & Building Materials Business, Housing & Construction Business and each of timber procurement division at each Group company conÔ¨Årm that the timber provided by suppliers has been legally harvested, or that the wood products they provide have been made only from legally harvested timber as a raw material. Each person in charge of procurement is required to follow the Timber Procurement Due Diligence Manual, gather the following information, cross-check relevant documents for each location and tree species, and conÔ¨Årm traceability of the entire supply chain all the way to the logging site. No. Category name 1 Supplier name 2 Supplier address 3 Timber type 4 Tree species of timber type 5 Country or region of logging 6 Annual procurement volume (weight, area, volume or quantity) 7 If sold to a legal entity, the name and address of that legal entity 8 Results of supplier surveys and other, inspection records and other Documents certifying that harvesting was conducted in accordance with laws and regulations of the logging 9 country Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú167Ôºû With these information sorted by country, region, tree species, and timber type, risk assessment on the illegal logging or human rights violation is carried out based on procurement standards stipulated by the Committee. Risk categories are A (low risk), B (medium risk) and C (high risk). Timber and wood products in the B (medium risk) and C (high risk) categories should not be solely evaluated with documentation to prove that they are legally harvested according to that country ºs laws and regulations. In addition, when necessary, company staÔ¨Ä are sent for on-site inspections to ensure traceability back to the logging site. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we audited 33 companies in Category A, 30 companies in Category B, and 99 companies in Category C before terminating business transactions with 16 of those companies. Consideration for Human Rights, Labor Practices, Biodiversity Conservation and Local Communities Following items are checked, through Sustainability Procurement Surveys to suppliers and local interviews for the products that are being procured: Whether the rights of workers, local and indigenous community are abused in the area where we procure the products and their raw materials from. If this is the case, whether suppliers check their logging practices take place with consideration for these rights. Whether the high conservation values forests are included in the area where we procure the products and their raw materials from. If this is the case, whether suppliers check their logging practices with consideration to forests with high conservation value. Review Each procurement division reports the status and progress of these initiatives to the Timber Procurement Committee, facilitating continuous improvements throughout the supply chain. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we added necessary items from social and environmental aspects to the questions in the Questionnaire on Sustainable Procurement used up until then to revise this questionnaire into the Sustainability Procurement Survey. We strengthened the management system by scoring survey outcomes to improve the visualization of sustainability initiatives at our suppliers. Timber Procurement Management System Ôºú168Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Reinforcing Measures for the Sustainability of Timber Products There is increasing concern about deforestation as climate change. Our Group ºs timber procurement sustainability measures comply with our own Timber Procurement Due Diligence. In May 2019, we newly implemented an Action Plan to further reinforce evaluation standards for sustainability. Policy on ‚ÄúSustainable Timber and Wood Products‚Äù We deÔ¨Åne timber and wood products as sustainable if they fulÔ¨Åll one of the following: Percentage of sustainable timber 1. CertiÔ¨Åed timber and pre-certiÔ¨Åed timber: FSC, PEFC, and SGEC and timber products handled (Regardless of CoC connection, we place emphasis on certiÔ¨Åcation at time of FY2019 result production and promote a shift to certiÔ¨Åed timber) 2. Timber from plantation forests 89.8% 3. Natural timber where forestry management and distribution can be assessed as sustainable. (this does not include timber from conversion forests = timber harvested from natural forests that were converted to farm land such as oil palm plantations) 4. Recycled wood Percentage of sustainable timber and timber products handled In the ‚ÄúMid-Term Sustainability Targets as part of the 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan‚Äù FY2021 target announced in May 2019, we will promote the gradual increased use of alternative wood (natural timber from forest thinning or plantation timber) to stop the handling of items 100ÔºÖ that do not fall under our deÔ¨Ånition of sustainable timber or wood products, even in situations where legality can be conÔ¨Årmed. By our target Ô¨Åscal year of 2021, we strive to achieve our goal of 100% handling of sustainable timber and timber products. About symbol for Independent assurance Reinforcing Timber Procurement Due Diligence Through Our Action Plan The Company engages in responsible timber procurement as a Group in accordance with the Sumitomo Forestry Group Procurement Policy. To respond to recent concerns, in May 2019, we created an Action Plan to reinforce on a regular basis our timber procurement due diligence. Major areas of reinforcement to further promote responsible procurement include the appointment of the director in charge of sustainability promotion as the chairman of the Timber Procurement Committee, the holding of regular study sessions for persons in charge of procurement, and for suppliers with low scores, a two-year probation period to implement requested improvement measures and the cessation of transactions in the event that no improvement is seen. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú169Ôºû Education for Personnel in Charge of Procurement Timber Production and Sustainable Forest Management in Indonesia and Malaysia As concern about deforestation increases worldwide, interest is focusing on eÔ¨Äorts by companies with regard to procurement of tropical timber. In this connection, we held a seminar on October 31, 2018 titled ‚ÄúTimber Production in Indonesia and Malaysia and EÔ¨Äorts Toward Sustainable Forest Management.‚Äù It was attended by a total of 32 managers and other responsible personnel at international distribution departments handling tropical timber and other imported timber. At the seminar, participants learned the latest information about timber legality certiÔ¨Åcation systems in both countries, the current state of certiÔ¨Åed timber, and sustainable forest management. Each year, we keep up with changing circumstances by providing seminars and training Institute for Global Environmental sessions on the latest societal and environmental issues. These are separate from the Strategies (IGES) ordinary training provided to all employees by the Personnel Department. A lecture by Research Manager Hiromitsu Samejima Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation Systems The Sumitomo Forestry Group operates under a system related to certiÔ¨Åed timber as one of sustainable timber and wood products deÔ¨Åned as the handling of sustainable timber and wood products expands. To share the latest information, we held a Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation Seminar on February 18, 2020 with the participation of 16 people in charge of timber procurement, including Timber Procurement Committee members. This seminar covered the history of the FSC, PEFC, SGEC certiÔ¨Åcation systems and the latest information about the FM and CoC certiÔ¨Åcations.

Experts from the certiÔ¨Åed NPO Sustainable Management Forum of Japan, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Japan, FoE Japan, Global Environment Forum„ÄÅInstitute for Global Environmental Strategies, Takasaki City University of Economics and Waseda University participated to discuss various themes, such as the implementation of the Sustainability Procurement Survey, the process and timeframe for demanding improvements, timber The scene at the Dialogue from conversion forests and recycled timber. Conference During the discussions, in addition to considering ways to build capacity, participants agreed on the need for adequate communication with suppliers in implementing Sustainability Procurement Surveys and requesting improvement measures in a manner that would enhance the quality of suppliers and consequently, lead to utilization of sustainable forest resources throughout the industry. For timber from converted forests, while keeping close watch on measures for sustainable commodity production in other industries, it should be conÔ¨Årmed that appropriate assessment, such as for forests with high protection value (HCVA), is being conducted. Participants voiced the opinion that recycled timber should be deÔ¨Åned as timber that has been used once by the consumer (building materials, etc.) and that wood waste, old fruit trees and such should undergo the same level of due diligence as regular timber. With these opinions in mind, the Company revised and is implementing its Timber Procurement Management Regulations and its Timber Procurement Due Diligence Manual to fulÔ¨Åll its goal of 100% handling of sustainable timber and timber products as outlined in the Management Plan 2021. Assessing Timber Procurement by local interviews Timber Procurement in Romania Several environmental groups have expressed concerns about forest management and timber production in Romania in terms of whether or not logging has been appropriately conducted. In April 2017, members of the Timber Procurement Committee conducted on-site inspections, Ô¨Årst gathering information through meetings with such organizations as the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Romanian Government, the Embassy of Japan in Romania, ASFOR (Romanian Forest Association), among others. The members also went to a supplier manufacturing facility and inspected representative logging sites of logs that were transported to the facility. At the manufacturing facility, they conÔ¨Årmed that the supplier properly checks transport permits and the logs bundled on the trailer when receiving raw material logs at the lumber manufacturing plants. For example, the visiting team was able to conÔ¨Årm that the supplier was thorough in segregated management to ensure that logs exceeding the amount permitted were not used and that they engaged in such measures as reporting to forestry authorities. The team received an explanation about forest management from a forest ranger at the logging site and checked the actual hammer stamp mark and process when loading the trailer in the Ô¨Åeld. In addition, they were able to conÔ¨Årm the dedication to preserving the rare forest ecosystem by observing forest conservation areas under the Romanian government ºs jurisdiction. The Company regularly meets with environmental groups that we receive concerns from. In the meeting of January 2019, we obtained information and provided the latest on our Group initiatives. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú171Ôºû Inspection of harvest land still covered in snow Check when loading the trailer Properly checking the delivery at the plant using tablet Segregated management of round wood beyond the amount terminals on the permit Concrete Form Plywood from Indonesia In recent years, several environmental groups have expressed their concerns about the legality of the logs used as raw material for plywood manufactured in Indonesia. In Indonesia, the SVLK timber legality veriÔ¨Åcation system is in place, requiring timber product manufacturers and exporters to register by obtaining SVLK business certiÔ¨Åcation issued by an independent evaluation and certiÔ¨Åcation organization recognized by the National Accreditation Committee. Upon doing so, the business obtains documentation (V-Legal documents) from the independent veriÔ¨Åcation and certiÔ¨Åcation body certifying the timber as legal, and expressly conÔ¨Årming the legality of the entire supply chain, from logging to timber processing at manufacturing plants to export. In July 2018, we conducted an on-site inspection of the concrete formwork paneling plywood manufacturing plant that serves as our supplier. At a timber yard near the harvesting site, we were able to use QR-code labeling on tags attached to logs to conÔ¨Årm the harvesting information at the Indonesian Ministry of the Environment and Forestry website, as well as with V-Legal documentation. After the same logs were transported to the plant, we were once again able to use QR codes at a plant timber yard to access the ministry website and V-Legal documents, successfully tracing them back through the transport process to their harvest location. In terms of the procurement of raw material logs used to process plywood, the Company continues to work with suppliers on various initiatives as we strive to fulÔ¨Åll our ‚ÄúMid-Term Sustainability Targets as part of the Mid-Term Management Plan‚Äù to achieve the target of 100% handling of sustainable timber and timber products.

With this, we responded by submitting relevant documents and explaining to the Olympic Organizing Committee that these types of raw material logs were not part of the Company ºs supply chain. As a result, the Olympic Organizing Committee concluded that the concerns were unfounded and not eligible for reporting, which was disclosed in February 2019 on their website. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú173Ôºû Plywood from Sarawak, Malaysia In recent years, as is the case with Indonesia, several environmental groups have expressed their concerns about the legality of the logs used as raw material for plywood manufactured in Sarawak, Malaysia. Sarawak Forest Corporation was established in 2003 for the purpose of eliminating illegal logging in Sarawak, Indonesia. Thereafter, the Sarawak Timber Legality VeriÔ¨Åcation System (STLVS) was created in 2015 to further strengthen eÔ¨Äorts to eliminate illegal logging, reÔ¨Çecting the trend of elimination of illegally logged timber in countries such as the United States, the EU, and Australia. Sumitomo Forestry conducted an on-site audit of a plywood production plant of one of its suppliers in September 2019 to primarily conÔ¨Årm whether the STLVS was properly in operation from the logging sites to the plant landing. We were able to conÔ¨Årm that tracking is possible from logs arriving at the plant to the harvesting district via identiÔ¨Åcation processes such as orange tags proving royalty payments (for processing domestically), white tags (for log production) as well as markings and relevant transfer permits from regional forest oÔ¨Éces through the detailed logging plans and tree logging lists required by STLVS. In addition, a signature from a representative in charge of the regional forest oÔ¨Éce on the back of the export application (K2) necessary to export plywood products conÔ¨Årms the products satisfy all of the STLVS standards.

It is considered a pioneer amongst forest certiÔ¨Åcation system operators. Adhering to the 10 principles and 56 regulations encompassing environmental impact, local society, and indigenous people's rights, FSC-accredited certiÔ¨Åcation bodies will undertake reviews. Recently, country or regional standards as well as the review procedure for small-scale forest owners have been introduced to provide greater support for diverse forests and owners. PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation) Forestry organizations of 11 European countries established PEFC together in 1999 as an organization to mutually authenticate the system of each country. PEFC does not directly authenticate an individual forest, but when the PEFC's required conditions that adapted ‚Äúthe inter-governmental process‚Äù implemented by 149 countries is met, the country's own forest certiÔ¨Åcation system is authenticated by PEFC. Joined by non-European countries in 2003, the organization originally called Pan European Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation Schemes changed its name to Program for the Endorsement of Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation. Since then, PEFC has shown drastic growth, and to date its total certiÔ¨Åed area is the largest across the world. Sustainable Green Ecosystem Council (SGEC) SGEC authenticates forest management that demonstrates both rich natural environment and sustainable timber production in Japan. With reverence for Japan's indigenous natural environment, social customs, and culture, the review premises on seven criteria. SGEC can also authenticate forestry operations and distribution systems under CoC. SGEC joined PEFC in November 2014 and submitted a mutual authentication application to PEFC in March 2015, which was mutually approved in June 2016. Ôºú176Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Promoting the Use of CertiÔ¨Åed Timber The most important aspect of selling certiÔ¨Åed timber is managing the procurement of certiÔ¨Åed timber separately from other types of timber. With CoC certiÔ¨Åcation, because we are inspected by a third party, we are able to guarantee that timber and other products are from certiÔ¨Åed forests and sell them to our customers. Sumitomo Forestry Group has set a goal to achieve by 2020 to at least a 12% sales volume ratio of imported certiÔ¨Åed timber and other products. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the actual Ô¨Ågure was 10.7%. Furthermore, for sales of SGEC certiÔ¨Åed timber, Japan ºs forest certiÔ¨Åcation system, we have set a sales volume target of 85,000 square meters or more by 2020. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the actual Ô¨Ågure was 71,000 square meters. Sumitomo Forestry supplied raw wood cut from the Mombetsu company-owned forest to use as raw materials of timber products for new competition facilities for sporting events. After delivering these raw materials, some media outlets published a story about the company-owned forest being certiÔ¨Åed but that no Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) had been obtained from the indigenous people for the logging. Our company addressed these concerns with everyone involved through by explaining the following: Since starting our own company-owned forest business in 1926, Sumitomo Forestry has not conÔ¨Årmed any concerns from or demands made by indigenous people about its business areas or management methods. Sumitomo Forestry requires materials from certiÔ¨Åed forests for all relevant facilities, and our certiÔ¨Åed timber complies with all timber procurement standards for sporting events. When Sumitomo Forestry supplied logged materials for relevant facilities from the Mombetsu company-owned forest in 2017, for this forest certiÔ¨Åcation, the standards, regulations, guidelines and evaluation criteria related to FPIC have been gradually put in place since 2015. The Mombetsu company-owned forest was up to date with all of the required measures at that time. The Sumitomo Forestry Group will listen carefully to all of its stakeholders in the future in an eÔ¨Äort to ensure even more sustainable forest management.

Carbon Stock of Forests in Japan and Overseas *1 Domestic: Carbon stock as of the beginning of each Ô¨Åscal year *2 Overseas: Carbon stock as of the beginning of each calendar year Ôºú196Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Logging and Transport: Supplying Timber Products Through Systematic Logging The Sumitomo Forestry Group logged approximately 70,000 m¬≥ of trees in Japan and approximately 850,000 m¬≥ of trees overseas in Ô¨Åscal 2019 in forests it owns or manages based on long-term logging plans. Harvested trees are milled and processed before Ô¨Ånally reaching the market as products such as housing and furniture. In the case of timber turned into structural members for housing, the products are used for several decades. Even after being dismantled or at the end of their product life, wooden construction and timber products can be reused as Ô¨Åberboard or other wood materials in construction or as raw material for making paper, and all that time it will continue to retain CO2. The CO2 released when timber is ultimately burned as a wood fuel is what has been absorbed from the atmosphere as trees grow, and therefore it does not represent an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere over the life cycle of the tree. Carbon Stock in the Housing and Construction Business Site Preparation and Planting: Preparing for the Next Cycle Harvesting and using timber alone will lead to a diminishing of forest resources. The Sumitomo Forestry Group therefore promotes sustainable forest management by always planting new trees after logging. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we planted forests on 159 ha in Japan, and on 7,430 ha overseas. The newly planted trees will absorb CO2 during their growth and retain it as carbon. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú197Ôºû Protecting and Utilizing Domestic Forest Resources Basic Policy In recent years, the degradation across Japan of artiÔ¨Åcial forest plantations of cedar, Japanese cypress and other species has resulted in the alarming loss of the multifaceted functions of forests, such as water source recharge. The reasons for this devastation include the stagnation of timber value and worsening proÔ¨Åtability as well as the inability for proper thinning or other management of the forests. In order to prevent further devastation of forests by revitalizing the forestry industry, the government of Japan has set a goal of raising Japan's timber self-suÔ¨Éciency rate to roughly 50% by 2025. We will contribute to the targets laid out by the government of Japan while expanding our managed forest area, developing and introducing forestry machinery compatible with Japanese terrain and other such conditions, increasing the cultivation of fast-growing trees, spearheading planting and cultivation technologies, pioneering container seedling businesses, and promoting business solutions that leverage ICT. Breakdown of Company-Owned Forests Preserving and Increasing Forest Resources Through Management of CompanyOwned Forests The Sumitomo Forestry Group owns a total of approximately 48,000 hectares (about 1/800 of the national land area) of forest land area. Company-owned forests are categorized as either ‚Äúcommercial forests,‚Äù where the production of timber is the priority, or ‚Äúenvironmental forests,‚Äù where conservation of the environment is the focus. Sumitomo Forestry acquired a forestry certiÔ¨Åcation from Japan's Sustainable Green Ecosystem Council (SGEC)*1 for all companyowned forests*2 in 2006 and third-party evaluations have conÔ¨Årmed that the forests are being properly managed, including with regard to measures to conserve biodiversity. New forest purchases after the acquisition of the forest certiÔ¨Åcation have each been under evaluation for certiÔ¨Åcation and our certiÔ¨Åcation rate is 100%. Forest operations include appropriate thinning, which helps to preserve and increase forest resources, while taking into consideration the surrounding environment including the ecosystem. Sumitomo Forestry also aims for highly productive management of its forests based on operational plans that follow the principle of performing the appropriate management for the appropriate tree species on the suited land. Ôºú198Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 *1 Japan's own forestry certiÔ¨Åcation system through which forest management is veriÔ¨Åed as sustainable by third parties. CertiÔ¨Åcation is based on seven criteria that include the preservation of biodiversity and the conservation and maintenance of soil and water resources. Due to the June 2016 approval of mutual recognition of the PEFC*3 international forest certiÔ¨Åcation system, international recognition has increased. *2 The forests owned by Sumitomo Forestry exclude the lands leased to Kawanokita Development Co., Ltd., which is a Group company responsible for operating a golf course, and the surrounding forest. Newly purchased forests are excluded because they underwent expanded inspections during the subsequent Ô¨Åscal year. *3 The programme for the Endorsement of Forest CertiÔ¨Åcation Schemes is an international NGO that mutually authenticates certiÔ¨Åcation standards created in each country and region as criteria to be shared internationally. Forest certiÔ¨Åcation systems in 49 countries have joined PEFC of which 44 have been mutually recognized as forest certiÔ¨Åcation systems. Distribution and Area of Company-Owned Forests (as of March 31, 2020) Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú199Ôºû Forest Revitalization Initiatives Seedling Production for Regional Revitalization Increasing number of municipalities are working to foster forest resources that are not yet eÔ¨Äectively utilized as one part of regional revitalization measures. Areas of clear cutting is expected to increase in the future as the harvesting period approaches for cedar and Japanese cypress planted after World War II, and a stable supply of seedlings is desired for reforestation. However, due to circumstances such as a lower number of producers, it is expected that the resources will be insuÔ¨Écient. Sumitomo Forestry was the Ô¨Årst to modernize seedling production. We are contributing to the sustainability of forest resources and active resource production through eÔ¨Äorts such as the construction of greenhouse-type cultivation facilities with proper environmental management using proprietary production technology for seedling containers. More speciÔ¨Åcally, starting from the development of an environmental control greenhouse facility in Hyuga City, Miyazaki in 2012, we established the know-how for production in Mombetsu City, Hokkaido as well. The production per unit of area signiÔ¨Åcantly increased by controlling the temperature and humidity and allowing cultivation throughout the year compared to conventionally raising seedlings in the open. We opened greenhouse facilities in Gero City, Gifu Prefecture in Ô¨Åscal 2016, in Motoyama City, Kochi Prefecture in May 2017, and in Midori City, Gunma Prefecture in Ô¨Åscal 2018 as well as in Minamiaizu, Fukushima Prefecture in Ô¨Åscal 2019 to establish a system capable of cultivating 1.9 million seedlings a year throughout Japan. We are also linking to local municipalities to contribute to the revitalization of the region by establishing greenhouses with local employment as well as the development and standardization of new technology related to seedling cultivation in addition to as well. Cultivating Sumitomo Forestry Seedlings Throughout Japan Ôºú200Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 EÔ¨Äorts in Fast-Growing Trees Sumitomo Forestry has begun eÔ¨Äorts in fast-growing tree forests that are gaining more attention in recent years. Fast-growing trees are trees such as Chine Ô¨År, chinaberry, willow and white birch that grow quickly and allow harvests in a short cutting cycle compared to Japanese cedar or Japanese cypress. The Hyuga Forestry OÔ¨Éce is conducting a test harvest of Chinese Ô¨År in the Hitoyoshi company-owned forest in Kumamoto prefecture. This test monitors aspects that include the reduction in weeding and a growth comparison with Japanese cedar through growth surveys and other research to examine the potential as a new tree species for garden vegetation. Chinese Ô¨År In addition, Sumitomo forestry is also advancing the implementation of plans for test harvesting these fast-growing trees with the Forest and Landscape Research Center . Launch of FRD Forestry Roadway Design Support System Forests in Japan often have insuÔ¨Écient forest roads or strip roads in place which prevent smooth management of forests and transport of the timber that is harvested. Currently, when constructing forest roads or strip roads, lines are drawn by hand over a paper topographical map before visiting the site to see if that plan for the road network can be executed as is. This process of examination is usually done over and over again. The work to create these line drawn plans as well as check and verify the site rely heavily on individual intuition and experience as well as cost a vast amount of time and labor. This software takes advantage of precise topographical data obtained from aerial laser and Automatic Design Screen (Image) other measurements to design forestry road networks such as forest roads and strip roads. The main feature is a function for automatic design able to automatically create the line drawings by inputting the site of departure and destination in the operation screen. This feature creates line drawn plans based on parameters, including requirements such as longitudinal slope and the curvature radius, width, and operation costs speciÔ¨Åed in advance. In addition, we have devised a way for software to recognize dangerous terrain. This software packs more features than necessary for the job, such as allowing the design of safety lines that reÔ¨Çect areas which should be avoided due to potential collapse and other circumstances when creating a plan. The on-site exploration of the line drawn plans for roadways designed in the software oÔ¨Äers eÔ¨Écient on-site veriÔ¨Åcation. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú201Ôºû Spearheading Forest Revitalization and Developing Power Assist Suits for the Forestry Industry The Forestry Assist Suit Research and Development Consortium led by Sumitomo Forestry exhibited its third prototype of the Ô¨Årst power assist suit for the forestry industry developed in Ô¨Åscal 2017 that is able to reduce physical labor by 17% at the Intentional Robot Exhibition 2017. In Ô¨Åscal 2018, we tested the enhanced fourth prototype, featuring improvements making it easier to put on and take oÔ¨Ä, as well as more eÔ¨Äective functionality. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we further enhanced the Ô¨Åfth prototype with success in a roughly 30% (6 kg) weight reduction and decrease in the physical strength necessary to traverse terrain. This consortium is comprised of the Forest Research and Management Organization, ATOUN Inc. and the Nara Institute of Science and Technology. Development is moving forward with the aim of practical application by 2025. In addition to assisting operators while they walk when traversing up and down slopes, Prototype Testing this forestry power suit can also reduce the load on the shoulders and feet of workers when carrying heavy seedling packs and planting tools for several dozen kilometers. Practical applications of the power assist suit for the forestry industry would reduce the physical burden on workers and improve work eÔ¨Éciency by alleviating concerns about exhaustion on steep slopes while allow each person to carry a larger amount of seedlings and tools. Ôºú202Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Forest Management Overseas Basic Policy As national governments throughout Southeast Asia strengthen their promotion of natural forest conservation, they are implementing restrictions on harvesting and exports, among other measures that reduce the supply of natural wood. In addition, as momentum toward SDGs and sustainable development increases, it has become necessary to convert to timber obtained through forest plantation and certiÔ¨Åed forest management practices that ensure both environmental consciousness and stable supply. The Sumitomo Forestry Group implements forest plantation operations that take local communities and ecosystems into consideration to enable a stable and sustained timber supply while helping to reduce the impact on natural forests.

Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú203Ôºû Forest Management Overseas The Sumitomo Forestry Group is expanding three approaches to conducting plantation forest operations; industrial tree plantation, environmental reforestation, and social forestry. The purpose of industrial tree plantation is to produce wood and increase the supply of plantation timber (raw material). By zoning its managed land appropriately, the Group aims to achieve both the conservation of valuable ecosystems and the development of local communities through plantation forest operations. In addition, the Group also conducts environmental reforestation, planting trees for environmental conservation. It aims to contribute to environmental conservation through the expansion of forested areas and the fulÔ¨Ållment of the ecosystem services function of forests, by actively planting trees on land where natural regeneration would otherwise be diÔ¨Écult. The Group has also been engaged in ‚Äúsocial forestry‚Äù which shares the economic beneÔ¨Åts of forest plantation with local communities while enlisting the cooperation of local residents. Sustainable Plantation Business by Leveraging Forestry CertiÔ¨Åcation System Of an approximately 30,000-hectare plantation owned and managed by OBT* of Papua New Guinea, about two-thirds, or 20,000 hectares, has received FSC¬Æ forest certiÔ¨Åcation*1. Under the goal to plant on the 500-hectare land a year, OBT practices sustainable forest management that lays basis for communities and environment to function in harmony. The area planted in Ô¨Åscal 2019 was 491 hectares. Approximately 36,000 hectares managed by Tasman Pine Forests Ltd. (TPF) of New Zealand has been FSC¬Æ-FM certiÔ¨Åed*2.

Ôºú204Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Plantation Forest Operations in West Kalimantan, Indonesia (Industrial Tree Plantation) Since 2010, under the license from Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry permitting utilization of timber from commercial forests*, Sumitomo Forestry has been committed to a large-scale forest plantation business conducted in cooperation with the ALAS Kusuma Group, a company involved in forestry management and plywood manufacturing in Indonesia. The project covers areas in which forest degradation has advanced due to commercial harvesting from the 1960s to the mid-1990s in addition to repeated illegal logging and slash-and-burn farming practices. In these types of lands, Sumitomo Forestry Group actively uses devastated forests that are not economically viable as plantation forests while taking on the responsibility of preserving forests with high conservation value. In addition, we believe it is important to prevent further degradation of forests by providing an economic infrastructure to local communities through businesses. The plantation land used in these operations exists in tropical peatland which plays an extremely vital role in the carbon water cycle on a global scale. Sumitomo Forestry launched these operations by conducting detailed typographical survey and a boring test to understand the peat distribution and depth at a level never achieved in the world before. We properly manage water according to the wealth of data gained through these surveys to control greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands and forest Ô¨Åres. This peatland management model is the Ô¨Årst in the world to contribute greatly to measures that combat climate change. Even today, Sumitomo Forestry continues in eÔ¨Äorts to improve peatland management models by using satellites, drones, and other leading-edge technologies. * Issued by the Indonesian government, this is a business license to engage in industrial tree plantation operations in Indonesia. The license is valid for 60 to 100 years. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú205Ôºû Signed a contract with International Finance Corporation (IFC)‚Äîmember of the World Bank Group for the provision of advisory services. In accordance with the concept of High Conservation Values Forests (HCVF)* that draws great attention in recent years, Sumitomo Forestry conducted assessments on its operational properties with IFC and 2012 investigated whether the property use plan is implemented as stated and adequate consideration is made for biodiversity and livelihood of local residents. The reports of the investigation results were audited by a third-party organization, and valuable comments made by stakeholders on the report were adapted in the business plan. Held public hearings where stakeholders such as local residents, companies in the communities, academics, NGOs, and government oÔ¨Écers were invited to share the results of the investigations. 2013 Obtained the PHPL certiÔ¨Åcation, formally called SertiÔ¨Åkat Pengelolaan Hutan Produksi Lestari issued by Ministry of Forestry (Departemen Kehutanan) on sustainable forest management. Held public hearings with stakeholders prior to plantation forest harvest with the aim of deepening stakeholders' understanding about our businesses and consideration to environment and social issues that we promote. This 2015 venue also actively pursued cooperation from our stakeholders to prevent forest Ô¨Åres. Participants not only shared a lot of positive feedback but also gave us comments fruitful in the formulation of our business plans. Advanced eÔ¨Äorts with the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry to build a model for sustainable plantation forest operations and peat management methods in peatlands through our businesses and research activities. 2016 The Commissioner of Peat Land Recovery visited the local grounds to observe the peat management technology. Gained high praise for groundwater level control technology and the newest initiatives founded in data as well as introduced both in an international venue for government oÔ¨Écials as beneÔ¨Åcial examples for Indonesia. Entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry for a pilot project that aims to examine unique water level management technologies to sustainably manage peatlands and establish peatland management models in Indonesia. The term of this project is set for Ô¨Åve years. The project is being conducted with the cooperation of the Ministry of the Environment and Forestry as well as the Peatland 2017 Restoration Agency. The peatland management technology from this project was introduced as an example of excellent, leading-edge peat management at the November 2017 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP23) held in Bonn, Germany. In 2018, the Group formulated a grievance mechanism with the help of the IFC. Together with the University of Indonesia, we also conducted a social survey of operational and surrounding areas on a three-year plan. 2018 We reported on peatland management technology at the December 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP24) held in Poland. We announced initiatives related to WSL peatland management and plantation operations at The Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) held in Yokohama in August. We introduced for the Ô¨Årst time in the world that tropical peatland forest not only acts as the lungs of the Earth but also a heart that circulates water around the globe. 2019 We also announced a peatland management system that prevents Ô¨Åres at a side event of the United Nations Climate Action Summit held in New York in September. At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) held in Madrid in December, we presented water management technologies and the preservation of rare species. * In considering the value of forests, it goes beyond their value as absorbers of greenhouse gases, outlining methods of extracting each one of the many aspects of value forests contain. These aspects include their value as habitats of rare, endangered animal species, as water resources, as providers of essential natural services such as soil erosion control, and as land that has an intimate relationship with the lifestyles and cultures of local communities. Ôºú206Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Conservation of Peat Swamp Forests Conventionally, reforestation in peatlands* pushed water out of the soil and dried the land by digging many drainage routes for planting. However, drying-out land results in the decomposition of organic matter in the peat soil and acts to heighten global warming due to the emission of greenhouse gases. Dried peat, once ignited, is very diÔ¨Écult to extinguish, creating the risk of large-scale forest Ô¨Åres. The soil needs to always be in a damp state to prevent Ô¨Åres, but this means maintaining a constant groundwater level throughout the year through proper water level management is extremely vital. Therefore, in drawing up a forestation plan, the Sumitomo Forestry conducts detailed measurements and surveys based on which the following areas are identiÔ¨Åed: (1) forests to be protected with riparian forest and high rarity value, (2) areas to set as buÔ¨Äer zones between protection zones and plantation zones, and Ô¨Ånally (3) areas the Ô¨Ånal determination as plantation zones. In plantation zones, water routes that function as round log transport, water level control, and Ô¨Åre belts are constructed while allowing a constant water level in the peatlands to always be maintained without aÔ¨Äecting the rivers by not directly connecting the water routes and the rivers. Maintaining a constant groundwater level not only prevents forest Ô¨Åres and minimizes the breakdown of peats but also limits the emission of greenhouse gases. These results have been announced at relevant government agencies, universities and other institutes in addition to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP25), and some aspects have even been adopted as new policy measures. Regions where peatlands thrive, such as the Amazon, the Congo Basin, and Indonesia, have the most rainfall throughout the world. Tropical forests and peatlands act as a pipeline dispersing water into the air from a large amount of rainwater accumulated in the ground during the monsoon season through evaporation. The tremendous evaporation from these tropical forests and peatlands has the potential to act as a necessary water cycle function not only locally but at a continental and global scale. The collapse of the world ºs water cycle will result in abnormal weather and adversely impact agriculture, which will cause even greater food shortage issues. Sumitomo Forestry recognizes this fact in its peatland operations. Our presentation at The Seventh Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD7) held in Yokohama in August 2019 advocated the importance of proper tropical forest and peatland management because these regions act as the heart of the Earth circulating water throughout the planet. * Characteristics of the peat soil found in the peat swamps is known to emit enormous amounts of greenhouse gases, typically carbon dioxide and methane gas, if the soil was inappropriately exploited. Owing to joint researches by Japanese and Indonesian academic institutes, this project takes consideration to minimize greenhouse gas emissions that accrue as the peaty soil dissolves during exploitations.

Ôºú210Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Consulting Business Domestic Case Example Supporting Municipalities in Introducing Forestry ICT Platforms While quantitative forest resources are analyzed through aerial surveys and forest resource data systems are prepared in some advancing areas, many of the forests in Japan do not have suÔ¨Écient forest resource information. Sumitomo Forestry built the Forestry ICT Platform together with AS Locus Corporation as a measure to address this situation. The Forestry ICT Platform is a holistic system with a wide range of functionality related to advance forest resource information as well as forests and forestry that has been provided to municipalities throughout Japan and organizations in the forestry business since Ô¨Åscal 2013. The key distinctive feature of this platform is that it is provided in regionally customized form, with a variety of forest and forestry-related data and functions optimized for local characteristics. We have supported 13 municipalities with the platform as of the end of Ô¨Åscal 2019. Supporting the Creation of a Forest and Forestry Master Plan for Itoshima City, Fukuoka Prefecture Sumitomo Forestry is providing consulting in planning of forest maintenance and forestry development conducted by local municipalities by taking advantage of its wealth of knowledge in forest management cultivated in company-owned forests over a long period of time. As part of these eÔ¨Äorts, we supported the creation of a Forest and Forestry Master Plan in Itoshima City, Fukuoka Prefecture as an initiative to use local forest resource since January 2016. This plan is the foundation for measures related to proper forest maintenance and eÔ¨Äective use of city lumber in Itoshima, which is positioned as the basic plan under which businesses are to build supply chains for city use of timber that takes advantage of ICT promoted by Itoshima. As methods to create this master plan, we are zoning areas that consider attributes such as the growth rate and accessibility of forests as well as the environmental conservation functions after grasping the amount of forest resources within the city limits through aerial laser measurement. Sumitomo Forestry formulated a harvesting plan and a plan for a transportation network that would be optimal to haul timber cultivated in the forest out by deÔ¨Åning policies for conducting operations in the forest for each zone. Moreover, we also examined the systems to build to execute measures that follow this master plan. Sumitomo Forestry is currently assisting in the setup of an execution framework for this plan and will continue to support so that this master plan will contribute to regional reforestation.

Our comprehensive support has also included livelihood assistance to help reduce excessive dependency on forests. Among Vietnam's poorest areas, Dien Bien has suÔ¨Äered severe forest depletion due to practices by local residents such as expansion of farmland and burning of Ô¨Åelds. Given its importance as the location of a hydroelectric generator dam and sources of water crucial for all of Vietnam, however, we assist with a portion of the support that JICA provides to the province, such as the formation of organizations to Award ceremony protect forests, conservation activities, forest planting, fruit tree and vegetable cultivation support, as well as helping to provide feed for Ô¨Åsh and livestock. As of Ô¨Åscal 2019, we had reforested a total of approximately 28.8 hectares in six locations. In Dien Bien Province, where open livestock grazing has been the local custom, the resulting damage to planted tree seedlings has become an issue as it prevents them from taking root and growing. We are therefore promoting a forestation model that introduces the use of protective barriers. The seedling survival rate has increased compared to previous forestation models, thus conÔ¨Årming the eÔ¨Äectiveness of the forestation model using protective barriers. The results have been acknowledged by the provincial Rural Agricultural Development Bureau, and received an award in October 2018.

The CO2 emitted by burning wood does not contribute to CO2 in the atmosphere as part of the life cycle of the timber because the CO2 in the atmosphere is absorbed through photosynthesis as the trees grow (concept of carbon neutrality). Therefore, the Group has been engaged in wood biomass power generation as a type of business that contributes greatly to the advancement of forestry, such as the eÔ¨Äective use of wood, reductions in CO2 emissions and the maintenance of local forest environments. In February 2011, the Sumitomo Forestry Group entered this sector with the operation of the urban-oriented Kawasaki Biomass Power Generation Plant (generation capacity: 33 MW), which primarily uses scrap construction wood as fuel. Thereafter, full operations began at the Mombetsu Biomass Power Plant in December 2016 with a generation capacity of 50 MW, the Tomakomai Biomass Power Generation Plant in April 2017 with a generation capacity of 6.2 MW and the Hachinohe Biomass Power Generation Plant in April 2018 with a generation capacity of 12.4 MW. All of these plants generate power primarily from unused forest resource from Japan. Once the Kanda Biomass Power Generation Plant begins full operation in 2021, the Group will have a total power generation capacity of roughly 177 MW, which will supply electricity to approximately 374,000 households. Drawing on past experience in the wood biomass power generation business, the Group will continue to expand renewable energy business operations suited to local conditions and other requirements, aiming to build a power generation system with a capacity of 300MW primarily generated from wood biomass.

Sumitomo Forestry Group held hearings and invited stakeholders (local residents, neighbor corporations, academics, NGOs, and government workers) to conduct forest operations with considerations toward human rights. Hearing was held in 2013 to share the content and result of a survey and hearing held in 2015 to deepen stakeholders understanding about content of the business and environmental considerations prior to harvesting the plantation forest. In 2018, the Group built a grievance mechanism with the help of the IFC in PT. Wana Subur Lestari (WSL) and PT. Mayangkara Tanaman Industri (MTI). This mechanism provides two routes for grievances. The Ô¨Årst allows local residents to share their opinion in writing with WSL or MTI while the second provides WSL and MTI the opportunity to conduct informal visits with local residents to gather feedback. Both of these grievance routes provide a response to local residents within seven business days with the approval of the WSL and MTI management team. In addition, the Group has begun social surveys as part of the threeyear plan with the University of Indonesia around its business zones and neighboring area. Grievance Desk Human Rights Training The Sumitomo Forestry Group provides lectures about human rights in its new employee training in Japan. Sumitomo Forestry also incorporates classes about human rights in its training for new general managers. We also require all Group employees with access to the intranet to take the ‚ÄúWork and Human Rights‚Äù module in e-learning every year with the intention to promote respect for human rights and a workplace where no discrimination is permitted (completed with a test score of at least 80 points). In Ô¨Åscal 2019, 11,956 employees of whom 5,452 and 6,504 belong to the parent company and Group companies, respectively, took the class. The eÔ¨Äort in raising human right awareness via e-learning will be continued into the future. Prevention of Harassment Sumitomo Forestry makes its policy on sexual harassment, workplace bullying and maternity harassment clear, having included in its Employment Regulations, under one category of rules to be observed by employees (discipline on the job), a provision prohibiting such harassment as well as disciplinary standards. The Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct also prohibits all forms of harassment and this is communicated via the internal website and handouts. In addition, awareness within the Company is fostered by providing information with case examples and implementing regular awareness promotion notices, through human rights and ethics training and other activities. Furthermore, the Group distributes an email to every employee from the General Manager of the Personnel Department every six months to raise awareness about stopping all harassment. Furthermore, a framework to properly handle inquiries and complaints was put in place in Ô¨Åscal 2000 with the establishment of the Harassment Consultation Hotline within the Personnel Department and Compliance Hotline both inside and outside of the Company. The privacy of all those involved is protected and every eÔ¨Äort are made to ensure that neither the complainant nor those cooperating are treated detrimentally. Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct Preventative Measures for Mental Health Care Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú231Ôºû Occupational Health and Safety Management Basic Policy Sumitomo Forestry has established Rules for OHS Management with an aim of fostering a workplace environment in which employees can perform their jobs in a safe and healthy manner. The rules prescribe that a general OHS manager is to be stationed at each place of business regardless of how big it is, and every year, the Company checks on the status of the oÔ¨Écer and OHS committee meetings. With the aim of preventing accidents at construction sites and maintaining the health of workers, each division, such as the Environment and Resources Division, Timber and Building Materials Division, and the Housing and Construction Division, has also established separate OHS management policies and manuals in view of the distinctive characteristics of their respective businesses. The Quality Control and Worker Safety Management Department established on April 1, 2020 as an oÔ¨Éce directly under the president strives to consistently improve product and service quality and eradicate occupational accidents. This department also rolls out and strengthens quality as well as occupational health and safety management systems by providing guidance and advice to the entire Group. Occupational Health and Safety Management System The Quality Control and Worker Safety Management Department oversees matters related to occupational health and safety throughout the entire Sumitomo Forestry Group. This department deploys and consolidates occupational health and safety management systems while providing the necessary guidance and assistance to each Group company. Personnel department manages non-consolidated OHS of the Sumitomo Forestry, and heads of the personnel department provide OHS instructions and support branches in establishing OHS systems. In addition, OHS committees chaired by the general manager of each business division (General Manger of Personnel Department at the head oÔ¨Éce) and composed of members such as health and safety managers, industrial physicians, and labor union members were established in each business division, and matters discussed each month are posted on the intranet for the purpose of information sharing and enlightenment. The Sumitomo Forestry Group also conducts occupational health and safety training unique to each business and work site because a broad range of businesses related to wood are expanding globally. Targets and Performance Concerning Occupational Injuries In the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets as part of the Sumitomo Forestry Group 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan, Sumitomo Forestry Group sets critical targets by Ô¨Åscal 2021 as ‚Äúzero occupational injury and lost work time.‚Äù The Sumitomo Forestry Group aims to achieve its critical targets and deÔ¨Ånes priority sustainability measures in each division. The performance toward achieving these targets is reviewed each Ô¨Åscal year.

Occupational Health and Safety on Construction Sites Occupational Health and Safety (Manufacturing Business) Occupational Health and Safety in the Forestry Business Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú233Ôºû Work-Life Balance Basic Policy Sumitomo Forestry recognizes employees' diverse work styles and strives to create a workplace where they can be motivated in their jobs, and still enjoy fulÔ¨Ålling private lives. ReÔ¨Çecting these aims, the Company has worked on such initiatives as providing childcare and family care programs, promoting greater participation by women, and reducing overtime. In Ô¨Åscal 2013, the Workstyle DiversiÔ¨Åcation Department was established within the Personnel Department, bringing together support desk functions relating to work styles and careers, including childcare and family care, career support, mental health and post-retirement re-employment. In developing a counseling system which is easier for employees to access, the Company supports diverse work styles. A Ô¨Çextime system and a work interval system were adopted with the purpose of reducing long hours and improving productivity in Ô¨Åscal 2017. The transition is not only in working hours but also from a labor system to a true count system in addition to adopting measures such as a per hour productivity assessment. These programs aim to improve employee motivation as well as productivity by preventing harm to health from accumulated fatigue due to working long hours in addition to heightening awareness about cost versus time to realize a work-life balance. Addressing Long Working Hours Sumitomo Forestry sees long working hours left unaddressed as a factor causing occupational injuries and damage to the image of plants and it recognizes the lack of a workforce in the future as a grave management risk. Since Ô¨Åscal 2019, the Sumitomo Forestry Group set critical Ô¨Åscal 2021 targets ‚Äúreducing long work hours through work style reforms‚Äù in the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets to promote this initiative. Each division and consolidated Group company in Japan conÔ¨Årms the performance toward achieving these targets every Ô¨Åscal year. In particular, close communication with customers is indispensable in the sales and construction of custom-built detached housing, and long working hours occur as a result of this need in the Housing and Construction Division. Therefore, average overtime hours and individual overtime hours are reported to the head of each department to increase awareness about mitigating long working hours. Additionally, a Workstyle Improvement Committee has been set up at branches to implement initiatives to address long working hours. As to the working system and operational Ô¨Çow reform that are diÔ¨Écult to tackle at a branch level, the Long Working Hours Mitigation Committee set within the Housing and Construction Division continuously leads the long working hours mitigation campaign by making proposals for the systems improvement. Material Issue 4: A Vibrant Work Environment Where a Diverse Workforce can Unharness Their Skills and Individuality Ôºú234Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Revisions to the Personnel System In Ô¨Åscal 2017, Sumitomo Forestry revised the personnel system to transition overtime work to an actual count system paying employees based on deemed number of working hours. Moreover, we are promoting a reduction in long working hours and higher productivity by adopting a Ô¨Çextime system, work interval system and a productivity assessment by hour. The transition to an actual count system and the adoption of a productivity assessment primarily aims to grow the cost awareness by hour, reduce long hours as well as heighten the quality and productivity of work. We are also striving to equalize operational working hours overall by stipulating the total working hours per month in a Ô¨Çextime system. In addition, the interval system makes sure employees have 11 hours of leisure time between the end of the work day until the start of the next work day and exempts employees from working at the start of a workday or core time if it overlaps this leisure time. These systems aim to prevent overwork and further the preservation of employee health. Mental Health Care Practical Mental Health Care Based on the Guidelines for Maintaining and Improving Workers' Mental Health formulated by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in August 2000, Sumitomo Forestry implements four types of care for mental health: self-care; care provided by line managers; care provided by occupational health staÔ¨Ä within the workplace; and care using resources from outside the business. In April 2013, the Company established the Workstyle DiversiÔ¨Åcation Department within the Personnel Department. It is responsible for providing support related to childcare and family care, career support and support for mental health. In order to further enhance mental health care, the Company put eÔ¨Äort into providing mentally ill individuals with Mental Health Education for follow-up support and help in returning to work. The Company assigned an employee, Management who is a qualiÔ¨Åed clinical psychologist, to the Workstyle DiversiÔ¨Åcation Department, and it worked in close cooperation with an external provider of the employee assistance program (EAP)*. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, Sumitomo Forestry revised the external Employee Assistance Program (EAP) agency alliance and established a new management consultation desk to further a system to better support line care. This help desk is not only available to employees but also their families and can support in English and Chinese, which oÔ¨Äers better care for a wider range of employees. We adjust stratiÔ¨Åed working hours and the work load to suit the circumstances of each individual by adopting an occupational rehabilitation system to help employees return to work to create and execute rehabilitation plans so that each person can both physically and mentally get used to the work environment. Sumitomo Forestry distributes a Mental Absentee Guidebook when employees take leave with corporate rules and other information related to how to spend that time oÔ¨Ä as well as the suspension of their work to elevate worry as much as possible during their break. We also distribute a Guidebook for Managers to supervisors as well to provide information that includes ways to handle each situation. * A workplace mental health care service for employees Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú235Ôºû Preventative Measures for Mental Health Care As part of its prevention of mental health disorders, the Company has oÔ¨Äered stress checks, which were made mandatory after amendments to the Industrial Safety and Health Law in December 2015, on a website to employees covered by health insurance (excluding those employees on long-term leave, such as maternity leave or convalescence leave) since Ô¨Åscal 2013. To further promote active health management in Ô¨Åscal 2019, we revised the stress check from the original 57 items (occupational stress quick check sheet) to a new stress check made up of 89 items. As follow-up measures after the stress check for departments that found to have low general health and a high stress rate, internal counselors (clinical psychologist) and external EAP agencies provide one-on-one counseling as well as line care and self-care training. Since Ô¨Åscal 2009, Sumitomo Forestry also provides guidance to all of its employees twice a year through the general manager of the personnel department while fostering communication with staÔ¨Ä on a daily basis to prevent harassment with the purpose of building a lively, comfortable and friendly workplace. In conjunction, a harassment consultation desk has also been put in place in personnel departments to support consults from employees. In addition, Work and Human Rights e-learning is required for all Group employees as training that includes education about harassment (passing the comprehension test require a score of at least 80 points). An employee who is a certiÔ¨Åed public health nurse has been hired into the Workstyle DiversiÔ¨Åcation Department to not only oÔ¨Äer mental health care but also provide assistance such as various health consultations, enlightenment about health for new employees, and follow-up after health check-ups. We also conduct health check-ups before appointing or returning an employee to a post for overseas appointees as well as interview individuals, gain information and provide advice about the state of their health as well as address other needs they may have.

(Non-Consolidated) As for Ô¨Åscal 2017, Sumitomo Forestry has consolidated the attendance management systems in a way that not only employees but also their supervisors can see their leave 60.2% plans, and thereby, enabled employees to plan their paid leaves better. In addition, the Housing and Construction Division established planned annual leave for all departments as of Ô¨Åscal 2017 (general rule of four days). The percentage of paid leave taken in Ô¨Åscal 2019 was 60.2%. The Company has again listed ‚Äútake at least 13.5 days of paid leave‚Äù in its Sustainability Budget, and will continue to further promote this initiative during Ô¨Åscal 2020.

Refresh Leave and Family Friendly Day Leave So that employees can engage energetically in their jobs with healthy body and mind, Sumitomo Forestry is developing workplace environments that allow employees to take leave as they wish. As part of those eÔ¨Äorts, employees are encouraged to take consecutive days of ‚Äúrefresh leave‚Äù at a time that suits them in addition to the summer and New Year holiday periods. Each workplace is required to draw up refresh leave schedules for individual employees. The number of days available for the refresh leave program changed from ‚Äúthree days‚Äù to ‚ÄúÔ¨Åve days‚Äù in Ô¨Åscal 2019 to put in place an environment where employees can take leave more easily. At branches of the Housing and Construction Division, which are regularly closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, employees often meet with customers on the weekends, which sometimes make it hard to take time oÔ¨Ä to participate in family events and other private occasions. This has been addressed with the introduction of Family Friendly Day leave, which allows employees to take either one Saturday or one Sunday oÔ¨Ä each month to spend with family or on a chosen pursuit. Branch employees are encouraged to cooperate on adjustment of job responsibilities and meeting schedules, thereby helping to create a workplace environment that makes it easy to take leave on the weekends.

For example, supervisors conduct interviews with employees who plan to take childcare leave together with a person in charge of the Workstyle DiversiÔ¨Åcation Department upon request. These interviews explain the programs related to childcare leave and provide advice about the work style after the employee returns to work in addition to introducing information such as examples of other employees who have found balance between raising children and work. Moreover, employees who want to work while raising children can apply for programs such as the Ô¨Çextime system as well as reduced working hours so that they can have a Ô¨Çexible workstyle. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú237Ôºû The 6th Next Generation Law Action Plan (for Fiscal 2015 to 2019) Sumitomo Forestry formulates and implements action plans for supporting employees who are raising families, in accordance with the Act on Advancement of Measures to Support Raising Next-Generation Children (Next Generation Law). Sumitomo Forestry has formulated and advanced its 6th Action Plan for Ô¨Åscal 2015 to 2019 with the following targets. 1. Host seminars themed on work style reforms in order to foster a work environment which actively involves female employees who are rearing infants 2. Hold ‚ÄúFamily Open Day‚Äù to create a pleasant work environment for all employees to execute their talent 3. Create systems for male employees who are raising children to consult with superiors about available programs to encourage male employees to participate in raising their children The usage status of programs related to child raising are also published on our intranet. An Iku-boss Seminar was held by inviting an outside instructor in September 2017 with the theme of renewing the way of thinking to continually improve results while realizing a work style in-line with each person's circumstances by limiting long hours according to an action plan. Approximately 120 people participated with most being general managers who work at the head oÔ¨Éce in Ô¨Åscal 2016. Approximately 180 general managers from around Japan from the Housing and Construction Division as well as others participated in Ô¨Åscal 2017. In April 2019, we held lectures on work-style reforms to enhance the hourly value of each employee with the participation of roughly 200 general managers of departments and branches from throughout Japan. Sumitomo Forestry also formulated and began work on its 7th Action Plan for Ô¨Åscal 2020 to 2021 with the following three targets. 1. Encourage telework system and a work environment to enable work-style options regardless of place. 2. Put in place consultation systems to support employee career development. 3. Build environments in which every employee working in a company involved in housing and lifestyles can actively participate in the valuable experiences of raising children and household chores regardless of gender. Family Open Day Since July 2014, Sumitomo Forestry holds the ‚ÄúFamily Open Day,‚Äù an event for the families of employees to visit their oÔ¨Éces. The ultimate aim of this event is to create pleasant work environment and lively atmosphere for all employees by expressing the Company's appreciation for the support provided by employees' families, assisting the families in understanding about the work at Sumitomo Forestry better, and fostering opportunities for employees to gain mutual understanding with others. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the event was held in one branch, totaling 20 participants from 5 families. The children took part in the morning brieÔ¨Ång, exchanged business cards, interviewed Family Open Day at the School of employees about their work, and made wooden crafts. Celebrating its sixth anniversary in Professional Building Techniques Ô¨Åscal 2019, Family Open Day was held as summer event by spearheading innovation. Promoting Paternal Support for Male Employees In the process of receiving the lump-sum childcare allowance oÔ¨Äered to male employees with newly born children, the employees are required to submit ‚Äúthe questionnaire for a parental support request,‚Äù which is followed by an interview with a direct supervisor about the answers to the questionnaire as well as details of the request. The supervisor then adds resulting comments on the questionnaire including instructions for the subordinate and consideration that should be made by the Company, at the end of the process. This system is believed to encourage more male employees to take part in the parenting duties and raise mutual understanding between the parenting males and their colleagues.

Since Ô¨Åscal 2017, this program was expanded to all employees (approval system) except new graduates who joined the company less than three-years ago or career hires who have only been with the company for less than six months with emphasis on employees who are taking care of children or a family member as well as employees who have a long commute. As response to the COVID-19, Sumitomo Forestry adopted Group-wide Ô¨Çextime policies, introduced a shift system to reduce the number of people in oÔ¨Éces, and provided systems for employees to work either in the oÔ¨Éce or from home. When an emergency declaration was issued, we transition to a fundamental telework systems to have all employees in the aÔ¨Äected regions work from home. In the future, in order to promote Ô¨Çexible work styles further, the Company will continue to work to expand consistent use of the program, such as by explaining the program details and recommending its use to employees on an individual basis when they appear for work style consultations. Participation in ‚ÄúTelework Days‚Äù Following Ô¨Åscal 2018, Sumitomo Forestry participated in the ‚ÄúTelework Days‚Äù campaign promoted by the Ministry of Internal AÔ¨Äairs and Communications, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, the Cabinet Secretariat, the Cabinet OÔ¨Éce, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in addition to relevant associations and corporations as a special cooperative organization to promote work style innovation in Ô¨Åscal 2019. 310 employees worked remotely at home or mobile for at least two days of the week from July 22 to September 6, and the participation of 162 employees throughout Japan on July 24, the focus date of the campaign. Through this campaign by providing opportunity for many employees to experience the beneÔ¨Åts of telecommuting and working remotely Ô¨Årst hand, Sumitomo Forestry promotes understanding and create a foundation for a telework system. Transfer Request Application Systems (Spouse Relocation / Family Care) In Ô¨Åscal 2008, Sumitomo Forestry established a program facilitating the transfer of employees to a certain destination for reasons limited to marriage or a spouse transfer accompanied by a change of residence. The program enables employees to continue working for the Company even after marriage or their spouse being transferred. In Ô¨Åscal 2014, with the new addition of ‚Äúchildcare‚Äù to the reasons for application, transfers are now considered in cases where an employee wants to live with their spouse for the purpose of balancing work and parenting. Also, a new system was established whereby employees can submit a transfer request for reasons of ‚Äúfamily care.‚Äù Transfers are now also considered in cases where the location of employment restricts the employee from balancing work with family care. As at the end of March 2020, a total 43 employees have made use of these programs to transfer to a diÔ¨Äerent location. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú241Ôºû Fair Employment and BeneÔ¨Åts Basic Policy According to internationally accepted human rights norms, we shall of course respect equal opportunity and diversity as well as respect the human rights of all individuals, including women, children, indigenous people, minorities and vulnerable people in the employment and treatment of employees as stated in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct. In its recruitment activities too, the Company emphasizes the ambition and volition of the applicant, and does not diÔ¨Äerentiate selection processes according to academic background or gender. At Group companies outside Japan, the employment of local staÔ¨Ä is actively promoted, and talented personnel are employed and promoted to management positions, irrespective of race or gender. As for the disciplinary punishment and dismissal of employees, if there has been a compliance violation, the employee will be dealt with appropriately in accordance with Employment Regulations. We have also put in place a system to prevent unfair dismissals. Recently, talent acquisition has been recognized as one of the major management issues for management in Japan triggered mainly by low birth rate and thereby aging population. Sumitomo Forestry communicates its employment and beneÔ¨Åt policies with potential employees during recruitment and expands supportive programs to foster diverse work styles and performance of female employees in eÔ¨Äort of acquiring valuable, next-generation talent. Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct Promotion System The Workstyle DiversiÔ¨Åcation Department, which was established as an independent organization in the Personnel Department in April 2013, with the cooperation of each department, supports the utilization of a wide range of employees from female staÔ¨Ä to re-employed retirees and employees with disabilities as well as promotes diversity.

Development and Sales from a Woman's Perspective Having started in March 2013, Women's Perspective Project which gathered diverse female employees from the headquarters, branch oÔ¨Éces across Japan and Group companies in intention to bring homes designed from their residents' perspectives. Previously, the project provided the ‚ÄúComama‚Äù spatial design proposal and also nine houses built and sold in just half a year at East Hills Seya in the Ikoma district in Nara Prefecture. In addition, the brush-up customer service training from a woman ºs perspective is intermittently held for female home advisors working at model homes. This training provides insight into household concerns and inconveniences as well as discusses the dream home from a woman ºs perspective. The curriculum also teaches speciÔ¨Åc ways to build trust as a key stage of the sales process by especially empathizing with wives and other female customers. This training program is held once every two to three years according to the enrollment of employees yet to take the course. Up until now, 462 female employees took this training program. Ôºú244Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Main Initiatives Aimed at Increasing the Motivation of Female Employees Sumitomo Forestry provides various training for female employees. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, training for women salespersons was conducted for the purpose of Ô¨Ånding their source of motivation to encourage female staÔ¨Ä to continue to work in sales. Two female staÔ¨Ä members‚Äîone fourth-year employee and a twelfth-year supervisor working on the sales team‚Äîpresented the secret to Ô¨Ånding the signiÔ¨Åcance of working as sales team member without focusing on gender. Because many female sales staÔ¨Ä resign due to life events, building a working environment that allows diverse workstyle innovation is vital. At the same time, raising individual awareness is also important. Therefore, we are working to ensure self management that not only improves sales skills but also heightens motivation. The Sumitomo Forestry Group on-site training for female engineers provided an informational exchange with other companies in the same industry as well as construction site tours for female on-site managers with the goal of teaching successful examples of construction engineers who are women outside Sumitomo Forestry as well as improving skills and motivation.

As of June 2020, Sumirin Exterior of new Sumirin Wood Peace OÔ¨Éce Building Wood Peace employs 11 people with disabilities. In the future, the Company will further this recruitment and ensure business continuity. Adopting Systems to Re-employ Retirees and Provide Selective Retirement Re-employment of Retirees Sumitomo Forestry adopted a system for the re-employment of retirees in Ô¨Åscal 2006 whereby it re-employs personnel, who retired at 60, until the end of the Ô¨Åscal year that they reach the age of 65, on the condition that they have had at least 10 years of continuous service, they have speciÔ¨Åc qualiÔ¨Åcations and experience, and they wish to be re-employed. About 80% of our employees who turn 60 request re-employment, and 100% of those employees who requested reemployment are re-employed in the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Åscal year. In addition, the Senior Human Resource Asset Bank Center established in April 2018 extends re-employment contracts even after the end of the Ô¨Åscal year when employees turn 65 who are necessary to the company and would like to keep working. 43 employees have currently registered for the program while 35 have been re-employed and are working as of April 1, 2020. Adopting a Selective Retirement System Sumitomo Forestry adopted a Selective Retirement System in April 2020 to extend retirement until the end of the Ô¨Åscal year the employee reaches the age of 65 (March 31 of the personnel Ô¨Åscal year). We have also introduced a system to move up retirement to the day before the employee ºs 60th birthday when requested. An employee can continue to work through the valid term of their contract (re-employment) when selecting retirement before the age of 65 and requesting a Ô¨Çexible work style, such as reducing the number of work days. Material Issue 4: A Vibrant Work Environment Where a Diverse Workforce can Unharness Their Skills and Individuality Ôºú246Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Return to Work Application System Sumitomo Forestry has operated the Return to Work Application System since Ô¨Åscal 2008. The aims of the system are to meet the re-employment needs of workers to secure talented personnel who resign due to unavoidable circumstances such as childcare and eldercare. Employees register their wish to return to work at the time they resign, and applicants must have had worked for at least three consecutive years before the resignation. As at the end of March 2020, the Company received 256 applications. When the Company receives an application, it goes through a selection process based on the Company ºs needs and the skills of the applicant. Applicants who are successfully re-employed within three years of the resignation are able to regain the same levels of position as before. Direct Employment of Non-permanent Employees In recent years, regulations for dispatched employees have been strengthened to correct disparities arising out of diÔ¨Äerent forms of employment. In response, Sumitomo Forestry reviewed its personnel systems to appoint competent employees, and in April 2011, changed the status of its dispatched employees to directly employed Ô¨Åxed-term employees, referred to as ‚Äúpartner employees.‚Äù Sumitomo Forestry also operates a system for promoting partner employees to permanent status. It promoted 12 workers to permanent employee status in Ô¨Åscal 2020.

Material Issue 4: A Vibrant Work Environment Where a Diverse Workforce can Unharness Their Skills and Individuality Support for Obtaining QualiÔ¨Åcations and Attending External Education Sumitomo Forestry promotes independent eÔ¨Äorts for capacity building and career development. For instance, the Company's Regulations for Assistance in Obtaining QualiÔ¨Åcations and Attending External Education include provisions for assistance when an employee seeks to obtain qualiÔ¨Åcations or use an external educational institution. With regard to obtaining qualiÔ¨Åcations needed for managing operations and qualiÔ¨Åcations recommended for capacity building, the regulations prescribe assistance limits for each qualiÔ¨Åcation. In particular, a lump-sum payment is provided to employees who pass the examination for Ô¨Årst-class registered architects to acquire a Ô¨Årst-class registered architect's license. 21 employees satisÔ¨Åed the criteria in Ô¨Åscal 2019. Initiatives in the Human Resources Development Department, Housing and Construction Division The Human Resources Development Department engaged in training and a variety of other initiatives in accordance with the training and education policies. Among the trainees, junior employees aim to become independent (fully qualiÔ¨Åed) by the end of their third year in education that concentrates on making trainees think. OJT strengthens the coordination with trainers and incorporates methods for Ô¨Çipped learning as a means to strengthen OJT. The training aims to provide faster mastery of the content as a place to Ô¨Ånd more practical follow up. Ôºú250Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Flow of Flipped Learning To ensure the OJT for junior and mid-level employees reaches its full potential, we are nurturing management skills, product knowledge, and human assets development capabilities of current and future managers to support and guide on eÔ¨Écient work styles. Training has also begun using VR video as a new initiative. In addition to on-site training, trainees quickly learn the knowledge necessary for construction by experiencing various virtual environments without exterior inÔ¨Çuences, and deepen their understanding of operational processes through hands-on experiences as though they are training on an actual site.

Fuji Manabi no Mori Project which began in 1998 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Company's establishment, setting out to restore the vitality of the rich national forest cloaking the foothills of Mt. Fuji that was extensively damaged by a typhoon. Today, this project visualizes the progress of tree growth in survey areas of planted regions and oversee natural forest recovery of Mt. Fuji Manabi no Mori. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the Mt. Fuji Manabi no Mori was used for volunteer activities, environmental education programs as well as opened to NPOs and other organizations. A total of 1,554 people visited Mt. Fuji Manabi no Mori from inside and outside of the Company with a total of 29,818 people visiting the project between Ô¨Åscal 1998 and 2019. 20-year History of Mt. Fuji Manabi no Mori Booklet (in Japanese) Volunteer Activities in Forestry Development Since the start of the project in 1998, up until now, a cumulative total of 28,000 volunteers have helped to plant approximately 30,000 region-speciÔ¨Åc saplings and conduct other forestry eÔ¨Äorts. To date, reforestation eÔ¨Äorts of national forest damaged by typhoons were completed as the Ô¨Årst phase by removing the hexatubes. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, a tree survey began as a monitoring survey necessary to comprehensive forest management activities. As the Ô¨Årst year of this tree survey, 189 volunteers took part in creating a database from records of 495 trees planted on approximately 1,800 m2 over four days under the guidance and cooperation of arborists and other tree experts. The Manabi no Mori project will shift to a more suitable forest for learning by visualizing the growth of the trees that have been cultivated by the volunteers.

Activities include nature observation and games incorporating the Ô¨Åve senses. The aim of these opportunities to rediscover the natural world is for the students to learn about the importance of nature and encourage them to consider new ways in which people can coexist with nature in the future. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, a total of 1,101 students and children from 13 schools were invited to the program. A cumulative total of Environmental Education Program more than 10,000 students and children have been invited as of Ô¨Åscal 2019. Environmental Education Program Trend Ôºú262Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Vegetation Monitoring and Wildlife Habitat Survey We have been conducting vegetation surveys since Ô¨Åscal 2000 to monitor the recovery of the natural forest under the guidance of Vegetation Management Science Laboratory, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology. From the same year, we have been conducting wildlife habitat surveys with the cooperation of the Minami Fuji Branch of the Wild Bird Society of Japan. The vegetation monitoring has been able to conÔ¨Årm the gradual growth of beech, Japanese zelkova, and other trees that were planted as well as dogwood and amur cork trees that grew naturally after the damage caused by the typhoon. Over the last 20 years, the survey revealed that the planted trees had not only gotten larger but entire species in the forest also recovered. The environment where the ground was bare after the removal of fallen trees gradually transformed from grasslands to forests. With this, on the wildlife habitat survey, the population of pheasants and shrikes is declining, and in their place, the population of such birds of the forest as narcissus Ô¨Çycatchers and varied tit is increasing with opportunities to view them becoming more frequent, indicating that the forest is steadily recovering. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, we started a three-year entomological survey with the cooperation of Tokoha University professors. This monitoring survey will identify and list over 80% of the insect species living in Manabi no Mori with a large behavioral range. Cultivating a forest is a never-ending job and Mt. Fuji Manabi no Mori, too, is a 100-year project. To ensure that the project is still running 100 years from now, forest management and environmental activities will be continued as a way to communicate the importance of nature to as many people as possible.

Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú263Ôºû Advocating the Kanagawa Zero Plastic Waste Declaration In February 2019, the Sumitomo Forestry sales oÔ¨Éces in Kanagawa (Yokohama Branch, Yokohama North Branch, Kanagawa West Branch, Shonan Branch, and Tokyo South Branch of Housing and Construction Division) pledged their support for the Kanagawa No Plastic Waste Declaration. In the future, we will continue the beach cleaning activities that began in Ô¨Åscal 2018 as well as providing environmental education for local communities about plastic waste. Kanagawa Zero Plastic Waste Declaration Development of Technology to Pass Down Heritage and Precious Trees to the Next Generation Sumitomo Forestry uses the most cutting-edge biotechnology in addition to conventional grafting and cutting based on the request of owners to pass down heritage and precious trees to the next generation. We are also putting our strength into breeding seedlings that provide the properties in the Ô¨Çowers and leaves of heritage and precious trees as a way to pass down both heritage and precious trees to the next generation. In addition, we are building a DNA database for trees to further advance a sophisticated program to identify individual varieties. Successor Trees to the Miracle Pine Return Home: -Rikuzentakata City, Takatamatsubara Tsunami Memorial Park Tree-planting to Commemorate the Opening of the ParkThe successor trees of the Miracle Pine cloned through grafting returned to their homeland in Rikuzentakata City for the Ô¨Årst time on September 22, 2019. The ‚ÄúMiracle Pine‚Äù was the sole surviving pine tree from the tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake. Sumitomo Forestry attempted to cultivate successor trees to the Miracle Pine and, in 2011, was successful in using grafts and seedlings to propagate new trees. Three of these successor trees were planted for the opening ceremony of the Takatamatsubara Tsunami Memorial Park. It is hoped that these successor trees propagated from the Miracle Pine will become a symbol of protection against disaster and remind those to come of the Great East Japan Earthquake. These successor trees, together with Miracle Pine seedling planted by Rikuzentakata City that recovered strongly from the disaster, will live on to a new Princess Hisako Takamado tomorrow. Sumitomo Forestry's Endeavour to Cultivate Successor Trees of the Miracle Pine Japan Landscape Contractors Association Iwate Division Manager Yoneuchi launches the Miracle Pine Rescue Project. April 2011 Cuttings, graftings, tissue cultures and seedlings are all examined as possible methods of propagation. December 2011 Three grafted saplings and 18 seedlings germinate Approximately 1,000 pine cones are harvested when the September 2012 Miracle Pine is felled. Breaking down all of these pine cones, 75 seeds are collected Seeds collected in September of the previous year are March 2013 planted. The 18 seedlings that germinated in 2011 all wither and die June 2013 nine seedlings are successfully cultivated from the 75 seeds collected in 2012. Present Three grafted trees and nine seedlings are growing well. Ôºú264Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Launch of the TOKYO Sakura Project -Preserving and Popularizing the Tokyo Sakura by Tokyo Metropolitan Government and Sumitomo ForestryThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government and Sumitomo Forestry launched the TOKYO Sakura Project to preserve and popularize the cherry blossoms that has close ties with Tokyo. Sumitomo Forestry is passing on the genetic strains of Tokyo Sakura through species identiÔ¨Åcation via the genetic information as well as the cloning techniques via tissue cultures unique to Sumitomo Forestry in accordance with the Partnership Agreement on TOKYO Sakura Project Logo the Natural Park Business concluded by Sumitomo Forestry and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in April 2018. Start of the Oku Matsushima Natural Recovery Volunteer Planting Activity Sumitomo Forestry entered into a partnership agreement on restoration property development coordination and cooperation with Higashi Matsushima City, Miyagi Prefecture in July 2012 after the Great East Japan Earthquake to make every eÔ¨Äort toward restoration. Higashi Matsushima City aims to revitalize tourism by bringing back the wetlands in the Susaki district near the Nobiru coast devastated by the tsunami. As part of this eÔ¨Äort, Sumitomo Forestry began trial tree planting activities in Ô¨Åscal 2017. A soil investigation discovered a high concentration of acidity, which needed considerations about the tree species and techniques for planting. We then formulated a tree-planting plan taking into account third-party insight from the Tohoku Research Center of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute. We could check and make sure the seedlings had been growing with support by local community, so that the Higashi Matsushima Nature Recover Volunteer Planting Activity started near Oku Matsushima ‚ÄúKizuna‚Äù Solar Park along the Nobiru coast of Higashi Matsushima City In Ô¨Åscal 2019. On October 23, a total of 136 people from the local community, students from Miyanomori Elementary School in Higashi Matsushima and Sumitomo Group employees took part in planting 630 botanical plants, such as Japanese black pine and evergreen shrubs indigenous to Japan.

When starting new businesses or expanding its overseas business sites, the Group's policy is to consider the environment, revitalize local economies and promote employment and thereby operate in harmony with local communities. Activities Which Contribute to Local Communities in Indonesia Support for Children Through the KTI Educational Foundation PT. Kutai Timber Indonesia (KTI) founded the KTI Educational Foundation in 2000 to commemorate its 30th anniversary with the purpose of improving the livelihood of people in Indonesia through education as well as engaging in social activities. This foundation primarily provides educational support to impoverished children as well as school supplies to public schools in Probolinggo in the East Java province where a Sumitomo Forestry Group plant is located. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the foundation provided school supplies to orphans, English learning assistance to students living near the plant and other such support as well as IDR 45,480,800 (approx. 350,000 yen) in Ô¨Ånancial support. Providing uniforms to children at the orphanage Community Development Through Project EARTH Initiatives Sumitomo Forestry has also been involved in Project Earth since 2009 to oÔ¨Äset CO2 (approximately 60,000 tons) emitted from the harvesting of wood used for primary building materials of Sumitomo Forestry Home houses, and emitted from transport, fabrication, and construction by planting in Indonesia. This project combines ‚Äúenvironmental reforestation‚Äù for the purpose of recovering the ecosystem of degraded forests in national parks and community-oriented ‚Äúindustrial tree plantations‚Äù that unify sustainable comprehensive forest management and community contributions. Environmental Reforestation to Combat the Harsh Natural Environment and Forest Fires In Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park located in East Java, Indonesia, Sumitomo Forestry planted about 1.1 million trees, including supplementary planting, over roughly 700 hectares of plantation forest between Ô¨Åscal 2009 to Ô¨Åscal 2016. Mount Bromo erupted in 2010 at this national park damaging the plantation forest due to volcanic ash and gas. At the end of a severe dry season in November 2014, a large Ô¨Åre broke out and burned almost all of the roughly 400 hectares of forest planted up to 2013. We replanted the forest, constructed a Ô¨Åre belt that was six meters in width and 20 km in total length, prepared water and equipment for Ô¨Åre-Ô¨Åghting, and introduced around the clock dry season patrols. However, in October 2019, a large number of forest Ô¨Åres broke out in the national park and once again damaged approximately 470 hectares of plantation forest. Sumitomo Forestry continued to manage the plantation forest even after 2017 upon completion of the reforestation until transferring the environmental reforestation responsibilities to the national park in March 2020 after completing the agreed upon project with them. In the future, the national park plans to restore the ecosystem by maintaining and managing the plantation forest. Ôºú268Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Community-oriented Industrial Tree Plantation Side-by-Side the Local People Who Wish to Plant Trees Starting in the Lumajang Regency located at the foot of Mount Semeru in East Java, Indonesia, Sumitomo Forestry worked with the local people to cultivate about 3,800 hectares of community oriented industrial tree plantation between Ô¨Åscal 2010 and 2017. The harvest and sell of the grown trees that were planted will stimulate the local economy. Pt. Kutai Timeber Indonesia (KTI), a Sumitomo Forestry Group company, took charge of the local activities promising to purchase future logs to give the local people conÔ¨Ådence in their planting eÔ¨Äorts. Sumitomo Forestry not only engaged in planting activity, but also provided local lifestyle infrastructure, building routes necessary for reforestation, and made donations such as academic supplies to kindergartens and elementary schools in addition to setting up public restrooms in villages. After completing the planting eÔ¨Äorts in Ô¨Åscal 2017, the cultivation and reforestation eÔ¨Äorts transferred to KTI and participating citizens. Thereafter, the local people involved have been planting trees they themselves cultivated and harvested in addition to seedlings provided for free from KTI. KTI provided the local people with 920,000 seedlings in Ô¨Åscal 2018 and 680,000 seedlings in Ô¨Åscal 2019. 66,891 houses were delivered during this project period with a roughly 400,000-ton CO2 Ô¨Åxation target. As of ten years since these planting eÔ¨Äorts, the cumulative total estimated CO2 Ô¨Åxation was 430,000 tons*. This is expected to reach our carbon dioxide Ô¨Åxation target of 6 tons per household. Sumitomo Forestry strives to support the local people who want to plant more trees together with KTI in Indonesia. *Excludes CO2 Ô¨Åxation for environmental reforestation deemed to have a high risk of Ô¨Åres and other disasters.

Diagnosing and Treating Adults and Children Alike Social Contribution Through the Housing Business in the United States and Australia The Sumitomo Forestry Group engages in social contribution activities through the housing business in the United States and Australia. In the United States, MainVue Homes set up MainVue Day in 2015 as a day each year for employees to participate in volunteer activities at least once. This program both works as an ongoing philanthropic activity and also an opportunity to reÔ¨Çect on a corporate philosophy that focuses on giving back to society. MainVue Homes employees took advantage of MainVue Day in 2019 to participate in a volunteer eÔ¨Äort held by the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI)‚Äîa non-proÔ¨Åt oÔ¨Äering housing assistance to low-income and homeless people in Washington‚Äîto build a group of small homes. There are approximately 40,000 homeless people living in Washington, of which 7,000 are estimated to live with children. LIHI builds small homes equipped with electricity and heat for families living under these harsh conditions. With the hope of providing at least a little more comfort in the lives of these impoverished people, MainVue Home employees pitched in wherever they could from painting both the inside and outside of homes and building front porches to cleaning the housing exteriors. MainVue Homes Employees Taking Part in the Construction Work Ôºú272Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Crescent Communities, another company in the United States, worked with the project held by Habitat for Humanity‚Äîan international non-proÔ¨Åt organization providing housing assistance in over 70 countries worldwide‚Äî to build and provide homes at an accessible price to help families who cannot aÔ¨Äord a home. The Company worked with 14 other multifamily developers active in Charlotte, North Carolina to fund and build a home in the northern area of the city in 2019. Employees from Crescent Communities took part in the construction and completed the home in July. The house was delivered without fail to a family who jumped in to help with the construction with passion for their own home. Rather than simple economic assistance for families struggling to buy a home, this project is an eÔ¨Äort for families who still want a scheduled mortgage to get involved for a designated amount of time in the construction. The project includes courses on asset formation and home maintenance and management as an initiative that goes beyond providing a home to support the independence of home buyers. In 2019, Sumitomo Forestry Group companies DRB, Edge Homes, and Mark III Properties also donated to Habitat for Humanity and took part in housing support activities. Employees from Crescent Communities taking part in the construction work Henley Properties builds and sells detached homes in Australia. The Company held the Good Friday Charity Auction in April 2019 whereby the money raised from the sales of a spec home, built with cooperation of a housing lot developer, materials supplier and other business partners, is donated. Many business partners took part in these activities from the provision of land to design, estimation, material manufacturing, procurement, and labor management in order to build this two-story home in Clyde North located in south east Melbourne. Henley Properties donated the entire 761,000 Australian dollars (approx. 54 million yen) earned from the charity auction this year to a children's hospital.

Sumitomo Forestry has been providing support to the trial reforestation activities since 2015. In the Ô¨Årst year, we investigated the soil of the land planned for garden vegetation, created a Ô¨Åeld of rice seedlings, selected plant and tree species and collected seeds as well as made other preparations to cultivate seedlings. In the second year, we conducted surveys of the soil and compost that can be collected on-site and furthered seedling preparations. In the third year, we planted the seedlings and drafted a plan for surveys to assess the Approx. Two-Year Old Seedlings percentage that take root. Ready for Planting Although there were delays in the process due to the impact of natural disasters and other factors, plant the cultivated seedlings in 2018, the fourth year of the trial activities, and conÔ¨Årmed those seedlings were able to take root without any problems in 2019. Despite the fact that a tremendous undertaking was anticipated in both time and eÔ¨Äort for reforestation at high altitudes where the environment is harsh and vegetation growth is slow, the project was successful thanks to the cooperation of local project members centered around experienced people who have been involved with planting eÔ¨Äorts for over 30 years on the Himalayan route.

The Group established its Environmental Philosophy in 1994 and Group-wide Environmental Policies in 2000. Moreover, in 2015, the Group has initiated the Sumitomo Forestry Group Environmental Policy, bringing together the Environmental Philosophy, the Environmental Policies, the Sumitomo Forestry Group Declaration of Biodiversity, and the Sumitomo Forestry Group ºs Biodiversity Action Guidelines. The Environmental Policies applies to the product life cycle and all business processes from product and service development, design and manufacturing to material procurement, distribution, waste management, supplier and partner selection, new project launches, mergers, and acquisitions in all businesses of the Sumitomo Forestry Group to promote businesses that contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. A green procurement survey is conducted for the selection and evaluation of suppliers based on the Sumitomo Forestry Group Environmental Policies to assess risks from both environmental and social perspectives in each business when launching new businesses as well as in mergers and acquisitions. To share and raise awareness of the Environmental Policies among Group employees, they were printed in employee handbooks. Opportunities to read through and discuss them were also arranged, for example as part of new employee training, ISO 14001 internal environmental auditor training courses and departmental meetings. The environmental policies are also posted in meeting rooms, and the environmental approach of the Sumitomo Forestry Group has been shared with business partners. Furthermore, the Sumitomo Forestry Group Code of Conduct established in 2017 not only encompasses Group companies but everyone in the supply chain. The Code of Conduct drives coexistence with the environment and clariÔ¨Åes the approach to advance eÔ¨Äorts toward the environment, including all of the business partners of Sumitomo Forestry Group. We formulated the Mid-Term Environmental Management Plan (Ô¨Åscal 2010 to 2014) with speciÔ¨Åc numerical targets for the Ô¨Årst time in Ô¨Åscal 2009 as environmental goals and established the Mid-Term CSR Management Plan (Ô¨Åscal 2015 to 2020) that includes environmental targets in Ô¨Åscal 2014. The plan was incorporated into CSR budget as concrete numerical targets for each Ô¨Åscal year and environmental activities have been steadily enhanced through implementation of the PDCA (plan-do-check-act) cycle at each organization. In May 2019, We have announced the Sumitomo Forestry Group 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan (Ô¨Åscal 2019 to 2021). As one of four basic policies, the Mid-Term CSR Management Plan (Ô¨Åscal 2015 to 2020) was revised to promote the integration of business and ESG eÔ¨Äorts in addition to the formulation of non-Ô¨Ånancial targets as Mid-Term Sustainability Targets. In the future, the Sumitomo Forestry Group will further enhance its environmental management in accordance with these goals.

In Ô¨Åscal 2019, 84 departments at 5 companies went under renewal and surveillance reviews for the ISO 14001: 2015 (JISQ 14001: 2015) standards. As a result of these reviews, eight incompatibilities and 96 points of advice for improvement were identiÔ¨Åed as matters to be observed. After reviewing report on the corrective measures taken to address the incompatibilities was examined, all of the entities were approved for renewal of registration on August 8, 2019. In addition to examining methods of improvement and taking action for each of the observation items, notices were issued by the Sustainability Department to share information on any issues common to the Group companies, and internal environmental audits were conducted to check the implementation of preventive measures. Internal Environmental Audits In addition to reviews conducted by external certiÔ¨Åcation bodies, companies covered by the ISO 14001 certiÔ¨Åcation periodically carry out internal environmental audits. These audits are implemented by employees who have passed an exam upon completion of an in-house training course taught by third-party instructors to become internal environmental auditors. Following the amendments of the international standards in September 2015, requiring these courses be taken and passed by all general managers within the scope of the registration in particular enhances understanding about the revisions to these standards and strengthens leadership. As a result, the number of employees certiÔ¨Åed as internal environmental auditors has reached a cumulative total of 1,297 (as of the end of Ô¨Åscal 2019). Internal environmental audits are in the Ô¨Åfth year since the update to the ISO14001:2015 standard. After a full audit of all the departments at Ô¨Åve Japanese companies within the scope of the registration, internal environmental audits were conducted at 108 departments from July 2019 to March 2020, following the audits conducted in Ô¨Åscal 2018 with emphasis on departments that had many points of improvement. When irregularities due to the amendments were found, the audited departments took corrective actions and subsequently submitted the action reports to the audit department. Audit results were reported to management by the General Manager of Sustainability Department and a review was conducted. Compliance and Violations of Environmental Laws There were no signiÔ¨Åcant violations* of any, environment-related laws or ordinances in the past Ô¨Åve years.

We also determined speciÔ¨Åc measures as evaluation metrics in each department for risk with the potential to arise in daily operations and report on the progress of those measures to the Risk Management Committee each quarter while the Sustainability Committee formulates measures for risk with the potential to arise in the medium to long term. Risks with the potential to high impact business are reported to the Board of Directors to discuss their countermeasures. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the Sustainability Committee invited instructors from outside the company to teach a Risk and Opportunity of ESG Investment and Corporate Strategy study session. This seminar discussed speciÔ¨Åc challenges related to mainly climate change such as amendments to SBT certiÔ¨Åcation standards and RE100 trends. Risk Management Framework Climate Change and Biodiversity-related Risks and Strategies Responding to Natural Disasters Damage from a major earthquake, windstorm, Ô¨Çood or other natural disaster could result in signiÔ¨Åcant costs arising from restoring operations at facilities, verifying the safety of delivered housing products, delays in the completion and handover of contracted properties, or other events. Such costs could inÔ¨Çuence the Group's operating results and Ô¨Ånancial position. As countermeasures, Sumitomo Forestry promotes the sale of homes built with highly seismic resistant BF construction method as well as the sale of resilience housing equipped with the functionality to sustain living for a certain period of time even if lifelines are cut. Furthermore, we are building a service framework that aims to provide rapid assistance through IoT technology that rapidly grasps the damage during a disaster in real time. HIGHLIGHT 2ÔºöBuilding homes that protect lives and lifestyles BF Method Housing Sales Adapted to Climate Change Responding to Changes in the Wood Cultivation and Procurement Regulations Because Sumitomo Forestry positions wood as its principal material and product, the risk of higher costs as well as the risk of having to change suppliers in the event of limitations being imposed due to the depletion of timber resources or changes to habitats resulting from climate change and the loss of biodiversity. Sumitomo Forestry imports timber and wood products from more than 20 diÔ¨Äerent countries and strives to place representatives in primary locations to collect information to mitigate the risk of changes in timber cultivation and timber procurement regulations. The company also makes eÔ¨Äorts to verify legal compliance, such as deploying employees from the head oÔ¨Éce. We work to procure legally harvested timber throughout the entire Group in accordance with the Clean Wood Act enacted in May 2017, such as becoming the Ô¨Årst company to register in Japan. Procurement Initiatives (Distribution Business) Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú291Ôºû Setting Carbon Pricing Such as Mandatory Emission Reductions As reduction of greenhouse gases advances globally, there is the possibility that reduction obligations will be imposed upon businesses in countries where the Sumitomo Forestry Group has bases. If Group companies with bases in these countries are unable to meet reduction obligations, they will be required to purchase emission credits, creating the risk of increased business costs. Even in Japan, carbon pricing has been implemented due to Tax for Climate change measures enforced in October 2012. Achieving targets outlined in the Paris Agreement could result in changes such as higher taxes and the adoption of new carbon taxes, which could inÔ¨Çuence business activities and costs. As a countermeasure, Sumitomo Forestry sets greenhouse gas reduction target for each Group company and department and pursues those reductions based on the numerical targets that are drafted each Ô¨Åscal year. Sustainability Targets of Our Group 2021 Mid-Term Management Plan and Material Issues Responding to Energy Supply Shortages In countries like New Zealand, where hydroelectric power is used, there is a risk that a change in the amount of rainfall will cause dam levels to fall and lead to a disruption of supply from hydroelectric power stations, forcing Sumitomo Forestry Group sites in those countries to suspend plant operations. As a countermeasure, Sumitomo Forestry sets greenhouse gas reduction targets for each Group company and department and promotes energy savings while pursuing those reductions based on the numerical targets that are drafted each Ô¨Åscal year. Corporate Image Deterioration Any failure in addressing various risks such as climate change measures and the preservation of biodiversity may be detrimental to the corporate image, directly aÔ¨Äecting sales and other performance indicators. Sumitomo Forestry comprehensively analyzes and addresses risks from environmental, social and governance perspectives in the short to medium and long term through the Risk Management Committee and Sustainability Committee. Risk Management Responding to Environmental Laws and Regulations The Sumitomo Forestry Group is striving to reduce and to prevent the manifestation of legal risks such as the disposal of industrial waste, soil and water pollution caused by toxic substances, noise and vibration. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, there were no signiÔ¨Åcant violations of any environment-related laws or regulations or any grave environmental incidents. Ôºú292Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Processing of Industrial Waste Construction-related waste makes up the highest percentage of industrial waste that is illegally dumped in Japan. Viewing the environmental risks presented by the processing of industrial waste as one of the biggest in terms of the potential impact on society and business, the Sumitomo Forestry Group works to ensure that industrial waste is disposed of appropriately. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, to comply with the Waste Management and Public Cleansing Act and other related laws and regulations, the Group has established a set of industrial waste management regulations covering appropriate disposal, reduction, recycling and reuse of industrial, as well as manufacturing regulations stipulating standards essential for production activities. In keeping with these regulations, voluntary audits of waste manifests and terms of outsourcing agreements with waste processors are carried out twice a year for each Group company oÔ¨Éce in Japan emitting industrial waste. If an audit concludes that corrective action is required, appropriate action is taken and it is subsequently conÔ¨Årmed through reports submitted in line with the industrial waste management system that waste is being properly treated. In addition, industrial waste managers at each oÔ¨Éce conduct site checks of contractors' waste treatment plants at least once a year. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, managers from the Housing and Construction Division conducted approximately 639 on-site checks at roughly 550 waste treatment plants run by 335 waste treatment contractors. Divisions other than the Housing and Construction Division as well as oÔ¨Éces of Group companies are being instructed to continue using waste treatment plants which the Housing Division has already inspected. To be able to determine whether industrial waste is being processed in an appropriate manner, the Group asks waste treatment contractors to employ electronic manifests. All branches of the Housing and Construction Division as well as all contractors accepting industrial waste from new housing construction sites have already introduced electronic manifests. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, 99.7% of all manifests, including those for housing demolition waste, were electronic. In conjunction with this, training is also provided for employees who coordinate the processing of industrial waste. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, a total of 18 people participated, including newly appointed personnel in charge of industrial waste processing at Group companies in Japan. Moreover, training was conducted in the same way for building contractors, demolition contractors and industrial waste disposal operators. Furthermore, in April 2020, the Sumitomo Forestry Group created an e-learning program on basic waste management to teach the fundamentals of industrial waste management and built a system for employees to undergo this curriculum via the intranet. Promotion of Waste Reduction and Recycling Soil Contamination Soil contamination is diÔ¨Écult to discover as contaminants build up and spread underground out of sight. The Sumitomo Forestry Group implements soil contamination countermeasures for land owned or administered by the Group and conducts voluntary soil contamination studies prior to new land purchases in the subdivision business. We are in compliance on land applicable to the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act. Water Pollution Water pollution creates the risks of human health being directly aÔ¨Äected by contamination of drinking water and of contamination aÔ¨Äecting the habitats of organisms living in rivers, lakes and seas. Inspections entrusted to external measurement agencies are conducted once every two months and daily water quality tests are done internally through automatic COD measurement devices for the waste water expelled from waste water processing facilities in the Sumitomo Forestry Crest Imari Plant, which is a speciÔ¨Åed oÔ¨Éce under the amended Water Pollution Control Act of Japan, and the inspection results are issued to the local municipals every six months. Water is also sampled and inspected by the prefecture once a year and by the city three times a year. Through this measure, all inspections found the level of water pollution to be within the statutory limit for wastewater. In addition, the Tsukuba Research Institute is considered a speciÔ¨Åed oÔ¨Éce under the amended Water Pollution Control Act of Japan and therefore, delivers notiÔ¨Åcation of updates to some testing equipment and new installations according to this law. The Institute also conducts water quality inspections once every month through an external measurement agency to monitor those results and issue reports to Tsukuba City once every six months. Management of Hazardous Chemical Substances and Appropriate Disposal Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú293Ôºû Contamination by Hazardous Chemical Substances Contamination caused by hazardous chemical substances leads to risks of a major impact on human health or the environment and the risk of a disaster. The Sumitomo Forestry Group keeps track of amounts of hazardous chemical substances including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used and discharged as part of appropriate management, meanwhile making an eÔ¨Äort to reduce the use of these chemicals. The Group takes appropriate action in response to the Air Pollution Control Act. Sumitomo Forestry Crest's Niihama Plant equipped with boilers and Kagoshima and Shizuoka plants equipped with incinerator make regular measurements of emission volumes and concentrations of NOx, SOx and soot and dust, and dioxins, respectively, and monitor that these Ô¨Ågures are maintained below the statutory limits. Management of Hazardous Chemical Substances and Appropriate Disposal Noise and Vibrations Sumitomo Forestry makes an eÔ¨Äort to prevent noise and vibrations during housing construction. When complaints about noise or vibrations are received, the circumstances are recorded and the information is shared with the rest of Group to prevent the occurrence of similar incidents. Sumitomo Forestry Crest conÔ¨Årms that noise levels within the site boundaries of plants are below the statutory limit by taking regular measurements. No complaints about noise or vibrations having a major impact on the environment were received from local residents during Ô¨Åscal 2019. Global Warming (Addressing the Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbons) In April 2015, the Fluorocarbons Recovery and Destruction Law came into force for the purpose of promoting drastic measures over the entire lifecycle of chloroÔ¨Çuorocarbons that have a strong greenhouse eÔ¨Äect, from manufacture to disposal. Since April 2020, regulation based on the law have been further strengthened, and the Group has taken steps to disseminate the details and take appropriate measures. In most cases, the Sumitomo Forestry Group leases its oÔ¨Éces in buildings, and since the Group is primarily engaged in the construction and sale of housing and the manufacture and distribution of processed wood products, it does not own (or manage) that much commercial refrigeration and air conditioning equipment (air-conditioners, refrigerators, etc.). However, in response to the enactment of this law, we are conducting periodic simple inspections of the same equipment that is using Ô¨Çuorocarbons as a coolant as well as executing legal and periodic inspections for devices with compressors that have 7.5kW or higher rated output. Furthermore, Sumitomo Forestry promotes the transition to products that do not use Ô¨Çuorocarbons in accordance with the Law on Promoting Green Purchasing when replacing existing equipment or purchasing new equipment.

The TCFD requires the disclosure of information on four aspects of climate change risks and opportunities: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. In particular, strategic aspects recommend disclosure about strategic resilience according to investigations conducted according to future climate scenarios. Sumitomo Forestry Group has undertaken this as one of its agenda items, recognized the risks associated with climate change as serious risks, and announced its support to the TCFD in July 2018. Based on the TCFD recommendations, scenario analysis was begun the same year. In the initial scenario analysis, the timber and building materials, and the housing and construction businessÃ∂ core businesses of Sumitomo ForestryÃ∂examined the circumstances in 2030 according to two scenarios anticipating the global average temperature rising by two degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius compared to temperatures before the industrial revolution. These Ô¨Åndings were reported to the Sustainability Committee and Board of Directors. In addition, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has set targets in the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets for further initiatives in the future based on the scenario analyses. Material Issue 5: Corporate Ethics and Governance Structures Governance Related to the Issue of Climate Change The Sumitomo Forestry Group will promote the response to issue of climate change centered on the Sustainability Committee, similarly as other ESG challenges. The Sustainability Committee, chaired by the President and composed of members made up of executive oÔ¨Écers, directors and each divisional manager, formulates and promotes initiatives for medium to long-term ESG challenges related to the sustainability of the Sumitomo Forestry Group in addition to analyzing risks and opportunities, conducting progress management of the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, which incorporate business strategies toward achieving the SDGs, including monitoring of implementation and eÔ¨Äectiveness of the Our Values and Code of Conduct. The content of all committee proceedings is reported to the Board of Directors. Sustainability Committee Risk Management Framework Identifying and Evaluating Risks and Opportunities In business operations in which we position wood as our principal material and product, a major transitional business risk that we face is the increase in timber procurement costs associated with stricter regulations such as forest protection policies and logging regulations. Examples of physical risks include the increased costs associated with delayed construction processes and decreased eÔ¨Éciency of housing construction caused by increasingly intense natural disasters and the impact of abnormal weather involving temperature rises. At the same time, the advance of regulations against fossil fuels provide a boost (opportunities) for our biomass energy generation operations business and demand for fuels made from wood chips. Our corporate headquarters has worked with each division in these scenario analyses to identify risks and opportunities and to evaluate the impact mainly from Ô¨Ånancial aspects. We discussed measures to prevent risks with respect to the items identiÔ¨Åed as material risks and opportunities, and reported them to the Sustainability Committee and the Board of Directors. Moving forward, we will increase the accuracy of our scenario analyses and discuss how to reÔ¨Çect them in our business planning, while moving forward with the creation of business strategies for the resilience that will see us through into an uncertain future.

The Sumitomo Forestry Group has announced the formulation of SBTi* and set new greenhouse gas reduction targets for the entire Group in June 2017 and was certiÔ¨Åed as SBT in July 2018. Its progress and results are explained below. 1. Scope 1&2: 21% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 2017 (base year) by 2030. 2. Scope 3: 16% reduction of total greenhouse gas emissions from Category 1 and Category 11 compared to 2017 (base year) by 2030. Sumitomo Forestry Group will further strengthen its energy-saving activities, promote use of renewable energy, and other initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change based on the SBT. * The SBTi was established in 2015 as a collaboration of four organizations CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), the UN Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi deÔ¨Ånes and promotes best practice in science-based target setting, to help companies determine a pathway for reducing their emissions in line with what is required to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial temperatures. In Japan, the Ministry of the Environment has translated this in Japanese as ‚ÄúCorporate 2¬∞C Target and is supporting company eÔ¨Äorts. Toward to SBT CertiÔ¨Åcation Goals In July 2018, the Sumitomo Forestry Group greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets have been oÔ¨Écially approved by international SBT initiative (SBTi).

Material Issue 3: The Reduction of the Environmental Impact of Our Business Activities Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú309Ôºû Aiming for 100% Renewable Energy and Joining the RE100 The Sumitomo Forestry Group positions reduction of environmental impact of our business activities as one material issue that needs to be addressed and strives to engage in energy-saving activities and use of renewable energy. As part of these initiatives, we joined the international RE100* initiative that aims for 100% of electricity used to be from renewable energy in March 2020 to accelerate our eÔ¨Äorts to reduce greenhouse gases. By 2040, we aim to utilize 100% renewable energy for the electricity used for our Group business activities and for the fuel for our power generation operations. Sumitomo Forestry Group ºs implementation of renewable energy includes solar power generation panels installed at our housing exhibition sites and generated power for our own use (including an adjacent wood fuel chip factory) from our biomass power generation sites. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, renewable energy accounted for about 16% of our total group electricity usage. The biomass fuel accounted for about 87% on our power generation business fuel usage. To accelerate the implementation of renewable energy, we plan to have each business division set its own targets and tackle the issue as a company-wide initiative. For Sumitomo Forestry Group to achieve 100% renewable energy for the electricity for our operations, we are utilizing Sumirin Denki, a service where we purchase surplus power as well as supply electricity generated from solar power systems of Sumitomo Forestry home houses. We are also considering installing solar power generation systems in our factories both in Japan and overseas. Furthermore, we will consider a diverse range of procurement methods that take advantage of programs in each country we operate. Sumitomo Forestry Group will continue to proactively utilize renewable energies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the realization of a sustainable society. * RE100 is an international initiative run jointly by The Climate Group, a global environmental NGO, and the CDP. 32 companies in Japan are part of the 229 companies worldwide who are RE100 members as of March 25, 2020. HIGHLIGHT 5: Aiming for 100% Renewable Energies by 2040 Ôºú310Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Greenhouse Gas Emissions per Scope Based on the GHG Protocol Since Ô¨Åscal 2012, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has ascertained the volume of its CO2 emissions according to diÔ¨Äerent scopes* based on the GHG Protocol, a set of widely used international accounting tools for quantifying GHG emissions. In view of the increasing demand of renewable energy in recent years, the Sumitomo Forestry Group entered the biomass power generation business in 2011 and has begun operation of Okhotsk Bio Energy in December 2016 as a consolidated subsidiary. This power plant uses coal as supplemental fuel for smooth operation and maintenance while using unused wood resources as the primary fuel. Therefore, the total CO2 emissions in Scope 1 and 2 in Ô¨Åscal 2019 for the Sumitomo Forestry Group were 380,641t-CO2e, up 2.9% compared to Ô¨Åscal 2017. In addition, when looking by business, our plants in Japan and the power generation business make up 57.0% while our plants overseas compose 28.5%. We started to calculate Scope 3 in Ô¨Åscal 2013 and the targets for this calculation largely expanded in Ô¨Åscal 2015 and Ô¨Åscal 2017. Among these results, the impact in category 11, ‚Äúemissions during use of detached houses sold,‚Äù is acknowledged to be a major factor, and the increase in residential and construction operations in Ô¨Åscal 2020 of Net Zero Energy House (ZEH) projects is expected to reduce CO2 emissions volumes while the homes are in use. In the future, we will work to meet targets via SBT in an eÔ¨Äort to take greenhouse gas emissions reduction to another level. * The GHG Protocol requires businesses to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions according to the following categories Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions of a company, including emissions from fuel consumption. E.g. CO2 emissions from the use of gasoline for company vehicles. Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity and heating. E.g. CO2 emissions from the use of electricity by oÔ¨Éces. Scope 3: GHG emissions occurring in the supply chain. E.g. CO2 emissions generated during the use of products sold.

Boundaries and Methods of CO2 Emissions Calculation Energy Consumption from Business Activities The Sumitomo Forestry Group consumed 2,903,124MWh* of energy in Ô¨Åscal 2019. The energy consumption of the Group increased during Ô¨Åscal 2016 to 2017 due to the start of trail and full-Ô¨Çedge operations of the Mombetsu Biomass Power Generation and Hachinohe Biomass Power Generation Businesses. The start of full operations at the Hachinohe Biomass Power Generation Plant in April 2018 stopped a dramatic amount of the rise in energy consumption, but this power consumption declined 3.7% in Ô¨Åscal 2019 compared to the previous Ô¨Åscal year. The energy consumption in business other than the power generation business has declined by various energy-saving activities. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, total renewable energy accounted for about 72% of our group energy usage. * The Balance of Input & Output is calculated according to the TJ unit based on the Environmental Reporting Guidelines issued by the Ministry of the Environment. Both are equivalently calculated for the amount of energy consumption.

About symbol for Independent assurance Reducing CO2 Emissions from OÔ¨Éces All business sites of Group companies in Japan are advancing the introduction of fuel-eÔ¨Écient vehicles to make 547 of the 616 company-owned vehicles introduced during Ô¨Åscal 2019 fuel-eÔ¨Écient vehicles (for an 88.8% adoption rate of fuel-eÔ¨Écient vehicles). In addition, the Group has encouraged employees who drive on the job at oÔ¨Éces and business sites of Group companies in Japan to participate in the Eco Training course run by the Japan Automobile Federation (JAF). The Group has also worked to reduce power consumption. In the Housing and Construction Division, power consumption has been reduced by moving to a ‚Äúfree address‚Äù oÔ¨Éce system (where personnel are not assigned to Ô¨Åxed desks) to make more eÔ¨Écient use of oÔ¨Éce space. In addition, the division has also proceeded to install solar power generation systems and LED lighting at its model homes and other business sites. The Group will continue to reduce CO2 emissions by such means as reducing prolonged working hours and raising awareness among employees. Reducing CO2 Emissions Outside OÔ¨Éces To address CO2 emissions collectively, the Group set Sumitomo Forestry Crest, manufacturing plants of Agro-Products Division of Sumitomo Forestry Landscaping, as well as power generation businesses, the Tsukuba Research Institute, the Tokyo Metropolitan Area Recycling Center, Sumirin Fill Care, Kawanokita Development, and Japan Bio Energy as domestic non-oÔ¨Éce category constituents, as well as overseas manufacturing plants of RPI, ASTI, KTI, VECO, NPIL, SRP, and CCC in addition to OBT as overseas non-oÔ¨Éce category constituents with their respective reduction targets. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the start of full operations at Hachinohe Biomass Power Generation caused an increase of 2.0% compared to Ô¨Åscal 2017, which is the base year. Ôºú316Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Reducing CO2 Emissions from Transportation Under the revised Act on the Rational Use of Energy in Japan, consigners*1 are required to reduce per-unit energy consumption by an annual average of 1% or more in the medium to long term in relation to the transportation of goods. Sumitomo Forestry and Sumitomo Forestry Crest fall under the category of ‚ÄúspeciÔ¨Åed consigner‚Äù (annual freight transportation volume is 30 million ton-km*2 or more), obligating them to submit reports to the Japanese Government. Sumitomo Forestry therefore sets a target each Ô¨Åscal year to reduce per-unit energy consumption*3 in transportation by 1%or more compared to the previous year. Sumitomo Forestry Crest also sets targets to reduce per-unit energy consumption compared to the previous year. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, Sumitomo Forestry's per-unit energy consumption was 99.7% compared to the previous year and Sumitomo Forestry Crest's was 98.9%. Ongoing eÔ¨Äorts will be made to reduce CO2 emissions through cooperation with transportation partners on such measures as improving loading eÔ¨Éciency, shifting from land to sea transportation, and utilizing the return leg of construction material deliveries to transport waste. *1 Cosigners as deÔ¨Åned in the Act on the Rational Use of Energy in Japan is someone who transports cargo to carriers for our businesses *2 Freight transportation volume (ton-kilometers) = freight weight (tons) √ó distance travelled (km) *3 Sumitomo Forestry measures energy consumption per unit of volume handled.

The Mid-Term Sustainability Targets announced in May 2019 set targets for protecting resources, reducing the emission of waste and achieving zero emissions. In addition to the recycling rate, we have also set a target for the absolute amount of Ô¨Ånal disposal and are further strengthening the management system. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, overall Sumitomo Forestry Group emissions volume was down 2.4% compared to the previous year. The amount of Ô¨Ånal disposal achieved our target of 58,860 ton with a result of 55,515 tons. This was a 2.0% reduction compared to the previous Ô¨Åscal year. We will continue to strive to eÔ¨Äectively use resources in the future. Trends in Waste Generated and Recycling Rate Over the Last Five Years * Data for Alpine MDF Industries Ltd.

About symbol for Independent assurance Initiatives to Achieve Zero Emissions The Sumitomo Forestry Group has deÔ¨Åned ‚ÄúZero emissions‚Äù as no incineration or landÔ¨Åll of industrial waste (recycling rate of 98% or more) generated by domestic manufacturing facilities and new housing construction sites. Based on this deÔ¨Ånition, domestic manufacturing facilities achieved zero emissions in Ô¨Åscal 2009. As for new housing construction sites, including exterior landscaping, the Group achieved zero emissions in the Tokyo metropolitan area in Ô¨Åscal 2012. Since Ô¨Åscal 2015, the Group has been adhering to the former Mid-Term CSR Management Plan with its target year of Ô¨Åscal 2020 while continuously working towards zero emissions. From Ô¨Åscal 2019, we are working to achieve zero emissions in keeping with the new Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, with a target year of Ô¨Åscal 2021. In addition to the recycling rate, the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets set a target of 15% reduction in the amount of Ô¨Ånal disposal throughout the entire Sumitomo Forestry Group compared to Ô¨Åscal 2017, and we worked toward zero emissions. Furthermore, within the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, we take factors such as the state of progress of business activities and the resulting waste generation into account, establishing the following seven categories for a more Ô¨Ånely diÔ¨Äerentiated eÔ¨Äort to achieve zero emissions than in the Mid-Term CSR Management Plan. These categories are: New Housing Construction Sites, Domestic Production Plants, Power Generation Business, Renovation Business, Lifestyle Service Business, Overseas Manufacturing Plants, and Demolition Work sites. Material Issue 3: The Reduction of the Environmental Impact of Our Business Activities Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú321Ôºû EÔ¨Äorts at New Housing Construction Sites We work to reduce waste generated at Sumitomo Forestry's new housing construction sites. At monthly meetings of our Waste Reduction Working Group, leaders of sub-groups raise and share issues while managing progress toward meeting targets. EÔ¨Äorts to reduce waste have included the use of the bare minimum necessary packaging materials and reusable protective material for Ô¨Çooring. We engaged in initiatives that aimed to achieve the 98% recycling rate set by the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets, which was 94.3% against our target of 96.1% for Ô¨Åscal 2019. In the future, we will strive to further reduce waste emissions and improve our recycling rate through precuts of roof slate and external wall siding. In the Tokyo metropolitan area, the Company obtained inter-region recovery and recycling certiÔ¨Åcation, whereupon we established the Metropolitan Area Recycling Center, and implemented streamlined sorting of waste. Since Ô¨Åscal 2018, new housing construction site waste processing operations expanded areas covered by the inter-region recovery and recycling certiÔ¨Åcation are promoting a higher recycling rate.

Ôºú338Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Project for Soil PuriÔ¨Åcation Technology and Environmental Remediation Aided by Plants An issue in re-using the site of an old factory is the environmental impact associated with soil contamination and the cost burden of any remedial measures. For example, under the revised Fire Service Act of Japan, gasoline stations are now obliged to repair any underground tanks that have lain under the ground for more than 40 years, and as a consequence of this, it is expected that between 1,000 and 2,000 stations will close down each year. In order to meet the demand for environmental remediation and measures dealing with soil contamination, the Sumitomo Forestry Group has been working on cleansing Grass laid on the site where a contaminated soil by using the functions of plants (phytoremediation). As part of this, gasoline station once stood during Ô¨Åscal 2012, in collaboration with ENEOS (JX Nippon Oil & Energy Corporation at the time), the Group developed a method for purifying soil contaminated with oil using Burning Field, a variety of Japanese lawn-grass independently registered by the Group. One of the functions possessed by the variety of Japanese lawn-grass used in this method is that the nutrients transpiring from its roots activate microorganisms in the soil, and the upshot of this is that it has the potential to inexpensively reduce the oil content in polluted soil. This method has been adopted at nine sites so far to purify areas where gasoline stands or oil depots once stood, with puriÔ¨Åcation at Ô¨Åve sites now complete. In Ô¨Åscal 2013 and 2014, the Ministry of the Environment conducted a study on low-cost, low-impact technologies for surveying and for counteracting contaminated soil in addition to presenting the Environmental Measures Exemplary EÔ¨Äorts Awards (Minister of the Environment Award) in 2013. The study found that oil-degrading microorganisms tend to become more active, and were recognized as having potential to be applied at sites heavily contaminated with oil. Received the Good Design Award in October 2018 from the Japan Institute of Design Promotion. Moving forward, by steadily producing results in soil puriÔ¨Åcation based on this technique, the Group will continue to help resolve the nationwide problem of oil contamination. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú339Ôºû Policies and Targets for Biodiversity Conservation Declaration of Biodiversity and Biodiversity Action Guidelines Sumitomo Forestry established its policy on Biodiversity Conservation in Company-owned Forests in Japan in Ô¨Åscal 2006, and its Timber Procurement Philosophy and Policy in Ô¨Åscal 2007. The Company also revised its Environmental Policies in Ô¨Åscal 2007 to incorporate biodiversity considerations. Then in March 2012, the Sumitomo Forestry Group established its Declaration of Biodiversity, setting out the Sumitomo Forestry Group's understanding of and stance on biodiversity; Biodiversity Action Guidelines, specifying an internal set of guidelines; and Biodiversity Long-Term Targets as speciÔ¨Åc goals of activity. In July 2015, the Group initiated the Sumitomo Forestry Group Environmental Policy, bringing together the Environmental Philosophy, the Environmental Policies*, the Sumitomo Forestry Group Declaration of Biodiversity, and the Sumitomo Forestry Group's Biodiversity Action Guidelines. Therefore, the eÔ¨Äorts in biodiversity are also operated based on the policies integrated in the Sumitomo Forestry Group Environmental Policy. * The Sumitomo Forestry Group formulated the Environmental Philosophy in 1994 and the Environmental Policies in 2000. Sumitomo Forestry Group Environmental Policy Long-Term Biodiversity Targets As well as advancing biodiversity conservation initiatives, the Group established its Long-Term Biodiversity Targets in March 2012 as a way of contributing to the international community in respect to attainment of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets adopted at the Conference of Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP10) in 2010. Rough schedules for achieving each of the longterm targets were put in place covering the period up until 2020 and serve as a guideline for advancing initiatives. The Sumitomo Forestry Group's Long-term Biodiversity Targets (summary) Group-wide Targets 1. (Aim to achieve sustainable forests) In all timber-related businesses, from upstream to downstream, we will work to prevent a reduction in forest areas and pursue forest sustainability. We will strive to regenerate forests through reforestation and natural regeneration and logging a planned, sustainable manner that takes into account the forest's ability to grow. We will increase the procurement and use of sustainable timber, such as forest certiÔ¨Åed timber, plantation forest timber and Japanese timber. We will promote the eÔ¨Écient use as well as the recycling and reuse of timber. 2. (Increase the amount of CO2 absorbed by and sequestered in forests and timber) By cultivating healthy forests and promoting the use of timber through the greater use of timber construction materials and the construction of wooden buildings, we will strive to increase the amount of CO2 absorbed by and sequestered in forests and timber to contribute to the protection of biodiversity and the alleviation of climate change. Individual targets 3. (Forests) We will promote forest management that regenerates, maintains and increases biodiversity. We will carry out zoning to protect ecosystems and the habitats of living creatures. We will ensure that in terms of area, 20% or more of our Company-owned forests in Japan are environment forests that emphasize environmental protection. We will maintain that 100% Company-owned forests remain forest-certiÔ¨Åed. Ôºú340Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 We will maintain and increase biodiversity at our operation sites based on results of our biodiversity monitoring of Company-owned forests in Japan. We will conduct operations at plantation forests overseas while considering how best to contribute to local communities, economies and education. 4. (Products) We will provide products and services that take into account biodiversity, such as forest-certiÔ¨Åcation and products and services that have undergone environmental assessment. 5. (Construction) We will work to develop homes and communities that are in harmony with the natural environment and their surrounding urban landscapes. 6. (Design) We will manage and minimize the generation of waste by promoting a zero-emissions policy in building and construction. 7. (Greening) We will be considerate to the surrounding ecosystems and tree species and actively cultivate native species. 8. (Plants) We will manage and minimize pollutants, waste and noise, and reduce their impact on biodiversity. 9. (Public relations) We will actively communicate the importance of biodiversity to all stakeholders, including customers, business partners, and local communities. 10. (Research) We will gather the latest information and develop conservation technologies to implement biodiversity initiatives. 11. (Social contribution) We will protect trees that are historically and culturally important and also preserve their genetic material. Company Structure for Biodiversity Conservation In accordance with our environmental management structure, the Representative Director and President is the person in charge of Sumitomo Forestry Group's biodiversity conservation initiatives, and the Executive OÔ¨Écer in charge of the Sustainability and the General Manager of the Sustainability Department manage Sumitomo Forestry Group company activities. Commitment to Protected Areas To manufacture and secure timber resources, Sumitomo Forestry owns or manages many forests both in Japan and overseas. None of these forests is located in areas designated as world heritage sites. Furthermore, we have not and will not operate in areas designated as world natural heritage sites. Regardless of land ownership, national parks in Japan, which has a small land area, operate under the Regional Natural Park System and many national parks include private property. A portion of Sumitomo Forestry's Company-owned forests are located inside national park areas, and as is the case for other areas designated as protected forests or other, we operate in strict compliance with all legal regulations. Furthermore, in terms of risk assessment, in areas determined to be important from a biodiversity perspective, we not only strictly adhere to all legal regulations, also work to mitigate our impact through reevaluation, minimization, revitalization, oÔ¨Äsetting and other eÔ¨Äorts. We manage approximately 48,000 hectares of Company-owned forests in Japan and approximately 230,000 hectares of forests overseas. These managed forests are categorized as environmental forests, commercial forests and other. Both in Japan and overseas, a nature conservation area is created according to its categorization as an environmental forest or protected forest and operations in such areas are not permitted in principle. However, the borders of these lands set by the government do not always match the boundaries of the ecosystem. AÔ¨Éliated companies PT. Wana Subur Lestari (WSL) and PT. Mayangkara Tanaman Industri (MTI) conducted thorough animal and plant surveys that included conservation forest neighboring areas under governmental management before deÔ¨Åning preservation areas and business areas. WSL and MTI also worked with local organizations to build a conservation network that deÔ¨Ånes a net of green corridors to prevent closed oÔ¨Ä islands which would isolate the regions where orangutans, long-nose monkeys and other Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú341Ôºû rare Ô¨Çora and fauna live. These protected areas account for over 20% of our operating land, higher than the 17% goal for protected regions set out in the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Evaluation of Stakeholder Initiatives The concept and speciÔ¨Åc initiatives of the conservation network advocated by WSL and MTI have attracted attention both in Japan and overseas as unprecedented eÔ¨Äorts worldwide. At the Indonesian Pavilion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP25) held in Madrid, Spain in 2019, representatives from international organizations, researchers, and non-proÔ¨Åt organizations highly praised our presentation of these initiatives as a representative of private organization. In addition, in our urban greening business, we obtain third-party evaluations by actively encouraging our customers to register for ‚ÄúIkimono Kyozon Jigyousho‚Äù certiÔ¨Åcation set by the Association for Business Innovation in Harmony with Nature and Community (ABINC) or the Social and Environmental Green Evaluation System (SEGES) green certiÔ¨Åcation implemented by the Organization for Landscape and Urban Green Infrastructure. Support of Related Initiatives and Cooperation with Organizations Sumitomo Forestry participates in many organizations that are actively involved in biodiversity conservation. The chairman of Sumitomo Forestry serves as vice chairman of the Keidanren Committee on Nature Conservation, made up of Keidanren member companies. In addition, employees are temporarily assigned to serve as secretariat members* and committee members are dispatched to the planning task force, which is in charge of operations. We also participate in the Japan Business Initiative for Biodiversity (JBIB), made up of companies passionate about biodiversity, and conduct joint research on corporate biodiversity initiatives in subcommittee meetings. In the Double 20 Project in Japan to achieve the targets for Aichi, we have registered three projects as of June 2016; The Sumitomo Forestry Group's Biodiversity Long-term Targets, Sumitomo Forestry-owned Forest Operations Friendly to Biodiversity, and the Environmental Education Program at Mt. Fuji Manabi no Mori Project. These three projects are highly praised for many reasons that include the creation of many independent links, content with a great impact that utilizes the features of the company in its eÔ¨Äorts and for the ripple eÔ¨Äects to related industries that can be expected thanks to the relationship outlined with Aichi targets. In March 2017, these projects were bundled and recognized as a business tie-up with the Japan Committee for United Nations Development Business (UNDB-J; 10th). Sumitomo Forestry Landscaping Co., Ltd. is actively striving toward the registration of certiÔ¨Åcations in the JBIB Guidelines for Sustainable Business Sites promoted by the Association for Business Innovation in harmony with Nature and Community (ABINC) and the SEGES Green CertiÔ¨Åcation promoted by the Organization for Landscape and urban Green Infrastructure for properties undertaken with the environmental greening business. Moreover, the Chief Corporate Advisor of Sumitomo Forestry acts as the chairman of the Organization for Landscape and Urban Green Infrastructure. * Initiatives implemented up to Ô¨Åscal 2019. Sumitomo Forestry Group biodiversity conservations activities have been certiÔ¨Åed as an aÔ¨Éliated operation of the Japan Committee for United Nations Development Business (UNDB-J) (in Japanese) Japan Business Initiative for Biodiversity (JBIB) Participation in Drafting the Guidelines for Private Sector Engagement in Biodiversity The Ministry of the Environment drafted the Guidelines for Private Sector Engagement in Biodiversity (Ver. 1) in 2009 for business proprietors as a means to advance biodiversity conservation and sustainable use with recognition that corporate activities play a vital role in those eÔ¨Äorts. Sumitomo Forestry was involved in drafting these guidelines as a member of the investigative committee. The Guidelines for Private Sector Engagement in Biodiversity brings together basic information and approaches necessary to conserve biodiversity and reduce loss in a way that is easy for private sector organizations not yet addressing biodiversity issues to understand while also oÔ¨Äering a means for business proprietors already engaged in eÔ¨Äorts to play an even more eÔ¨Äective role. In December 2017, the second version was released in light of growing interests and expectations about conserving biodiversity driven by the SDGs and other international targets. These guidelines presented the sustainable timber procurement of Sumitomo Forestry as one excellent example initiative. Ôºú342Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Biodiversity Conservation in Company-Owned Forests in Japan and Plantation Forests Overseas Biodiversity Conservation in Company-Owned Forests in Japan The Policy on Biodiversity Conservation for Company-owned forests in Japan calls for eÔ¨Äorts to promote diversity of ecosystems through proper management of protected areas and consideration toward the continuity of forests, diversity of species through protection of rare Ô¨Çora and fauna, and genetic diversity through the maintenance of populations. In keeping with these policies, forests are subject to appropriate zoning and management according to certain criteria, such as the increment of trees. Sumitomo Forestry is also making eÔ¨Äorts to create endangered species lists and manuals and conduct monitoring surveys of wildlife. Policy on Biodiversity Conservation in Company-Owned Forests in Japan(Excerpt) (Formulated June 2006) 1. Diversity of ecosystems We will properly manage strictly protected areas designated under the Natural Parks Law of the Japanese government and other legislation in a manner stipulated by the law. In other areas, we will ensure continuity of forests by limiting the area of forest harvested, particularly when clear cutting is conducted. 2. Diversity of species We will work to prevent a decline in the number of species existing in natural forests by refraining from expansive planting projects and other extreme activities involving the replacement of species that would have a major impact on existing ecosystems. We will also give the utmost consideration to the protection of rare Ô¨Çora and fauna in all operations, making reference to the Sumitomo Forestry Red Data Book. 3. Genetic diversity Genetic variation and the maintenance of populations to support them will become issues in the future. However, analysis is complicated and therefore we will closely watch monitoring activities carried out by government and public institutions and their Ô¨Åndings. Red Data Book and Riparian Forest Management Manual Sumitomo Forestry creates a Sumitomo Forestry Red Data Book listing Ô¨Çora and fauna at threat of extinction which may exist in Company-owned forests and distributes it to employees and contractors involved in forest management. By carrying the book with them during operations, personnel can refer to the opinions of specialists when they come across Ô¨Çora and fauna included in the book and take action. While using the latest version of this book today, we will continually advance measures focused on biodiversity and update the content of the text as necessary. The Company has also created the Riparian Forest Management Manual to ensure the Sumitomo Forestry Red Data Book appropriate management and preservation of areas around bodies of water that are rich in biodiversity. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú343Ôºû Wildlife Monitoring Surveys Sumitomo Forestry monitored wildlife inhabiting Company-owned forests. Every year, surveys are conducted in one of four areas Ã∂ Mombetsu (Hokkaido), Niihama (Shikoku), Hyuga (Kyushu) and Hyogo/Mie (Honshu). Data for each area is therefore accumulated in four-year cycles. This is used to create basic reference materials relating to biodiversity and to ascertain the impact of forestry on the surrounding environment over the long-term. Monitoring surveys conduct nine times up until now have clearly shown diverse life being maintained through the production of a habitat environment and a change in the number of mammals and birds during the gradually transition from a clear-cut area to forest. While a number of species decline temporarily, the clear-cut areas have been shown to distribute places suitable for umbrella species such as hawks and land appropriate for hunting in a mosaic shape in addition to realizing a favorable environment for life such as the species above to thrive. In the future, we will consider monitoring results to date as we work to properly sustain functions such as maintaining environmental conservation and biodiversity in company-owned forests.

The Sumitomo Forestry Group identiÔ¨Åes the living conditions and moving patterns of the deer in company-owned forests and mitigates damage to seedlings to encourage forest growth by trapping and ridding the deer in order to ensure proper forest management. Properly controlling the deer population contributes to comprehensive forest management of next generation through promotion of forest growth, biodiversity conservation by sustaining diverse vegetation on the forest Ô¨Çoor, and prevention of local disasters by preventing soil runoÔ¨Ä. Biodiversity Conservation in Plantation Forests Overseas More than half of living species throughout the world live in rainforests, which are said to be the treasure troves of life. However, rainforests are slowly disappearing today due to a variety of issues from disordered development and illegal logging to forest Ô¨Åres. Sumitomo Forestry Group aÔ¨Éliated companies PT. Wana Subur Lestari and PT. Mayangkara Tanaman Industri conduct industrial forestation operations in the West Kalimantan province of Indonesia with the aim to balance biodiversity and economic interests. After thorough animal and plant surveys, the companies formulate a land use plan that appropriately divides protected zones from plantation zones. Protected zones are subject to regular animal surveys and in addition to population monitoring of orangutans and Proboscis monkeys, which are rare animals, studies are conducted on fruit-bearing trees, their source of food. In addition, we consult with neighboring companies to construct a conservation network of mesh-shaped green corridors to ensure that habitats do not become isolated. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, a camera trap set up inside the protected area photographed for the Ô¨Årst time an orangutan mother and baby, providing evidence that the orangutan population inside the operation site was increasing. Conservation networks, which the Company advocates, are a new concept that is gaining attention both in Japan and overseas. At the Indonesia Pavilion at the 25th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP25) held in 2019, we were the only private company representative to give a presentation, which won high acclaim. We not only work to conserve ecosystems on land but also check the water quality of rivers Ô¨Çowing through the plantation and survey marine life of rainforest peatlands. In the future, the Sumitomo Forestry Group will further strive to engage in biodiversity conservation from the standpoint of a private organization and economically-viable, sustainable business searching for greater harmony between the global environment and local communities. Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Ôºú345Ôºû Conservation Network Ôºú346Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 EÔ¨Écient Use of Water Resources Reduction of Water Consumption in Business Activities Around the world, there is a growing sense of crisis over water shortages. It is expected that this problem will become more and more urgent as the demand for water rises with population increase and economic growth in developing countries. The primary businesses of the Sumitomo Forestry Group include the Timber & Building Materials Business and the Housing Business, which operate on a business model that does not use high-volume of water. However, our businesses are expanding into sectors that do use water as a valuable resource. Our policy is to reduce the amount of water used with emphasis on these businesses while conducting risk assessments and examining countermeasures for problems that arise. In addition to manufacturing plants inside and outside Japan, since Ô¨Åscal 2012, the Sumitomo Forestry Group began examining the consumption of water and the associated sources at bases where actual water usage is measurable, such as at buildings owned by the Sumitomo Forestry Group. In Ô¨Åscal 2017, we discovered 91.8% of water use is at eight group companies which make up 7.2% of the consolidated net sales by analyzing the water use of all Group companies in Ô¨Åscal 2016. Therefore, we have positioned these eight companies as important water management companies and conducted risk assessments for water use at Ô¨Åve companies in Japan as well as brought together speciÔ¨Åc measures to address any cases of insuÔ¨Écient water. The Sumitomo Forestry Group has also begun to grasp the actual state of water use even at three overseas companies. From Ô¨Åscal 2016 to Ô¨Åscal 2018, Sumitomo Forestry Group water consumption increased due to the operation of the Mombetsu Biomass Power Plant and Hachinohe Biomass Power Plant. Biomass power generation leads to increased water usage because power is generated by burning wood and other biomass fuel to boil water and create steam for powering turbines. The Sumitomo Forestry Group has set conservation and eÔ¨Äective utilization of water resources as a target in the Mid-Term Sustainability Targets announced in May 2019 with speciÔ¨Åc water consumption targets for entire Group for conducting progress management. In Ô¨Åscal 2019, the entire group used 2,897,000 m¬≥ of water, which achieved our target of 2,981,000 m¬≥ or less. Water saving measures for circular use of industrial water at the Sumitomo Forestry Crest Imari Plant was a major factor in reaching this target. Overseas manufacturing plants reduced their water use in Ô¨Åscal 2019 by 6.2% compared to Ô¨Åscal 2018 because of watersaving activities, such as the use of rainwater. Sumitomo Forestry conducts sample surveys of water used by partner companies at on-site construction of houses in Ô¨Åscal 2015 to grasp the water consumption in the supply chain, which found the volume of water used per 1 m¬≤ of Ô¨Çoor area is approximately 0.0887 m¬≥.

EÔ¨Äorts at Sumitomo Forestry Crest The Imari Plant of Sumitomo Forestry Crest, which manufacturers such products as synthetic resin adhesives, uses industrial water to cool its manufacturing equipment. Afterwards, this water is reused to dilute factory wastewater and for other purposes as a water-conservation measure. In addition, from Ô¨Åscal 2018, wastewater (coagulation sedimentation treated water) is further treated biologically to control the amount of water necessary for dilution for factory wastewater water quality management. This and other new water-saving measures led to an industrial water usage of 84,100 m¬≥ in Ô¨Åscal 2019, a 43% decline compared to Ô¨Åscal 2018. Biological processing facility (aeration blower) Biological processing facility (aeration tank) Measuring the COD of eÔ¨Ñuent Ôºú348Ôºû Sumitomo Forestry Group Sustainability Report 2020 Measures Used at the Sumitomo Forestry Crest's Imari Plant for Saving Water 1. Subjecting waste water (after processing for coagulating sedimentation) to further*1 biological processing makes it possible to restrict the water used for dilution in plant waste water quality management (approximately 350m¬≥/day). 2. Maintain water-quality control by measuring COD*2 and treat wastewater using only the minimum amount of water necessary. 3. After water is used to cool manufacturing equipment, it is used to dilute plant waste water. 4. Improve the proportion of rainwater used, such as by upgrading the pumps used for collecting rainwater. *1 BeneÔ¨Åcial microorganisms are supplied with air (oxygen), whereupon they absorb and break down organic substances, lowering COD values. *2 Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD): An indication of the amount of oxygen required to oxidize an organic compound in water; one of the most important indicators of water quality. Participation in Relevant Incentives The Sumitomo Forestry Group provides answers to the CDP Water questions and discloses more detailed information about eÔ¨Äorts on risks related to water since Ô¨Åscal 2017.
