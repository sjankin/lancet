Communication on Progress – 2020 Statement of Continued Support Supporting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continues to be at the heart of TRANSTEC’s work. And since endorsing the UN Global Compact initiative, TRANSTEC has also integrated the UNGC’s Ten Principles into its overall strategy and operations. At the occasion of the second annual Communication on Progress, we wish to reiterate our continued commitment to supporting and promoting the initiative and its principles. This second year of participation to the UNGC has been the opportunity on the one hand to consolidate the achievements of our first year namely the creation of a comprehensive set of policies and their corresponding procedures – and on the other to develop new initiatives in line with the Ten Principles. 1. In accordance with our assessment mechanism, we have carried out the yearly review of all our policies. Based on the lessons learned we have been able to identify additional measures to put in place and have updated our policies accordingly. We have also provided additional training to staff including specialized training on issues such as Safeguarding. 2. We have launched a series of initiatives to continue to improve our performance in the areas of the UNGC. This year we have prioritized actions related to the Environment and we will continue to develop this in the coming year. Also, in the current global sanitary crisis we have taken the measures possible at all levels to contribute to the fight against Covid-19. At corporate level, we have setup a Covid-19 Committee which works on a daily basis to ensure the health and safety of both our workers and our project teams. At project level, we implement wherever possible initiatives that help the most vulnerable. For instance in Somalia we will, as part of a DfID funded Programme, assess healthcare facility and community preparedness for and response to the Covid-19 outbreak. In the other countries where we operate, our teams are also working on finding new and innovative ways to help communities in the face of this crisis. Throughout the next year we will continue to consolidate our ethical approach to doing business at corporate level as well as strengthening it at project level. We will also continue to reinforce our actions in the SDGs. Finally, we will follow the initiatives launched to improve our performance in the areas of the UNGC namely environmental protection.

This Policy also outlines clear reporting procedures so that anyone victim of or witness to any form of Human Rights violation knows both how to report it and that they are protected by our Whistleblowing Policy from any form of retribution or victimisation. This preventive and protective framework continues to be in place and has been strengthened further to the annual review and update of the policy. Indeed this review has led to the following changes: a wider definition of what constitutes a violation of our Safeguarding Policy; strengthening the victim-centered aspect of the response to a violation; nomination of an additional Safeguarding Focal Point bringing the number to two (one man and one woman); The updated Policy has been presented in detail to TRANSTEC staff and we have started to present it also at project level. Besides this annual training to staff, additional specific trainings were provided to or attended by staff, including: a specific half a day awareness raising session on psycho-social risks at work, how these could be prevented was given to the entire Board of Directors; a workshop “Safeguarding – Leading Culture Change” given by the Department for International Development (DfID) – United Kingdom; Measurement of outcome: The Safeguarding Policy and the Whistleblowing Policy have been reviewed and updated and all staff have been provided with a training on the updated version of these policies; Projects have also started to receive an Ethics Training which also includes among other issues Safeguarding, Social Responsibility and Human Rights; Nomination of an additional Safeguarding Focal Point; 1 The Principles of the UN Global Compact: https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles Tools: ❖ Safeguarding Policy and Procedures ❖ Safeguarding Register ❖ Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures Labour Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; The effective abolition of child labour; and The elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation2. These four principles continue to be upheld in the same way as before because as a Belgian company TRANSTEC is bound to comply with a series of national laws and international conventions and regulations that ensure the respect for international principles on labour and ethical employment. This includes legislation: against sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment at work; against child abuse and exploitation; against inequality or discrimination on the basis of race, age, religion, sexuality, culture of disability; prohibition of slavery; for the promotion of equality between men and women; TRANSTEC continues to recognise and uphold the right of its employees to freedom of association and collective bargaining. All of these commitments form an integral part of TRANSTEC’s Charter of Conduct and Ethics. TRANSTEC’s Labour Regulation (Règlement de Travail) continues to ensure1 that the national legislation on working hours and leave entitlements is complied with, thereby providing decent working conditions for all its staff. In parallel, TRANSTEC’s Recruitment Policy makes a clear and strong statement against any form of discrimination in our recruitment process. It ensures that all the necessary procedures are put in place to guarantee that our equal opportunity policy is complied with at all stages of recruitment. With this policy any person in charge of a recruitment is bound to make sure that applicants are evaluated and selected in a consistent and fair manner based on criteria related to their ability to meet the requirements of the job description and specifications. Our Recruitment Policy is in line with all relevant legislation regarding the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Measurement of outcome: The Recruitment Policy has been reviewed and updated and all staff have been provided with a training on the updated version of the policy; Projects have also started to receive an Ethics Training which also includes among other issues recruitment best practices to be applied also at project level; 2 The Principles of the UN Global Compact: https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles Tools: ❖ Recruitment Policy and Procedures ❖ Internal Labour Regulation (Règlement de Travail) ❖ Statement of Compliance with Ethical Employment Standards Environment Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies3. As mentioned in our first Communication on Progress environmental protection and climate action constitute an important action area for TRANSTEC. Therefore, in addition to the annual review and update of our Environmental and Sustainability Policy and the ensuing training provided to staff we have also launched a series of initiatives that aim to contribute to a reduction of our environmental footprint. Along with the existing measures – such as offering staff “eco vouchers” that can be used to purchase environmentally friendly goods and services here are some of the initiatives put in place in the last year: promoting the use of the Ecosia4 search engine; offering the possibility of a “car-free day” for HQ staff; compensating the carbon footprint created from unavoidable travel of TRANSTEC staff by supporting environmentally projects certified by the Gold Standard Label5; using of a zero carbon emission logistics service for all Brussels-based postal deliveries from HQ; whenever possible favouring teleconferencing to travel; In addition to the above we have also taken the first steps to complete our registration with the “Label Entreprise Eco Dynamique”. This label rewards and encourages Brussels based companies, associations and institutions that act to reduce the impact of their activity on the environment. The label promotes eco-management approaches, particularly in terms of waste management and prevention, rational use of energy, management of worker mobility. As part of that effort the TRANSTEC Environmental Protection Officer has attended a series of trainings including on issue of “Communication and Environment: how to mobilise your teams”. Measurement of outcome: The Environmental and Sustainability Policy has been reviewed and updated and all staff have been provided with a training on the updated version of the policy; Projects have also started to receive an Ethics Training which also includes among other issues Environmental Protection; A series of initiatives have been launched to contribute to a reduction of our environmental footprint; 3 The Principles of the UN Global Compact: https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles 4 Ecosia is a search engine which uses its profit to fight against deforestation and has built its own solar energy plant to power searches made. 5 The Gold Standard Label is a best practice standard for climate and sustainable development interventions, Gold Standard for the Global Goals, to maximise impact, creating value for people around the world and the planet we share. Tools: ❖ Environmental & Sustainability Policy and Procedures ❖ Headquarters Environmental Risk Register ❖ Project Environmental Risk Register Anti-Corruption Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. As mentioned in our first annual Communication on Progress TRANSTEC has set in place a robust system of policies and procedures to reduce the risk of corruption, fraud, conflict of interest and other forms of malpractice as well as to provide the necessary reporting mechanisms. As part of our annual assessment mechanism we have reviewed all our policies that aim to prevent malpractice and based on the lessons learned we have updated these policies accordingly. In particular we have further strengthened our due diligence both in the procedures to be followed at each stage of a contract and in the elements to be assessed regarding : participation in a criminal organisation, corruption, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, child labour or other offences concerning trafficking in human beings professional misconduct any other unlawful or unethical conduct As a result we have stronger tools and procedures that enable us to make a comprehensive analysis of potential partners and follow their continued compliance with our standards and this throughout the duration of a contract. Measurement of outcome: The Anti Fraud and Corruption Policy, the Conflict of Interest Policy, the Supply Chain Management Policy and the Whistleblowing Policy have been reviewed and updated and all staff were provided with a training on the updated version of these policies; Projects have also started to receive an Ethics Training which also includes among other issues combating fraud, corruption and other forms of malpractice; Tools: ❖ Anti Fraud & Corruption Policy and Procedures (including Register) ❖ Due Diligence Questionnaire ❖ Gifts & Hospitality Register ❖ Conflict of Interest Policy and Procedures (including Register) ❖ Supply Chain Management Policy and Procedures ❖ Whistleblowing Policy and Procedures Links with the UN Sustainable Development Goals Since its inception in 1983, TRANSTEC’s core activity has been that of promoting what is now referred to as the SDGs. From a small consulting practice working on poverty eradication in rural areas and designing famine early warning systems we have now become an organisation that bilateral and multilateral funding agencies can rely on to promote the progress of SDGs.
