But we don’t simply measure our success by size. We also consider our increased capacity to drive innovation and address the most pressing challenges of our time. We see our purpose as building a more prosperous and resilient world for all, delivering solutions to issues across the globe. To do this, we provide our clients with sustainable answers to some of the world’s most difficult questions.
