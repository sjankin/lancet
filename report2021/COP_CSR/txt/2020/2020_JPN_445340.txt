At Tokyu Fudosan Holdings Corporation, we have leveraged the strengths of the Group to create new value in cities, and in society. The keyword in this process is Lifestyle Creation. In Lifestyle Creation 1.0, we offered new lifestyles to society through the development and sale of condominiums and detached houses, development of commercial facilities, hotels and resorts, and the provision of spaces such as office buildings. In Lifestyle Creation 2.0, we proposed solutions in the form of new home, work and play styles, expanding the boundaries of our real estate business to include management, agency and operation of these various spaces and properties, as consumer behavior shifts from the consumption of goods to the consumption of services. Social issues are changing with the times, with examples including workstyle reform, childcare and nursing care problems, lengthening healthy lifestyles, and the advancement of new workstyles such as telework and workations; and customer lifestyle scenes are diversifying. To support these needs, our value creation model is evolving into Lifestyle Creation 3.0, which combines the three domains (home, work and play styles) to achieve ideal lifestyle proposals.

It Good access Links up to 8 lines (JR and private train lines) has contributed to solving issues in the area in front of Shibuya Station. For example, vehicles no longer need to be parked on road for cargo handling. In addition, the Shibuya Sakuragaoka Block Redevelopment Plan is scheduled to be completed in fiscal 2023. We will proceed with the development of an appealing area that will attract people and companies, by improving the international competitiveness of Shibuya with proposals integrating unprecedented new home, Rendering work and play styles. The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered in a new normal, as peoples' values and lifestyles are also changing. These changes have also instigated diverse workstyle options in offices as well, partly reflecting the ubiquitization of teleworking. However, this has weakened connections between people, and the negative consequences of insufficient communication have also become apparent. Places that encourage communication and the creation of ideas and innovation are essential for business. Offices will play a significant role in strengthening employees' sense of belonging and the strength of the organization as well.

In addition, because Shibuya attracts diverse cultures, the area is free from the authoritarian hierarchy that is typical of traditional office streets. Startups attracted to the non-authoritarian atmosphere of Shibuya see the area's great potential as a place for innovating — more so now with the changes taking place. Progress in digital transformation (DX) will definitely lead to the development of businesses based on sensing technologies, D2C,* and other systems, resulting in an increase of companies enjoying significant growth. Support for these startups will make Shibuya a place that continues to develop and attract growth companies. Looking ahead to the future of Shibuya, we will continue to sustainably take action to enhance the distinctive personality of the area and improve the value of the overall area. Thus, we will strive to continue proactively increasing the appeal of Shibuya, an area where diverse values coexist. * D2C: Direct to Consumer.

Interview Tenant of SHIBUYA FUKURAS GMO Internet Group Establishing an Office in Shibuya, Wishing to Continue Growing in This Area We were among the first to introduce teleworking in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business performance has remained unaffected during the several months since then, so at one point we questioned the necessity of an office. However, we have now reaffirmed the role and significance of an office, and are certain of the significant importance of an office. If business is a battle, an office is a weapon, and so is teleworking. It is important to take advantage of every work style weapon we have. Of course, places for face-to-face communication are indispensable. For our company, which only handles digital products, the office is a symbol that plays an important role in the building of credibility and the differentiation of our company from others. This is why we consolidated our group's financial businesses to open our second head office at SHIBUYA FUKURAS. We relocated to Shibuya because our office in Aoyama, where we were founded, became too small for us. Since them, IT ventures have gradually collected here, resulting in the establishment of Bit Valley. Shibuya has become an area that contributes greatly to Mr. Masatoshi Kumagai the acquisition of human resources and improvement of the corporate brand. When we CEO, Chairman of the Board and moved to the building, people from TOKYU LAND CORPORATION welcomed us as if we President, Founder and Group CEO were family.

Results progressed steadily, supported in part by the solid business environment, and we believed that would be able to sufficiently achieve all of our fiscal indicator targets. With the COVID-19 pandemic taking place from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, however, business conditions changed rapidly, especially with regard to BtoC business operations.

Initiatives for Social Issues Through Our Business: Supporting Social Infrastructure through Renewable Energy Business Operations We are currently seeing an increase in the importance of renewable energy globally. At TOKYU LAND CORPORATION, we have been engaged in the renewable energy business — which embodies a key aspect of our sustainability policy, that “we will strive for environmental and economic harmony through our business activities” — since 2014. Business operations being conducted under the ReENE brand contribute to suppressing CO2 emissions and increasing Japan’s energy self-sufficiency. At the same time, they are resistant to the impact of economic changes, and can be expected to contribute to increasing demand and investment, as a stable revenue-generating asset. The ReENE Matsumae Wind Farm commenced operation in April 2019. The wind farm is equipped with 12 wind turbines, which at the time were the largest in Japan, enabling a level of power generation equivalent to the yearly power consumption of around 30,000 typical households. Based on our emphasis on consideration for the environment and regional cooperation, we are developing solar sharing business operations that allow power generation to coexist with farming, and building a sustainable business model while promoting regional vitalization. We have also established the Renewable Energy Association for Sustainable Power supply (REASP) in association with Renewable Japan Co., Ltd. and other powerful business operators, and are working to create systems that will enable the stable supply of renewable energy in the long term, in collaboration with local communities. TOKYU LAND CORPORATION joined RE100*4 in April 2019. The Company is working to realize the goal of 100% Renewable Energy (including renewable energy used by the Company itself) by 2050.

The decrease during the year ended March 31, 2020 were mainly due to the sales of properties of ¥18,641 million ($ 172,602 thousand), and transfers to real estate for sale of ¥19,059 million ($ 176,472 thousand), respectively. The decrease during the year ended March 31, 2019 were mainly due to the sales of properties of ¥37,283 million, and transfers to real estate for sale of ¥32,847 million. 3.

TOKYU FUDOSAN HOLDINGS 2020 INTEGRATED REPORT 111 On Publishing the 2020 Integrated Report This year’s integrated report is the fifth to be issued by Tokyu Fudosan Holdings Corporation. The importance of integrating both our financial and non-financial information and communicating details of our corporate value creation to our stakeholders is increasing with each year, and we make improvements to the content that we disclose on an annual basis. In this year’s report, we endeavored to convey our ideal vision of “To Become a Corporate Group that Continues to Create Value” in an easily understandable story, with specific details. This year’s core theme is Lifestyle Creation 3.0. To enable readers to gain a deep understanding of the story of our value creation utilizing the Group’s three core strengths and the breadth of its business wingspan, we sought to improve and enhance the content of the report with features on projects that lead to the creation of future lifestyles through our proposal of new home, work and play styles. We have also reflected the requests of our investors. In the new report, we summarized the value provided through our business operations (outputs) and social value (outcomes) created as a result, with additional editing to enable readers to understand the impact of our business on society. We also had our outside directors participate in online round-table talks to exchange opinions, and heard their frank and unreserved opinions on various issues, including how communication has been and should be conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the business environment has changed dramatically in the face of this crisis, the Group’s stance in aiming for sustainable growth and society remains unshaken. We will continue to thoroughly communicate details of our further growth in the future, and our mission in supporting social infrastructure. Advancing the process of digital transformation (DX) is another pressing issue for the Group, I, as director responsible for DX, will be working to implement transformations in business models within the Group with a sense of urgency. As of this year, we also decided to stop printing paper copies of our report, and disclose it to our stakeholders on our website. This decision was based on our desire to drive the advancement of digitalization, and our consideration for the global environment. Shouhei Kimura As a company working to resolve social issues through its business activities, we have Director, Operating Officer participated in the UN Global Compact advocated by the United Nations, and are supporting Supervisor for General Management, Digital Transformation Promotion Office Supervisor its Ten Principles with regard to human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.

Looking ahead, we will continue to value the importance of dialogs with our stakeholders, and create various opportunities for communication. October 2020 Under the direction of Director Shouhei Kimura, members from the Corporate Communication Department, together with the Group Corporate Planning and Group General Administration departments formed the administrative office for compiling this report. We summarized concepts spanning the Group, while coordinating closely with Group companies. The administrative office held a total of 16 editorial meetings (shifting to an online format as of April), as well as holding theme-based subcommittee meetings and conducting interviews as required in order to compile the report. We hope that this report will be useful to stakeholders as a communication tool for gaining an understanding of our Group.
