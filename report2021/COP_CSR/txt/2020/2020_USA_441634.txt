Mr. O’Reilly was determined to make the best goods at the lowest cost so the consumer was getting unsurpassed value for their money. Eurow was known for selling single products. Its main product was the sheepskin seat cover. In 2000, Mr. O’Reilly’s daughter, Donna O’Reilly bought the business and changed the name to Eurow & O’Reilly Corporation. Over the years, Eurow & O’Reilly Corporation expanded to a leading manufacturer and global supplier of microfiber and cotton textiles with fully branded product lines. 8 Promoting the United Nations Global Compact Below is a chart stating Eurow & O’Reilly’s progress on the 10 principles put forth by the United Nations Global Compact. The percentage is based on the manufacturing distribution between audited versus non-audited factories. All factories are audited, but the percentage below reflects only third party audits.

We believe gender diversity allows for a wider range of insight, perspective, and knowledge within the workplace. Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. promotes an environment where the most talented individuals have the opportunity to advance within the Company, regardless of gender and without discrimination. All candidates are assessed equally during the recruitment and selection process, and all hiring decisions are based on the qualifications and experience of each individual. Once hired, Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. is committed to evaluating each employee based on performance, quality of work, and overall value to the Company, regardless of gender. The following charts demonstrate Eurow & O’Reilly Corp’s. commitment to gender equality in both managerial and non-managerial positions during the final quarter of 2019. Please note, as a Company with a relatively low population, the slightest variation within the organization will significantly impact the overall percentages.

As a Company, we will continue to track any variances between men versus women in our workforce and make an effort to maintain similar ratios. However, we will continue to adhere to our policy regarding equal opportunity and comply with all applicable laws. Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. prohibits harassment, discrimination, and/or retaliation based on gender, gender identity, race, color, age, religion, national origin or ancestry, physical or mental disability, marital status, veteran status, sexual orientation, and/or any other basis protected by Federal and State laws. These guidelines apply to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoffs, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.

The Government of Uzbekistan practices forced child and adult labor in the harvest of cotton. By signing this pledge, we commit to not source Uzbek cotton for the manufacturing of any of our products until this practice ends. We joined Responsible Sourcing Network and its multi-stakeholder coalition to raise awareness of this issue and press for its elimination. Our pledge can be found on: http://www.sourcingnetwork.org/the-cotton-pledge Responsible Sourcing Network has also recently created the Yarn Ethically & Sustainably Sourced (YESS) initiative which is meant to drive slavery out of cotton production. In addition to Uzbekistan, cotton produced by forced labor has been documented in at least 9 countries. The cotton then makes its way through the value chain into goods sold by major brands and retailers. The goal of YESS is to assist in eliminating the market for cotton produced by forced labor and increase the use of ethically and sustainably sourced cotton. Eurow has endorsed YESS by signing a Statement of Support. Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. is committed to doing our part in bettering the community by working to ensure the health and wellbeing of our employees, our customers and the community. We consistently ensure that our company is using ethical labor practices to demonstrate social responsibility. Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. donated product to a number of diverse charitable organizations including homeless shelters , substance abuse recovery programs, and occupational therapy programs for disabled children and adults. The Company also donated product to various local animal shelters that are dedicated to rescuing, rehabilitating and rehoming abandoned, injured, sick, and abused animals. Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. is continuously looking into new ideas about how we can contribute to the community. 12 Our Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (continued) Eurow & O’Reilly Corporation participates in Customer Social Responsibility programs where selected factories have undergone social audits performed by UL and their responsible sourcing group. The scope of UL’s workplace assessments are based on: • Labor Practices • Health and Safety 3rd Party Audited by Volume • Environment for Social Compliance Additional components can include: Factories A, B, and C have been audited by a • Facility Supply Chain Profile 3rd party independent organization for social • Ethics and Business Integrity, and compliance. Factories are re-audited on a • Management Systems yearly basis. Non-audited factories are factories that do not have an official 3rd party audit report on record. Eurow visits nonManufacturing audited factories regularly and performs Eurow works with 5 main factories that produce internal audits. Should any deficiencies be 97.99% of its products. None of the other found, a corrective action plan is put factories’ product volume is more than 1%. immediately into place. Eurow is very close to its goal of having 95% of production volume audited. 2018 70.00% 62.67% 5.57% 60.00% 94.43% 50.00% 40.00% Audited Not Audited 30.00% 22.12% 2019 20.00% 9.98% 10.00% 5.23% 2.23% 1.00% 2.01% 0.00% 94.77% 13 Audited Not Audited Our Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (continued) Collecting and analyzing data in key areas are a high priority at Eurow & O’Reilly Corporation. The data provides feedback on our progress and helps us gain insight into areas where we can improve. We have chosen to focus on Principle 4: Labour Businesses should uphold the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour, and report at the GC Advanced levels of the UN Global Company Differentiation Programme. G4-HR6: OPERATIONS AND SUPPLIERS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR INCIDENTS OF FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOR, AND MEASURES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELIMINATION OF ALL FORMS OF FORCED OR COMPULSORY LABOR Working Conditions at Factories 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019** % of Main Factories Assessed 75.3% 92.0% 97.2% 97.8% 96.7% % Change from prior year +1.3% +22.2% +5.7% +0.6% -1.1% New Factory Evaluations and Approvals # of new factories evaluated 2 1 0 1 0 % Approved 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% % Pending 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Factory Ratings (1 – Excellent, 2 – Good, 3 – Fair)* Excellent 40.0% 50.0% 100.0% 75.0% 100.0% Good 0.00% 25.0% 0.0% 25.0% 0.0% Fair 60.0% 25.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% *Excellent is a factory that meets expectations and demonstrates readiness to assume responsibilities for managing and monitoring compliance activities. On a scale of 0 to 100, 100 being the highest, an Excellent factory scores 85 or higher. Good is a factory that needs further improvement. For instance, a factory lacking a product risk assessment for each product would fall in this rating. A Good factory scores between 71 to 84. Fair is a factory that needs significant action. For instance, a factory that does not have a system to identify and trace raw materials through finished goods would fall in this rating. A Fair factory scores 51 to 70. Any score below 50 is non-passing. The global score is 79. This number is based on audits of over 5,000 factories. **In 2019, the audit format had changed. Instead of receiving a score, it was calculated based on the number of issues found in 16 categories. Definitions for a Excellent, Good, and Fair factory remained the same. 14 Our Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (continued) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Forced Labor Does not use involuntary labor 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Workers allowed to leave after shift 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Workers are not locked in 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Does not withhold documents (i.e. 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% passport) Does not require mandatory overtime 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Does not require deposit upon hire or 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% recruiting fee Working Hours Allows workers to refuse overtime 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Does provide 1 day off in 7 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Wages & Benefits Pays overtime premium 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Provides wage statement 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Pays at or above region minimum 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% wage Provides subsidies or benefits to 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% workers (i.e. meals, uniforms, housing, maternity leave, paid leave, etc.) Abuse No evidence of physical abuse 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% No evidence of psychological abuse 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Miscellaneous No disciplinary deductions 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% No discrimination 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Workers have freedom of association 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 15 Our Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (continued) 16 Our Approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (continued) Another principle we have chosen to focus on is Principle 5, Labour Businesses should uphold the effective abolition of child labour, and report at the GC Advanced levels of the UN Global Company Differentiation Programme. G4-HR5: OPERATIONS AND SUPPLIERS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING SIGNIFICANT RISK FOR INCIDENTS OF CHILD LABOR, AND MEASURES TAKEN TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE EFFECTIVE ABOLITION OF CHILD LABOR All our factories comply with laws for child labor. The workforce is always over the legal working age, which is supported with valid age documents. Therefore, none of the factories have any risk for incidents of child labor. As a result, instead we have chosen to report the youngest age at factory in each region which we feel has more significance. Youngest Age at Factory Province in China 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Anhui 21 22 N/A** N/A N/A Jiangsu 22 22 23 19 23 Zhejiang 18 18 18 18 18 Henan N/A* 24 22 26 N/A*** *In 2016, the factory in the Henan province received its first audit. Therefore, prior to 2016, there is no data, which is why “N/A” is entered for 2015. **At the end of 2016, the factory in Anhui closed. Therefore, from 2019 and onwards, the youngest age at factory for Anhui is “N/A” since there is no longer a factory in that province. ***The factory in Henan produced one main product that had lost demand in 2019, so there was no activity with this factory for the year. Because of the lack of activity, a proper audit could not be carried out. Therefore, it is unknown what the youngest age at the factory was for this year. 17 Working Conditions at Manufacturing Sites Below are the violations that a factory can be cited for. They are broken into 3 major categories: labor, wages and benefits, and health and safety. Labor covers issues such as child labor, forced labor, and any abuse. Wages and benefits ensures any hours worked are paid, overtime is limited, no deductions are taken from pay as punishment, and benefits such as insurance are provided. Health and safety address issues such as working fire alarms and fire extinguishers, protective guards on equipment and ear plugs for operators, valid electrical certificates, and providing a reasonably safe working environment. Factory Factory Factory A B C Labor Child labor Prison / slave labor Physical abuse Wages and benefits Unpaid wages Exceeded monthly overtime* Disciplinary deductions Benefits not offered** Health & safety Lack of emergency equipment*** Lack of protective equipment / wear Lack of electrical maintenance Lack of security Legend Critical violations need to be addressed immediately. Major None detected violations are important but not critical and are addressed within 30 days of detection. Minor violations are less severe and are addressed Minor Violation within 90 days of detection. All violations require a corrective action Major Violation plan which is signed by factory management and agreed to by Eurow. Critical Violation *Factory A, B, and C plan on employing more production workers right before peak production periods which will eliminate excessive overtime. **Factory A, and C had employees that had newly met the qualifications for social insurance but were not covered yet. ***During the audit, Factory A had a few employees that were not wearing the provided protective equipment. 18 Empowering Women Women’s Business Enterprise National Council Eurow is certified by the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC), the largest third-party certifier of businesses owned, controlled, and operated by women. The organization fosters diversity to fuel economic growth globally through access to opportunities. Supporting Women in the Workplace Eurow offers short-term supplemental insurance coverage. The benefit is provided at no cost to the employees. The plan pays a short-term benefit if an employee is unable to work due to injury or illness. This benefit also covers the birth of a child. Annual Trend with Women-Owned Businesses (in millions of units) Partnering with Other Women-owned 1.7 Businesses 1.6 Eurow has partnered with several womenowned businesses. The goal is year over 1.5 year to increase the volume of business with women-owned businesses. Eurow plans to 1.4 continue this trend to support women in business. 1.3 1.2 2017 2018 2019 19 Environmental Impact Eurow & O’Reilly Corporation has taken several measures to reduce its impact on the environment. The warehouse is equipped with R30 insulation under the roof. This type of insulation is key in maintaining a stable temperature. R30 insulation keeps the heat in during the winter and keeps the heat out during summer. Because of the insulation, there is about a 20 degree difference between the outside temperature and internal temperature of the warehouse. This feature is especially important during hot summer months because it eliminates the need for air conditioning. There is also energy efficient lighting in the warehouse that is motion activated. That way, only the parts of the warehouse that have activity stay lit. This feature helps further limit energy usage. Lighting was converted to electronic ballast technology after the acquisition of the building. The entire building, office and warehouse included, also has special features that help keep temperatures stable. First, the building has membrane roofing, a type of roofing system that is made of rubber used on flat surfaces. The roof is coated with a highly reflective barrier on the membrane. The roof is roughly 50 thousand square feet. The barrier is a polymer with reflective material embedded in it. It helps maintain stable temperatures by reflecting sunlight away from the building and precludes heat from getting into the membrane and into the building. This feature is particularly important at the building’s location where there is no marine layer in the area and temperatures in the summer can reach over 100°F. The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) is an organization aimed at fighting light pollution, which is a side effect of industrial civilization. Outdoor lighting used at night is either overly bright, improperly shielded, or poorly targeted resulting in light pollution which disrupts the natural rhythm of ecosystems and wildlife. To help preserve our dark skies, in 2019, we installed lighting products certified by IDA’s Fixture Seal of Approval program. The lights point downwards to reduce the amount of illumination lost to the night sky. Also, the bulbs are LED which are 80% more efficient than traditional bulbs. Eurow & O’Reilly Corporation also has a recycling program. Any discarded corrugate from shipping boxes and any used office paper is picked up once a week for recycling. We also recycle used ink cartridges. 20 Anti-Corruption Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. expects employees to conduct business according to the highest ethical standards, and to dedicate their best efforts to the interests of the Company. Business dealings that appear to create a conflict of interest between Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. and an employee are not acceptable. Employees must avoid any interest, influence or relationship which may conflict or appear to conflict with the best interests of the Company. For Example: Accepting gifts, entertainment or other benefits from a competitor, customer or supplier of more than a value determined by the IRS trade or business gift guidelines is prohibited. Formal expense forms are required, and must be accompanied by original receipts to show incurred business expenses, before the expenses are approved and a reimbursement is issued All business transactions are conducted via wire transfer so there is an electronic trail for tracking purposes. Transactions that are less than USD $200 may be settled via petty cash. The form of payment is documented in the accounting records along with an invoice or receipt. Petty cash is reviewed periodically to ensure the amount of cash always equals the amount on the receipts plus and leftover cash. 21 51 Moreland Road Simi Valley, CA USA Copyright © 2019 • Eurow & O’Reilly Corp. • All rights reserved.
