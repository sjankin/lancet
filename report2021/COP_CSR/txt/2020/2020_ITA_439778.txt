The project aims for simultaneous development of a system for storing surplus electric approach to produce microalgal biomass in an integrated phototrophic-heterotrophic cultivaenergy from renewable and/or traditional sources turned into chemicals and a system to reduce tion system. The proposed system uses pre-concentrated olive oil wastewaters as a carbon CO2 emission from combustion and/or biogas plants. This is accomplished through an electrosource for growing algae, thus contributing to waste reuse and valorization. The microalgal bichemical process that allows for the conversion of electrical energy into chemical energy, leadomass will be tested for application in nutraceuticals (by extracting carotenoids) and for ing to the production of synthesis gas from carbon dioxide by using nanostructured catalytic bio-polymer production (by extracting starch and other carbohydrates and the lipid fraction). electrodes. The aim of the project is to design, build and test two prototypes: the first for the synthesis of nanostructured electrodes and the second for electrochemical CO2 reduction. In this way, the catalysts produced in the former prototype will be used for the electrochemical MEMBER (advanced MEMBranes and membrane assisted procEsses for preand post-combusreduction of CO2 in the latter one. tion CO2 captuRe) is a consortium of 17 Partners with Tecnalia as Project Coordinator.

The Group has committed to the goal of CRITERIA AND incorporating sustainability into the Group’s business strategy, governance, operations and financial reporting, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the REPORTING United Nations in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The report has been prepared in accordance PRINCIPLES with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Standards 2016: “Core option”. Furthermore, Maire Tecnimont has aligned itself with the new “Consolidated Non-Financial Disclosure” reporting requirements provided for by Italian Legislative Decree No. 254 of December 30, 2016, which transposes, into Italian law, Directive 2014/95/ EU of the European Parliament and Council. The 2020–2024 Industrial Plan approved by the Board of Directors of Maire Tecnimont includes ESG sustainability indicators (environmental, social and governance) linked to the Sustainable Development Goals set out in the United Nations 2030 Agenda. As of this year, the plan identifies and prioritizes material topics based on the various business lines and the relevant SDGs. The plan therefore connects economic and financial goals to sustainability ones, allowing for integrated strategic planning. STAKEHOLDER INCLUSIVENESS, MATERIALITY, COMPLETENESS, SUSTAINABILITY CONTEXT The Sustainability Report presents the main Group results in terms of the economic, social and environmental topics identified in a dedicated materiality analysis, which is described in detail in Paragraph 2.5 “Materiality Analysis” of this document. In order to identify the most material themes, and therefore determine the contents of this report, consideration was taken of the opinions of the top management of the various corporate divisions in the Group, as well as of sector analysis results, sustainability macro-trends and other external reference sources. The report additionally aims to inform all stakeholders on the Group’s main economic, social and environmental results. 114 CREATING CREATINGVALUE VALUE 2019 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 115 APPENDIX APPENDIX The following table shows, for each of the identified material topics, its relative boundary both inside and outside of the The following table shows the correlation between topics of the Italian Legislative The data and information provided organization.
