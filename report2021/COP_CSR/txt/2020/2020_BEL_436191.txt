This was an increase of EUR 280.6 million compared to the net cash outflow of EUR 68.9 million in 2017. Free cash flow amounted to EUR 241.2 million and was EUR 727.0 million higher than last year. Cash flow from operating activities resulted in a cash inflow of EUR 362.0 million, EUR 95.8 million higher than in 2017. Cash generation from operating activities was impacted by bpost bank dividend (EUR -7.8 million) and collected proceeds due to Radial’s clients (EUR -5.4 million). Excluding these elements the positive variance in working capital evolution (EUR +143.8 million, mainly thanks to improved clients balances and payment of transaction expenses related to Radial acquisition in 2017) was partially offset by the decreased operating results (EUR -34.8 million). Cash used in investing activities resulted in a cash outflow of EUR 120.8 million in 2018 compared to EUR 751.9 million last year. Cash outflows related to acquisitions were EUR 605.2 million lower than last year which combined with higher proceeds from sale of buildings (EUR +31.5 million) and lower capital expenditures (EUR +6.4 million) contributed to the decreased cash outflow. This was to a limited extent offset by investment securities in 2017 (EUR -12.0 million). The cash flow relating to financing activities amounted to EUR -29.5 million (EUR +416.8 million in 2017). In 2018 the issuance of the bond and commercial paper, along with the loans entered into during the third quarter of 2018 was more than offset by the reimbursement of the bridge loan for the Radial acquisition, the unwinding of the pre-hedge interest rate swap related to the bond and the dividends.

As a consequence, bpost as a tax assets for unused tax losses carried forward. public institution pays a contribution that is defined by a programme law. The amount is adapted each year proportionally to the number of civil servants (full time equivalents) and is subject to inflation. For most benefits, an average cost per inactive member is used for the valuation of the benefits. This average cost has been estimated by dividing the annual cost for inactive members by the number of inactive beneficiaries based on the reference data received from the pensions’ administration. The discount rates have been determined by reference to market yields at the statement of financial position date. bpost used the Towers Watson RATE:link1 tool for the determination of the discount rates, considering a mix of financial and non-financial AA corporate bonds. (1) The Towers Watson RATE:link tool is a tool designed to assist companies in the selection of discount rates that accurately reflect the characteristics of their pension schemes. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2018 34 6.4 Summary of significant All associates are accounted for using the equity method: the participating interests are separately accounting policies included in the consolidated statement of financial position (under the caption “Investments in FINANCIAL associates”) at the closing date at an amount CONSOLIDATED All accounting estimates and assumptions that corresponding to the proportion of the associate’s STATEMENTS are used in preparing the financial statements are equity (as restated under IFRS), including the result for consistent with bpost’s latest approved budget / longthe period.

After the training, the employees were tested on the content of the module. Road safety is also a key concern for us. We aim to totally eliminate road accidents. In 2018, we ran a large training project concerning road safety in Belgium. For every vehicle (including e-bicycles and internal transport), it was mandatory to receive driving training at bpost’s driving school (FRAC1). The trainings focus on improving driving knowledge and skills; three different levels are proposed, depending on the current qualifications of the driver. We also want to make sure our employees remain healthy, and include psychosocial as well as physical aspects. To this end, bpost promotes and offers access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services, such as company doctors. Our Belgian “Health Surveillance” system provides mandatory medical check-ups for all bpost postal workers: a thirty-minute check-up, including a cardiovascular and musculoskeletal screening every five years for the under 45s and every three years for the 45 plus.We even ask our employees in sorting centers to go on an annual basis. In 2018, a total of 6,300 bpost employees and 1,600 interim workers got a medical check-up. bpost employees can also get vaccinated against the flu in the Fall. For the psychosocial wellbeing of our employees, we organize a survey to measure the level of employee engagement and organize a personalized “balance tool” so that employees can gain insight into their personal stress and motivation levels. Based on the result, we give personalized tips and tricks. Our employee Assistance Program (external psychologists) is available for more complicated individual problems. We will implement these tools on a global scale in the near future. Employees suffering from stress can ask a member of our specialized team of stress coaches for help on a voluntary basis and staff management receives psychological training on recognizing signs of distress in their employees. Also, we have a security line, which our employees can call anytime 24/24 7/7.

Experience@ work gives these organizations the opportunity to hire senior employees at a junior pay level, and allows senior employees to use their talent, experience and expertise in a new working environment, while remaining on bpost’s payroll. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2018 120 Ethics and diversity CSR CONSOLIDATED bpost STATEMENTS bpost Belgium Subsidiaries People – Group Ethics and diversity Unit 2016 2017 2018 Trend 2018 2018 Total own employees Headcount 25,371 25,460 25,770 n/a 8,164 33,934 Total male own Headcount 17,107 17,269 17,585 n/a 4,203 21,788 employees Total female own Headcount 8,264 8,191 8,185 n/a 3,961 12,146 employees Total FTE FTE 23,178 23,353 23,658 n/a 7,849 31,507 Total male FTE FTE 16,013 16,202 16,500 n/a 4,085 20,584 Total female FTE FTE 7,165 7,152 7,158 n/a 3,768 10,926 Diversity of own employees (in headcount) Share of female (own % 32.6 32.2 31.8 48.5 35.8 employees) Share of women % n/a 0.00 0.00 14.29 13.04 in executive level positions Share of women in % 36 35.06 36.79 37.79 37.23 management positions (excl. executive level) Headcount by type of contract Total own employees Headcount 282 607 613 n/a 534 1,147 with fixed term contracts Total male own Headcount n/a 296 244 n/a 312 556 employees with fixed term contracts Total female own Headcount n/a 311 369 n/a 222 591 employees with fixed term contracts Total own employees Headcount 22,896 24,853 25,157 n/a 2,624 27,781 with open-ended contracts Total male own Headcount n/a 16,973 17,341 n/a 1,749 19,090 employees with open-ended contracts Total female Headcount n/a 7,880 7,816 n/a 875 8,691 own employees with open-ended contracts bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2018 121 bpost CSR bpost Belgium Subsidiaries People – Group CONSOLIDATED Ethics and diversity STATEMENTS Unit 2016 2017 2018 Trend 2018 2018 Headcount by full-time/part-time Total own employees Headcount 18,901 19,137 19,370 n/a 7,418 26,788 contracted on a fulltime basis Total male own Headcount n/a 14,039 14,285 n/a 3,905 18,190 employees contracted on a fulltime basis Total female Headcount n/a 5,098 5,085 n/a 3,513 8,598 own employees contracted on a fulltime basis Total own employees Headcount 6,470 6,323 6,400 n/a 745 7,145 contracted on a parttime basis Total male own Headcount n/a 3,230 3,300 n/a 301 3,601 employees contracted on a parttime basis Total female Headcount n/a 3,093 3,100 n/a 444 3,544 own employees contracted on a parttime basis Headcount by age group Total own employees Headcount 3,811 4,205 4,497 n/a 1,912 6,409 ≤ 30 years old Total own employees Headcount 12,922 12,717 12,601 n/a 3,957 16,558 within the age group 31-50 Total own employees Headcount 8,638 8,538 8,672 n/a 2,234 10,906 within the age group 50+ Employee turnover Employee Turnover of % 11.30 10.941 10.49 41.33 17.91 own employees Employee Turnover % 11.44 11.141 10.43 20.99 16.27 Male of own employees Employee Turnover % 10.97 10.511 10.63 20.34 20.83 Female of own employees Voluntary Employee % n/a 5.82 5.75 24.24 10.20 Turnover of own employees Voluntary Employee % n/a 5.96 5.91 11.59 9.11 Turnover Male of own employees Voluntary Employee % n/a 5.52 5.40 12.65 12.14 Turnover Female of own employees (1) Restatement based on standardization of definition. bpost ANNUAL REPORT 2018 122 bpost CSR bpost Belgium Subsidiaries People – Group CONSOLIDATED Ethics and diversity STATEMENTS Unit 2016 2017 2018 Trend 2018 2018 Ethics Number of registered Number 16 11 10 40 50 complaints on unethical workplace behavior Number of registered Number n/a 0 0 0 0 cases of corruption and bribery Monetary amount of Euros n/a 0 0 0 0 legal and regulatory fines and settlements above 10,000 USD linked to data breaches, corruption or environment damage Diversity and inclusiveness We also partner with Duo for a Job, a Belgian organization matching young job seekers with an At bpost, we aim to attract and retain individuals immigrant background to people over 50 years old.

By walking past every door every day, local postmen and postwomen can play a significant role in assessing whether older adults are socially isolated. Therefore, in eight Belgian municipalities, bpost started the bclose service in collaboration with the local social services. After approval by the older adults, their trusted postman or woman pays them a home visit to ask some brief questions, in order to get insight into what they might need. This information provided by our bclose’s services can be used confidentially to take action to help the isolated people and integrate them into community life. In 2018, we started a new wave of home visits in the municipality of Olen, in the province of Antwerp. Dynasure passport delivery Thanks to our subsidiary Dynasure, Antwerp citizens can now receive their renewed passport when its suits them best.

In the course of 2018 and in accordance with the Law of May 2, 2007 on the disclosure of significant shareholdings in listed companies and the Articles of Association, bpost published a number of transparency declarations disclosing that a notification threshold was reached (crossed upward or downward).
