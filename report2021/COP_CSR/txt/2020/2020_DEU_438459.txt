The 17 goals were published in September 2015 as part of the UN’s 2030 Agenda. They articulate the key challenges and resolutions of a global sustainability policy and thus serve as a guide for the sustainable development of society, culture, and economy. Because it is part of global value chains, the Krones Group also influences­ ­economic, environmental, and social developments – sometimes directly and materially and sometimes only indirectly and to a small extent. When assessing sustainability topics for materiality in 2019, we made the impact on SDGs a key factor. We held a stakeholder workshop with representatives from administration, trade associations, academia, and our employees in which we discussed the SDGs on which the Krones Group is already having an impact and which ones will need to be addressed in the future. The results of the workshop were part of our materiality analysis and have also been incorporated into our ­strategic planning of future sustainability-related activities. 1 | To our stakeholders 2 | environment 3 | society 4 | employees 5 | ethics 6 | market Materiality matrix 1 | 11 Materiality matrix Materiality analysis Definition statement pursuant to Section 289c (2) of the German ­ ommercial Code (HGB) and German Accounting Standard 20 (GAS 20) C The materiality matrix serves as the fundamental guide for sustainability management within the Krones Group.

The Executive Board adopted a corresponding action emissions for the long term. The following areas offer the greatest reduction plan alongside the CO2 reduction target. Besides the specific measures laid out potential: within the action plan, we are conducting a number of additional initiatives and projects to optimise energy and consumption in specific instances.

Back in 2009, we established enviro, a certified management system for promoting the development of energy and media-efficient machines and systems (see “Product sustainability”). With our energy and emissions management policy, KRONES is also contributing to climate protection within our own production operations (see “Decarbonisation”). We now aim to take our water and waste management to the next level. We have already laid the groundwork by obtaining ISO 14001 certification of the environmental management system for KRONES AG and our major production sites in China, the USA, and Brazil. Now we are focusing on transferring the account­ ability structures and processes defined there into a uniform, groupwide management system for waste and water consumption that goes above and beyond simply meeting statutory requirements and transparency rules. To advance the process of establishing systematic waste and water management across our organisation, we have to bundle ongoing measures, standardise data collection processes, and reassign responsibilities. We are already conducting initial analyses on the current situation. Because of the complexity of our production processes and their underlying value chains, it will take some time for us to complete a global inventory of our water and waste management. Therefore, our current focus is on implementing meaningful groupwide metrics that we can use to gain concrete insight about the relevance and reach of various measures. 1 | to our stakeholders 2 | environment 3 | society 4 | employees 5 | ethics 6 | market Resource conservation 2 | 19 Resource conservation – Additional information Attachment KRONES AG – Water consumption (m³ and m³ per €1 million in consolidated revenue) KRONES AG – Recoverable and non-recoverable waste (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in consolidated revenue) 130,324 127,334 112,285 224 120,000 18,753 18,000 286 262 80,000 16,711 16,626 15,000 35 32 40,000 29 40 20 12,000 2017 2018 2019 Absolute Per €1 million in consolidated revenue 9,000 0.06 5 0.08 4.87 0.07 KRONES AG – Total waste generated 4.53 6,000 4.20 (metric tonnes and metric tonnes per €1 million in consolidated revenue) 3 3,000 18,977 1 18,000 16,997 16,888 2017 2018 2019 Recyclable Non-recoverable Absolute Per €1 million in consol. revenue Absolute Per €1 million in consol. revenue 15,000 KRONES AG – Hazardous waste (metric tonnes) 12,000 1,243 1,194 9,000 1,200 1,089 4.92 4.60 4.27 5 6,000 800 3 3,000 400 unaudited 1 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Absolute Per €1 million in consolidated revenue 1 | to our stakeholders 2 | environment 3 | society 4 | employees 5 | ethics 6 | market Product sustainability 2 | 20 Product sustainability – Policy In our quest to continually increase the environmental sustainability of our 1.

Results In order to systematically increase information security on our products, we have identified eight cyber security principles and incorporated them into our policy: secure login information, system hardening, up-to-date products, continuous risk management, defined lifespans, secure life cycles, documentation, and point persons. These principles are applied to new Krones products and services. They have already been implemented in one of our major product lines and will be rolled out successively across the remaining product lines. Implementation of the EU GDPR was completed in 2019. Besides making adjustments to processes, this included target-group-specific communication and qualification measures aimed at raising awareness among responsible personnel in the regions. We have also initiated and maintained regular exchange among departments and sites. 4 Employees Employee satisfaction – Policy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29 1.

Krones signed the Diversity Charter in 2010, clearly expressing the company’s com­ mitment to promoting diversity within the group. Until now, our efforts have been limited to ad hoc measures. As announced in last year’s report, we have developed a diversity management policy with concrete action areas for the Krones Group. The new policy focuses on ensuring that our teams are diverse in terms of age, gender, and nationality with the aim of increasing efficiency, flexibility, and creativity within our organisation. To accomplish this, we will bundle existing activities, implement new measures, and set new targets. To effectively implement our diversity policy and live it sustainably, we need processes and tools that must first be established and implemented within the group. Because of the challenging economic environment, we will be introducing the diversity policy in stages beginning in 2020. For the sake of transparency, we provide some current numbers on the topic of diversity that are currently being managed by way of several targeted actions. 1 | to our stakeholders 2 | environment 3 | society 4 | Employees 5 | ethics 6 | market Diversity 4 | 38 Diversity – Additional information Attachment KRONES Group – Age structure 2019* KRONES Group – Gender ratio 2019* KRONES AG – Gender ratio 2019 30–50: 9,224 Men: 13,605 Men: 7,781 Under 30: 2,792 Women: 2,528 Women: 1,324 Over 50: 4,117 * A few smaller subsidiaries have not yet provided concrete numbers for these figures.

Goals Agile product development: Continue and optimise our use of the agile­ ­approach in development projects. Across-the-board portfolio management: Establish a strategic framework and coordinate development activities across the entire Krones Group with the aim of strengthening the company’s position as a supplier of complete solutions. Research and development ecosystem: Purposefully expand technological expertise by strengthening internal and external partnerships, for example by building expert teams for promising innovation topics. Update our innovation strategy: Develop and implement a top-down approach to innovation discovery and development that relies more heavily on a cross-functional focus on comprehensive solutions and vision-driven, anticipatory innovation instead of reactive, project-based development. 1 | to our stakeholders 2 | environment 3 | society 4 | employees 5 | ethics 6 | Market Customer matters 6 | 53 Customer matters – Policy Krones’ actions are guided by our customers’ requirements.
