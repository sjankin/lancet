To further implement the Principles 7, 8 and 9 of the UN Global Compact in our daily operations, StormGeo has identified a number of KPIs to measure our success. The work we do externally, particularly for our shipping clients, has big impacts on the environment. In 2019, we supported close to 65,000 voyages with weather routing, saving about 650,000 metric tons (MT) of fuel. This For 2019, these KPIs were: equates to the removal of close to 2 million MT of CO2 and more than 22,000 MT SOX from the atmosphere and I.

Additionally, we support 30% of all offshore wind production, providing enough energy to power more than 20 million homes per year. II. No increase in tons of CO2 equivalents (tCO2eq)/full-time equivalent (FTE) from previous reporting year. III. 3% overall reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from previous reporting year. StormGeo’s internal and external work on the environment are highlighted as part of our IV. Improve waste management practices throughout the StormGeo Group with increased communication and commitment to our vision and mission. initiatives. Here, KPI IV was fully achieved and I partially achieved, while KPI II and III were not. For KPI I we completed an ISO 14001 gap analysis, with 80% documentation ready for certification. KPIs II and III are measured through annual carbon account reports. These allow us to benchmark our carbon footprint and evaluate our progress over time. // Vision At StormGeo, we have been reporting on our carbon accounting since 2011. We now report from all our offices A world beyond climate change. with at least five FTEs. In 2019, this was 15 offices, accounting for 521.7 of the total 543.0 FTEs in StormGeo (96.1%). In comparison, nine offices reported in 2018, accounting for 312.1 of the total 401.0 FTEs (77.8%) At StormGeo, we know that climate change has to be confronted.

Using conversion factors, the data are then converted to carbon footprints; that is, the total GHG emissions caused by the reported activity, measured in tCO2eq. The factors are purchased from the specialized sustainability // Mission consultancy CEMAsys, using the international standard A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised edition) by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP). Every day, we enable our clients to navigate a changing environment by unlocking the value of data. Input data and conversion factors are compiled and verified by our Global HSSE and Sustainability Managers, who present the data in an annual carbon accounting report. The report is broken down into three scopes: We believe the most important decisions should be made based on leading edge advanced analytics with the most reliable data. StormGeo’s mission is to be a trusted resource our • Scope 1 Direct GHG emissions due to fuel combustion, company vehicles and fugitive emissions. clients can turn to, guiding them through a rapidly changing future. • Scope 2 Indirect GHG emissions due to consumption of electricity, heating/cooling and steam. • Scope 3 Indirect GHG emissions from other sources such as purchased goods and services, investments, leased assets and franchises, transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting, waste disposal and use of sold products. // 12 // 13 // stormgeo. committment of progress. 2020 In 2019, our overall carbon footprint was 2,780 tCO2eq, of which 2 tCO2eq, 336 tCO2eq and 2,442 StormGeo’s total footprint was 254.8% higher than in 2018. We believe this increase can be explained by tCO2eq came from Scopes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Figure 1 presents these numbers, illustrating various factors. First, the carbon accounting in 2019 represents 521.7 FTEs relative to 312.1 FTEs in 2018 due how StormGeo’s largest carbon footprint stems from indirect GHG emissions. to acquisitions. Second, we improved our reporting methods for 2019, resulting in more complete reporting in existing categories and more extensive reporting in new categories relative to 2018. Third, we saw a substantial increase in business air travel, at least in part due to the extraordinary situation of having first an interim CEO, 2,500 then later a new CEO, who both visited most of our 24 offices worldwide. On the other hand, in two of the categories where we had complete reporting in 2018, stationary combustion 2,000 (scope 1) and energy consumption (scope 2), we measured a considerable decrease. These changes come from our three American offices, which continued to switch their energy sources from fossil fuels to non-GHG emitting 1,500 sources in 2019. Taking StormGeo’s growth in personnel and offices over the last year into account, the 2019 carbon footprint 1,000 was 127.1% and 139.0% higher than in 2018 per FTE and office area, respectively. These numbers may provide a more accurate picture of the success of our environmental measures, empowering us to better tailor our environmental procedures to reduce our 2020 carbon footprint under the new and improved reporting methods. 500 For 2020, we have set the following KPIs related to the environment: 0 i.

Reduce non-recycled waste going to landfills and incineration from 30% to 25%. 2017 iii. Reduce our overall greenhouse gas emissions by 3% relative to 2019.

The scope 1 number for 2019 is 2 tCO2eq and thus difficult to discern. v. Close gaps for ISO 14001 certification. We continue to strive toward these KPIs and measure them every month, or when applicable. They help us drive business awareness and action in support of achieving SDGs 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities, 12 on Responsible Consumption and Production, 13 on Climate Action, 14 on Life Below Water, and 17 on Partnerships for the Goals. Given COVID-19 in 2020 where our employees began working remotely, we have seen the merits of a remote workforce. We expect to continue this flexibility going forward and believe this will further reduce emissions with fewer employees traveling to an office, increased virtual meetings and less business travel. // 14 // 15 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + // stormgeo. committment of progress. 2020 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Referring to Principle 10 of the UN Global Compact, StormGeo works against corruption in all its forms, including + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + extortion and bribery.
