We at Al Naboodah Group have taken these challenges very seriously, and continue to search for best practices to achieve our goals and strategic objectives, in a holistic approach in which every aspect is considered in addressing these challenges. We believe that with great challenge comes great opportunity, so sustainability must therefore be at the forefront of our operations. Those of us in the construction industry need to collaborate to prepare for the coming changes and create a sustainable built environment for generations to come. In order to have healthy communities, clean air and a non-toxic environment and maintain a certain rate or level of economic growth whilst maintaining an ecological balance, Sustainability has to be embraced by everyone both at home and work.

The Board of Directors support this policy, aiming to conduct a responsible and profitable business. Sustainability is communicated to the rest of the Group through the Sustainability Framework, which provides clear strategic directions through yearly goals and targets, identified through stakeholder engagement workshops. The Sustainability Framework is based on the triple-bottom line – Working as a Family (social), Unlocking Potential (economic) and Responsible Consumption (environmental). These pillars translate into objectives, targets and initiatives that are reassessed annually to ensure continuous improvement. The annual goals and targets are implemented across the Group. GOALS & TARGETS Figure 6. ANGE Sustainability Framework 23 ADOPTING SUSTAINABILITY A GLOBAL FRAMEWORK – THROUGH REGIONAL ACTIONS The world’s interwoven challenges require collaboration and a shared responsibility and vision. The United Nation’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recognise this reality and provide a global framework to protect the planet and ensure that all people thrive and prosper. ANGE plays a leading role in the UAE, with the potential to contribute to regional and global sustainable priorities. To focus the Group’s efforts and understand its impact, ANGE has conducted an extensive exercise to map its sustainability objectives with the 17 UN SDGs. ANGE’s Sustainability Framework is also aligned to the UAE Vision 2021 Agenda. This way, the Group synergises with global and local sustainability goals and targets.

This value creation is vital to achieving business growth and a sustainable competitive advantage. ANGE firmly believes effective engagement helps translate stakeholder needs into organisational goals and creates the basis of effective and focused strategy development. As such, in 2019, under the Working as a Family pillar, the Group introduced various stakeholder engagement initiatives that further strengthen the relationship based on mutual benefit and trust. ENGAGING WITH OUR EMPLOYEES Engaging with our employees is key to successful integration of sustainability across the Group. ANGE strives to capture the interest of employees through interactive and engaging activities throughout the year and during the annual Sustainability Week. Upon joining ANGE, employees are immediately introduced to the Group’s Sustainability strategy and framework during onboarding induction, and provided with a Sustainability toolkit. In addition, employees are required to participate in an online sustainability training session that explains its strategic importance and emphasises the role of the employee in the Group’s sustainability journey. During 2019, 135 new employees completed this online training. 38 OPERATIVE HAPPINESS SURVEY In ANGE’s annual operatives survey, participants anonymously respond to a series of questions that reflects employee happiness levels across several RESPONSE RATE OVERALL OPERATIVE SATISFACTION areas.

For 2020, the Group aims to maintain the same response rate and happiness levels, using regional languages to facilitate participation. At Al Naboodah Construction Group, the Facilities Management Department is always focused on adding value to the organisation’s business competitiveness with the motto ‘think strategically and target operationally’. We are in compliance with sustainability objectives set for the year concerning cost savings on energy, resources, materials, etc. Equally, we ensure that Sustainable Practises are always maintained across all facilities, and we are delighted to showcase our facilities both internally & externally to demonstrate best practice in the market. Manzoorudeen KK Facilities Manager 39 EMPLOYEE HAPPINESS SURVEY Alongside the Operatives Survey, it is also important for ANGE to evaluate the happiness rate of its staff. In 2019, 949, out of approximately 2,000 employees, participated and rated their overall happiness rate with ANGE. From results its noted that 91% of employees are ‘Happy’ or ‘Very Happy’ working in the Group.

Benny Vargheese – Head of Human Resources – Construction and Commercial Group 41 SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT PERFORMANCE EVALUATION With the objective of serving its employees better through creating practices that would drive Sustainability as a strategic objective across the Group and create value for all, ANGE rolled out the Sustainability Department Performance Evaluation in 2019. Feedback was gathered from eight CGUs and nine departments that the Sustainability department works closely with and supports. The evaluation helped the department to refocus and understand how their work and contributions over the course of the year fit within the organisation. It also allowed them to look at what is working and what is not, which will be a tremendous benefit to map out future sustainability goals. SUSTAINABILITY TOOLKIT In 2019, the Sustainability Team revised the Sustainability Toolkit that includes detailed information about ANGE’s sustainability approach, and general 800 information on sustainability related topics, and encourages employees to get involved with many different initiatives across the Group, enabling them to play a more strategic role in driving sustainability. Online Sustainability SUSTAINABILITY PLEDGE Pledge Reinforcing sustainability as a strategic objective is an ongoing commitment for all. The Sustainability Pledge reached over 2,000 employees, and during 2019 Sustainability Week employees reinforced their commitment by taking the online pledge, taking the number of responses to more than 800. 42 SUSTAINABILITY WEEK For the fourth consecutive year, ANGE’s Sustainability Week brought together OVER employees, key partners and suppliers, and more, to focus on ANGE’s sustainability pillars and material topics.

AGRICULTURE DIVISION HOSTED WORKSHOP ON DATE PALM FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT The Agriculture business of Swaidan Trading hosted the hugely successful training programme in Al Ain. As part of its long-standing partnership with the Al Ain Municipality to preserve and maintain the important date palm plantations in the area, Swaidan Trading’s Agriculture business has a responsibility to keep abreast of new avenues for sustainable management of the plantations. In this regard, the business hosted a workshop entitled ‘Rediscovering Date Palm for Sustainable Development’, which explored both traditional and pioneering new techniques for recycling date palm waste for useful and viable applications. Our agriculture business is considered a leading authority in the field of date palm preservation, so this was a significant event on the topic in the GCC region and was well attended by staff from the Al Ain Municipality, the media and government officials. The business was presented with a Certificate of Appreciation from the Al Ain Municipality for their efforts in hosting the successful workshop. 45 EMPLOYEE WELFARE Employee welfare ranks as the fourth highest material topic for ANGE and There were several initiatives we took in 2019 to provide exceptional employees are at the core of its success.

ANGE’s Worker Welfare Policy and programme ensure the Group is in line with EXPO 2020 mandates and principles, whilst at the same time upholding UNGC Principles on Labour and Human Rights. In addition to briefings on employment and human rights given directly by the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation, ANGE workers have access to award-winning accommodation, free health check-ups, regular recreational activities and trips, barbers, ATMs, gyms, free WiFi and cuisine tailored to their countries of origin. Regular open forums take place in employee accommodation villages and offer workers the opportunity to ’have a voice’ and make suggestions for improvement or raise any challenges they may face, in a non-confrontational environment. Feedback informs the Group that operatives appreciate this opportunity and the suggestions that ANGE has adopted as a result. ANGE was the proud recipient of the UAE’s Happiest Working Environment award for three consecutive years, decisively confirming its status as the employer of choice in the UAE. 46 EMPLOYEE WELFARE Reinforcing our commitment to ‘Working as a Family’ and the welfare of As a Key Strategic Objective, the Group IT our employees, we celebrated World Labour Day across our Employee department understands the important role Villages on the 1st May 2019 by conducting various activities such as fun games, a singing competition and other exciting programmes.

Scott McLaughlin – Senior HSE Manager, Compliance ANCG 9 HSE: Health, Safety and Environment 51 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY As the workforce at most project sites comprises both Group employees and those of subcontractors, suppliers are expected to comply with ANGE’s high H&S standards and all legal requirements, such as maintaining an HSE plan and training their employees with approved third parties. Regular inspections and audits ensure these standards are met. Contractors are invited to attend specialised training delivered by ANGE to its employees, for example training on high-risk activities, ensuring a full H&S knowledge baseline on site. One key element of ANGE’s H&S approach is Visible Felt Leadership (VFL), which visibly involves top management in site safety. The award-winning programme sets periodic tours by management to project sites, to inspect the facilities and talk to the workers. Project managers conduct weekly tours, managers conduct monthly tours and Senior Management visit the projects every quarter. A report is issued at the end of the tour with key findings and recommendations for corrective measures. During 2019, 2,901 VFL tours were conducted across ANGE sites, making management accessible to the workforce and highlighting the overarching commitment of ANGE to H&S. In addition to the commitment of the top management, the commitment of employees is key to maintaining a safe workplace.

During 2019, we continued to conduct classroom and Visual Impact Training sessions aimed at encouraging the workforce to accurately report Near Misses. With these initiatives, the number of minor first aid cases recorded reduced from 171 cases in 2018 to 140 cases in 2019. The reporting of Near Misses, Unsafe Acts and Unsafe Conditions was also positive throughout the year with 1052 Near Misses being reported. The reporting of Near Misses is an important part of our Health & Safety Strategy and one of our key Leading Indicators, as it gives us an excellent opportunity to be proactive in putting the necessary 2017 2018 2019 controls in place to ensure future accidents/incidents are prevented.

Therefore: ISR of 6 is calculated as follows 243 x 1,000,000 / 40,525,796= 6. 10 11 Lost Time Injuries are injuries that result in more than 3 days off work, not including the day of the accident. A Near Miss is defined as an unplanned event which did not result in injury, illness, or damage but had the potential to do so. 53 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY ZERO-STRIKE-360 ZERO-STRIKE-360 is an initiative designed to raise awareness on the dangers of working with (or in close proximity to) construction vehicles and/or heavy plant and equipment. It is an acronym which stands for: ZERO – 0 Strikes by machinery is the target! S – Scan the Area for workers before operating plant & equipment T – Trained Workers & operators are required for Man-Machine Interaction activities R – Reversing Vehicles must be directed by a flagman and have an audible reversing warning I – Increase Visibility by wearing high-vis clothing and ensure work areas are illuminated K – Keep a Safe Distance of 5 meters from plant & equipment at all times E – Exclusion Zones established around work areas to prevent unauthorised access 360 – 360° Field of Vision should always be maintained by operators around plant & equipment The initiative has given and continues to give the workforce a better understanding of the dangers when working with, or in close proximity to construction vehicles and/or heavy plant and equipment. It is also identified as one of ANCG’s ‘Critical Activities’ and forms one of its ‘Life Saving Rules’ (LSR’s), which are regularly communicated to the workforce and who are randomly tested during Senior Management Safety Tours for their understanding of these LSR’s. The delivery of the Visual Impact Training in the operatives’ native language also significantly contributes to safer working practices on sites. Near Miss reporting increased and incidents decreased in the second half of the year, and there have been ZERO strikes involving man & machine interaction. 54 SAFEGUARDING HEALTH AND SAFETY Lagging indicators Leading indicators KPI TARGET ACTUAL KPI TARGET ACTUAL Lost Time Injury frequency rate 0.08 0.12 Project Management HSE inspections 100% 100% (four per calendar month) All accident frequency rate 5.90 2.81 Near miss reporting frequency rate 18.60 21.18 Injury severity rate 5.00 4.99 Delivery of structured HSE training 100% 100% Restricted Work Day Case Frequency Rate Introduced in 2019 0.22 1 Mass tbt per project per week 100% 100% Restricted Work Day Case Severity Rate Introduced in 2019 2.71 USACFR 98.00 214.96 (Unsafe Acts & Conditions Frequency Rate) Table 11.

Gareth Main – SHEQ Manager, Operations 57 HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES: SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT (SIA) Typically employed in the construction business, SIA is a tool to identify and assess how the design and construction of a building or civil engineering project will impact the internal workforce, the nearby community, and other associated stakeholders. An SIA assesses social issues such as people’s way of life, and health and well-being, as well as environmental impact and the interactions between the two. Formal implementation of social impact assessments at ANGE formed part of the 2018 SHEQ objectives and targets, and SIAs were employed in the Group’s most recent projects to identify potential impacts and determine mitigation measures. The aim of the Social Impact Assessment is to mitigate and minimise any potential impact on the immediate community by the Group’s projects. In 2020, we plan to form a Project Environmental Engagement Team(EETs) with the objective of driving forward the environmental actions and targets of a project and to contribute towards progress measured against the business Sustainability Strategy. 58 H&S TRAINING 2017 2018 2019 2017 2018 2019 Total number of employees covered 12,378 9,031 11,193 Total number of training 60 59 75 courses/sessions available MALE 12,267 8,908 11,109 Total number of training 86,146.50 61,297.50 24,246.00 FEMALE 111 123 84 hours MALE 85,923.85 60,859.50 24,037.00 Employee category FEMALE 222.65 438 209 Executive & senior management 24 12 23 Middle management 112 179 194 Table 12.

This represents a significant decrease in carbon emissions which is a result of the adoption of clean energy sources and efficient energy use. 14 The data reported in the Managing energy efficiency section corresponds to the Group’s activities in the United Arab Emirates. 15 Fuel consumption includes Diesel and Petrol which is directly spent on Generators/vehicles/etc. 16 Data for the consumption of self-generated energy at National Plant includes 2019 full year data. 17 https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement 18 Scope 1 emissions refer to GHG emissions derived from non-renewable energy consumption 19 Scope 2 emissions refer to the electricity consumption by the Group’s assets. 75 20 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions only include CO2 gas . ENERGY EFFICIENT OFFICES AT EXPO 2020 CAR PARK PROJECT WHY WE DID IT? Part of our Sustainability Wheel includes ’Responsible Consumption’, and as a Group we recognise the importance of managing our energy consumption more efficiently by applying best practices. HOW WE DID IT? An energy assessment was conducted in the site office cabins with the objective of measuring energy consumption. Energy reduction can be achieved in two ways by using energy efficient products and reducing the amount of electricity used (Switching off lights and unplugging sockets). Introducing skylights as part of the cabin’s design replaced LED lights, and the natural light from these skylights helped to reduce the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination as LED lights. All meeting rooms and washrooms were fitted with motion sensors which helped to save unnecessary energy wastage and reduce the total electricity demand. An Energy Simulation was done by energy analysis software Visual DOE 4.1 to evaluate the energy consumption of the proposed site office in line with the methodology described in ASHRAE 90.1-2007 standards. VALUE CREATED With skylights usage, the total energy savings per month were recorded as 644.40 kWh. It can be inferred from the results that the site office building will save 13.62% energy when compared with ASHRAE 90.1-2007 budget building. ANGE’s effort to drive sustainability across the company in 2019 led us to be appreciated by the Dubai Municipality Waste Management Department that follows the Best Waste Management Practices across the Emirates. John Cortez SHEQ Manager 76 REDUCING WASTE ANGE believes that waste management is a pivotal environmental factor due to ANGE generated a total of 98,158.44 tonnes of waste, of which 82% corresponds the nature of its operations and the materials it uses. Waste management is an to construction waste. integral part of the UAE’s green growth vision and ANGE continuously strives to improve waste management procedures to help conserve and properly manage The decrease with respect to the generation of hazardous and non-hazardous natural resources. Optimising efficiencies in waste management supports the UAE waste in 2017 and 2018 is due to various factors including the number of facilities, Vision 2021 to ensure sustainable development 21 and the SDG 12 Responsible number of active employees, implementation of Project Alpha, etc. Consumption and Production. 22 Waste generated through ANGE activities (tonnes) A degree of progress was achieved in the waste management area during 2019 Construction waste 80,896.3 after launching Project Alpha, an internal project of ANGE that was launched with `Residential waste 5,592.95 the objective of streamlining consumption data into one platform to reduce cost and improve on our resourcefulness. As many as 100 different waste streams were identified and segregated by type. Table 19.
