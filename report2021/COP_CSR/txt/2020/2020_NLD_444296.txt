OUR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY At Ohpen we are committed to the highest professional and ethical standards, regarding both people and planet. PLANET It's greener in the cloud, with an 88% reduction on CO2 emissions. The cloud-native strategy we've followed since 2009, helps reduce our clients' environmental footprint. In addition, we believe 'every small thing helps' which is why we use 100% renewable energy, have a no-car policy and work with a strict procurement policy for all our partners. PEOPLE We strongly believe that compliance and ethics is an active attitude and not just a set of regulations. It is a system of moral principles. These principles are as diverse as the fabric we are made of. The Ohpen team values diversity and inclusion; gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, age, etc. It strengthens us, as more opinions and backgrounds bring new perspectives. We do not engage with parties that are in violation of the ILO Fundamental Principles and Rights at work.

ENVIRONMENT 5.1 United Nations Global Compact Principles on Environment • Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; • Principle 8: Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; • Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 5.2 Sustainability Our main contribution to sustainability can be found in the reduction of our clients’ environmental footprint. Our core banking engine not only liberates our clients from outdated legacy software, but it also helps them reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. By harnessing the energy efficiency of the cloud, instead of hosting their applications on-premise, we enable our clients to reduce these emissions by 88%. In September 2018, we have started a program to further decrease our use of computing power to preserve energy. Our cloud provider, AWS, is committed to running its business in the most environmentally friendly way possible. In 2018, AWS achieved 50% renewable energy usage. 5.3 Implementation • At Ohpen we also actively pursue the reduction of our own environmental footprint. We only use products and services that have the highest energy efficiency, can be fully recycled and harm neither people nor the environment. Therefore, Ohpen chooses its suppliers very carefully and mindfully: All our in-house printing is done on 100% FSC Certified recycled paper, double-sided and by using bio-degradable ink; Ohpen collaborates only sustainable tea and coffee vendors. These suppliers help Ohpen reduce its environmental impact, but also contribute to the quality of the lives of all those involved in growing, harvesting and processing the coffee and tea; Ohpen uses only local vendors to reduce its carbon footprint and, to support local businesses; the cleaning company is required to only use eco products with European Ecolabel . • All our offices strictly follow all three waste reduction components “Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle”: Ohpen actively raises and promotes awareness of water and energy-saving methods; Ohpen AMS procures renewable 100% electricity generated by wind turbines; In 2019 Ohpen Barcelona installed a water fountain on the premises which provides high quality filtered water for the employees and prevents using any forms of bottled water; Ohpen implemented a waste separation system; We further limited the use of materials by going paperless where possible (e.g. using DocuSign); Ohpen banned disposable cutlery (cups, straws, plates etc). We use only reusable cutlery made of ceramic, metal or wood. • In 2019 Ohpen invested in 4Ocean hot and cold water bottles. Supporting 4Ocean for Ohpen is a perfect way to preserve the planet for the next generation. • Ohpen pro-actively encourages sustainability by informing and educating Ohpeneers throughout the year. These typically include dedicated leaflets, stating the latest efforts, initiatives, achievements, waste streams, vendors and challenges ahead titled Together for a sustainable future . United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 9/16 DocuSign Envelope ID: D409D9E0-8610-4BE9-A429-E99BB4FD18E7 • Ohpen adheres to a strict public transport preference policy and does not provide parking space or company cars. Visitors are encouraged to travel by public transport as well. Our Ohpeneers in HQ are provided with NS-business cards to enable this core believe. • Ohpen has invested in state-of-the-art remote conferencing equipment in its offices to prevent travel where it's not necessary. • Our new goal is to reduce the usage of plastic and be 80% plastic-free by the end of 2021. 5.4 Measurements of outcome The utilities consumption (heating gas, electricity and water) of Ohpen is listed in the table below.

ANTI-CORRUPTION 6.1 United Nations Global Compact Principles on Anti-Corruption Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 6.2 Anti-Corruption at Ohpen Integrity is our “raison d’etre”. Our clients trust some of their most important activities to our comp any. Without our integrity and commitment to ethical business standards, our clients can’t trust us, and we have no right to exist. The purpose of the financial services industry is to foster growth, investments and increase economic activities. Corruption is antithetical to that. 6.3 Implementation • The Ohpen general code of conduct specifically prohibits engaging in any type or form of corruption. The Ohpen code of conduct is, in its entirety, part of the labour agreement and is binding to all employees and management; • The Ohpen code of conduct not only explicitly prohibits engaging in corrupt practices and bribery but also provides guidance in cases of potential conflict of interest; • Ohpen employees are not allowed to conduct business with companies, institutions or individuals when prohibited by law or generally considered socially unacceptable; • Ohpen employees are not allowed to: offer or accept or gifts with a value higher than € 50, accept invitations for events or occasions other than of professional or functional nature or accept money or directly to money deducible objects; • Ohpen, employees are not allowed to conduct private business with business relationships of Ohp en, without prior consent of the company board. The board only approves if there is no (appearance) of conflict of interest and objective, market-based prices or fees are charged. 6.4 Measurement of outcomes Our code of conduct lays out the procedure for (confidentially) reporting violations of our code of conduct, breaches of integrity and other issues relating human rights. Annually, our processes, procedures and methods of working are audited and scrutinized by independent and accredited auditors and to date we have had zero findings of corruption or otherwise improper behaviour.

CAUSES WE SUPPORT 7.1 Financial Literacy Ohpen is committed to financial literacy and in sharing the team’s vast first-hand experience in the financial industry. By learning how to handle their finances better automatically increases people’s quality of life. 7.1.1 Monkey Money Mind In 2019, founder of Ohpen, Chris Zadeh and Angelique Schouten, board member, co-authored a book on the psychological influences when making financial decisions. The aim of this book is to raise awareness of common personal finance pitfalls and how to avoid them, helping readers to become money -literate. As part of the campaign in spreading the word on why we stop thinking when we start spending, Ohpen encourages anyone who buys the book to include sections of the book in presentations they give; alternatively, Chris and Angelique also make themselves available to speak at other organizations’ internal or external events to discuss the topics in Monkey Money Mind. 7.2 Conservation and Animal Welfare As part of our commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability, Ohpen supports animal welfare and the conservation of the environment. United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 12/16 DocuSign Envelope ID: D409D9E0-8610-4BE9-A429-E99BB4FD18E7 7.2.1 The Gorilla Organization Ohpen supports this cause by donating all the proceeds of Monkey Money Mind to The Gorilla Organization (TGO). TGO is a registered charity in England and Wales (charity number 11177131) that takes a new community-led approach to protect the endangered mountain gorillas in Africa. TGO provides innovative and award-winning sustainable initiatives to support the local people in the area by developing their entrepreneurial and organic farming skills, thereby reducing their dependence of the forest and mitigating climate change. United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 13/16 DocuSign Envelope ID: D409D9E0-8610-4BE9-A429-E99BB4FD18E7 7.3 Diversity & Well-being At Ohpen, we believe that committing your organization to promote diversity and well -being can have profound effects. For this reason, we highly support both, not only in the workplace but outside as well. 7.3.1 KZ/Hiltex Sponsorship Ohpen is a proud sponsor of KZ/Thermo4U club since 2017. Korfball is a ball sport with Dutch origins, played by two teams of eight players. Each team is made up of four women and four men. The objective is to throw a ball through a bottomless basket that is mounted on a 3.5 m high pole. Next to being a very fast and technical game, korfball sets itself apart from other major sports by being a mixed sport. By choosing to sponsor KZ/Thermo4U, a team that has always been among the top in the region, Ohpen not only emphasizes its commitment to sports and well-being but also its commitment to gender equality. In the Netherlands, over 100.000 people play korfball, and its popularity is rapidly growing in the United States and Taiwan. 7.3.2 StayConnected Ohpen supported StayConnected by donating iPads to support hospitals in the Netherlands at the beginning of the corona crisis. The idea of StayConnected is to provide all IC beds in the Netherlands with iPads, so that the hospital staff could establish a secure connection between the patients and their home front, when they needed each other most. United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 14/16 DocuSign Envelope ID: D409D9E0-8610-4BE9-A429-E99BB4FD18E7 7.4 Supporting the fight against Cancer Additionally, Ohpen supports the fight against cancer by sponsoring parties that raise money for cancer research. 7.4.1 Mark Slats Sponsorship Since 2018, Ohpen entered a sponsor agreement with Mark Slats, who competed in the world’s toughest and longest non-stop solo sailing race, The Golden Globe Race, to raise money for cancer research. The Golden Globe Race is a non-stop 30,000 nautical mile solo race, without any modern technology or outside assistance. In February 2019, Mark Slats, a carpenter by trade, finished 2nd place in the Golden Globe Race. With his ingenuity and resourcefulness, Mark, who is not a professional sailor, reminds us of how we can achieve more with less resources. 7.4.2 Aniek Hendriksz Second to None Another way that Ohpen advocates for cancer research is by supporting the foundation Aniek Hendriksz Second to None. This foundation is fully committed to raising money for research to combat brain tumours and works closely with the brain cancer research team from the Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital. 7.4.3 Roses & butterflies In early 2018, Ohpeneer Esther Beekhuis founded Roses and Butterflies to spread some color to seriously ill children going through a dark time at hospitals across the Netherlands. Her foundation creates and distributes unique handmade dollhouse suitcases to the children’s ward at local hospitals. The dollhouses are donated to patients with the hopes of provide them some comfort and offer a distraction that allows them to withdraw into their own dream world during such a difficult period. Made with a lot of love, patience and dedication, each dollhouse suitcase includes a personal painting that hangs in it. The paintings are made by children (aged 1-10 years old) who also want to help and spread some joy. Along with each dollhouse suitcase are also two bracelets which recipients can share with a friend their favorite nurse or whoever they choose that stands by them day and night. There is a pink version for the girls and a cool blue one for the boys for the age of 3 and up and a toddler version from 1 -3 years is available in a “build yourself a wooden dollhouse” suitcase. At the moment, Roses and Butterflies has distributed 370 suitcases at: • The two locations of the Amsterdam UMC; • VieCuri Hospital Venlo; • Spaarne Hospital Haarlem; • Hospital Rivierenland Tiel; • Tjongerschans Heerenveen; United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 15/16 DocuSign Envelope ID: D409D9E0-8610-4BE9-A429-E99BB4FD18E7 • Rijnstate Arnhem; • Due to the COVID19 the dollhouse suitcases for the UMCG Groningen and the Wilhelmina Child hospital Utrecht are stored safely, soon we will distribute these. They are now working on 70 new cases for a total of 450 by the end of this year. Roses and Butterflies created also a XOXO Journal, a positive journal for the NICU babies. A pilot has started at the Rijnstate Arnhem. United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2020 16/16
