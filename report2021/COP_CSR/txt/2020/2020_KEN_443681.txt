Scope of the CoP The year 2020 has been very challenging for the business environment from a macroeconomic perspective. It has severely adversely impacted our operations. Nevertheless, the activities, initiatives and measures put in place to ensure full compliance and implementation of the UNGC principles and adherence to COVID-19 pandemic procedures that preserve out workforce have been covered in the report. 2|P A G E In the different areas of the principles, Brand ID Technologies East Africa Limited’s management also has mechanisms of measurement of the results against the set goals in line with UNGC’s Human Rights, Labour, and Environment and Anti-corruption policies. 1. Human Rights UN Global Compact Principles covered: Principle 1: Business should support and respect the protection of internationally Proclaimed human rights. Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Current Commitment Brand ID Technologies East Africa Limited as a company is committed to family-friendly policies that provide employees with a safe and conducive working environment in line with the international human rights as well as adequate resources to perform optimally in their roles. These policies are aligned to the employment act to ensure full compliance with the law. A brief description of our Processes or System We have a HR management team who ensure that the rights of our employees and stakeholders are adhered to. These policies are made clear to the employees through the company’s handbook. • We have 30 annual leave days per year to all employees to enable them to have ample rest as required and are approved by respective manager, up to 10 days compassionate leave for employees who are bereaved in their immediate family or other immediate family members’ matters. Also, our employees are entitled to sick leave with full pay on production of a certificate of incapacity to work signed by a duly qualified Medical Practitioner or a person acting on the Practitioner’s behalf from an acceptable Medical Centre. • Maternity/paternity leave: We also offer female employees (3) three months maternity leave with full pay in addition to their annual leave entitlement while male employees are entitled to two (2) weeks paternity leave • We have a safe, secure and neat working environment. From March 2020, we have instituted a work-from-home policy and advocated for strict adherence to GoK COVID-19 preventive measures during office visits and client site visits. • Similarly, we host all our clients’ data with a reputable service provider – Amazon Web Services. We also use secure encryption mechanisms to ensure that client data is not breached so that individual and personal data is not revealed. We are also not collecting any individual’s identifier information. Measurement of outcomes We have managed to retain all of our staff by cutting back on expenditure so as to ensure that all these families remain catered for. Further, even with work-from-home policy in place, there has not been severe disruptions to our business. We measure this indicator through the number of leave days with paid leave. In the past year, 1 male staff member has proceeded to paternity leave. Additionally, one staff member has also proceeded to 3 months of paid maternity leave. None of our IT systems have been breached this year; ensuring that our brand protection software solution assists our client with the correct data and parameters to detect counterfeiters. Sources of this information We presently keep manual records and are guided by our own HR manual. We also draw this information from our balance sheet and income statements. 3|P A G E 2. Labour Rights UN Global Compact Principles covered: Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.

A brief description of our Processes or System The company has an able HR team which ensures that the rights of its employees and stakeholders are adhered to and none • The Company does not treat an employee or job applicant less favorably for any reason relating to their disability, gender, race or tribe.

Environment Rights UN Global Compact Principles covered: Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. 4|P A G E Current Commitment Brand ID Technologies East Africa Limited understands as a company, we are committed in ensuring that we operate and take initiatives that will promote our company as environmentally responsible and a company that embraces environmentally friendly technologies in its businesses. Being primarily an IT services company, important to us are three main factors: the number of servers running, the total energy required to power each server, and the carbon intensity of energy sources used to power these servers which all impact carbon emissions. We also understand that Amazon web services are run by solar farms and wind farms. Measurement of outcomes • Work from home policy: o Brand ID technologies has fully implemented work from hope policy that is contributing to less commute for our staff – thereby impactive the environment positively. • Hosting: o A typical large-scale cloud provider achieves approximately 65% server utilization rates versus 15% onpremises, which means when companies move to the cloud, they typically provision fewer than ¼ of the servers than they would on-premises o In addition, a typical on-premises data center is 29% less efficient in their use of power compared to a typical large-scale cloud provider that uses world-class facility designs, cooling systems, and workloadoptimized equipment. Sources of this information Our IT systems database contains the unique identifiers which were allocated to products. Internally, these records are manually maintained. 4. Anti-Corruption UN Global Compact principles covered Principle 10: Business should work against corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery. Current Commitment: We remain committed to implementing the10th principle of anti‐corruption and ensuring its total elimination in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. A brief description of our Processes or Systems • We have clearly demarcated governance structures that all employees are aware of and that have the full backing of the management. • We have guidelines and policies on anti-corruption. Corruption remains an offence in Brand ID Technologies East Africa Limited and the offence is punishable by termination and prosecution. For example: o To maintain business and personal ethics, cumulative annual value of all gifts or entertainment an employee may receive from any one gift giver cannot exceed 5000/=. If it does, or for some reason they HAVE to accept it, they have to disclose this to the management. o Altogether, as a rule we encourage employees (and in some cases enforce) to decline gifts, entertainment, etc. from companies who are competitors or whom we are doing business with. • We also have a policy in place to curb any conflict of interest and to ensure that all tenders are analyzed and opened before a panel to ensure transparency and accountability. 5|P A G E • Our products and services promote transparency and accountability to stamp out counterfeits and monies accruing out of illicit trade. • A proper remuneration plan is in place and will provide employees with the necessary and sufficient resources to match their needs. This way, there will be elimination of conflict of interests in the company’s operations. • Brand ID Technologies East Africa Limited has published its a code of ethics internally which, together with education and awareness, will enhance transparency among all staff hence averting any possible cases of corruption. Measurement of outcomes • We have continued declined to pay facilitation payments in the last year – at great cost to our firm. In fact, where it has been demanded or implied, we have chosen not to do business. • We have been able to realize actionable data for our clients – that shows data evidence in trends in counterfeiting – by quantifying the problem, they can practically survey the market and tackle the problem using the help of enforcement agencies and measure success. There have been 2 successful raids as actioned from data we have mined from our system. Sources of this information This information can be verified from our existing clients and now also in the media. 5. How do we intend to make this CoP available to our stakeholders?
