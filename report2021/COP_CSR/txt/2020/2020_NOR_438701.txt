The Group’s main reporting and the composition of the business areas, see products are biopolymers and biovanillin from lignin and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statement. speciality cellulose, but the product portfolio also includes second generation bioethanol, pharma intermediates and BioSolutions develops, produces and sells biopolymers and cellulose fibrils. biovanillin from lignin. Biopolymers are used as binding and dispersing agents in a wide range of end-market Borregaard’s niche products serve applications in a wide applications, such as construction, industrial binders, range of end-markets including construction, agriculture, agrochemicals and batteries. Biovanillin is supplied to food and beverages, transport and pharmaceuticals. The flavour and fragrance companies, as well as to the food Group’s strong market positions have been developed and beverage industry. In addition, BioSolutions carries out through in-depth understanding of its markets, production of trading activities in chemicals which are either linked to advanced and specialised products and local presence in the lignin-based products or have previously been produced by form of a global sales and marketing organisation. Borregaard. COMPETENCE AS THE MAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BioMaterials develops, produces and sells speciality Borregaard is a competence-driven company with cellulose mainly for use as a raw material in the production production, research and development (R&D) and sales of cellulose ethers, cellulose acetate and other speciality and marketing as its core competencies.

Borregaard monitors the situation measure to drive specialisation, diversification and growth. closely and has activated the company’s emergency During 2019, we redirected some of the competence and organisation. In line with our values, we put safety and resources in our lignin business away from multi-application health first. Many measures have been implemented in responsibilities into roles fully focused on the individual our operational units and offices around the world to limit applications. The goal is to increase sales of high value the risk of infection. The direct effects for our businesses lignin products through focused innovation work and to are limited as of today. However, we have no guarantee grow volume by attracting new customers within new for how this situation will develop in the future, neither in applications. terms of market conditions, supply chains nor government regulations. Borregaard’s market-oriented culture characterises the organisation of the business. Our business areas and market Kind regards, segments are organised based on the markets they serve. MESSAGE This is further highlighted through an altered composition and renaming of Borregaard’s business areas; BioSolutions, FROM THE CEO BioMaterials and Fine Chemicals. The names provide a strategic description of Borregaard as a supplier of bio-based Per A. Sørlie, and specialised products and as a solutions provider. President and CEO Borregaard has defined clear strategic priorities for the development of the company. Our ambition is to develop Borregaard into an even more specialised and competitive company, that delivers sustainable solutions and strong financial results over time. In the five-year period from 2015 to 2019, we have invested Borregaard has prioritised six of the seventeen Sustainable close to NOK two billion in various strategic projects to Development Goals set out in the UN’s 2030 Agenda for improve competitiveness and provide for top-line growth Sustainable Development; zero hunger, economic growth, in the years to come. The new biopolymer plant in Florida, innovation, responsible production, climate action and life the upgrade and further specialisation of the biopolymer on land. These goals are closely linked to the business model operation in Norway, the cellulose fibrils plant, the and the products and solutions we provide. In 2019, The development of the Ice Bear technology, and the upgrade Science Based Targets Initiative approved Borregaard’s target of the bioethanol plant are the most prominent expansion for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 53% by 2030 and projects in this period. 100% by 2050, from a 2009 base year. The targets are in line with the ambitions in the Paris Agreement and well below the In the coming years, we will step up our activities to level required to limit the global temperature increase to 2°C. increase market awareness of Borregaard’s green solutions. Sustainability is a key component of Borregaard’s business During 2019 we have adjusted the organisation in several model and one of our core values. We offer sustainable areas to support strategy execution. The NOK 450 million products with a good climate footprint and positive upgrade and specialisation of the production facilities for environmental, health and safety benefits, that can replace bioploymers at the Sarpsborg site included new drying oil-based products. Although most of our customers are capacity, tanks for storage of liquid materials and improved still buying chemicals based on performance and price, solutions for logistics, infrastructure and energy. This the sustainability footprint of our products is becoming investment will enable further specialisation on the unique increasingly important. One example of this is Borregaard’s raw material base and will over time further reduce our biovanillin used in the food, beverage and cosmetics exposure to cyclical market segments. In addition, the industries. The market for biovanillin is growing rapidly. This increased drying capacity at the Sarpsborg site reduces trend is expected to continue and most likely be reinforced the need for drying products at other production sites. in parallel with the world’s growing sustainability focus. In As a consequence, the operations in Germany have been response to a growing demand, Borregaard has decided to restructured to reflect future needs. This optimisation of the expand production capacity for biovanillin by at least 250 operations in Norway and Germany is targeted to deliver additional tonnes annually from 2021. cost reductions of NOK 60 million from 2021. 8 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 9 MARGRETHE HELGE HAUGE AASEN Member Member THE BOARD Member of the Board since April 2018.
