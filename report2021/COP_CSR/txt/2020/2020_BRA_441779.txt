Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance according to the accounting practices adopted in Brazil, or the IFRS – International Financial Reporting Standard, nor should it be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operational performance, or as an alternative to operational cash flows, or as a liquidity measure. Adjusted EBITDA has no standardized meaning, and the Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The Company’s management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure of its performance, which is widely used by investors and analysts to evaluate performance and compare companies. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a different way to the Company. Adjusted EBITDA is not part of the financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA is designed to present an indicator of operational economic performance. Sabesp’s adjusted EBITDA is equal to net income before net financial expenses, income tax and social contribution, depreciation and amortization, and other net operating revenues/expenses. Sabesp’s Adjusted EBITDA serves as a general indicator of economic performance and is not affected by debt restructuring, interest rate fluctuations, changes in the tax burden, or levels of depreciation and amortization. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA serves as an appropriate instrument for a regular comparison of operating performance. In addition, there is another formula for calculating Adjusted EBITDA that is adopted in clauses of some financial commitments. Adjusted EBITDA allows a better understanding not only of operational performance but also of the Company’s ability to meet its obligations and raise funds for investments in capital goods and working capital. However, Adjusted EBITDA, has limitations that prevent it from being used as an indicator of profitability because it does not take into account other costs resulting from Sabesp’s activities or certain other costs that may significantly affect its profits, such as financial expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenses and other related charges. 10 – Other operational revenues consist of gains on sales of property, plant and equipment, sales of public notices, sale of electricity rights, indemnification and reimbursement of expenses, fines and sureties, leasing of real estate, re-use water, Pura’s projects and services and are shown net of Cofins and Pasep. Other operational expenses consist of the write-off of concession assets due to obsolescence, deactivated construction works, unproductive wells, economically unviable projects, loss of fixed assets and surplus cost of commercialized electricity. 57 2020 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Financial and Operational Information item on 2020-2024 Investment plan (R$ million) the top menu. 4,120 4,115 4,178 4,021 Adjusted EBITDA increased by 14.8%, 3,781 508 593 530 615 increasing from R$6,540.6 million in 2018 to 578 R$7,510.5 million in 2019, and the adjusted Sewage EBITDA margin reached 41.8 % in 2019 versus Treatment 40.7% in 2018.
