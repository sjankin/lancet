Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer Statement of the company's chief executive expressing continued support for the United Nations’ (UN) Global Compact and renewing the company's ongoing commitment to the initiative and its principles. To our stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that BioPorto reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Peter M. Eriksen, CEO Communication on progress This report concerns BioPorto’s efforts in 2019, which focused on the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Since BioPorto acceded to the Global Compact in early 2010, the company has been actively supporting the ten principles within the business, its strategy and supply chain. BioPorto is aware of its social responsibility and endeavors to improve its social and environmental conditions. In several areas, BioPorto fulfills its responsibility solely by complying with current law, but in other areas, the company’s responsibility has been expanded to include preventive activities for optimizing various conditions. It is important to BioPorto to highlight these efforts vis-à-vis its customers, suppliers, shareholders, other stakeholders, etc., to ensure that the outside world can have confidence in the company to live up to its social responsibility. For this reason, BioPorto continues its participation in the Global Compact, whose ten principles for social commitment as defined by the UN constitute a global frame of reference. At the same time, through our commitment, we will try to encourage the parties with whom we interact to consider and shoulder their share of these responsibilities. Human Rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. BioPorto supports and respects internationally recognized human rights. BioPorto has no external suppliers in countries that do not respect human rights. In 2017, BioPorto established a Code of Conduct covering the above. BioPorto’s employees are bound by BioPorto’s Code of Conduct and the company has initiated a process of implementing the Code of Conduct into supplier contracts to ensure that the company’s suppliers respect human rights. BioPorto’s employees are trained on Human Rights and a training session has been conducted for all new employees to raise the public awareness on human rights. BioPorto’s executive management monitor and evaluates the performance annually. Any alleged incidents of Human Rights abuses would be reported to the executive management and the executive management would take prompt action. Labor rights 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; 5. the effective abolition of child labor; and 6. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Danish and American traditions, culture and law mean that labor rights are naturally supported and complied with by BioPorto, both in Denmark and the United States. BioPorto has no external suppliers in countries that use child labor or forced and compulsory labor, and BioPorto deems that there is a very low risk of this taking place in areas where BioPorto might be expected to operate.

Management ensures that employees are trained to handle hazardous goods and chemicals correctly. In the composition of its staff, BioPorto endeavours to achieve an equal gender breakdown as well as a diversity of educational backgrounds, nationalities and cultures. This diversity provides a dynamic workday and encourages fine interplay for the benefit of staff and company efforts alike. 2019 Female Male Non-Danish All Employees 39% 61% 41% Head of Departments 37% 63% 27% Executive Management (one person) 0% 100% 0% Board of Directors 32% 68% 20% BioPorto has adopted a Diversity Policy, which is available on the company’s website and reads as follows: “BioPorto is committed to continue working towards ensuring and furthering equal opportunities for all employees in respect of differences, such as gender, age, religion, sexual orientation and ethnicity, as all – in our view – serve as key components in ensuring a better, more dynamic and healthier business. We believe that employees should be recognized because of – and not despite – their diversity. The view extended through this policy also includes maintaining equal opportunities for women and men at all management levels in the BioPorto group. The Board of Directors annually discusses the company’s activities to ensure relevant diversity at management levels and evaluates the policy on diversity. BioPorto has defined a target, that no later than in 2022, at least 25 % members of the Management of the company must be women. This target must not detract from other competency requirements in the nomination of members to the Management team of the company. With regards to diversity for the Board of Directors, the Company has reached its target and currently does not have an underrepresented gender, as the gender distribution is 50/50.” BioPorto’s Nomination Committee has a clear policy for evaluating candidates of both genders for vacant board positions, and for the election in 2018 a female candidate was elected to the Board of Directors. For future vacancies in the Board, the Nomination Committee will continue to evaluate candidates of both genders.
