At Shaw, it means keenly focusing on the ingredients that go into products as well as the impacts of sound, moisture, cleanability and other design considerations because we know the spaces where we learn, create and come together to solve our greatest challenges impact our wellbeing. We‚Äôre addressing environmental health and human experience at the same time. Putting people at the heart of our sustainability efforts. 2 3 Dear Stakeholders, It‚Äôs impossible to reflect on 2019 without acknowledging the unprecedented circumstances we‚Äôve each faced personally and professionally thus far in 2020. A global pandemic, cries for racial justice that spread throughout the world, and economic volatility are just three examples. Each called our attention to overt and underlying conditions that challenge not only our collective sustainability endeavors but for many sustainability in the truest sense of the word‚Äîour very existence. People are key to solving the puzzle. As I reflect on how to reconcile the significant progress we made as a company in 2019 with the Herculean challenges that we and the world have faced in 2020, there are two common threads: people and connectivity. Our efforts have long-been focused on people. So, when we began defining our sustainability approach with the newly coined term: sustain[HUMAN]ability‚Ñ¢ last year, it was a natural fit. We quite literally put humans at the center of sustainability. This reflected the priority we put on the impact our products can have on people. It also encompassed the investment we make in our associates, our customers, our supply chain partners, our communities and others that are so critical to our success. We‚Äôve navigated the opportunities of 2019 and the challenges of 2020 with the same unwavering focus on people at the heart of all we do. The complexity of it all‚Äîand how interconnected each of our actions is‚Äîhas never been more apparent. At a conference late last year, a colleague drew the analogy of the work we do to the puzzle cube many of us played with as children. As she wisely observed, you can‚Äôt focus on only one side of the cube or the rest will be irrevocably scrambled. You must focus on all sides simultaneously in order to succeed. That captures our approach to sustainability. At Shaw, we‚Äôre carefully focusing on where we can have the most impact without losing sight of the myriad of other important aspects of our sustainability work where we can contribute to change in partnership with others. People are the key to solving the puzzle. I hope you find that reflected in this year‚Äôs annual sustainability report‚Äîand in all that we do. Based upon our materiality assessment, we were in the midst of revisiting our 2030 corporate sustainability goals to ensure they aligned with our current operations and market expectations when the pandemic struck. Our intent is to continue these discussions and carefully take into consideration the inevitable changes in stakeholder priorities and expectations amid and following all that is happening globally to reshape our lives. We look forward to sharing that journey with you. Susan Farris Vice President of Sustainability Susan Farris, Vice President of Sustainability 4 5 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY WHAT MATTERS We spend a whopping 90% of our time indoors‚Äîat home, at school, at work, in restaurants, Based upon our most recent materiality assessment, these are the issues that Shaw and its stores, hospitals, sports venues, and more. stakeholders have deemed most important for the company to focus on. It‚Äôs no wonder the spaces where we learn, create, and come together to solve our greatest challenges have a significant impact on our wellbeing. We‚Äôve become an indoor species.

Doing so requires constantly seeking to understand our customers and their preferences and pain points; improving our products, services and operations; and investing in people and processes to advance all that we do. When I shared a similar perspective in last year‚Äôs sustainability report, I had no idea what changes lie ahead for 2020. While this report is focused on 2019, I‚Äôd be remiss not to acknowledge the tremendous circumstances we find ourselves in thus far in 2020. Our people-first approach is fundamental to how we sustain[HUMAN]ability‚Ñ¢. Amid a global pandemic and an increased focus on the fair treatment of people, Shaw‚Äôs people-first approach underpins our commitment to operating safely and making prudent financial decisions while meeting customer and stakeholder needs. The incredible efforts by our teams are continuing to drive innovation. We strive for world-class customer experience amid a remarkable time of change. And we are rapidly adapting to the next normal and anticipating future shifts. Over the past five years, Shaw has invested more than $1.5 billion in new and existing facilities in the U.S. alone‚Äîwith similar investment in the prior five years. Our investments in people and processes in 2019 lay a solid foundation for 2020 and beyond. Notably, in 2019, we: ‚Ä¢ Aligned our residential sales force to enable decision-making closer to the customer to enhance customer experience ‚Ä¢ Continued modernizing our carpet manufacturing facility in Andalusia, Ala.‚Äîadvancing that $250 million multi-year investment‚Äî and investment in our resilient (LVT) manufacturing operations in the U.S. ‚Ä¢ Expanded manufacturing and warehouse space at our carpet tile facility in Adairsville, Ga., and enhanced capabilities at our carpet tile manufacturing facility in Sanquhar, Scotland ‚Ä¢ Invested in our logistics and distribution network and further bolstered our supply chain operations Our people-first approach is also fundamental to how we sustain[HUMAN]ability‚Ñ¢. We are driven by a respect for people and an appreciation for the diverse backgrounds and perspectives that shape our experiences. Diversity‚Äîand equal access to opportunity and a culture that fosters inclusion and belonging‚Äîare instrumental to our success and continued innovation. Shaw is committed to attracting and retaining a diverse workforce that will help us continue to bring the best thinking, products and services to our customers and to meet the needs of our wide range of stakeholders globally.

Designing spaces that support people and the planet. 16 17 PRODUCT HUMAN IMPACT On average, people spend approximately 90% of their time indoors. With this being the reality for so many of us, it‚Äôs no surprise that the definition of sustainability has broadened beyond traditional operational measures (such as energy, water and recycled content), and even social and philanthropic impacts, to an increased interest in material health and how commercial and residential spaces impact people. There are a number of factors pointing to and driving this market shift. With greater access to information, consumers are increasingly Sustainable building programs and design standards have evolved curious about what ingredients are going into their homes, to embrace and consider factors such as material health and noise workplaces and schools. It‚Äôs a journey we‚Äôve been on for decades, alongside other building performance metrics. At the same time, but the market is ever-evolving; new information emerges daily; new standards have emerged such as FitWel and the WELL Building and technology frequently changes. This presents an opportunity Standard, with a stated mission to improve human health and to continually think about how we can best create a positive wellbeing in buildings and communities throughout the world.

Why? So that the possibilities of what people can achieve within Discussions about chemicals of concern that were previously the confines of four walls or the boundaries of a sports field are limited to technical conferences or solely focused on food, limitless! cosmetics and consumer products are now common topics within the built environment sector. 18 19 MATERIAL HEALTH PRODUCT CERTIFICATIONS AND DISCLOSURE KNOWING OUR PRODUCTS We aim to know as much about our products as possible‚Äîwhat goes into them and thus what might come out of them. That begins with raw material choices. Our technical development groups use an enterprise-wide raw material approval process, and sourcing ensures purchase orders are not issued without completing this review process. We use the Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program material health assessment methodology to characterize the hazards of chemicals present in a product and to assess any relevant routes of exposure to hazardous chemicals during the intended use and end-of-use phases of a product‚Äôs lifecycle. Chemical composition data for materials is required down to the 100 ppm level (0.01%) to generate full assessment ratings. This program‚Äôs material health rating system was developed to identify the continuum of risk. Almost 90 percent of the products we manufacture are Cradle to Cradle Certified, and we follow this internal evaluation process as well as hazard screening and risk assessment ¬Æ for all new raw materials, regardless of whether the final product is pursuing or already certified to the Cradle to Cradle Certified Products Program standard. SEEKING THIRD-PARTY CERTIFICATION Shaw values third-party verification and validation of our sustainability efforts both SM as a way to simply communicate a product‚Äôs sustainability attributes and to avoid the skepticism that often comes with self-disclosed information. Cradle to Cradle certification‚Äîwith its focus not only on safe ingredients, but also the effective use of raw materials and energy and water resources, and labor and community practices in the supply chain‚Äîis a key piece of the puzzle in our approach to creating sustainable products. Importantly, it also resolves the tension between the desire to know more about what is in our products and the need to protect intellectual property. We also ensure our products meet indoor air quality performance for VOC (volatile organic compounds) emissions using Green Label Plus, FloorScore and GREENGUARD Everyone should have access certification programs. Shaw is one of the first manufacturers to achieve the Assure Certified‚Ñ¢ standard and certification for rigid core luxury vinyl tile (LVT). Assure was established to create a uniform standard of quality for all Rigid Core LVT. Certification to sustainable products for allows manufacturers globally to demonstrate that their vinyl rigid core flooring has been manufactured to the highest standards and meets all requirements for indoor air quality, rigorous performance, and heavy metals and ortho-phthalate content. their homes and workspaces. In addition to these third-party certifications, we also provide product ingredient and disclosure information via Health Product Declarations (HPDs) and Declare labels, to be responsive to marketplace expectations for manufacturers to be more transparent about the materials used. At Shaw, our approach is to: IMPLEMENTING SUSTAINABLE SOURCING POLICIES ‚Ä¢ Aim to know as much as possible about our products We strive to ensure that the products we source from others are held to the same high standards we set for our own operations, and our global sourcing group is an active ‚Ä¢ Seek third-party certification participant in this effort. Our sustainable sourcing work stands to not only benefit Shaw and its customers, but industry more broadly as new chemistry options become available. ‚Ä¢ Employ a sustainable sourcing policy ENGAGING PRODUCT R&D AND DESIGN TEAMS ‚Ä¢ Empower product innovation and design teams Shaw‚Äôs product research and development, design and technical teams stay abreast of trends‚Äînot only in color, texture and technical capabilities, but market demand for sustainable products. Cradle to Cradle design principles are fundamental to our product innovation. 20 21 ACOUSTICS IMPACT ON PEOPLE Sound affects how we feel, how we work, how we sleep and how we learn. Too much noise can lead to stress, fatigue, lack of focus, anxiety and lengthy healing times. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can raise our blood pressure, accelerate breathing, cause irritability and anxiety. It can affect our quality of sleep. It can increase our sensitivity to pain, as well as impair our comprehension, memory and reading ability. IMPACT ON BUSINESS From student apartments and hotels to offices and hospitals, sound can positively or negatively impact how people experience a building. According to a survey of multifamily property managers, noise is the third most frequent complaint made by residents. And these complaints aren‚Äôt just idle chatter: 20 percent MAKING A SOUND CHOICE of residents say they would move if there were noisy or annoying neighbors.

It‚Äôs a topic that touches human health, agriculture and food security, water supply, transportation, energy, ecosystems and other important areas of sustainability. As a company that puts people at the center of its sustainability efforts, our carbon mitigation strategy is a key component of how we strive to sustain[HUMAN]ability. No one person, organization or corporation can solve problems at this scale alone. Our collective contributions have a cumulative positive affect. Together, we can make a difference. HOW WE DO IT THE IMPACT OF CHANGE Shaw‚Äôs approach to energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) As a result of Shaw‚Äôs investments to help reduce our energy management is multifaceted and includes reducing energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) impact, we have cut our Scope 1 & 2 consumption, switching to cleaner fuels and producing renewable emissions in half from our 2010 baseline. We also have reduced energy at our own facilities. We also address climate change by our GHG intensity by almost 37 percent compared to 2010 (per incentivizing additional renewable energy development and usage pound of finished product). through the purchase of renewable energy credits.
