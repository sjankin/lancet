This top-down system chain allows all employees to be involved in activities aimed at fulfilling major sustainability objectives.

Ambev’s initiatives against climate change also involve sharing knowledge and management tools with other companies. Based on the success of the SAVEh platform, SAVEe was created with a focus on reducing consumption and improving energy management. All suppliers and other interested companies can access the platform free of charge to receive guidance and online consultancy on smarter energy consumption. The development of the SAVEe platform was made in partnership with French multinational Schneider Electric. In 2019, Ambev consumed 6.98 billion megajoules (MJ) of non-renewable energy in Brazil, which represented a reduction of 800 million MJ in comparison with 2018. Part of the electricity is generated in the Company itself, through the use of natural gas, which reduces the cost of purchasing energy and makes the operation more reliable.

Effluents and waste are the responsibility of the corporate supply manager, who works from the engineering excellence center. Since 2012, Ambev has set benchmarks for recycled packaging innovation. It was in that year that the company presented the first PET bottle made with 100% recycled materials for the 2-liter Guaraná Antarctica. Currently, the manufacture of this bottle consumes 70% less energy and 20% less water when compared to ones made of virgin resin. And innovation goes far beyond PET bottles. Returnable glass bottles, for example, have a longer lifecycle and can be reused more than 20 times. In Rio de Janeiro, the Ambev Glass factory produces glass bottles through the recycling of shards and uses them as raw material for 47% of the packaging produced at the plant. The glass factory also has equipment capable of purifying the gas generated by its oven, which removes up to 99.95% of pollutants. Glass recycling represents a 35% energy saving and the preservation of about 90,000 tons of virgin material which are no longer consumed annually. The production of beer and soft drinks at Ambev used 12,773,549,337 cans, 2,311,527,180 PET bottles and 7,644,245,718 glass bottles. These totals include both returnable and disposable bottles. One of the focuses of sustainable management is the packaging recovery. In 2018, 97.7% of cans and 66.2% of the cardboard sold were recovered, according to the CEMPRE Review 2019 report. CEMPRE does not disclose the percentage recovered from other materials.

In 2019, we strengthened the Center for Beer Innovation and Technology Center (CIT), in Rio de Janeiro, as an environment of collaboration and technology to bring even more innovations to our consumers. It was there that launches like Skol GT and Skol Puro Malte became a reality. Furthermore, this year we invested R$ 2.5 million in the installation of solar panels in the Center. They have the capacity to produce enough energy to supply 100% of the centers’ activities during the period of the day when sunlight levels are at their highest. This initiative perfectly matches our Renewable Energy commitment. SMART DRINKING Smart drinking is one of the pillars of our work toward sustainability. The initiatives implemented are based on four major goals: 1. To reduce the inaproppriate consumption of alcoholic beverages by at least 10% in six pilot cities by 2020 and implement the best practices around the world by the end of 2025. In Brazil, Brasília (DF) was chosen as the pilot city. This goal was translated into the Brasília Vida Segura program, a public-private endeavor monitored by an independent committee of scientists and specialists, which is based on five pillars and seeks to implement and study the best interventions and recommendations in education, mobility, health and business. The idea is to assess a portfolio of sustainable public policies aimed at reducing the harmful consumption of alcohol on a population scale. 2. To influence social norms and individual behaviors, reducing the inappropriate consumption of alcoholic beverages by investing US$ 1 billion in social marketing campaigns and corresponding programs in the markets where we operate by the end of 2025. 3. To ensure that non-alcoholic or low-alcohol products represent at least 20% of AB InBev’s global beer volume by the end of 2025. 4. To have informative labels on all beers by the end of 2020 and increase health and alcohol education by the end of 2025. 48 AMBEV | SUSTAINABILITY REPORT | 2019 Be(er) Responsible Day: Ambev employees go out and visit bars, restaurants, supermarkets to hand out informative materials on moderate alcohol consumption FOCUS ON RESPONSIBILITY • 30,000 employees involved in the GRI 102-12 | 103-1 | 103-2 | 103-3 | 416-1 Be(er) Responsible Day Alcoholic beverages demand responsibility from everyone involved, and smart drinking is a fundamental pillar in our sus• 1 million bars, restaurants and tainability strategy. In this sense, we work on three major fronts: supermarkets visited don’t drink and drive; make moderate use of alcohool; and no underage drinking. We understand our role in society and seek to establish a healthy and cooperative relationship with those who embrace our products. Like the other ecosystems in which Ambev is involved, smart drinking must be guided by joint and permanent action from all spheres of society. We want to strengthen the culture of moderation. Some examples of actions taken in 2019 in this regard were the free distribution of mineral water at major events and a campaign that involved mixing up the letters on our labels and included five brands from our portfolio, having been shown on TV and on the internet.
