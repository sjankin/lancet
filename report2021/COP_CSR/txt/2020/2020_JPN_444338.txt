TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 13 Message from the President Shoichi Tosaka President and Chief Executive Officer 14 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 VALUE CREATION STORY Continue Sustainable Growth-oriented Management while Closely Watching the Impact of COVID-19 The TAIYO YUDEN Group’s Future Vision Support to the Electronics Industry through Smart Products Since its inception in 1950, TAIYO YUDEN has been supplying capacitors and other electronic components that have been critical to the evolution of everyday electronic devices. We have consistently used internally developed materials as the bases of our products to assure top performance of the electronic components we make. In recent years, various industries have used an increasing number of electronic components as the need for compact/high-performance devices is rising. Accordingly, the TAIYO YUDEN Group is focused more than ever before on its signature credo of “conducting every step from the research and development of materials to product commercialization.” This is our major driver to grow business. Against this backdrop, the TAIYO YUDEN Group aims to solve social issues in the electronics field and contribute to the creation of a safe, comfortable, and convenient society by realizing its vision “to be an excellent company that enjoys the trust and highest regard from its customers” through the development and provision of “smart products.” Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 2020 Reached Record-high Net Sales and Operating Income Consolidated net sales for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 totaled ¥282.3 billion, which is an increase of 2.9% compared to the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year, and operating income rose 5.5% to ¥37.1 billion, for new record highs. The core capacitor business growth was driven by automotive applications where the number of electronic components installed per vehicle has risen with the increased use of electronic equipment. In addition, net income attributable to owners of parent company was ¥18 billion, down 23.9% year on year. This was the result of recording extraordinary loss that included impairment loss on goodwill associated with ELNA CO., LTD., our subsidiary, and loss on disaster related to our subsidiary FUKUSHIMA TAIYO YUDEN CO., LTD., which incurred typhoon-related damage. Impact of COVID-19 Operations Back to Normal but Watching Future Impacts The TAIYO YUDEN Group has been impacted by the rapid spread of COVID-19 in 2020. We limited operations at our production facilities in the Philippines and Malaysia at one point from March in accordance with governments’ restrictions on activities and movement. In addition, we were affected mainly by TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 15 Message from the President increases in logistics costs and lead-times due to a reduction in flights. In response, the TAIYO YUDEN Group implemented various measures that included activating its Business Continuity Planning (BCP) measures, taking steps to prevent further infections, changing distribution channels, and securing alternate transportation routes. Currently*, operations at production facilities have normalized and business activities are running as usual. Nevertheless, we will remain vigilant as supply chains could be disrupted again in the event of another wave of infections. * As of August 2020 We expect the TAIYO YUDEN Group’s mediumto longterm growth potential to steadily increase Future Business Conditions & Earnings Forecasts Electronic Components are a Mediumto Long-term Growth Market In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the impact of COVID-19 on earnings was minor. However, the near-term impact on the TAIYO YUDEN Group’s earnings has become a greater concern mainly attributed to the noticeable reduction in automobile production with the global economy clearly slowing. In addition, business conditions are currently unclear due to worsening trade friction between the United States and China. The TAIYO YUDEN Group targets net sales of ¥300 billion, operating margin of 15%, and ROE of over 10% for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021, the final year of the medium-term management plan. However, we now expect to achieve these targets from the next fiscal year due to temporary stagnation caused by COVID-19. Despite this situation, accelerating demand growth for electronic components is a mediumto longterm trend that remains unchanged and is being driven by the shift to 5G next-generation communication * An automotive industry standards and development of CASE* in the automobile market. Particularly in 5G, China has already acronym formed from Connected, Autonomous, taken the lead in revitalizing these markets. The 5G market is expected to undergo full-scale growth Shared & Services, Electric worldwide owing to the switch to 5G-compatible smartphones along with upgrading telecommunication base stations and other infrastructure. 16 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 VALUE CREATION STORY With the start of 5G services, there will certainly be an increase in the number of electronic components installed not only in smartphones but also various types of electronic machinery. It is easy to guess that the need for high-end components will pick up as the load on devices will increase when 5G software services improve. As a result, we think the need for high-end components like capacitors supplied by the TAIYO YUDEN Group will continue to increase significantly. Beyond capacitors, we also see products like inductors and communication devices moving in the same direction. While negatives from COVID-19 look unavoidable in the short term, we expect the TAIYO YUDEN Group’s mediumto long-term growth potential to steadily increase. Core Product Strategies Enhance Products & Lineups As for product strategies, we are continuing to evolve our core multilayer ceramic capacitor in terms of smaller sizes and larger capacitance. At the same time, we intend to capture demand for power-assist hybrid vehicles with our offering of our hybrid aluminum electrolytic capacitors made by our subsidiary ELNA CO., LTD. which cover the high voltage zone requirements. Moreover, we will expand electric double-layer capacitors and lithium ion capacitors in the farad-unit high capacity zone. As for ferrite and applied products, inquiries have picked up regarding our unique multilayer power inductors that use metal materials. This compact product demonstrates extremely high performance in large currents while leveraging its cost advantages through the TAIYO YUDEN multilayer technology. This makes our products very competitive for 5G smartphones. Not relying on the smartphone market, however, we will install our new inductor products into automotive, IT infrastructure, and industrial equipment based on two key types: compact multilayer and large coil-wound. As for communication devices, higher volumes for multilayer ceramic filters look promising along with increased demand for SAW and FBAR filters for 5G smartphones. We will therefore pursue development of new ultra-small/low-profile products that conform to these design requirements. In addition, TAIYO YUDEN Group filters command a high market share for telematics and other applications owing to their reliability. Going forward, we aim to further expand automotive applications for these filters. Capacitor Business Direction and Positioning of ELNA CO., LTD.

Accordingly, we targeted a rise in sales composition ratio to 38% for automobiles, IT infrastructure, and industrial equipment by the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. We subsequently reached this target two years earlier than planned in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 owing to brisk sales growth in focus markets. Further to this achievement we raised the sales composite target for this segment to 50% and we are continuing our marketing activities to this end. Expectations are extremely high for the TAIYO YUDEN Group given the limited number of suppliers able to steadily supply large volumes of high-quality electronic components that are required to have a high level of reliability for use in automobiles, IT infrastructure, and industrial equipment. The sales composition ratio in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 was 18% for the automotive and 23% for IT infrastructure and industrial equipment markets, for a combined total of 41%. Our efforts to steadily penetrate growth markets to capture stable demand has started to bear fruit. In focus markets, we intend to extend our targets to include medical devices and robots in the industrial equipment field. Sales Composition by Market Sector Consumer products 10% •Flat screen TV 19% •Digital camera •Game console 14% Information equipment 16% •Tablet device Sales Composition •PC in Focus Market Communication equipment 35% Target 50% •Smartphone •Mobile phone 42% Automotive •ADAS Automotive 25% •Meter cluster 18% IT Infrastructure/ •ECU Industrial Equipment 25% IT infrastructure/ 4% Industrial equipment Focus markets •Base station 23% communication device 19% 23% 41% •Server •Security camera Years ended March 31 2015 2020 New Businesses Taking on the Challenge of New Businesses with Innovative Solutions The TAIYO YUDEN Group is developing new businesses in order to expand its earnings source. To this end, we will fully committed to develop electronic components that leverage our strengths in areas such as material and multilayer technologies while also working to enhance the provision of high-value-added solutions at the right edge of the smiling curve. 18 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 VALUE CREATION STORY For example, the development of actuators using piezoelectric materials for use in automobile touch panels involves offering solutions for tactile technology that combines both tangible and intangible aspects. In addition, we completed a prototype for an all solid-state battery and plan to start shipping samples in the fiscal year ending March 2021.

In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, by using AI to constantly watch for production abnormalities the TAIYO YUDEN Group is able to unitarily “smart.E” Project: Evolution in the Manufacturing Process ~Shift from G to E~ Utilize IoT and big data to eliminate wastefulness, inconsistency FY2018– Control and overburden; promote STAGE3 capital Improve major advancements in manufacturing Prevention investment productivity of abnormalities FY2017 – Full-scale operation STAGE2 Zero Implementation defects Early detection under way of abnormalities Deal with FY2016 – Implementation factors that cause STAGE1 across the board abnormalities Innovative advance beforehand Visualization Implementation Eliminate of abnormalities under way Detect abnormal Location free Trial operation abnormalities Automate products quickly analysis (waste) Completed Eliminate operational loss FY2019 results Analyze (inconsistency) ・Early detection/prevention of Attach big data sensors to the equipment abnormalities by utilizing AI Eliminate Compile data Identify overburden → Domestic and overseas problems central monitoring and store them in one location → Higher worker productivity Building an inspection system → Reduction of equipment Visualization of operational loss Visualization of work production equipment ・Improvement in product quality Visualization of labor force TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 19 Message from the President monitor operations in Japan and overseas. This drives better human productivity, and a reduction in facility operational loss. TAIYO YUDEN’s smart.E has not only realized visibility of equipment status but also identified skill difference among plant employees, resulting in higher product yields and quality. Going forward, we plan to build a location-free framework that enables identical manufacturing at any plant around the world. The TAIYO YUDEN Group has dispersed its production globally centered on capacitors and inductors, but functions currently vary by region as does what can and cannot be done. Transitioning to borderless production will be our challenge in the years ahead. In light of this, we will accelerate our efforts to develop a flexible global production system that enables us to quickly pivot to other locations when production facilities anywhere are stopped due to such threats as pandemics like COVID-19 or natural disasters. Furthermore, we plan to proactively automate production to a greater extent than before through robotics and mechanization. Investment for Future Growth Continuing Growth Investment to Meet Higher Demand over the Medium to Long Term We recognize this is a critical time to undertake investment aimed at electronic component demand growth over the medium to long term. For multilayer ceramic capacitors, we have enhanced production capacity by 10-15% year on year in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. In April 2020, we have completed construction of Building No. 4 for our production subsidiary NIIGATA TAIYO YUDEN CO., LTD. We plan to continue these investments and further enhance production capacity on an ongoing basis. We are also concentrating our efforts on R&D, from which the TAIYO YUDEN Group’s future is forged.

MLCCs help store electricity temporarily, maintain stable voltage, and eliminate noise in electronic components installed all types of electronic devices found everywhere. TAIYO YUDEN offers a wide-ranging lineup of compact, thin and highly reliable MLCCs that feature high-capacitance owing to its material-based development capabilities. What is the market environment like? Electronic devices are progressively becoming more compact and high functioning. Accordingly, installed MLCCs need to be smaller and have higher-capacitance, while the number of MLCCs per electronic device is increasing. For example, smartphones are becoming thinner and more functional, which in turn is creating a particularly strong need for even smaller components. Electrostatic capacitance and rated voltage decrease as the MLCC size becomes smaller, so improving these features have enabled more compact MLCCs. In addition, the computerization of automobiles has progressed in recent years, requiring MLCCs installed in these electronic circuits to have more compact designs/higher-capacitance as well as be highly reliable. 24 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 VALUE CREATION STORY Multilayer-type metal power inductors What type of product is this? Core materials Inductors are mainly used to stabilize voltage and align electric signals in electronic circuits. The structure of inductors consists of wire-wound and multilayer types, with the latter facilitating smaller and thinner designs. In addition, the use of metal materials enables inductors to accommodate even larger Printed conductive current. Combining these features, we provide inductors that meet market needs in terms of smaller wires sizes and larger currents. What is the market environment like? Layering IoT-related devices require highly efficient power circuits as they are being operated for long time periods whenever possible. Such devices include smartphones, wearable terminals and sensor networks, all of which have become increasingly high performance and multifunctional. These types of compact/ thin devices require small/thin power inductors able to accommodate large current. Multilayer ceramic filters What type of product is this? Multilayer ceramic filters are components used to select required frequencies (filtering) across a range from low to high bands based on a structure that combines MLCCs and multilayer inductors. What is the market environment like? 5G (5th generation mobile communication system) has three characteristics: high speed/capacity, low latency, and numerous simultaneous connections. Accordingly, 5G will be used in even more frequency bands. Multilayer ceramic filters show promise as indispensable components for 5G-compatible smartphones. Multilayer piezoelectric actuators What type of product is this? Multilayer piezoelectric actuators use piezoelectric materials with vibrating properties when added voltage to realize the sensation of pressing buttons on panels along with realizing slick and rough tactile sensations.

Awareness, 2. Communication and dialogue, and 3. Changing systems and schemes. Our aim is for all employdiversity ees to seize upon their maximum potential and unleash new creativity, thus strengthening competitiveness. This will be accomplished by carrying out measures to train employees and to create a nurturing environment that fosters a mindset which enables diverse human talent to play a full and active role. 2. Quality Quality affects the quality of all work, not just the manufacturing site. TAIYO YUDEN has been providing five in-house quality trainings since this fiscal education year so that participants can understand and practice the scientific methods and ideas that will help them change the way they work. We aim to improve the quality of the TAIYO YUDEN Group by encouraging them to understand and practice the basic methods of quality control and methods that are effective in problem solving and data processing for all occupations and industries. 3.Leader TAIYO YUDEN has a training program for talents who will be responsible for TAIYO YUDEN after 5-10 years. The program started last fiscal year, and a development total of 80 people took the course. In the first year, we learned the method with the theme of learning organization (organization that finds and solve problems by ourselves), and in the second year, we carried out the workshop of thinking about strategies by imagining 10 years later. This is a program that takes three years to learn the skills and ways of thinking for the next generation, not one-off training. 4.Engagement In order to understand and strengthen the current organizational strength, we conducted an engagement survey last fiscal year (a survey of TAIYO YUDEN employees with a response rate of 88.5%). We quantitatively undersurvey stand the strengths and weaknesses of an organization from the perspective of employee engagement, and for each weakness, we devise solutions and work to improve them. In the future, we plan to carry out it regularly and check the progress of improvement. TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 39 Section 3 FOUNDATION UNDERPINNING VALUE CREATION Roundtable Discussion with the Outside Directors To realize sustainable growth and increase corporate value over the medium to long term, the TAIYO YUDEN Group is promoting the construction of a corporate governance system that enables transparent, fair, rapid, and decisive decision-making. Outside Directors Masashi Hiraiwa, Seiichi Koike and Emiko Hamada have offered their opinions on the current status of TAIYO YUDEN’s governance and issues for the Company’s focus moving forward.

Thankful that you two who possess manufacturDirector at TAIYO YUDEN, and I feel that the governance ing knowledge have joined us, I think that we are increasingly system is being strengthened. Last year, Ms. Hamada was entering into more specific discussions, such as what kinds appointed, making it now three of the eight members of the of issues are being faced in each business and the kinds of Board of Directors who are Outside Directors. The respecrisks that each is facing, and I think that is leading to deeper tive compositions of the Board of Directors and the Audit & discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings. Supervisory Board, as well as the areas of expertise of their members, are very well balanced. As all the members make various statements from diverse perspectives based on their Evaluation of Board of different careers and expertise, Board of Directors’ meetings Directors’ Effectiveness are being revitalized. Hiraiwa: In its efforts to strengthen governance, TAIYO Hiraiwa: This is my fifth year of my tenure as an Outside YUDEN is also focusing on evaluating the effectiveness of its Director.

Originally, the main role of Outside Directors was Seiichi Koike Outside Director TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 41 Roundtable Discussion with the Outside Directors Hamada: Effectiveness evaluations are conducted in the that remuneration is linked a little more to improvements in form of a questionnaire.

Furthermore, if this is continued for a few years, I believe of building and giving consideration to an optimal system. that the accumulation of improvements in a certain period will be considerable, since changes, such as where things have Hiraiwa: The area of director remuneration is not alone in improved, and points in need of further improvement are claribeing beset with difficult problems, as their nomination profied, and PDCA cycles can be followed. cess is, too. The Nomination Committee is required to report on the nomination and dismissal of managers, but to actually judge the aptness of the nomination or dismissal requires an evaluation of the manager. In that case, how should the evaluation of the manager be conducted? Short-term numerical evaluations are simple, but you need to look at managers’ performance over some years to evaluate whether they are improving corporate value over the medium to long term. In contrast, competency evaluations are not easy, because we are probably not always working closely with one another. How to properly evaluate managers is one of the issues that should be considered on an ongoing basis. Koike: In an era of increasing uncertainty and incessant change, there is no way that can be said to be best practice for how boards of directors should function. I think it is necessary to constantly keep up efforts to improve their effectiveness. In TAIYO YUDEN’s effectiveness assessment two years ago, the establishment of a forum for discussion on business risks was recognized as an issue, and subsequently the Board of Directors deepened discussions on that very subject. The Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee Aiming to Continuously Increase Koike: Participation and the giving of advice in an appropriate Corporate Value from a Long-Term manner on matters of remuneration and nomination count Perspective among the most important roles for outside directors. Looking back on its history, TAIYO YUDEN’s remuneration system has Koike: As pointed out in actual evaluations of the effectivebeen reviewed in an appropriate and timely fashion as the ness of the Board of Directors, it seems that TAIYO YUDEN business environment and performance levels have changed. has thus far not often held discussions with a focus on the We recognize that the current remuneration system is well medium to long term, such as five or 10 years from now. I thought out and designed, however here and there some think this is due to the fact that, in the electronic component tasks remain. The remuneration system for directors who industry, where the market environment changes incessantly execute business has high incentives for improving short-term in a short span of half a year or several months, we have had business performance, but not so much over the medium to no choice but to mainly discuss strategies tailored to shortlong term. I think that what is needed is to devise a way so term market trends. 42 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 FOUNDATION UNDERPINNING VALUE CREATION However, stakeholders are nowadays very interested Hamada: I too think that achieving sustainable growth will not only in single-year performance, but also in solving major necessitate efforts to develop and utilize human resources, social issues that must be addressed from a mediumto longwhich are the assets of a company, and to acquire human term perspective, and in initiatives that address ESG, such as resources who possess the perspectives, skills, and capabilthe environment and human resources. ities that, up to now, have not been found in TAIYO YUDEN. In the new era, I think that a future-oriented human resources strategy matched to those efforts will gain in importance. In the meantime, centered on multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), TAIYO YUDEN’s business performance is robust and given added impetus by burgeoning markets, such as 5G in the telecommunications industry and CASE in the automobile industry. I think, however, that the time is approaching when we should be discussing how this business portfolio might change in the years to come. Should we enhance our product lineup centered on MLCCs? What kind of customers would we sell to? Should we build multiple markets or rather expand the customers within one market as well? I consider that there are a number of options like these, but unless we change to systems that are able to complement each other with multiple pillars, I think that difficult When discussing from a mediumto long-term persituations will arise in the future. spective, instead of setting our goals as an extension of the present, in a society that is undergoing incessant change and Hiraiwa: Up to now, TAIYO YUDEN has continued to grow facing many challenges, we envision that TAIYO YUDEN will steadily, centered on MLCCs, and has reached the point contribute to that society as its member and continue to exist. where it can aim for sales of ¥300 billion. However, I think From there I think we would need to backcast to consider the the time is coming when sincere discussion about what is ideal form. needed to provide new value to a society that is changing at And I think it is important to discuss investment in intana remarkable speed due to efforts for SDGs and the effects gible assets, which is the source of competitive advantage.

financial statements (1) Scope of consolidation TAIYO YUDEN CO., LTD. (the “Company”) has 34 consolidated subsidiaries (all subsidiaries). (2) Application of equity method i) The Company has one equity-method associate. ii) Name of associates not accounted for by the equity method Bifröstec Inc. and three other companies Reasons for not accounting for by the equity method The companies not accounted for by the equity method are excluded from the scope of equity method because the exclusion has a minimal impact on profit or loss (for the Company’s equity interest), retained earnings (for the Company’s equity interest) and others, and they have no importance as a whole. iii) Other specific information about application of equity method For companies accounted for by the equity method with account closing dates that are different from the Company’s closing date, the financial statements of each company’s fiscal year-end are used. (3) The fiscal years of consolidated subsidiaries As the reporting date for consolidated subsidiaries – ELNA CO., LTD., ELNA TOHOKU CO., LTD., ELNA ENERGY CO., LTD., ELNA ELECTRONICS(S) PTE. LTD., ELNA AMERICA, INC., ELNA (SHANGHAI) CO., LTD., TANIN ELNA CO., LTD., and ELNA-SONIC SDN. BHD. – is December 31, but the difference between the reporting date of these subsidiaries and that of the parent company does not exceed three months, financial statements for their fiscal year-end are used as a basis for consolidation. When significant transactions occur at those subsidiaries between their fiscal year-end and the consolidated balance sheet date, the necessary adjustments are made in the consolidated financial statements. As the reporting date for subsidiaries – TAIYO YUDEN (GUANGDONG) CO., LTD., TAIYO YUDEN (SHANGHAI) TRADING CO., LTD., TAIYO YUDEN (TIANJIN) ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., TAIYO YUDEN (SHENZHEN) ELECTRONICS TRADING CO., LTD., TAIYO YUDEN (CHINA) CO., LTD. and one other company – is December 31, their preliminary financial statements prepared as of the consolidated reporting date of March 31 are used as a basis for consolidation. (4) Accounting policies i) Accounting policy for measuring significant assets a) Securities Other securities (available-for-sale securities) Securities with readily determinable fair value Market value method based on market price as of the consolidated closing date is applied (valuation differences are reported as components of net assets and the cost of securities sold is calculated based on the moving average method.) Securities without readily determinable fair value Stated at cost using the moving-average method Investments in limited liability partnerships for investment business and similar partnerships (falling under definition of “securities” as defined by Article 2, paragraph (2) of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act) are valued at the net equity equivalents based on the recently available financial statements of the partnership corresponding to the reporting dates of the financial statements stipulated in the partnership agreements. b) Derivatives Market value method is applied c) Inventories Finished goods and merchandise: Mainly stated at cost as determined by the gross average method (The book value stated in the balance sheet is written down based on the decreased profitability.) Work in process: Mainly stated at cost as determined by the gross average method (The book value stated in the balance sheet is written down based on the decreased profitability.) Raw materials and supplies: Mainly stated at cost as determined by the first-in-first-out method － 10 － 66 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 DATA SECTION (The book value stated in the balance sheet is written down based on the decreased profitability.) ii) Accounting method for depreciation of significant assets a) Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets and right-of-use assets) The declining-balance method is mainly applied for the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries. However, the straight-line method is applied to buildings acquired (excluding facilities attached to buildings) on and after April 1, 1998, and facilities attached to buildings and structures acquired on and after April 1, 2016 by the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries. Useful lives of the assets and residual value of the assets are mainly estimated in consistent with the method accepted under the Corporate Tax Law in Japan. The straight-line method is mainly applied for overseas consolidated subsidiaries. b) Intangible assets (excluding leased assets) The straight-line method is applied for the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries. Useful lives of the assets are estimated in consistent with the method accepted under the Corporate Tax Law in Japan. However, internal use software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life which is internally determined (mainly five years). The straight-line method is applied for overseas consolidated subsidiaries. c) Leased assets Leased assets are depreciated over the leased term by the straight-line method with no residual value. d) Right-of-use assets Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the leased term by the straight-line method with no residual value. iii) Accounting method for significant provisions a) Allowance for doubtful accounts To prepare for losses from bad debt, the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries provide an allowance for doubtful accounts at an uncollectible amount estimated by either using the historical rate of credit loss in the case of general receivables, or based on individual consideration of collectibility in the case of specific receivables such as doubtful receivables. Overseas consolidated subsidiaries calculate the amount of potential loss mainly estimated on an individual basis. b) Provision for bonuses To prepare for bonus payments to employees, provision for bonuses is provided based on the estimated amount of payments. c) Provision for bonuses for directors (and other officers) To prepare for bonus payments to directors and operating officers, provision for bonuses for directors (and other officers) is provided based on the estimated amount of payments. d) Provision for retirement benefits for directors (and other officers) Some consolidated subsidiaries provide the necessary amount at the end of the current fiscal year in accordance with internal rules to prepare for the payment of directors’ retirement benefits. iv) Accounting method for retirement benefits a) Method of attributing expected retirement benefit to periods In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the estimated amount of retirement benefits is attributed to the periods up to the end of the current fiscal year on a straight-line basis for the domestic consolidated subsidiaries and on a benefit formula basis for the overseas consolidated subsidiaries. b) Method of expensing actuarial gains and losses Actuarial gains and losses are amortized by the straight-line method over a certain number of years (mostly 10 years) within the average number of remaining service years of the eligible employees at the time they arise, and allocated proportionately beginning in the following fiscal year. c) Adoption of simplified accounting method used by small companies Some consolidated subsidiaries apply the simplified method in calculating the retirement benefit liabilities and retirement benefit expenses, which assumes the retirement benefit obligations to be equal to the benefits payable assuming the voluntary retirement of all employees at fiscal year-end. － 11 － TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 67 Consolidated Financial Statements v) Accounting policy for hedging a) Accounting policy for hedging Deferred hedge accounting is applied. b) Hedging instruments and hedged items Hedging instruments: Forward foreign exchange contract Hedged items: Monetary receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies and forecast transactions c) Hedging policy In accordance with the internal risk management regulations, derivative transactions are not entered into for speculative purposes and unless they are backed by actual demand. d) Method of evaluating hedge effectiveness The determination of hedging effectiveness is not performed because for forward foreign exchange contracts in place to hedge foreign-currency transactions the important conditions for the hedging instrument and the hedged item are identical, and it is expected that market fluctuations, etc., will be offset at the beginning of the hedging and continuously thereafter. vi) Accounting policy for goodwill Goodwill and goodwill equivalent are amortized over the period within 20 years during which their effects remain using the straight-line method. vii) Scope of cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows Cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows consist of cash on hand; demand deposits; and short-term, highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. viii) Other significant matters for preparation of the consolidated financial statements a) Accounting policy for consumption taxes Consumption taxes and local consumption taxes are accounted for based on the tax exclusion method. b) Application of consolidated taxation system The consolidated taxation system is applied for the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries. c) Application of tax effect accounting for the transition from the consolidated taxation system to the group tax sharing system As for items regarding the transition to the group tax sharing system introduced in the “Act Partially Amending the Income Tax Act” (Act No. 8 of 2020) and items revised on non-consolidated taxation system in connection with the transition to the group tax sharing system, the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries have not applied the provisions of paragraph (44) of the “Guidance on Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting” (Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) Guidance No. 28, February 16, 2018) as allowed by the provisions of paragraph (3) of the “Tax Effect Accounting for the Transition from the Consolidated Taxation System to the Group Tax Sharing System” (ASBJ PITF No. 39, March 31, 2020). Accordingly, amounts of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined in accordance with the provisions of the tax law before revision. Notes Changes in accounting policies From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, subsidiaries using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) started to apply IFRS 16 “Leases,” and assets and liabilities are recorded in principle for all leases as lessee accounting treatment. Those subsidiaries have adopted the method where the cumulative effect of applying this accounting standard is recognized at the date of initial application, which is allowed as the transition approach. The impact of the application of this accounting standard on the consolidated financial statements was immaterial. Notes New accounting standards not yet applied  “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Statement No. 29, issued by the Accounting Standards － 12 － 68 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 DATA SECTION Board of Japan on March 31, 2020)  “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition” (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020)  “Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020) (1) Outline The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) jointly developed comprehensive accounting standards for revenue recognition and issued “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” in May 2014 (as IFRS 15 by IASB and Topic 606 by FASB). Considering that IFRS 15 shall apply to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and Topic 606 shall apply to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, the ASBJ developed a comprehensive accounting standard on revenue recognition and thus issued the accounting standard together with the implementation guidance. The ASBJ established the accounting standard for revenue recognition by following the basic policies in developing it. The basic policies were: firstly, incorporating the core principle of IFRS 15 as the starting point from the perspective of facilitating comparability among financial statements, which is one of the benefits of ensuring consistency with IFRS 15; secondly, adding alternative treatments, but to the extent not impairing comparability, where consideration should be given to the practice having been used in Japan. (2) Scheduled date of application These accounting standards will be applied from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. (3) Effects of application of the accounting standards, etc. The impact of the application of the “Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition,” etc. on the consolidated financial statements is currently under evaluation.  “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Statement No. 30, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on July 4, 2019)  “Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories” (ASBJ Statement No. 9, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on July 4, 2019)  “Accounting Standard for Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Statement No. 10, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on July 4, 2019)  “Implementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” (ASBJ Guidance No. 31, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on July 4, 2019)  “Implementation Guidance on Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments” (ASBJ Guidance No. 19, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020) (1) Outline In light of the situation in which the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) have established detailed guidances on fair value measurement with almost the same content (IFRS 13 “Fair Value Measurement” in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” in the US GAAP), the ASBJ worked to ensure consistency of the Japanese GAAP with international accounting standards mainly for guidance and disclosures on fair value of financial instruments and issued the “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement” as well as issued or revised related accounting standards and implementation guidances. The ASBJ’s basic policy for the development of the accounting standard for fair value measurement is to incorporate, in principle, all the provisions of IFRS 13 from the perspective of increasing comparability of financial statements among companies in Japan and overseas by using the unified measurement method, and to establish other treatments of individual items to the extent that consideration is given to practices that have been conducted to date in Japan and comparability among financial statements is not materially impaired. (2) Scheduled date of application These accounting standards will be applied from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022. － 13 － TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 69 Consolidated Financial Statements (3) Effects of application of the accounting standards, etc. The impact of the application of the “Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement,” etc. on the consolidated financial statements is currently undetermined.  “Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates” (ASBJ Statement No. 31, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020) (1) Outline With regard to “sources of estimation uncertainty,” which is required to be disclosed in paragraph (125) of International Accounting Standard (IAS) 1 “Presentation of Financial Statements” (“IAS 1”) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in 2003, in order to oblige requests to consider requiring that those sources of estimation uncertainty to be treated as information that is highly useful to users of financial statements and disclosed in the form of note information in the Japanese GAAP as well, the ASBJ developed and issued the Accounting Standard for Disclosure of Accounting Estimates (“Accounting Standard”). The ASBJ’s basic policy for the development of the Accounting Standard is to present the principle (disclosure purpose) instead of enhancing individual notes, and place the onus on entities to determine the specific information to be disclosed according to the disclosure purpose, while referring to the provision of paragraph (125) of IAS 1 in the development. (2) Scheduled date of application The accounting standard will be applied from the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021.  “Accounting Standard for Accounting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections” (ASBJ Statement No. 24, issued by the Accounting Standards Board of Japan on March 31, 2020) (1) Outline After receiving proposals for considering the enhancement of information in notes on “accounting policies and procedures adopted in cases where the relevant provisions set forth in accounting standards and other regulations are not clear,” the ASBJ made necessary amendments to ASBJ Statement No. 24, including renaming it, and issued the revised accounting standard as the “Accounting Standard for Accounting Policy Disclosures, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections.” When enhancing information in notes on “accounting policies and procedures adopted in cases where the relevant provisions set forth in accounting standards and other regulations are not clear,” the Annotations on the Corporate Accounting Principles (Annotation No. 1-2) shall be continued to be followed to avoid affecting established accounting practices in cases where the relevant provisions set forth in accounting standards and other regulations are clear. (2) Scheduled date of application The accounting standard will be applied from the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2021. Notes Changes in presentation The presentation of certain accounts of the previous fiscal year has been changed to conform with the presentation adopted for the current fiscal year. Consolidated statement of income “Loss related to anti-monopoly act” included in “Other” under “Extraordinary losses” in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 is presented separately from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 due to an increase in materiality. The consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation. As a result, in the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the ¥668 million that was included in “Other” under “Extraordinary losses” has been reclassified as ¥579 million under “Loss related to anti-monopoly act” and ¥88 million under “Other.” － 14 － 70 TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 DATA SECTION Consolidated statement of cash flows “Loss related to anti-monopoly act” included in “Other, net” under “Cash flows from operating activities” in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 is presented separately from the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 due to an increase in materiality. The consolidated financial statements for the previous fiscal year have been reclassified to reflect this change in presentation. As a result, in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the ¥682 million that was included in “Other, net” under “Cash flows from operating activities” has been reclassified as ¥579 million under “Loss related to anti-monopoly act” and ¥103 million under “Other, net.” Notes Additional information Accounting estimates associated with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) We recognize that the spread of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has a widespread impact on economic activities, and we anticipate that it will also have a considerable impact on the performance of the Company group (the “Group”) in the future. Although some factors are difficult to reflect in future financial forecasts, such as the impact of COVID-19 and when it will fade away, regarding impairment of non-current assets and recoverability of deferred tax assets, etc., we conducted verifications based on the information available as of the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. After careful consideration based on the above, an impairment loss on goodwill of ¥5,206 million was recorded at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We have determined that COVID-19 will not have a significant impact on other items that require accounting estimates. However, depending on the future changes in the economic environment, it may have an impact on the consolidated financial statements from the next fiscal year.

Fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019) Type Application Location Amount Machinery, equipment and vehicles Idle assets Ome-shi, Tokyo, Others ¥3,892 million Buildings and structures Idle assets Ome-shi, Tokyo, Others ¥606 million Other Idle assets Inami-cho, Wakayama, Others ¥115 million The Group categorizes its business assets by segmentation for management accounting, and idle assets by individual asset. Property, plant and equipment such as head office and laboratories are categorized as common assets. For the idle assets with no specific utilization plan and no recoverability, their book values have been written down to the memorandum value and such reduction was recorded as impairment loss. It is noted that the recoverable amount is measured principally at value in use, and the amount is assessed at zero because no future cash flows are expected from the assets. Fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 (from April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020) Type Application Location Amount Machinery, equipment and vehicles Idle assets Philippines, Inami-cho, Wakayama, Others ¥83 million Goodwill Other – ¥5,206 million The Group categorizes its business assets by segmentation for management accounting, and idle assets by individual asset. Property, plant and equipment such as head office and laboratories are categorized as common assets. For the idle assets with no specific utilization plan and no recoverability, their book values have been written down to the memorandum value and such reduction was recorded as impairment loss. Regarding goodwill that arose when consolidated subsidiary ELNA CO., LTD. came within the scope of consolidation, in addition to sluggish demand in the automobile market from the previous fiscal year, the spread of COVID-19 and other factors have led automobile manufacturers, which are our main customers, to slow down their operations. Regarding the impact of COVID-19, given the external information available at the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, based on the assumption that the impact will continue for a certain period into the next fiscal year (fiscal year ending March 31, 2021), the revenue initially estimated can no longer be expected, and therefore its book values have been written down to the recoverable value and such reduction was recorded as impairment loss. It is noted that the recoverable amount is measured at value in use and is assessed by discounting future cash flows at a rate of 6.32%. *7 Business restructuring expenses Fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 (from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2019) The Group has recorded the expenses incurred from the structural reform of its overseas subsidiaries (consisting primarily of special retirement payments resulting from reorganization of overseas business sites) as business restructuring expenses and presented as extraordinary losses.

Notes Financial instruments 1. Status of financial instruments (1) Policy for financial instruments The Group, which mainly produces and markets electronic components, procures short-term operating funds through bank loans, and long-term funds for capital investment, etc. through bank loans and issuance of corporate bonds in accordance with a capital investment plan. Temporary surplus funds are managed as safe and secure financial funds such as short-term deposits. The Group uses derivative transactions to hedge risks stated below, and does not intend to use them for speculative purpose. (2) Description of financial instruments and associated risks, and risk management structure Trade receivables are exposed to customer credit risk. Therefore, the Group manages due dates and balances for each customer, and makes efforts to early recognize concerns about collectibility and reduces its risks due to deterioration in financial conditions, etc. Investment securities consisting mainly of shares of companies with which the Group has business relationship are managed by reviewing market values and financial conditions of issuers on a regular basis. Payment due dates of most trade payables are within one year. The Group uses bank borrowings mainly for the purpose of procuring funds necessary for capital investment. Bank borrowings are not exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk as their interest rates are fixed. Operating receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, arising from global business operations, are exposed to exchange rate fluctuation risk, but the risk is hedged by using forward foreign exchange contracts. Forward exchange contracts are used for operating receivables and payables, which are certain to arise from export and import transactions. The Group engages in derivative transactions only with high-rated financial institutions. The finance department executes and manages derivative transactions in accordance with the internal risk management regulations that stipulates trading authority, the limit amount and other related matters. The － 23 － TAIYO YUDEN Report 2020 79 Consolidated Financial Statements department also records details of transactions and check balances with counterparties. The results of transactions are reported by the head of the finance department to the chief of headquarters in charge. The Company unifies the management of funds of the entire Group based on funding plans prepared by each group company in order to allow them to secure adequate liquidity.
