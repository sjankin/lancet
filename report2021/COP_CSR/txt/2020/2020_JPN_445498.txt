After a few hours of cooking under the guidance of the OzHarvest Chefs, 150 delicious and nutritious meals were delivered the same day to a homeless refuge and crisis center. BIA's marketing coordinator said: It was great to have experienced chefs work with us to create delicious meals for those in need out of food that would otherwise have been thrown away. Volunteering for OzHarvest has certainly made me stop and think about what I can do to minimize food wastage.

Message from the Representative Director & Chairman In order to establish governance structures suitable for the conduct of business on a global scale, approximately one half of Brother’s directors have been outside directors and have engaged in highly independent operations since 2008. In addition, Brother established the Brother Group Basic Policies on Corporate Governance in 2015 and has worked to reinforce governance. The separation of business execution and oversight roles has been clarified, and in 2019, a female director was elected to establish a more diverse Board of Directors structure. The Board of Directors, of which I serve as chairman, engages in active deliberations through the participation of officers with extensive experience in different fields. In addition to performing management oversight and governance functions, we will proactively support the efforts of all employees to ensure a long, successful future for the Brother Group through the development of new business, our quick response to sudden changes in the environment, the development of future generations of human resources, consideration for ESG, social contribution, and other factors. Representative Director & Chairman Toshikazu Koike Message from an Outside Director The novel coronavirus pandemic has posed numerous challenges to international society. I believe that as a global company, Brother has been able to respond promptly, but this situation has also brought to light new potential risks. It is not possible to prepare for all risks, and therefore, it will be necessary for the company to enhance its decision-making and response abilities as an organization in the future. One of the things I have felt through my experience as an outside director of multiple companies is the importance of worksite skills. All employees being aware of problems and exercising leadership are common to organizations that can undergo change. One of the triggers for this type of innovation was enabling women to demonstrate their capabilities. Concepts of an unchanging division of labor still have strong roots in Japanese society, but I hope to make use of the open-minded culture at Brother to support the growth and empowerment of all employees including women.
