VII. Other Activities – Regenerative and environment-friendly cultural factory F1963 a Wire Factory becomes a Cultural Factory F1963 was established in 2016 by global wire manufacturer Kiswire. In its name F1963, the letter “F” stands for factory while “1963” denotes the year that Kiswire built its first factory in Busan’s Suyeong District. With the hosting of the Busan Biennale 2016 on September 2016, F1963’s first opening event, the factory that had manufactured wire ropes for 45 years from 1963 to 2008 has been reborn as a multicultural complex. F1963 is an eco-friendly space that brings people, art and culture together. F1963 is a place where nature and art coexist, and all genre of culture and arts are available 365 days a year. F1963’s vision is to become not only a cultural hub for all the local communities of Busan, but also a world-class cultural complex. F1963 Square Julian Opie in Busan 2018. 3. 24 ~ 6. 24 VII. Other Activities – Regenerative and environment-friendly cultural factory Old intertwined with New : an architectural regeneration project F1963 is an example of an architectural regeneration that finds an artful balance of old and new. While the old factory exterior has been preserved, the interior was renovated to give the building a new purpose. F1963 was conceived through many new structural additions ; • The center was carved out to build a courtyard which provides ventilation and lighting. • The front walls were removed and replaced with glass, and blue-hued expanded metal was added to accentuate the expandability of space and create a new image. • The worn concrete floor that bears the scars of the old factory have been transformed into landscaping rocks and stepping stones, and the wooden truss that once sustained the roof has been restored as a bench for visitors to sit and relax. Preservation: reuse and recycle Carving: courtyard, façade Additions: blue expanded metal Sharing similar qualities of wire, solid but flexible bamboos form gardens and a mini forest at F1963. VII. Other Activities – Regenerative and environment-friendly cultural factory A diverse space that excites like a captivating novel The spatial concept of the architecture is “Three Squares”. The first center square serves as a multi-purpose space for seminars, parties, concerts and performances. With the bare ground exposed and the roof completely open, it is designed to be a place where earth meets sky. The second square is a place to unwind. It houses a café, microbrewery bar/restaurant, and an image library. The third square is a cultural space featuring an exhibition hall, library and bookstore to provide diverse contents on art and culture. ©부산문화재단 ©부산문화재단 VII.
