Report 2020 6 A Message from the President Future vision: ‚ÄúBecome a unique global company that is trusted by society by providing value (safety and peace of mind, color and comfort)‚Äù Representative Director, President and CEO DIC Corporation Kaoru Ino In February 2020, we celebrated DIC‚Äôs 112th anniversary. One of the world‚Äôs leading diversified chemicals companies, DIC is also the core of the DIC Group, a multinational organization comprising 174 companies in 64 countries and territories. In addition to commanding the top share of the global market for printing inks, a core business since our establishment, the DIC Group has succeeded in growing pigments and polymers‚Äîboth derived from printing inks‚Äîinto prosperous components of our business portfolio. Amid rising environmental concerns, including climate change and marine plastics, falling birthrates, longer lifespans, and the evolution of social structures with the rapid spread of digital technologies, the DIC Group continues to marshal its capabilities to address increasingly urgent social imperatives toward a sustainable society. 1. DIC111 Progress Report and a Review of Fiscal Year 2019 In fiscal year 2019, we kicked off our DIC111 Medium-Term Management Plan‚Äîwith the two basic strategies of Value Transformation and New Pillar Creation‚Äîtoward a business structure less vulnerable to macroeconomic factors. Unfortunately, shipments of epoxy resins, polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) compounds and other highly profitable products expected to show high growth were hampered by reduced demand in the semiconductor, electrical and electronics equipment, and automobile sectors, due to slower global economic growth amid trade friction between the United States and the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC). Consequently, consolidated net sales slipped 4.6%, to ¬•768.6 billion, and operating income declined 14.6%, to ¬•41.3 billion. While we acknowledge that our efforts to maximize the benefits of Value Transformation fell short, we made significant headway in eliminating the gap between costs and sales prices‚Äîa temporary difference resulting from delays in revising sales prices to reflect fluctuations in raw materials prices‚Äîwhich had hampered our performance in fiscal year 2018. We also benefited from cost reductions achieved through rationalization, one result of which was the Southeast Asia operating income recovery to fiscal year 2018 levels. 2. Promoting Businesses Focused on Social Imperatives and Business Portfolio Transformation We have traditionally recognized the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including factors affecting raw materials prices and supplies, and exchange rates, on DIC Group operating results as a major structural issue. Guided by the two basic DIC111 VWUDWHJLHVZHDUHWKXVZRUNLQJWRFUHDWHDPRUHUREXVWRSHUDWLQJIRXQGDWLRQE\WUDQVIRUPLQJRXUEXVLQHVVSRUWIROLR¬≤VSHFL¬øFDOO\ by building a sophisticated portfolio focused on environment, safety and health (ESH)-related issues and social change by advancing qualitative reforms in existing core businesses, and creating new businesses with the potential to become mainstays. We define Value Transformation as clarifying competitive advantages and shifting to products capable of withstanding the impact of changes wrought by macroeconomic and other external factors. For example, given the changes in demand resulting from digitalization, for the past several years we have sought to modify our business portfolio, reducing the weighting of publication inks and increasing that of inks and other materials for packaging. Grouping various businesses together under Packaging will bring together common issues such as food safety and food loss, positioning us to develop comprehensive proposals for packaging materials, including by forming partnerships across the value chain and revamping business models. Simultaneously, we will promote the establishment of standards for withdrawal to review and perhaps replace certain businesses dealing with commoditized products. We seek to become a unique and trusted global company generating value in safety and serenity, color and comfort. DIC‚Äôs future vision Two Strategies for Business Portfolio Transformation ‚óè Build a wide range of global No. 1 businesses that Social Value evoke our Color & Comfort brand slogan Target Areas ‚Ä¢ Environmental impact reduction ‚óè Deliver corporate value through diversity, earning ‚Ä¢ Social contribution respect and admiration from the global community ‚óè Work with employees, customers and stakeholders to Economic Value create value and enhance the DIC brand ‚Ä¢ Growth ‚Ä¢ Profitability ‚Ä¢ Capital efficiency To facilitate New Pillar Creation, we established the New Business Development Headquarters to oversee efforts to create new growth-driving businesses and develop them into mainstays in four priority areas in which social imperatives and DIC competitive strengths overlap. We will accelerate this process by making extensive use of corporate venture capital (CVC) and by seeking advantageous mergers and acquisitions (M&As). DIC Report 2020 8 The four priority areas outlined in DIC111 as the focus of portfolio transformation are areas that offer potential for enhancing both social value and economic value. To underpin this transformation, we recently established the DIC Sustainability Index, a proprietary index that will allow us to measure the social value of our products. This index will be used in all DIC Group businesses to assess the environmental impact of products from raw materials procurement through disposal and social contribution, and when customers use our products, from shipment until the end of their useful lives. This index will be incorporated into future product development, procurement, sales and distribution. We will also use the Sustainability Index to communicate these efforts to stakeholders in an easy-to-understand manner, thereby allowing us to identify activities we should pursue. For example, our ability to successfully grow our packaging businesses depends on us effectively confronting such challenges as the need to reduce plastics and eliminate marine plastics. So, how do we go about doing this? The key to how much our packaging business contributes to society will be our ability to provide packaging solutions that help increase social value by advancing the reduction, reuse, and recycling of materials. In the past, improving convenience was our principal concern, but our focus now must be on balancing convenience and environmental impact. Chemical companies have always been expected to provide convenience, but today our sales and our survival hinge on our ability to deliver both convenience and lower environmental impact. 8VHRIWKH',&6XVWDLQDELOLW\,QGH[FRPPHQFHGLQ¬øVFDO\HDU *RLQJIRUZDUGZHZLOOFRQWLQXHWRFDSLWDOL]HRQWKLV index to ensure we maintain a healthy awareness of the social value created by addressing social imperatives and in so doing reinforce our long-term management direction. 3. BASF SE‚Äôs Colors & Effects Business Acquisition and Outlook Even before launching of our Value Transformation strategy, we had begun looking to reinforce our functional pigments business, a key strategic product area. We have long manufactured highly profitable ultraviolet (UV)-curable functional pigments, earning recognition in the market for high-value-added specialty pigments, including those for cosmetics, optical equipment, and color filters‚Äîall small in terms of production volume but delivering exceptionally high value. In our search for ways to expand operations, we became aware of a BASF plan to divest from its Colors & Effects business. After carefully assessing its regional strengths and product portfolio, we determined that integrating Colors & Effects functional pigments could yield significant synergies. Although closing is not expected until late 2020, we anticipate the total cost of this acquisition will be approximately ¬•120 billion, well within the ¬•250 billion earmarked for strategic investments under DIC111, making it a highly attractive proposition. To date, stakeholder evaluations of this acquisition are generally positive, thanks to the complementary nature of our geographic business sites and product portfolios, as well as the rationality of the acquisition from a monetary perspective. Given the PRC‚Äôs 2019 economic slowdown and the global COVID-19 health crisis, we must assume global economic growth ZLOOZHDNHQWRDFHUWDLQGHJUHHLQ¬øVFDO\HDU$OWKRXJKLWLVGLI¬øFXOWWRSUHGLFWWKHIXOOLPSDFWRIWKLVSDQGHPLFHQVXULQJ the health and safety of our worldwide members remains our priority. I call on all DIC Group members to join forces to promote measures within and across regions to help us overcome this challenge. Looking at materials for electrical and electronics equipment, for example, we largely cleared intermediate material inventories and saw improved shipments of high-performance resins in January and February. However, as COVID-19 has disrupted global automobile industry supply chains, there is no way to accurately project what will happen. While the negative impact of the current situation is impossible to accurately gauge, we know what we must do. The task immediately ahead of us is to accelerate the implementation of our Value Transformation and New Pillar Creation strategies. Looking at the challenges we faced between the Great East Japan Earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic, it is absolutely essential for us to ensure the effective management of DIC Group supply chains. Accordingly, we have established a Supply Chain Management Unit. Until now supply chain management was the responsibility of individual product divisions.

In terms of business continuity planning (BCP), the Great East Japan Earthquake exposed risks associated with highly fragmented supply chains. A solid grasp of supply chain‚Äìrelated issues and the ability to swiftly enact post-pandemic or major disaster BCPs are both critical. Recognizing that both also depend on a company‚Äôs competence, we will continue working to formulate effective BCPs tailored to our supply chains. 4. Building a Stronger Management Infrastructure and Addressing ESG-Related Issues 1 Digital Transformation Conscious of the many implications of digitalization, we recently established the DX Promotion Department, a dedicated department charged with advancing digital transformation (DX). I see the importance of digital transformation as a process for modifying a company‚Äôs corporate structure and a business model, rather than simply advancing systems capabilities through digitalization‚Äîa way to fundamentally transform a business or company. Of course, we also understand the importance of digital marketing and materials informatics‚Äîthe use of material properties databases and artificial intelligence (AI) in the selection and deployment of materials‚Äîand we will continue to promote efforts to apply both to various processes. DIC Report 2020 9 However, in this era of social change, the most important thing for us is to determine what corporate reforms are necessary to ensure we achieve our vision for the DIC Group. We are combining two approaches to this challenge. The first uses backcasting‚Äîworking back from our vision to determine actions to be taken to achieve that goal‚Äîand the second uses forecasting‚Äîanalyzing and extrapolating trends to determine appropriate actions‚Äîand leveraging digitalization to facilitate efficient implementation. In the area of production, for example, we have identified two key themes: Ensuring operating safety and increasing productivity. Rather than simply treating these themes as an extension of existing efforts, we are looking at what reforms we need to implement to realize unattended and smart production facilities and clarifying what can be done at present. Digital transformation will allow us to translate such ideas into execution. 2 Human Resources Management Under DIC111, we are promoting a human resources management strategy centered on four core themes called WING. As a global entity, we will continue to leverage the fact that approximately 60% of our labor force is overseas as a key competitive advantage. To facilitate more strategic human resources management in fiscal year 2019, we established the Human Resources Strategy Department. To date, we have taken active steps to empower women in the workplace and reform workstyles by introducing telework, √ÄH[WLPHDQGV\VWHPVWRVXSSRUWPHPEHUVVWULYLQJWREDODQFHFDUHHUZLWKIRUH[DPSOHWUHDWPHQWIRUDQLOOQHVV$WSUHVHQWZHDUH working to take such initiatives a step beyond structural changes by emphasizing efforts to foster a new corporate culture. 7KHFKDOOHQJHRIVKLIWLQJIURPDZRUNVW\OHSUHGLFDWHGRQOLIHWLPHHPSOR\PHQW¬ø[HGUHWLUHPHQWDJHDQGVHQLRULW\EDVHGSURPRWLRQWR new workstyles is not the sole responsibility of human resource departments. Changes to systems are simply a means to an end. It‚Äôs important to secure increasingly talented human resources. When anticipating future social changes, it is also important to consider what sort of key reforms are necessary. For example, while our telework infrastructure is now in place, we still have many jobs that cannot be done remotely. There is still ample scope for ingenuity to make operations more conducive to telework by integrating procedures. If such efforts are successful, telework will truly become something that helps resolve the issue of overwork by eliminating commuting time. 7KURXJKHIIRUWVWR¬≥UHIRUPZRUNVW\OHVWRFDSLWDOL]HRQGLYHUVL¬øHGLQGLYLGXDOLW\¬¥¬≤DFRUH:,1*WKHPH¬≤ZHVKDOOVWULYHWRFUHDWHDQ environment that accepts varied perspectives and encourages active discussion. In so doing, we will endeavor to marshal the diverse individuals who make up our labor force, drive organizational dynamism and create new value by bringing together people with diverse views and ideals. 3 Safety DIC Group management and members approach their responsibilities recognizing operational safety as the cornerstone of our EXVLQHVVDFWLYLWLHVDVDPDQXIDFWXUHURI¬øQHFKHPLFDOV1RQHWKHOHVVLQ$XJXVWZHH[SHULHQFHGDVHULRXV¬øUHDWRXU6DLWDPD 3ODQWWKDWUHJUHWIXOO\FDXVHGFRQVLGHUDEOHLQFRQYHQLHQFHDQGFRQFHUQWRUHVLGHQWVLQWKHYLFLQLW\RIWKHSODQWDQGRWKHUVLWHV5H√ÄHFWLQJ on the shortcomings that led to this sad incident, and reminding ourselves that our ability to locate sites and manufacture products depends on the understanding of local residents, we have renewed our pledge to act as a responsible corporate citizen, take part in the community, and, in the event an issue arises, immediately take steps to provide reassurance.

An Integrated Global Management Team Meeting with regional headquarters‚Äô top executives As overseas markets provide 60% of DIC Group consolidated net sales, we are highly conscious of the importance of effective global communication, and not just as it pertains to the TCFD. Thanks to steady efforts to enhance communication capabilities in recent years, when I issue statements as president and CEO they are instantly transmitted to core Group companies in 64 countries and territories and posted the next day, together with my image, for Group members in all these countries and territories to see. Since our 1986 acquisition of the Sun Chemical Group‚Äîmainly based in the United States and Europe‚ÄîDIC has worked steadily to build an integrated global management team. Today, Group members across the globe use the term ‚Äúglobal one entity‚Äù extensively. Looking ahead, the integration of the Colors & Effects business acquired from BASF will amplify our expectations of members in terms of their ability to function on a global stage. For example, we need to rethink our official language of business and advance a more forward-thinking concept of global operations, including businesses and human resource management. While defining what constitutes global operations may present its own difficulties, I believe it is accurate to say that operations are global when governed by a unified global strategy. There are many ways to view global management: Do you treat Group operations management and product-specific management as independent responsibilities or as parts of a greater whole? Is the current format of corporate (Japan) and regional headquarters best or should we create a global corporate headquarters configuration? We must consider all of these issues over the next two to three years. The integration of Colors & Effects in late December 2020 should further expand the DIC Group‚Äôs global presence. Although uncertainty persists worldwide due to COVID-19, we will continue seeking ways to apply chemistry to resolve challenges and working to become a unique and trusted global company generating value in safety and serenity, color and comfort. In these and all our endeavors, I look forward to ongoing stakeholder support.

With social Social Value imperatives related to concerns such as climate change and marine plastics ‚Ä¢ Environmental becoming increasingly urgent, the Group is reinforcing efforts to develop impact reduction ‚Ä¢ Social contribution distinctive solutions that contribute to social value and to the realization of a sustainable society. Through DIC111‚Äôs two basic strategies, Value Transformation and New Pillar Creation, the DIC Group will continue to accelerate efforts to transform its business portfolio in a manner that ensures its ability to balance social value and economic value. Economic Value ‚Ä¢ Growth ‚Ä¢ Profitability ‚Ä¢ Capital efficiency Formulating the DIC Sustainability Index to Express Social Value To accelerate its transformation, the DIC Group formulated a proprietary sustainability index with the aim of clarifying the social value that the Group provides. To draft the index, DIC established the cross-business Sustainability Strategy Working Group, which held discussions with departments in charge of the manufacturing and sales of Group products. Expressing Social Value on Two Axes: Environmental Impact Reduction and Social Contribution Sustainability Index The procurement of essential raw materials and the manufacture of products Assess product/business using graph below indicates ideal direction inevitably has an effect on the environment.

This means assessing not only energy used in and waste generated during production but also environmental impacts in the production of raw materials (crude oil production, mining, cultivation). The index also evaluates hazardous substances and substances designated under Japan‚Äôs Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (PRTR), thereby clarifying the DIC Group‚Äôs responsibility in supplying products, as well as its duty to formulate and implement countermeasures. The horizontal axis (social contribution) expresses evaluation of a product‚Äôs contribution to the resolution of key challenges during processing by customers, use by consumers and end-of-life disposal. The index also assesses risks associated with the raw materials procured and products supplied by the DIC Group, as well as opportunities (contributions to society) that leverage its unique capabilities.

Accordingly, replacing the 37¬∫C culture medium after culturing with fresh and cold (below room temperature) medium lowers the temperature, encouraging cells to detach gently from the base (thermoresponsive release), thereby minimizing damage during harvest. Because thermoresponsive release eliminates the need for scraping, the Cepallet ¬Æ series is suited for automated cell culture systems. Going forward, Cepallet ¬Æ cell cultureware is thus expected to contribute to the more efficient culturing of higherCepallet¬Æ cell cultureware quality cells in the research laboratories of pharmaceuticals manufacturers, universities and public research organizations.

The company develops and supplies a broad range of products that address diverse social imperatives. As the world shifts to become more environmentally conscientious, consumer Social Imperative packaged goods companies and their converter partners are constantly working to meet consumer demands. Studies show that consumers prefer sustainable packaging over packaging that is not eco-friendly. Meanwhile, some countries and world organizations are taking it upon themselves to make the world more sustainable. The United Nations (UN), for instance, introduced its initiative, Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a plan that highlights 17 UN goals for decreasing the carbon footprint. Recognizing these marketplace and regulatory trends, many brands have explored ways to integrate more sustainable solutions into their packaging. One option has been the development of biorenewable inks based on renewable natural resources. These biorenewable inks can be derived from plant materials, including gums, resins, waxes, solvents, oils and other polymer building blocks, according to the National Association of Printing Ink Manufacturers (NAPIM). Sun Chemical s Response Sun Chemical has aligned several of its sustainability goals with those of the UN‚Äôs agenda for sustainable development to drive sustainability in the packaging industry. Furthermore, Sun Chemical is supporting the goal of lowering CO 2 emissions by developing biorenewable inks that will help to reduce the carbon footprint of the printing industry. By partnering with HAVI, a global company that innovates, optimizes, sources and manages the packaging and supply chains of leading foodservice brands, Sun Chemical has introduced SunVisto ¬Æ AquaGreen to the market. The line of water-based inks, formulated with significantly higher levels of biorenewable resin content compared to other previous market offerings, offers a natural, cleaner, green option for food packaging. Sun Chemical‚Äôs SunVisto ¬Æ AquaGreen biorenewable inks have been certified and specified by HAVI to be a recommended natural-based ink solution, ensuring that foodservice brands and manufacturers receive truly renewable packaging ink. HAVI‚Äôs extensive global network and relationships with package developers on all continents means that Sun Chemical‚Äôs natural-based inks could be used by any of HAVI‚Äôs global partners anywhere in the world. SunVisto ¬Æ AquaGreen inks can be blended with varnishes and standard water-based pigment dispersions, and do not compromise end-use or on-press performance. They also offer outstanding print fidelity and ink resolubility on press, quick setting for in-line converting and high levels of resistance properties to rub, abrasion, water and grease. The aim of Sun Chemical‚Äôs sustainability initiatives relating to raw materials used and its manufacturing processes is to increase the plant-based biorenewable content (BRC) and/or recycled content in Sun Chemical products. Sun Chemical is moving on from using fossil-based raw materials, which are limited resources, to utilizing sustainable plant-based raw materials. DIC Report 2020 36 Sun Chemical‚Äôs Activities Striving to foster a circular economy, McDonald‚Äôs teams up with partners like Sun Chemical and HAVI to transition all of its packaging to be 100% renewable, recycled or certified by 2025.

In recent years, the rapid spread of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in an increasing diverse range of devices being connected via networks. Companies have traditionally collected and analyzed a variety of data, which has enabled them to address labor shortages by increasing factory automation, as well as to enhance the stability of product quality and increase added value. However, the momentous changes in the environment surrounding networks for directly controlling and monitoring production facilities has also brought a dramatic increase in the danger of cyber attacks and many companies have suffered considerable damage as a result. 7RGDWHZHKDYHVRXJKWWRSURPRWHSDUWLDORSWLPL]DWLRQRIUHVSRQVHVRQDVLWHVSHFL¬øFEDVLVEXW*URXSZLGHHIIRUWVKDYHEHHQLQVXI¬øFLHQWRQ FHUWDLQIURQWV$JDLQVWWKLVEDFNGURSLQ6HSWHPEHUZHHVWDEOLVKHGJXLGHOLQHVIRUVHFXULW\IRUFRQWUROV\VWHPVXVHGLQSURGXFWLRQ,Q¬øVFDO \HDUZHEHJDQRIIHULQJDQHOHDUQLQJSURJUDPRQFRQWUROV\VWHPVHFXULW\IRUSODQWJHQHUDOPDQDJHUVDQGJURXSPDQDJHU¬±OHYHOHPSOR\HHV In addition to strengthening administration, we are collaborating with the Information Systems Unit to standardize plant control networks with the aim of ensuring safe and secure environments and transforming our plants into smart manufacturing facilities.

The risk of accidents and disasters varies from one industry to another because of differences in the facilities, machinery and raw materials used. For the entire Group to work as one to improve occupational safety and health, it is therefore crucial to establish appropriate benchmarks for each region. DIC promotes the sharing of statistical data on accidents, disasters and reporting procedures for each region, as well as the gathering and sharing of statistical information related to occupational safety. This approach makes it possible to objectively compare and evaluate the operational safety of individual Group companies, establish precise targets for individual countries and regions, and formulate improvement programs. ,Q¬øVFDO\HDUWKH',&*URXSHVWDEOLVKHGDV\VWHPIRUDJJUHJDWLQJPRQWKO\RFFXSDWLRQDOVDIHW\DQGKHDOWKGDWDIRULQGLYLGXDO*URXS FRPSDQLHVLQ*UHDWHU&KLQDDQGWKH$VLD¬±3DFL¬øFUHJLRQDQGSXEOLVKLQJLWDVDPRQWKO\UHSRUW7KLVPDGHLWHDVLHUWRPRUHVZLIWO\LGHQWLI\DQG compare working hours, the number of accidents resulting in workdays lost, occupational accident frequency rate and other monthly data for WKHVHUHJLRQVWKHUHE\IXUWKHUHQKDQFLQJ*URXSZLGHPDQDJHPHQWDQGUHJLRQDOSHUIRUPDQFHV,Q¬øVFDO\HDUWKH*URXSLQWURGXFHGWKH '(&6DV\VWHPIRUUHFRUGLQJDQGVWRULQJWKLVGDWDLQWKHFORXGWRIDFLOLWDWHFHQWUDOL]HGPDQDJHPHQW )RUPRUHLQIRUPDWLRQSOHDVHVHHSDJH Statistical Occupational Safety and Health Data „Éª1XPEHURIHPSOR\HHV „ÉªTotal work hours „Éª1XPEHURIRFFXSDWLRQDODFFLGHQWVUHVXOWLQJLQ „Éª1XPEHURIDFFLGHQWVLQYROYLQJ¬øUHVH[SORVLRQV workdays lost and not resulting in workdays lost „ÉªWorkdays lost before restart of operations „Éª1XPEHURIZRUNGD\VORVW „ÉªOccupational accident severity rate „ÉªOccupational accident frequency rate Monthly report DIC Report 2020 72 ESH Conducting Risk Assessments By understanding potential risks in production processes, facilities and devices, and the hazards of chemical substances, the DIC Group systematically prepares initiatives to prevent accidents and occupational injuries.

As part of DIC Management School, the Group‚Äôs training module for senior management in Japan, in January 2011 a lecture was given by an outside expert on the relationship between corporate activities and biodiversity. The lecture was attended by 85 executives from corporate headquarters, as well as from plants and Group companies across the country, and prompted the launch of a wide range of related initiatives. For example, the same year brought the launch of an initiative designed to ensure an effective grasp of the relationship between the Group‚Äôs operating activities and biodiversity at all stages of its products‚Äô life cycles, from R&D and the procurement of raw materials through to end-of-life disposal or recycling. In April 2011, experts from the Chiba Biodiversity Center, a prefectural government organization, observed the 30-hectare natural forest and gardens in Sakura, Chiba Prefecture, occupied by the Central Research Laboratories and the Kawamura Memorial DIC Museum of Art, giving DIC‚Äôs biodiversity management efforts high marks and offering advice for future initiatives.

To preserve the natural environment, visitors to the site are prohibited from collecting plants and wildlife and are instead encouraged to enjoy the pristine natural scenery as is. In cooperation with the Chiba Biodiversity Center, the Kawamura Memorial DIC Museum of Art established a biodiversity satellite, a special display area in a small rest cabin on the site. Designed with the aim of fostering greater understanding of the importance of biodiversity, the satellite features permanent exhibits, including information panels and other materials related to biodiversity prepared by the organization, as well as introduces rare species native to Chiba and provides information on prefectural biodiversity initiatives.

The Group uses the guidebook to conduct assessments and on-site inquiries and promote awareness among suppliers worldwide.

VOICE We promote sustainable procurement by implementing continuous improvement. I work for at DIC Synthetic Resins (Zhongshan), where I am in charge of procuring raw materials for metal carboxylates used in tires. The supply chain for these metal carboxylates depends on leading global brand owners and supplies of raw materials from a limited number of suppliers. Accordingly, we view each supplier as an indispensable business partner and work to build relationships based on mutual trust while striving to ensure sustainable procurement. To improve quality and promote sustainability across the supply chain, we regularly survey suppliers using questionnaires, while purchasing, quality assurance and production staff conduct audits to deepen mutual understanding of the status of efforts to comply with laws and regulations, ensure occupational safety and health, and protect the environment. We provide feedback to suppliers on audit results and request corrective actions when standards are not met while at the same time providing related information to support improvements. As part of our efforts to ensure responsible procurement of minerals, we collaborate with corporate headquarters to conduct surveys of companies supplying processed cobalt products jointly and share information. ,Q$XJXVW',&6\QWKHWLF5HVLQV =KRQJVKDQ ZDVDZDUGHGDVLOYHUPHGDOE\(FR9DGLVIRULWV(6*LQLWLDWLYHV5DWKHUWKDQEHLQJ VDWLV¬øHGZLWKZKHUHZHDUHQRZKRZHYHU,ORRNIRUZDUGWRZRUNLQJDFWLYHO\ZLWKVXSSOLHUVWRIXUWKHUDGYDQFHWKHVXVWDLQDELOLW\RIRXU procurement practices.

DIC Report 2020 154 Third-Party Verification The DIC Group commissioned SGS Japan Inc. to conduct third-party verification of its data for greenhouse gas emissions, discharge of industrial waste and number of occupational accidents (including number of accidents leading to workdays lost). DIC Report 2020 155 Third-Party Opinion Regarding DIC Report 2020 Once again this year, I had the honor of reviewing the DIC Report. Reading last year‚Äôs report, I understood that DIC and its consolidated subsidiaries in Japan and overseas were strongly conscious of the importance of responsiveness to change. The first thing that caught my eye this year was the explanation of DIC‚Äôs focus under DIC111 to transform its business portfolio by focusing on businesses that deliver both social value and economic value. Accordingly, I think that the Company‚Äôs use of a new proprietary sustainability index, which commenced in 2020, is particularly worth noting. Counselor, I was inspired by the president and CEO‚Äôs message and particularly by the following The Japan Research Institute, Limited comment: ‚ÄúGoing forward, we will continue to capitalize on this index to ensure Eiichiro Adachi we maintain a healthy awareness of the social value created by addressing social In his current capacity, Eiichiro Adachi imperatives and in so doing reinforce our long-term management direction.‚Äù conducts industry research and Reading through DIC Report 2020, it is clear that the DIC Group has arrived at a new assesses corporate per formance from stage in its evolution in which environmental measures, diversity promotion and work the perspective of social responsibility. A member of the Market Evolution style reform are integrated comprehensively as aspects of management. Overall, I and Corporations in the 21st Centur y found the content extremely impressive.

Today, consideration for ESGcommittee for sustainable finance. Mr. Adachi is also known as the author of related issues is required not only of investors and fund managers but also of companies several books, including Environmental contemplating M&A transactions. It is thus important to communicate how DIC evaluated Management: A Beginners‚Äô Guide, ESG Handbook for Investors and Businesses this acquisition from an ESG perspective. Insofar as DIC has earmarked ¬•250 billion for and The Business Person‚Äôs Guide to the strategic investments, I hope that they will create a benchmark for Japanese companies SDGs (published in Japanese). for the incorporation of ESG considerations into investment decisions. It is also evident that DIC continues to promote steady efforts to reinforce its corporate governance organization, the practical guidance regarding the role of outside directors published by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry in July 2020 contains the following statement: ‚ÄúFor a company to achieve sustainable growth and bolster their corporate value over the medium to long term they must conduct management with an awareness of ESG, the SDGs and other global trends. It is thus hoped that a company‚Äôs outside directors are able to adopt perspectives that are easily missed by insiders and to offer opinions that help ensure the company‚Äôs ability to ensure sustainable management.‚Äù From this standpoint, improving accountability will be another challenge. The use and disclosure of a skills matrix is an idea worth considering. Third, I am concerned that disclosure in DIC Report 2020 is to a certain degree unduly weighted toward climate change. Product stewardship, especially the This third-par ty opinion ref lects my view of the sustainability initiatives and related management of chemical substances and efforts to address such issues as waste d i s c l o s u r e o f D I C a n d i t s c o n s o l i d at e d plastic and marine plastics should be given equal attention. For example, the European subsidiar ies in Japan and over seas, as understood from reading this report, from my Union is currently in the process of formulating what it calls a ‚Äúchemicals strategy perspective as an individual who provides for sustainability.‚Äù I think it is important for DIC to emphasize communication on corporate information to financial institutions nec essar y for ESG investment. It is not this topic. As a manufacturer of fine chemicals, I believe that the most critical task intended as a comment on whether or not facing DIC is to outline how it plans to shift away from fossil-based raw materials and the information herein has been measured and calculated accurately to conform with toward biorenewable plant-derived raw materials. In recent years, the concept of a commonly accepted standards for the regenerative economy has attracted increasing attention overseas. It is my hope that preparation of environmental or other reports DIC continues to expand its disclosure in key areas such as these. or as a judgment on whether the repor t covers relevant important matters in full.

Overview of In fiscal year 2019, consolidated net sales slipped 4.6%, to ¬•768.6 billion. On a local currency basis, however, Operating the decrease was only 1.3%. Owing to the impact of slowing global economic growth, shipments sank in a wide Results range of businesses, centering on materials used in electrical and electronics equipment and in automobiles. Operating income was down 14.6%, to ¬•41.3 billion, or 8.7% on a local currency basis. In addition to falling shipments, particularly of high-value-added products, these results reflected flagging sales prices for some products. A decline in results overseas after translation, a consequence of yen appreciation, also pushed operating income down. Thanks to the impact of raw materials price decreases and of cost reductions achieved through rationalization, the decline narrowed after bottoming out in the first quarter. Of particular note, operating income in the People‚Äôs Republic of China (PRC) and Southeast Asia turned positive in the second quarter. Ordinary income was down 15.2%, to ¬•41.3 billion. Net income attributable to owners of the parent fell 26.6%, to ¬•23.5 billion. This reflected an extraordinary loss arising from efforts to improve business efficiency, as well as one-time disasterand acquisition-related expenses. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) declined 17.2%, to ¬•67.4 billion. Factors behind this included the drop in net income attributable to owners of the parent.

Although sales edged up 0.6% on a local currency basis, the depreciation of the euro and emerging economy currencies led to a decrease after translation into yen. In the area of materials for food packaging, sales of packaging inks rose, particularly in emerging economies in Asia and South America. In contrast, sales of polystyrene languished, despite an increase in shipments, as raw materials price decreases prompted the reduction of sales prices. Sales of publication inks, which center on publishing inks and news inks, were down, owing to an ebb in overall demand. Sales of jet inks for digital printing rose. Segment operating income slipped 3.6%, to ¬•19.2 billion. On a local currency basis, operating income rose 8.0%, benefiting from the positive impact of an improved product mix and rationalization efforts, as well as from a decrease in raw materials prices, particularly in the PRC and Southeast Asia. As with segment sales, however, this translated into a decline on a yen basis. Billions of yen Change calculated in FY2019 Change (%) local currency (%) Net sales ¬•416.4 (4.2)% 0.6% Operating income 19.2 (3.6) 8.0 3 Management‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis Color & Display Segment sales, at ¬•116.4 billion, were down 6.2%. In the area of color materials, shipments of pigments for cosmetics and general-purpose pigments flagged, hampered by trade friction. In display materials, shipments of pigments for color filters were firm, although sales of thin-film transistor liquid crystals (TFT LCs) sank, hindered by sagging sales prices, a consequence of intensifying competition. Segment operating income plunged 28.0%, to ¬•10.8 billion. Contributing factors included sales price reductions for TFT LCs and waning shipments of general-purpose pigments. Operating income was also constrained by the tightening of environmental regulations in the PRC, as well as by increases in prices for pigments raw materials attributable to trade friction. Billions of yen Change calculated in FY2019 Change (%) local currency (%) Net sales ¬•116.4 (6.2)% (3.8)% Operating income 10.8 (28.0) (25.4) Functional Products Segment sales decreased 4.8%, to ¬•268.6 billion. While applications for polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) compounds continue to expand thanks to the trend toward lighter and increasingly electrified vehicles, shipments remained low, reflecting a downtrend in automobile production worldwide. Flagging economic conditions pushed down sales of epoxy resins and industrial tapes, the principal applications for which are smartphones and semiconductors. Sales of synthetic resins remained sluggish overall, despite bottoming out in the first quarter. Segment operating income was down 7.6%, to ¬•19.2 billion. Despite this decrease, which stemmed from dwindling shipments overall, the operating margin improved gradually, as shipments of epoxy resins and other high-value-added products picked up after bottoming out in the first quarter and raw materials prices decreased. Billions of yen Change calculated in FY2019 Change (%) local currency (%) Net sales ¬•268.6 (4.8)% (3.6)% Operating income 19.2 (7.6) (6.6) Analysis of Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019, totaled ¬•16.7 billion, a decrease of ¬•1.9 billion from Cash Flows December 31, 2018. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to ¬•50.6 billion, compared with ¬•51.0 billion provided by such activities in fiscal year 2018. Income before income taxes and non-controlling interests was ¬•34.7 billion, while the adjustment for depreciation and amortization was ¬•33.1 billion. Income taxes paid totaled ¬•7.1 billion, while working capital increased ¬•8.2 billion. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities came to ¬•24.9 billion, down from ¬•38.4 billion used in such activities in the previous fiscal year. A net total of ¬•1.3 billion was applied to the purchase of shares and investments in capital of subsidiaries resulting in change in scope of consolidation, while proceeds from shares and investments in capital of subsidiaries resulting in change in scope of consolidation amounted to ¬•900 million. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities amounted to ¬•26.8 billion, up from ¬•11.8 billion used in such activities in fiscal year 2018. A net total of ¬•12.6 billion was applied to the repayment of interest-bearing debt, while cash dividends paid came to ¬•11.8 billion. 4 Consolidated Balance Sheet DIC Corporation and Consolidated

to the Consolidated Financial Statements DIC Corporation and Consolidated Subsidiaries Year ended December 31, 2019 Note 1: Basis of The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions Presenting set forth in the Japanese Financial Instruments and Exchange Act and its related accounting regulations, and Financial in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan (‚ÄúJapanese GAAP‚Äù), which are different Statements in certain respects as to application and disclosure requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù). In preparing these consolidated financial statements, certain reclassifications and rearrangements have been made to the consolidated financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. The consolidated financial statements are stated in Japanese yen, the currency of the country in which DIC Corporation (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is incorporated. Note 2: Summary of Consolidated financial statements Significant Under the control or influence concept, those companies in which the Company, directly or indirectly, is able to Accounting exercise control over operations are fully consolidated and those companies over which the Company has the Policies ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for by the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its significant subsidiaries: Sun Chemical Group Co√∂peratief U.A., DIC (China) Co., Ltd., DIC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd, SEIKO PMC CORPORATION, DIC INVESTMENTS JAPAN, LLC., DIC Graphics Corporation and 145 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (141 other companies in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All material unrealized profit included in assets resulting from transactions within the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù) is eliminated. Investments in 22 affiliates in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (26 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018), are accounted for by the equity method. Accounting period of consolidated subsidiaries The closing date of the consolidated subsidiaries is the same as the consolidated closing date. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash on hand, certificates of deposit and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have insignificant risk of changes in value. Investment securities Investment securities are classified and accounted for, depending on management‚Äôs intent, into available-forsale securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gain and loss, net of applicable taxes, reported in a separate component of net assets. Available-for-sale securities whose fair values are not readily available are carried at cost. The cost of securities sold is calculated by the moving-average method. Allowance for doubtful accounts Allowance for doubtful accounts of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is provided mainly based on historical experience for normal receivables and on an estimate of collectability of receivables from companies in financial difficulty. Allowance for doubtful accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is provided mainly based on an estimate of collectability of receivables. Inventories Inventories are principally stated at cost, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method, which evaluates the amount of the inventories shown in the balance sheet by writing them down based on their decrease in profitability. Property, plant and equipment (excluding leased assets) Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Significant renewals and additions are capitalized; maintenance and repairs, and minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. Depreciation of buildings (other than facilities attached to buildings) of the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. Besides, depreciation of facilities 11 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements attached to buildings and structures acquired on or after April 1, 2016, is also calculated by the straight-line method. Other property, plant and equipment are calculated by the declining-balance method. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment of foreign consolidated subsidiaries is calculated principally by the straight-line method. The range of useful lives is principally from 8 to 50 years for buildings and structures and from 3 to 11 years for machinery, equipment and vehicles. Intangible assets (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization, and are amortized by the straight-line method. Goodwill is amortized by the straight-line method over a reasonable period not exceeding 20 years. Leased assets For the Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, leased assets related to finance leases that do not transfer ownership of the leased property to the lessee are depreciated on a straight-line basis, with the lease periods used as their useful lives and no residual value. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries account for lease transactions in accordance with either the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‚ÄúU.S. GAAP‚Äù) or IFRS. Retirement and pension plans Net defined benefit assets/liabilities are recognized for employees‚Äô and executive officers‚Äô retirement benefits. Pension assets are deducted from retirement benefit obligations and the net amount is recognized based on the estimated amount of payment as of the balance sheet date. In calculating retirement benefit obligations, the Company applies a method of attributing expected retirement benefits to each period on a benefit formula basis. The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gains and losses in the succeeding years primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (14 to 16 years). Past service costs are amortized in the accounting periods when they accrue. Foreign consolidated subsidiaries amortize actuarial gains and losses in the succeeding years primarily by the straight-line method over stated years that do not exceed the average remaining service period of the eligible employees (8 to 28 years). Past service costs are amortized over 1 to 28 years. Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized past service costs are recorded in ‚ÄúRemeasurements of defined benefit plans‚Äù in net assets after adjusting income tax effect. Asset retirement obligations The asset retirement obligation is recognized as the sum of the discounted cash flows required for the future asset retirement and is recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made. If a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation cannot be made in the period in which the asset retirement obligation is incurred, the liability should be recognized when a reasonable estimate of the asset retirement obligation can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability for an asset retirement obligation, an asset retirement cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related fixed asset by the amount of the liability. The asset retirement cost is subsequently allocated to expense through depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. Over time, the liability is accreted to its present value each period. Any subsequent revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are reflected as an increase or a decrease in the carrying amount of the liability and the capitalized amount of the related asset retirement cost. Income taxes The provision for income taxes is computed based on the pretax income (loss) included in the consolidated statement of income. Deferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the impact of temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes. These deferred taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws to the temporary differences. Research and development costs Research and development costs are charged to income as incurred. 12 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Basis of translation of financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries The financial statements of foreign consolidated subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements are translated into Japanese yen based on the following procedures: (1) Assets and liabilities of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. (2) Income and expenses are translated into Japanese yen at the average rate during the year. The differences of translation are included in foreign currency translation adjustment and non-controlling interests, which are presented as separate components of net assets. Translation of foreign currency account Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Japanese yen at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date and any difference arising from the translation is recognized in the consolidated statement of income if hedge accounting is not applied. Derivatives and hedging activities To hedge risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts, currency swaps, interest rate swaps and commodity swaps. To hedge a part of the risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for investments in foreign entities, the Company uses loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Group does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative financial instruments and foreign currency transactions are classified and accounted for as follows: 1) all derivatives are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income and 2) for derivatives used for hedging purposes, if derivatives qualify for hedge accounting because of high correlation and effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the hedged items, gains or losses on derivatives are deferred until maturity of the hedged transactions. Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the contracted rates if the forward contracts qualify for hedge accounting. Gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred and recognized in income when the hedged transaction occurs. If interest rate swaps qualify for hedge accounting and meet certain specific matching criteria, they will not be measured at market value, rather the differential paid or received under the swaps will be recognized in interest expenses or interest income. Per share information Earnings per share (basic) is computed by dividing net income attributable to owners of the parent available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares issued for the period. Earnings per share (diluted) reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock. Earnings per share (diluted) assumes full conversion of the outstanding convertible notes and bonds at the beginning of the year (or at the time of issuance) with an applicable adjustment for related interest expense, net of tax, and full exercise of outstanding warrants. Cash dividends per share presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of income are dividends applicable to the respective years, including dividends to be paid after the end of the year. From the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Company introduced the Board Benefit Trust (BBT). The shares held by the trust are recorded under net assets as treasury shares. The number of treasury shares excluded from the number of shares issued as of the balance sheet date used for the calculation of equity per share includes the number of shares held by the trust. The number of treasury shares excluded from the weightedaverage number of shares issued during the fiscal year used for the calculation of earnings per share includes the number of shares held by the trust. The number of treasury shares held by the trust excluded from the calculation of equity per share as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is 146,200 shares and 147,800 shares, respectively. The number of treasury shares held by the trust excluded from the calculation of earnings per share as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is 146,323 shares and 148,377 shares, respectively. 13 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 3: Accounting IFRS 16 Leases Changes The consolidated subsidiaries that prepare accounts under IFRS have applied IFRS 16 Leases (issued in January 2016) (IFRS 16) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. In applying IFRS 16, they have adopted a method of recognizing the cumulative effects of applying this standard on the date of initial application, which is accepted as a transitional measure. With regard to leases that the Group as lessee previously classified as operating leases by applying IAS 17, these leases were recognized as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the date of initial application. The impact of this change on consolidated profits and losses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 was immaterial. Furthermore, a description of the impact of this change on per share information was omitted on the grounds of immateriality. Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-16 Corporate Income Tax ‚ÄúIntra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory‚Äù The consolidated subsidiaries that adopt U.S. GAAP have applied ASU 2016-16 Corporate Income Tax ‚ÄúIntraentity transfers of assets other than inventory‚Äù (ASU 2016-16) from the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. ASU 2016-16 requires recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Previously, under U.S. GAAP, the income tax consequences for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. ASU 2016-16 is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Accordingly, it resulted in decreasing retained earnings brought forward as of January 1, 2019, by ¬•774 million. The impact of this change on consolidated profits and losses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 was immaterial. Furthermore, a description of the impact of this change on per share information was omitted on the grounds of immateriality. Note 4: New Accounting ‚Ä¢ Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries, etc. for ConPronouncements solidated Financial Statements (Practical Issues Task Force (PITF) No. 18, revised on June 28, 2019) ‚Ä¢ Practical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Associates Accounted for Using the Equity Method (PITF No. 24, revised on September 14, 2018) (1) Overview The ASBJ has revised PITF No. 18 ‚ÄúPractical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries, etc. for Consolidated Financial Statements‚Äù and PITF No. 24 ‚ÄúPractical Solution on Unification of Accounting Policies Applied to Associates Accounted for Using the Equity Method.‚Äù The major amendments are as follows: For foreign subsidiaries etc., that elect to present subsequent changes in fair value of investment in equity instruments in other comprehensive income, when investments in the equity instruments are sold, an adjustment shall be made to recognize the difference between the acquisition cost and sales price as gain or loss for the corresponding fiscal year as a consolidation process, in accordance with the Tentative Practical Solution of ‚ÄúUnification of Accounting Policies Applied to Foreign Subsidiaries, etc. for the Consolidation Process.‚Äù For foreign subsidiaries etc., that need to recognize any asset impairment, an adjustment shall be made to recognize the valuation difference as loss for the corresponding fiscal year as a consolidation process. (2) Date of adoption The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries will adopt these revised PITFs from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020. (3) Impact of the adoption of the revised PITFs The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying these revised PITFs in future applicable periods. 14 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Revenue Recognition‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 29, issued on March 30, 2018) ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúImplementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition‚Äù (ASBJ Guidance No. 30, issued on March 30, 2018) (1) Overview The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) jointly developed a comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and issued ‚ÄúRevenue from Contracts with Customers‚Äù in May 2014 (IFRS 15 by IASB, and ASU 2014-09 by FASB). IFRS 15 was applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, and ASU 2014-09 was also applied from annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Based on such a situation, the ASBJ developed the comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition and the implementation guidance and issued them together. The basic objective of the ASBJ in developing the accounting standard for revenue recognition was to enhance comparability between financial statements, which is one of the points of convenience of interfacing with IFRS 15. Accordingly, the accounting standard fundamentally incorporates the basic policies of IFRS 15. Also, where there are items that should be considered to reflect the business practices in Japan, alternative policies will be added to the extent that comparability is not lost. (2) Date of adoption The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries will adopt the issued accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. (3) Impact of the adoption of the accounting standard and implementation guidance The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard and implementation guidance in future applicable periods. Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 30, issued on July 4, 2019) ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 9, issued on July 4, 2019) ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Financial Instruments‚Äù (ASBJ Statement No. 10, issued on July 4, 2019) ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúImplementation Guidance on Accounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement‚Äù (ASBJ Guidance No. 31, issued on July 4, 2019) (1) Overview The IASB and the FASB have provided detailed guidance of almost the same contents for fair value measurement (IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement by IFRS, and ASU 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) by U.S. GAAP). Based on such a situation, the ASBJ issued ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Fair Value Measurement,‚Äù etc., as a result of initiatives mainly concerning promoting the consistency between Japanese and international accounting standards regarding guidance for fair value measurement and required disclosures. The basic objective of the ASBJ in developing the accounting standard for fair value measurement was to enhance comparability between financial statements of domestic and foreign entities, through a unified measuring method. Accordingly, the accounting standard fundamentally incorporates the basic policies of IFRS 13. Also, where there are items that should be considered to reflect the business practices in Japan, exceptional treatments have been established for certain items to the extent that comparability is not lost significantly. (2) Date of adoption The Company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries will adopt the issued accounting standard and implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022. (3) Impact of the adoption of the accounting standard and implementation guidance The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standard and implementation guidance in future applicable periods. 15 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements ASU 2016-02 Leases ASU 2019-10 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates (1) Overview These accounting standards require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability in the statement of financial position. There are no significant changes for lessors in these accounting standards. The FASB has issued ASU 2019-10, which amends the effective dates for three major accounting standards. The ASU defers the effective dates for the credit losses, derivatives and hedging, and leases standards for certain companies. (2) Date of adoption Foreign consolidated subsidiaries will adopt ASU 2016-02 from the beginning of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021. (3) Impact of the adoption of the accounting standards The Company is in the process of measuring the effects of applying the accounting standards in future applicable periods. Note 5: Changes in Changes due to application of ‚ÄúPartial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting‚Äù Presentation The Company has been applying ‚ÄúPartial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting‚Äù (Consolidated Balance Sheet) (ASBJ Statement No. 28, issued on February 16, 2018) from the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and changed the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities (that is, classified deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as ‚ÄúInvestments and other assets‚Äù and ‚ÄúNon-current liabilities,‚Äù respectively). As a result, the Company has changed the presentation of the consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. More specifically, ‚ÄúDeferred tax assets‚Äù classified as ‚ÄúCurrent assets‚Äù decreased ¬•8,891 million, and ‚ÄúDeferred tax assets‚Äù classified as ‚ÄúInvestments and other assets‚Äù increased ¬•4,701 million. Also, ‚ÄúDeferred tax liabilities‚Äù classified as ‚ÄúCurrent liabilities‚Äù decreased ¬•325 million, and ‚ÄúDeferred tax liabilities‚Äù classified as ‚ÄúNon-current liabilities‚Äù decreased ¬•3,865 million. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities of the same tax-paying entities were offset for presentation purposes. As a result, total assets decreased ¬•4,190 million in comparison with the amount before the change. Furthermore, in Note 17 ‚ÄúIncome Taxes,‚Äù we added the contents described in the annotation (Note 8) (excluding total valuation allowance) and the annotation (Note 9), both for the ‚ÄúAccounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting,‚Äù stipulated in Paragraph 3 through Paragraph 5 of ‚ÄúPartial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting.‚Äù However, information concerning the previous fiscal year is not provided pursuant to the transitional treatment stipulated in Paragraph 7 of ‚ÄúPartial Amendments to Accounting Standard for Tax Effect Accounting.‚Äù Note 6: Additional Board Benefit Trust (BBT) Information With regard to the compensation for executive officers, as well as directors who concurrently serve as executive officers (the ‚ÄúTarget Officers‚Äù), the Company introduced a performance-based stock compensation plan called BBT (the ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù) from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The purpose of the Plan is to further clarify the linkage between the compensation of the Target Officers, and corporate performance and the value of the Company‚Äôs shares. The intended result is strengthening the Target Officers‚Äô awareness of their contributions to the mediumto long-term improvement of corporate performance and value. Accounting treatment related to the trust agreement is in accordance with ‚ÄúPractical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company‚Äôs Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts‚Äù (PITF No. 30, issued on March 26, 2015). 16 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (1) Outline of the transactions The trust established under the Plan acquires the Company‚Äôs shares by cash contributed by the Company. The trust provides shares of the Company and the cash equivalent to the market price of the shares of the Company (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äôs Shares and Cash Benefits‚Äù) to the Target Officers, in accordance with the Rules of Officer Share Benefit established by the Company. The Target Officers shall in principle receive the Company‚Äôs Shares and Cash Benefits upon their retirement. (2) The Company‚Äôs shares remaining in the trust The shares remaining in the trust are recorded under net assets as treasury shares at the book value in the trust (excluding incidental costs). The book value and the number of such treasury shares are ¬•577 million and 146 thousand as of December 31, 2019, and ¬•584 million and 148 thousand as of December 31, 2018, respectively. Acquisition of the shares and assets of a pigments business from BASF SE and transformation of the business into a subsidiary On August 29, 2019, the Company resolved to acquire the shares and assets of the Colors & Effects business of BASF SE, Europe‚Äôs largest chemicals manufacturer, and entered into the master sale and purchase agreement. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval by pertinent U.S., European and other authorities as well as other customary conditions. (1) Objectives of the acquisition of shares and assets To hasten the qualitative transformation of its Color & Display business, the Company is working to expand its functional pigments business with the aim of driving growth as a leading global manufacturer of high-growth, high-value specialty pigments, including those for displays, cosmetics and automobiles. The annual global pigments market is estimated at approximately ¬•2.3 trillion. The Company is a leader in organic pigments and a valued manufacturer of aluminum effect pigments. The target business, which is based in Europe and has sites around the world, has established itself as a prominent global manufacturer of effect pigments (for pearl pigments) and for specialty inorganic pigments. Accordingly, the product portfolios of the Company and the target business are highly complementary, with little product overlap. Through this acquisition, the Company will add a functional pigments product portfolio which is highly regarded by customers. The Company has committed itself to achieving sustainable growth for its color materials business by expanding its functional pigments business, recognizing this as crucial to bolstering its corporate value. (2) Name of the seller of the target business BASF SE (3) Profile of the target business This acquisition involves obtaining the pigments business-related assets‚Äîincluding technologies, patents and other intellectual property, as well as goodwill not included in the share purchase‚Äîand the shares of 18 individual companies. (4) Schedule of the acquisition of the target business By the end of 2020 (Notes) 1. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval by pertinent U.S., European and other authorities‚Äîincluding under the antitrust laws of the relevant countries‚Äîas well as other customary conditions. 2. Owing to regulatory review timing and other closing conditions, the effective date of the transfer of shares and assets may change. 17 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (5) Cost of acquisition (Reference) ‚Ç¨985 million (¬•116.2 billion) (Notes) 1. The figure above is derived from adjusting cash and debt as of December 31, 2018, from the enterprise value (‚Ç¨1,150 million) of the target business. The actual cost of acquisition may vary depending on actual net cash/debt and differences in working capital, among others, at closing. 2. Advisory and other fees will depend on fees related to procedures to determine compliance with the antitrust laws of the United States and Europe, as well as of other relevant countries. Accordingly, such expenses are not included. 3. The exchange rate used is ¬•118.00/‚Ç¨1.00. This figure has been rounded. (6) Plans for raising funds With regard to the method of procuring funds for this acquisition, the Company planned to choose an approach that would avoid a decline in capital efficiency due to stock dilution and enable it to maintain financial soundness. Having since explored hybrid financing, the Company made the decision to use a subordinated term loan.

The significant provisions in the Companies Act that affect financial and accounting matters are summarized below: (1) Dividends Under the Companies Act, companies can pay dividends at any time during the fiscal year in addition to the year-end dividend upon resolution at the shareholders‚Äô meeting. For companies that meet certain criteria such as: (a) having a board of directors, (b) having independent auditors, (c) having a board of corporate auditors and (d) the term of service of the directors being prescribed as one year rather than the two years of a normal term by its articles of incorporation, the board of directors may declare dividends (except for dividends in kind) at any time during the fiscal year if the company has prescribed so in its articles of incorporation. The Company meets all the above criteria. The Companies Act permits companies to distribute dividends in kind (non-cash assets) to shareholders subject to a certain limitation and additional requirements. Semiannual interim dividends may also be paid once a year upon resolution by the board of directors if the articles of incorporation of the company so stipulate. The Companies Act provides certain limitations on the amounts available for dividends or the purchase of treasury shares. The limitation is defined as the amount available for distribution to the shareholders, but the amount of net assets after dividends must be maintained at no less than ¬•3 million. (2) Increases/decreases and transfer of common stocks, reserve and surplus The Companies Act requires that an amount equal to 10% of dividends must be appropriated as a legal reserve (a component of retained earnings) or as additional paid-in capital (a component of capital surplus) depending on the equity account charged upon the payment of such dividends until the total of the aggregate amount of legal reserve and additional paid-in capital equals 25% of the common stock. Under the Companies Act, the total amount of additional paid-in capital and legal reserve may be reversed without limitation. The Companies Act also provides that common stock, legal reserve, additional paid-in capital, other capital surplus and retained earnings can be transferred among the accounts under certain conditions upon resolution of the shareholders. (3) Treasury shares and treasury stock acquisition rights The Companies Act also provides for companies to purchase treasury shares and dispose of such treasury shares by resolution of the board of directors. The amount of treasury shares purchased cannot exceed the amount available for distribution to the shareholders which is determined by a specific formula. Under the Companies Act, stock acquisition rights, which were previously presented as a liability, are now presented as a separate component of equity. The Companies Act also provides that companies can purchase both treasury stock acquisition rights and treasury shares. Such treasury stock acquisition rights are presented as a separate component of equity or deducted directly from stock acquisition rights. Note 15: Capital Stock The total amount of capital stock authorized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is 150,000,000 shares. The total amount of capital stock issued as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is 95,156,904 shares. 24 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 16: Treasury Shares The number of treasury shares as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is follows: Shares 2019 As of January 1, Increase in Decrease in As of December 31, 2019 FY2019 FY2019 2019 Treasury shares: Common stock 511,035 2,187 1,600 511,622 Total 511,035 2,187 1,600 511,622 Notes: 1.

Note 20: Financial Group policy for financial instruments Instruments The Group manages funds with safe and secure financial assets. Means of financings include direct financing such as the issuance of bonds and commercial papers and liquidation of receivables, as well as indirect financing such as shortand long-term bank borrowings, the terms of which are determined based on financial market conditions and account balances at the time. Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments Receivables such as trade notes and accounts receivable are exposed to customer credit risk. In addition, some of such receivables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Investment securities, mainly the stocks of customers and suppliers, are exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations. Payment terms of payables, such as trade notes and accounts payable, are less than one year. In addition, some of such payables are denominated in foreign currencies and are exposed to the market risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. Funds needed for operations are mainly procured as short-term loans payable, whereas funds needed for capital expenditure and investment are mainly procured as long-term loans payable, bonds payable and lease obligations with regard to finance lease transactions. A part of such bank loans, bonds and lease obligations are exposed to market risks from changes in variable interest rates. Trade accounts payable and loans payable of the Company are also exposed to liquidity risk that the Company cannot meet its contractual obligations in full on maturity dates. Risk management for financial instruments The Company manages its credit risk from trade notes and accounts receivable on the basis of internal guidelines, which include the monitoring of payment terms and balances of customers by the sales and business administration departments to identify the default risk of customers at an early stage. The consolidated subsidiaries of the Company manage the exposure to credit risk on their own in accordance with their internal guidelines. Investment securities are managed by monitoring market values, the financial position of issuers and considering the relationship with customers and suppliers on a regular basis. The Group also tries to mitigate liquidity risk by arranging lines of credit with financial institutions, along with adequate financial planning. Fair values of financial instruments The following tables present the carrying amounts and the fair values of financial instruments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Investment securities The fair values of investment securities are measured at the quoted market price on the stock exchange. Liabilities Notes and accounts payable‚Äìtrade, short-term loans payable and income taxes payable The fair values of these accounts approximate their carrying amounts as these amounts are settled in a short period of time. Current portion of long-term loans payable and long-term loans payable For long-term loans payable bearing a floating interest rate, the fair values of those subject to special treatment of interest rate swaps are based on present value by totaling the amount of principal and interest, together with related interest rate swaps, discounted by the interest rate that would apply if equivalent long-term loans were newly entered into. The fair values of other long-term loans payable for which a floating interest rate is applied approximate their carrying amounts, due to the fact that the market rate of interest is quickly factored in while credit status of the Company remains unchanged. On the other hand, the fair values of long-term loans payable for which a fixed interest rate is applied are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the long-term loans payable. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for loans payable with similar terms and conditions. 29 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Lease obligations (current) and lease obligations (non-current) The fair values of these accounts are determined by discounting the cash flows related to the lease obligations. The discount rate applied for the calculation above is the interest rate that may be currently available to the Group for lease obligations with similar terms and conditions. Bonds payable The fair values are measured at the quoted market prices. Derivative financial instruments Please see Note 21 ‚ÄúDerivative Financial Instruments‚Äù for more information. Financial instruments whose fair value is not reliably measured There are no market prices for non-listed stocks and others (carrying amounts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, are ¬•21,614 million and ¬•29,541 million, respectively) whose future cash flows cannot be estimated. The fair values of such non-listed stocks and others are not reliably determinable and thus excluded from investment securities.

Instruments Foreign currency forward contracts and currency options and swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of exchange rate changes on receivables and payables or anticipated transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Interest rate swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of interest rate changes and to reduce financing cost. Commodity swaps are entered into to hedge the effects of commodity price changes of fuel. Loans denominated in foreign currencies are entered into to hedge a part of risks associated with the fluctuations of exchange rates for investments in foreign entities. The Group does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative transactions performed by the Group have risks due to fluctuations of exchange rates, interest rates and other factors. Because these transactions are executed with creditworthy financial institutions, the Group does not anticipate the likelihood of any losses resulting from default by the counterparties to these agreements. Internal regulation for managing derivative transactions has been established for the purpose of risk control in the Company, and all derivative transactions are performed under this regulation. The execution of derivative transactions is carried out by the Company‚Äôs finance department, and the management of risk is monitored by the Company‚Äôs accounting department. Transactions are periodically reported to the board of directors by the officer in charge of the Finance and Accounting Division. Consolidated subsidiaries execute transactions in accordance with their regulations for derivative management and periodically report the results of those transactions to the Company. 31 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative transactions to which hedge accounting is not applied as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 (1) Currency related Millions of yen 2019 Contract/notional Contract/notional amount due after Unrealized amount one year Fair value gain/loss Currency swaps: (Note 1) (Payment in Australian $ and ¬• 1,067 ¬•‚Äî ¬• (24) ¬• (24) receipt in U.S.$) Other 315 ‚Äî (5) (5) Foreign currency forward contracts: (Note 2) Selling Russian ruble 3,272 ‚Äî (21) (21) U.S.$ 3,172 ‚Äî 3 3 Colombian peso 1,512 ‚Äî (18) (18) Canadian $ 1,322 ‚Äî (14) (14) Other 550 ‚Äî (2) (2) Buying U.S.$ 1,829 ‚Äî (27) (27) Other 779 ‚Äî 1 1 Total ¬•13,817 ¬•‚Äî ¬•(106) ¬•(106) Notes: 1.

(Financing through a Subordinated Term Loan) Procurement of a total of ¬•60 billion through a subordinated term loan (‚Äúthe subordinated loan‚Äù) was approved at a meeting of the Company‚Äôs Board of Directors held on March 24, 2020. 1. Purpose and significance of the subordinated loan The Company had resolved to acquire the shares and assets of the Colors & Effects business of German firm BASF SE on August 29, 2019. 35 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements With regard to the method of procuring funds for this acquisition, the Company planned to choose an approach that would avoid a decline in capital efficiency due to stock dilution and enable it to maintain financial soundness. Having since explored hybrid financing, the Company made the decision to use a subordinated loan. Also, the Company currently has no plans to raise funds through the issue of new shares (equity financing). 2. Characteristics of the subordinated loan A subordinated loan is a type of hybrid financing midway between equity and debt. Accordingly, while classified as debt, it has characteristics similar to equity. As a result, the subordinated loan will be eligible for recognition by credit rating agencies as having equity credit attributes to a certain extent, enabling the Company to strengthen its financial base without causing stock dilution. Specifically, the Company expects 50% of the total amount procured to be assessed as having equity credit attributes by the Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. 3. Summary of the subordinated loan Total amount procured ¬•60 billion Contract date (scheduled) March 31, 2020 Drawdown date Any date within one year of the contract date Use of funds procured Business acquisition Due date 60 years from the drawdown date The Company may repay before the due date all or part of the principal on Early repayment* each interest payment date five years from the drawdown date or later, or in certain other specified circumstances. From drawdown date up to the 10th year, at base floating interest rate plus the initial spread. From the 10th year up to the 25th year, at base floating interest rate plus a Applicable interest rate 0.25% step-up from the initial spread. From the 25th year on, at base floating interest rate plus a 1.00% step-up from the initial spread. Interest deferral clause The Company may defer payment of interest. The creditors of the subordinated loan shall have a claim subordinated to that of other senior debt creditors in the event of the Company‚Äôs liquidation, bankruptcy, corporate reorganization or civil rehabilitation proceedings under JapaSubordination clause nese law or any equivalent proceedings under any laws other than Japanese law. Any provisions stipulated in the subordinated loan agreement shall not be amended in any manner detrimental to any of the Company‚Äôs creditors other than the creditors of the subordinated loan. Lenders MUFG Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., etc. Assessment of equity credit Japan Credit Rating Agency: Medium / 50% attributes (expected) * In the case of early repayment of the subordinated loan, the Company anticipates procuring funds through the issue of common stock or debt (refinancing securities) approved by rating agencies as having equity credit attributes equivalent to or higher than the subordinated loan. However, if the Company satisfies certain financial requirements when early repayment is made five years after the drawdown date or later, it may defer the procurement of funds through refinancing securities. Note 25: Segment (1) Segment information Information New corporate organization introduced Effective from January 1, 2019, the Company revised its segmentation to coincide with the launch of its medium-term management plan, DIC111.
