GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 1 MESSAGE FROM JEAN-DOMINIQUE SENARD Jean-Dominique Senard Chairman of Groupe Renault 2 GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 Find out more at www.groupe.renault.com RENAULT PROFILE Message from Jean-Dominique Senard In a context of a major global health crisis, Groupe Renault is fully committed to the collective efforts to fight against the epidemic. We are mobilized to ensure the safety of our employees and preserve the Group’s business. 2019 was a transition year for Groupe Renault. We have taken the time to restructure in order to better meet the challenges of the rapidly changing automotive sector. We carried out this transition in a context of economic uncertainty and market volatility which led us to reconsider our goals, in a spirit of responsibility and discernment. 2020 will be equally significant for Groupe Renault and the Alliance. Firstly, with the appointment of a new management team: from July 1, 2020, Luca de Meo will join the Group as Chief Executive Officer. Alongside him, Clotilde Delbos will take on the functions of Chief Operating Officer. Together, with support from a renewed and reinforced Executive Committee, they will form a high quality team, with proven qualities, to deliver Groupe Renault’s ambitions. 2020 will also be a decisive year for the Alliance. In 2019, we laid the foundations for a new cooperation, with the creation of the Alliance Operating Board that I have the honor of chairing. This Board will meet every month in the presence of the three Company Senior Executives. Together, we will take the decisions to strengthen the Alliance’s operational effectiveness, which is essential for improving the competitiveness of each member company. With this spirit of consensus, we will build the medium term strategic plans for the three companies. At the beginning of 2020, the Board decided to enter a new phase by presenting a new work framework to gain the maximum potential from each one’s strengths. For example, it was decided that a company should take the lead in the Groupe Renault faces Alliance for each key technology, that will be then spread multiple challenges, across the Alliance partners. but we have all of the This new organization for the Alliance is the foundation strengths for Groupe Renault’s success. It will enable us to face the investments required to adapt to a changing regulatory context and develop the mobility of tomorrow. Groupe Renault faces multiple challenges, but we have all of the strengths, know-how and talents to meet them. The Group is transforming itself on a daily basis to better leverage these strengths and provide truly sustainable and inclusive mobility, everywhere and for everyone.

The market downturn, volatile economic conditions and the acceleration in environmental regulations affected us at a time when we were also confronted with challenges internally. We pulled through. We succeeded in delivering on the commitments made in October by leveraging our strengths, know-how and expertise. We launched a new generation of vehicles with the New Clio and New Captur, which have contributed to our growth in Europe. Driven by our launches, we strengthened our positions in Russia with Arkana, Brazil with Kwid and Sandero and India with Triber. In the electric vehicle segment, our sales increased by around 25% over the year, and we have just launched the New ZOE. Lastly, we achieved a new sales record for our light commercial vehicles, as has our global access brand Dacia for the 7th consecutive year. These achievements are the result of the efforts made by all Groupe Renault’s teams, and I would like to thank them sincerely.

These elements include in particular road infrastructure, current legislation and its application, policies, and road user training and awareness levels. Accordingly, alone or in partnerships, Groupe Renault works to implement the measures best suited to a country’s level of maturity. Groupe Renault’s road safety policy and actions are based on a five-pronged approach: RAISE AWARENESS Changing the behavior of all stakeholders (public authorities, parents, drivers, children) over the long-term and educating people from the earliest age to the dangers of the road, are key weapons in the battle to improve road safety. RAISE AWARENESS PREVENT Prevention involves helping drivers to anticipate risks. Part of the solution consists of helping the driver by assisting with the driving task (driving aids). The remainder lies in encouraging more responsible driving. Drivers need to understand the limits beyond which they will be incapable of controlling their vehicles, and the situations in which they are putting themselves at risk. PREVENT CORRECT The quality of road handling and braking constitutes the fundamental dynamics of the vehicle. They are fundamental to avoiding accidents. Nevertheless, there are situations where technology should intervene to compensate for driver error. This is the purpose of these active safety systems. They intervene in difficult or emergency conditions; however, they do not do entirely replace the driver. CORRECT PROTECT A top priority of Groupe Renault’s road safety strategy is to protect the car’s occupants according to the nature and severity of the impact, regardless of their age, size or location in the vehicle, in small and large cars alike. Renault exceeds Euro NCAP standards by also equipping the rear seats of its vehicles with systems to provide optimal passenger protection. The protection of other road users (pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) is also taken into account. PROTECT RESCUE Groupe Renault collaborates with French and foreign emergency services to optimize help for accident casualties. These services receive guides explaining how to perform rescue operations on Renault vehicles. They are also provided with late-model vehicles on which they can practice victim extraction methods. Innovative modifications are applied to the brand’s vehicles to ensure that emergency firefighter interventions are safer and more effective.

Plants eco-designed to respect their local environment As a result of the Group’s international expansion, new plants have been developed in recent years in emerging countries, particularly in North Africa and Asia, in order to take advantage of dynamic local markets. The design of each of these facilities has benefited from Group best practices and the latest technological advances in the environmental field. It takes into account the specific local environmental constraints and sensitivities, identified by an impact study at the outset of the project. For example, the plants of Tangiers in Morocco (2012) and Chennai in India (Renault-Nissan, 2010), two countries subject to water stress, use the most advanced technologies to recycle all industrial wastewater, such that no industrial wastewater is discharged into the environment and external water supply requirements are reduced to a strict minimum (see 2.3.3.D). The Tangiers site is also equipped with a biomass boiler fueled by local agricultural waste (waste from the production of olive oil and from wood chippings, in particular from the site’s packaging waste). As the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE) provides the plant with electricity produced from entirely renewable sources, 92% of the plant’s energy needs are as a result met by renewable sources, meaning that the emission of more than 100,000 metric tons of CO2 each year is avoided. The plant, which Renault and its partner Dongfeng opened in 2016 in Wuhan, China, is also equipped with the latest energy-efficiency technology, including LED lighting, recovery of thermal energy from the air discharged to the atmosphere and centralized management of energy-intensive equipment.

GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 175 02 RENAULT: A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY ENVIRONMENT Designing vehicles that are recyclable and When the production of waste cannot be avoided, an effort is material-efficient made to reduce the quantity by separating the portion that is not strictly-speaking waste (recoverable active substances, water, Renault anticipated the European etc.). For example, the filtering systems for paint sludge facilitate regulatory requirement whereby 95% a reduction in the quantities of waste to be eliminated since they of vehicle mass should be recyclable or extract the water contained in the sludge. Optimization of sludge recoverable, and implemented it on all drainage at the Palencia plant resulted in a 25% reduction in the MATERIALS models brought to market as of 2007. ratio of production of paint sludge to vehicles produced between In addition, it has been voluntarily 2018 and 2019. Similarly, the separation of dry matter and oils applied to all vehicles sold by Groupe contained in the sludge and the shavings from machining reduces Renault worldwide. the tonnage of waste and facilitates the recovery of oils that can Accordingly, since the early 2000s, the be reused in the manufacturing process. The installation of an design of Renault vehicles has taken dismantling and recycling evaporator-concentrator at the Seville plant at the end of 2017 requirements into account. For example, dismantling has been made made it possible to reduce the tonnage of hazardous waste by easier by reducing the number of fixing points. Similarly, preference about 30% between 2017 and 2018; is given to recyclable materials for which recycling systems exist; P reuse spent products, production offcuts and scrap: in assembly whenever possible, a single part will not contain materials that plants, excess anti-corrosion protection waxes are recovered after cannot be recycled together; and tanks are shaped to allow all fuel application, filtered and returned to the production system. and oil to be removed. During the design phase, every vehicle project Following the implementation of regeneration of solvents used to is monitored by a recycling specialist. rinse the painting robots on most sites, the re-use of these The possibility of renovating powertrains or certain of their parts regenerated solvents in the paint lines is now in place at the (remanufacturing) is also taken into consideration from the Batilly, Maubeuge, Flins, Sandouville (France) and Valladolid beginning of their design by facilitating the dismantling and (Spain) sites. In Colombia, the Medellin plant has been recycling its assessment of their components. paint solvents internally since 2014, enabling the plant to almost completely eliminate solvent waste. As regards powertrain Renault is also working at reducing the amount of materials used in manufacturing sites, the Cléon plant collects and regenerates manufacturing its vehicles. Renault has introduced two used stamping and hydraulic oils from the Flins plant to use as a technological advances to the steel used in vehicle bodies, in order substitute for new oils. When they are in good condition, used to reduce the consumption of sheet metal: wood pallets are re-used within the Company or resold for the P the use of sheet metal with high elastic limits (including same purpose. Gaïa, a subsidiary of Renault Environnement, hot-pressed steel) reduces the thickness and therefore the mass recovers unused end-of-series parts from within the plants, sorts of the parts; them and sells them; P stamping processes have been optimized to improve material P recycle the materials contained within the waste. This form of consumption, i.e., the ratio between the mass of the part and the waste treatment can be applied to most recoverable materials initial mass of the metal blank. These processes allow smaller (cardboard, plastic, metal, etc.). In this way, metallic waste, which blanks to be used to make the same part and generate less metal represents over 70% of the total production waste, is almost waste. completely recycled. Paper, cardboard and plastics are also systematically sorted for recycling. However, beyond these Reducing at source and recovering industrial waste “traditional” recyclable waste categories, some more complex In accordance with the principles of types of waste that may initially appear of no value can also be the circular economy, Renault has recycled through incorporation in the composition of new adopted a preventive approach to materials.

Pursuant to the “comply or explain” rule in Article 27.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and the provisions of Article L. 225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code, the recommendations of that Code that have not been followed and the related explanations are summarized in the table below: Recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code (January 2020 version) Comments Director independence criteria Article (9.5) At its meeting on February 13, 2020, the Board of Directors reviewed Mr Pierre Fleuriot’s situation with regard to Criterion 1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code in view of his appointment as director of Nissan proposed by Renault at the Nissan Extraordinary General Meeting of February 18, 2020, pursuant to the agreements existing between the two companies. The AFEP-MEDEF Code states that one of the criteria that the Board of Directors must examine to rule out the status of Independent Director is “not being or not having been, during the previous five years, an employee, executive officer or director of a company within the company’s scope of consolidation.” According to the AFEP-MEDEF guidelines, this recommendation also applies when the director exercises “a term of office in a company in which the former holds a non-majority but significant shareholding, or in a sister company”. Please note that Nissan is not fully consolidated by Renault. Renault has significant influence over Nissan and therefore recognizes its stake in Nissan using the equity method (for more details on Renault’s stake in Nissan, see note 12 to chapter 4.2.6.4 of the Universal registration document). The Board of Directors, on the recommendation of the Governance and Compensation Committee, held that Renault’s proposal to appoint its Lead Independent Director to the Nissan Board of Directors with a view to developing and strengthening cooperation between the Boards of Directors of the two Alliance partners was not such as to call into question Mr Pierre Fleuriot’s freedom of judgment and independence with respect to Renault.

GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 299 03 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMPENSATION OF COMPANY OFFICERS 3.2 COMPENSATION OF COMPANY OFFICERS As stated in the introduction to chapter 3 of the Universal registration document, and pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-37-4 8° of the French Commercial Code, the Company refers to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. 3.2.1 General principles relating to the compensation of the corporate officers Once a year, as recommended by the Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors sets the components of the compensation awarded to the corporate officers. The Company’s compensation policy is regularly reviewed at meetings of the Governance and Compensation Committee, which is composed mainly of Independent Directors and chaired by an Independent Director in accordance with the Board of Directors’ charter. In its recommendations, the Governance and Compensation Committee takes into account the balance of the different components of the corporate officers’ compensation. The compensation policy for the non-executive corporate officer is based on a fixed compensation and does not include any variable or exceptional cash compensation, nor compensation for directorship. The compensation policy for the executive officer is based on six simple, stable, transparent practices: P 1 Closely linked to the Company’s strategy P The compensation is closely linked to the implementation and results of the strategy. P 2 Performance-oriented P The variable component of the executive officer’s compensation represents a fraction of the total compensation that is more significant compared to the one usually applied in the market and ensures the interests of the executive officer are aligned with the Company’s performance. P No variable compensation is granted in the event of under-performance. P 3 Focus on long-term performance P A large part of the executive officers’ compensation depends on multi-year targets being achieved. P 4 Close alignment with shareholders P The number of performance shares allocated to the executive officer is expressed as an absolute number, rather than a percentage of the salary, so that upward and downward fluctuations in the share price affect the corresponding total value. P The executive officer must retain 25% of the shares vested pursuant to performance share plans until the end of his term of office. P 5 Competitive compensation P Competition between corporate officers in the automotive market is intense. It is therefore of prime importance to ensure that the overall compensation of the executive officer is competitive compared to the practices of the Company’s peers, both CAC 40 companies and, more generally, comparable companies in the Automotive sector in Europe and worldwide. P 6 Compensation which does not encourage P The setting of performance targets, a sufficiently long evaluation period, and compensation capping allow excessive risk-taking excessive short-term risk-taking to be avoided. These principles are established in compliance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. More generally, the Governance and Compensation Committee regularly ensures that corporate officers’ compensation complies with all applicable laws and requirements in terms of corporate governance. 300 GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 Find out more at www.groupe.renault.com RENAULT: ANNUAL GENERAL GROUPE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RENAULT AND ADDITIONAL A RESPONSIBLE MEETING OF RENAULT RENAULT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS ITS SHAREHOLDERS INFORMATION COMPANY ON APRIL 24, 2020 COMPENSATION OF COMPANY OFFICERS In addition, the committee takes into account market best practices regarding the compensation of executive officers: Best practices that we follow: Practices we do not follow: P Use appropriate peer groups (country based and sector based) to inform (but not P Pay for failure: pay variable components in the event of poor performance of the dictate) compensation policy; Group; P Only make modifications to performance criteria when there are material changes P Place a disproportionate weight on short-term variable compensation versus to our business strategy and in order to maintain the alignment with shareholders’ long-term variable compensation; interests P Overly weight qualitative criteria in the annual variable compensation; P Clear mention of a cap for all variable elements; P Reward excessive or inappropriate risk-taking; P Set demanding performance conditions; P Have extraordinary severance payments in addition to the two-year non-compete P Include CSR criteria that are significant for the Company’s performance and aligned indemnity; with the corporate strategy; P Provide excessive severance or sign-on arrangements to our executives.

Budgeted Group operating margin was 6% and the actual Group operating margin for 2019 was 4.8%. P 0% (out of a maximum of 30%) for the Group revenues criterion. Budgeted revenues were €57,500 million, and actual 2019 revenues were €55,537 million. P 30% (out of a maximum of 30%) for the free cash flow (FCF) criterion. Budgeted FCF was €150 million and the actual FCF was €153 million at December 31, 2019. P Qualitative criteria: 20.60% (out of a maximum of 25%) broken down as follows: P Renault’s contribution to the Alliance Mid-Term Plan: 5.60% (out of a maximum of 8.33%), This target is broken down, on the one hand, into an achievement rate for cars produced on common platforms and on the other, an achievement rate for the use of common parts. These factors generate economies of scale that contribute to reducing development, purchasing and manufacturing costs for Group vehicles. In its assessment, the Governance and Compensation Committee noted the progress of these two indicators in 2019 while taking into account certain delays due to the implementation of a new governance structure within the Alliance. P Quality of CSR and environmental commitments: 7.60% (out of a maximum of 8.33%) The targets set on workplace safety were exceeded; these are notably measured by the FR1 rate (frequency rate of workplace accidents for Renault employees requiring external medical care), which improved compared to 2018 (see Chapter 2.4.2.4 of the Universal registration document). The Group’s CSR approach, entitled Mobilize, is structured around two areas of action– inclusion and sustainable mobility – and focuses on five commitments: diversity, education, social entrepreneurship, road safety and environment. The Mobilize program has developed as planned within the Group, with an increased budget (see Chapter 2.1 of the Universal registration document). However, in terms of compliance, certain rules and procedures still need to be deployed within the Group, which explains that the quality of CSR and environmental commitments criterion was not achieved at 100%. P Monitoring of the France multiyear agreement: 7.40% (out of a maximum of 8.33%). Among the 3 sub-criteria assessed and indicated in the CAP2020 agreement, the average of production volumes in France over the 2017-2019 period is slightly lower than the 2016 volume. However, the targets for allocation of new vehicles to French plants and manufacturing of chassis and powertrain parts, as well as the level of CAPEX and the number of hires in France were achieved (see Chapter 2.4.1.4 C of the Universal registration document). Having noted that the overall rate of achievement of the performance criteria was 50.60% for the 2019 financial year and recalling that Mr Thierry Bolloré’s gross annual fixed compensation was €651,915 for his term of office during the 2019 financial year (the gross annual amount of €900,000 prorated over the period from January 24 to October 11, 2019), the Board of Directors decided to set Mr Thierry Bolloré’s gross variable compensation in respect of the 2019 financial year at €329,869.

Pursuant to this authorization, the agreement was entered into between the Company and Mr Thierry Bolloré on April 3, 2019. In accordance with the recommendation of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board of Directors of November 8, 2019 decided, upon the end of Mr Thierry Bolloré’s term of office, to waive the benefit of the non-compete agreement subscribed by Mr Thierry Bolloré on April 3, 2019. Consequently, no monetary consideration has been paid to Mr Thierry Bolloré. The signature of this agreement was approved by the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting of June 12, 2019 (14th resolution). Under this agreement, Mr Thierry Bolloré undertook, as of the end of his term of office as Chief Executive Officer, not to engage, directly or indirectly, in an activity that competes with those of the Group, on his own behalf, on behalf of companies in the automotive design, construction and marketing sectors (mainly passenger cars and commercial vehicles), or on behalf of automotive suppliers. The application of this clause was limited to: P a period of twenty-four (24) months following the date on which Mr Thierry Bolloré effectively ceased to exercise his term of office (mandate social); P the territories in which the Group operates at the time of the termination of the term of office, excluding countries located in Africa and Oceania, and, in the case of equipment manufacturers, North America (United States, Canada). In consideration for his non-compete obligation, Mr Thierry Bolloré would receive from the Company, during the period of application of the agreement (twenty-four months) and subject to there being no breach of this agreement, gross financial compensation corresponding to two years of gross annual compensation (fixed compensation and annual variable compensation paid in cash), payable in twenty-four monthly installments.

This plan was authorized by the Board of Directors on April 3, 2019 and approved by the General Meeting of June 12, 2019 (15th resolution). On November 8, 2019, ruling on the financial conditions for the departure of Mr Thierry Bolloré, the Board of Directors noted that: (i) Mr Thierry Bolloré will retain the rights acquired in respect of the defined-contribution pension scheme under the conditions set by the scheme’s rules. (ii) Mr Thierry Bolloré lost his rights to the defined-benefit top-up pension scheme as a result of his departure from Renault SA. It is reminded that the pension scheme from which Mr Thierry Bolloré benefited was composed of (a) a defined-contribution scheme and (b) a top-up defined-benefit pension scheme. (a) Defined-contribution pension scheme (Article L. 242-1 of the French Social Security Code) Mr Thierry Bolloré benefited from a defined-contribution scheme; these contributions correspond to 8% of that part of his annual compensation (fixed and variable components) between eight and sixteen times the annual French Social Security cap (Band D); of this, 5% is paid by the Company and 3% by Mr Thierry Bolloré. The Company’s commitment is limited to the payment of his share of the contributions to the insurance firm managing the scheme. The estimated amount of the Chief Executive Officer’s annuity at December 31, 2018, based on the seniority acquired at that date, represented €6,022 per year in respect of the top-up defined-contribution pension scheme, assuming retirement entitlements are taken at the age of 65. (b) Top-up defined-benefit pension scheme (Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code) Mr Thierry Bolloré also benefited from a top-up defined-benefit pension scheme, arranged and financed by the Company, the management of which is outsourced to an insurance firm. Benefiting from this scheme is subject to a seniority condition (five years minimum with the Company and at least two years on the Group Executive Committee) and a presence condition as corporate officer, applied as of retirement. The reference compensation used to calculate the top-up defined-benefit pension scheme is equal to the average of the three gross annual compensations (fixed and variable components) the highest during the last ten years of activity prior to retirement.The annual amount paid into this pension scheme is equal to 10% of the reference compensation, this percentage rising by 1.4 percentage points per year of seniority in excess of five years on the Group Executive Committee, and by 0.4 percentage points per year of seniority other than on the Group Executive Committee, in the case of more than five years’ seniority with the Company. The amount is capped at 30% of the reference compensation. The reference compensation in question is capped at 65 times the annual French Social Security cap. In any event, the annual total of these pension amounts for the Chief Executive Officer may not exceed 45% of his reference compensation. If this cap is exceeded, the amount of the top-up defined-benefit pension will be reduced accordingly. The Company’s commitment to its Chief Executive Officer as of December 31, 2018, based on his seniority at that date, represented €169,138 in gross annual pension in respect of this top-up defined-benefit pension scheme.

Budgeted Group operating margin was 6% and the actual Group operating margin for 2019 was 4.8%. P 0% (out of a maximum of 30%) for the Group revenues criterion. Budgeted revenues were €57,500 million, and actual 2019 revenues were €55,537 million. P 30% (out of a maximum of 30%) for the free cash flow (FCF) criterion. Budgeted FCF was €150 million and the actual FCF was €153 million at December 31, 2019. P Qualitative criteria: 20.60% (out of a maximum of25%) broken down as follows: P Renault’s contribution to the Alliance Mid-Term Plan: 5.60% (out of a maximum of 8.33%), This target is broken down, on the one hand, into an achievement rate for cars produced on common platforms and on the other, an achievement rate for the use of common parts. These factors generate economies of scale that contribute to reducing development, purchasing and manufacturing costs for Group vehicles. In its assessment, the Governance and Compensation Committee noted the progress of these two indicators in 2019 while taking into account certain delays due to the implementation of a new governance structure within the Alliance. P Quality of CSR and environmental commitments: 7.60% (out of a maximum of 8.33%) The targets set on workplace safety were exceeded; these are notably measured by the FR1 rate (frequency rate of workplace accidents for Renault employees requiring external medical care), which improved compared to 2018 (see Chapter 2.4.2.4 of the Universal registration document). The Group’s CSR approach, entitled Mobilize, is structured around two areas of action– inclusion and sustainable mobility – and focuses on five commitments: diversity, education, social entrepreneurship, road safety and environment. The Mobilize program has developed as planned within the Group, with an increased budget (see Chapter 2.1 of the Universal registration document). However, in terms of compliance, certain rules and procedures still need to be deployed within the Group, which explains that the quality of CRS and environmental commitments criterion was not achieved at 100%. P Monitoring of the France multiyear agreement: 7.40% (out of a maximum of 8.33%). Among the 3 sub-criteria assessed and indicated in the CAP2020 agreement, the average of production volumes in France over the 2017-2019 period is slightly lower than the 2016 volume. However, the targets for allocation of new vehicles to French plants and manufacturing of chassis and powertrain parts, as well as the level of CAPEX and the number of hires in France were achieved (see Chapter 2.4.1.4 C of the Universal registration document). The Board of Directors, having noted that the overall achievement rate of the performance criteria was 50.60% for the 2019 financial year and recalling that the annual fixed compensation of Ms Clotilde Delbos was a gross amount of €83,307 for her term of office during the 2019 financial year (gross annual amount of €371,329 pro-rated over the period from October 11 to December 31, 2019), decided to set the variable compensation of Ms Clotilde Delbos in respect of the 2019 financial year at a gross amount of €42,153. Ms Clotilde Delbos also benefits, pursuant to her employment contract with Renault s.a.s., from a variable compensation that may reach 150% of her base compensation if all performance objectives are met (see paragraph Compensation components of Ms Clotilde Delbos in respect of her employment contract with Renault s.a.s. below). The total variable compensation of Ms Clotilde Delbos in respect of her corporate office and her employment contract may not exceed the maximum annual amount of 1,125,000 euros set for the previous Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the compensation policy voted by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 12 June 2019.

Top-up pension scheme €0 The interim Chief Executive Officer benefits from the collective pension scheme set up for members of Groupe Renault’s Executive Committee. The benefit of this top-up pension scheme to the interim Chief Executive Officer was approved by the Board of Directors on November 8, 2019, in accordance with the compensation policy approved by the Shareholders’ Annual General Meeting of June 12, 2019 for the Chief Executive Officer. This scheme includes a defined-contribution pension scheme and a defined-benefit pension scheme. (a) Defined-contribution pension scheme (Article L. 242-1 of the French Social Security Code) Ms Clotilde Delbos benefited from a defined-contribution pension scheme; these contributions correspond to 8% of that part of her annual compensation (fixed and variable components) between eight and sixteen times the annual French Social Security cap (Band D); of this, 5% is paid by the Company and 3% by Ms Clotilde Delbos. The Company’s commitment to its interim Chief Executive Officer is limited to the payment of its share of the contributions to the insurance firm managing the scheme. The contributions paid to the insurance firm as part of this scheme are calculated based on Ms Clotilde Delbos’ compensation in respect of both her corporate office and employment contract. The amount of Ms Clotilde Delbos’ estimated annual pension in respect of both her corporate office and employment contract represented €4,366 at December 31, 2018 (for a retirement liquidation at 65 years). (b) Top-up defined-benefit pension scheme (Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code) Ms Clotilde Delbos also benefits from a top-up defined-benefit pension scheme, arranged and financed by the Company, the management of which is outsourced to an insurance firm. Benefiting from this scheme is subject to a seniority condition (five years minimum with the Company and at least two years on the Group Executive Committee) and a presence condition as Chief Executive Officer, applied as of retirement. The reference compensation used to calculate the top-up defined-benefit pension scheme is equal to the average of the three gross annual compensations (fixed and variable components) the highest during the last ten years of activity prior to retirement. Pursuant to the publication of ruling no. 2019-697 of July 3, 2019, based on Article 197 of the “Pacte” Law and reforming the top-up defined-benefit pension scheme as of December 31, 2019, Groupe Renault decided to close this top-up defined-benefit pension scheme, resulting in the loss of the corresponding rights for all active beneficiaries, including Ms Clotilde Delbos (see Note 27-A to the 2019 consolidated financial statements, Chapter 4.2.6.6 of the Universal registration document for provisions reversals triggered by the closure of this scheme).

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the year ended December 31, 2019 To the Annual General Meeting of Renault, Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Renault for the year ended December 31, 2019. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31, 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee. Basis for Opinion Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from January 1st, 2019 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5, paragraph of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors.

AVTOVAZ) Risk identified Intangible and tangible assets and goodwill, of the operating segment “Automotive (excluding AVTOVAZ)” amount to 21 701 million euros. The Group carries out impairment tests at the level of intangible and tangible vehicle-specific assets related to specific vehicle models as soon as an impairment risk indicator has been identified, under the approach described in note 2-M of the consolidated financial statements. The test consists in comparing the net book value of the intangible and tangible assets related to specific vehicle models with their recoverable value, defined as the higher amount between the value in use and the fair value net of exit costs. The value in use is calculated based on discounted future cash flows. We have considered that the valuation of the vehicle-specific assets is a key audit matter because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the estimates and judgments required from Management to prepare these tests. Our audit response During our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our procedures mainly consisted in: P Understanding the analysis performed by Management in order to identify specific vehicle models presenting impairment indicators. P For the vehicle models tested: P Reconciling the net book value of vehicle-specific assets to the consolidated financial statements. P Assessing the consistency of the forecast volumes and margins assumptions used in the tests with the latest Management assumptions. P Assessing the reasonableness of the main assumptions used through interviews with the economic controllers in charge of the vehicles being tested and by comparing the assumptions with the data used in the previous impairment tests as well as, if applicable, with the historical performance of the vehicles. P Testing the arithmetical accuracy of the discounted cash flows projections prepared by management for vehicles subject to an impairment test. P Comparing the discount rate after tax used with external data available. P Performing sensitivity analysis on the main assumptions used. 04 CONSOLIDATION METHOD AND RECOVERABLE VALUE OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENT IN NISSAN Risk identified As at December 31, 2019, the Renault equity investment in Nissan amounts to 20,622 million euros, and Nissan contributes for 242 million euros to Renault net profit for the period. As indicated in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, Renault has a significant influence over Nissan and accounts for its investment using the equity method. The Nissan accounts used to prepare Renault’s financial statements are Nissan’s consolidated accounts published in compliance with Japanese accounting standards, adjusted according to group Renault standards for consolidation purposes. In accordance with the approach described in the accounting policies (note 2-M), an impairment test of the investment in Nissan was carried out at December 31, 2019. We have considered that the consolidation method and recoverable value of the equity investment in Nissan is a key audit matter given its magnitude to Renault’s consolidated financial statements, and given the following areas of attention: (1) the judgment of management to assess the Alliance governance structure as well as facts and circumstances underlying Renault’s significant influence over Nissan, (2) the completeness of adjustments to Nissan’s financial statements required to account for Renault’s share in the result and equity of this company and their accuracy, (3) the estimates used by management in determining the recoverable value of Renault’s investment in Nissan. Our audit response Our audit response to the risks identified mainly consisted in: P Reading the minutes of the Board of Directors meetings and the related party agreements and commitments register, and obtaining confirmation from management that there were no changes in the governance of Nissan and/or no new contracts structuring the relations between Renault and Nissan which could modify the analysis of the significant influence exercised by Renault over Nissan. P Understanding the conclusions and the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan in accordance with our instructions which detail the procedures to be performed and the conclusion format required for our audit purposes. P Understanding the audit work performed by the independent auditor of Nissan over the homogenization adjustments required to Nissan’s financial statements to match Renault accounting policies. P Assessing whether there are any identified impairment indicators, the main indicators being significant adverse changes on markets where Nissan operates or a significant and long lasting drop in Nissan stock market value. P Examining the relevance of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable value of its investment in Nissan, by reference to Nissan mid-term plan, historical performance achieved by Nissan as well as the overall perspectives of the Automotive sector. P Assessing the appropriateness of the information provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. RECOVERABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF THE FRENCH TAX GROUP Risk identified As indicated in note 8-A of the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the deferred tax charge for 2019 takes into account the discontinuation of the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax losses carryforwards under the French tax consolidation group for an amount of -753 million euros. The recognition of a deferred tax asset depends on the ability of the legal entities of the French tax group to achieve the financial performance expected by management. The termination of the recognition of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards of the French tax consolidation group as of December 31, 2019 is a key audit matter given the level of judgment required from Management, with regards specifically to the ability to reliably estimate future taxable results over the historical timeframe. Our audit response Our audit response to the risks identified mainly consisted in: P Assessing the consistency of the expected financial results for the French tax group with the main assumptions underlying the revised group mid term plan Drive the Future, which is currently being updated by Management and is expected to be issued in the first half of the year. P Comparing budgeted and actual results in prior periods to assess the reliability of the budgeting processes. P In respect of the deferred tax assets no longer recognized, assessing the nature and extent of the positive and negative evidence considered by Management to conclude that the availability of future taxable profits was not sufficiently probable at the balance sheet date. GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 335 04 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RECOVERABLE VALUE OF SALES FINANCING RECEIVABLES (RCI) Risk identified The sales financing activity is managed by RCI Banque with dedicated offers for individuals and companies as well as the financing of dealer networks. RCI Banque sets aside provisions to cover the risk of losses resulting from the inability of its clients to meet their financial commitments. Since January 1, 2018, RCI Banque applies IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , which defines in particular a new methodology for estimating provisions based on a prospective model, moving from a provisioning of ascertained credit losses to a provisioning model for expected losses based on a 3-bucket approach: loans without signs of impairment (bucket 1), loans that have signs of impairment (bucket 2) and loans with serious credit impairment or arreage (bucket 3). We consider the amount of credit loss provisioning as a key point of the audit, due to the size of the amount of customer and network loans in the assets of the Group’s balance sheet, the use of numerous parameters and assumptions in the calculation models and the use of judgment made by management in estimating expected credit losses.

Specific Verifications We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group’s information given in the management report of the Board of Directors. We have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements. We attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), is included in the Group’s management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-10 of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Appointment of the Statutory Auditors We were appointed as statutory auditors of Renault by the Annual General Meeting held on April 30, 2014 for KPMG S.A. and on by Order from the Ministry of the Economy of March 27, 1979 for Ernst & Young Audit. As at December 31, 2019, KPMG S.A. was in the sixth year of total uninterrupted engagement and Ernst & Young Audit was in the forty first year of total uniterrupted engagement, of which twenty-six year since securities of the Company were admitted to trading on a regulated market. Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit, Riks and Compliance Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. 336 GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 Find out more at www.groupe.renault.com RENAULT: ANNUAL GENERAL GROUPE CORPORATE FINANCIAL RENAULT AND ADDITIONAL A RESPONSIBLE MEETING OF RENAULT RENAULT GOVERNANCE STATEMENTS ITS SHAREHOLDERS INFORMATION COMPANY ON APRIL 24, 2020 STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: P Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a 04 basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. P Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. P Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements. P Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. P Evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. P Obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed on these consolidated financial statements. Report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee We submit to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters, that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.

(3) The fair value of Renault redeemable shares is identical to the stock market price.

The rates offered to Renault result from observable market data such as zero-coupon interest rate curves and secondary market prices for bonds issued by the Group, and consequently this is a level 2 fair value. The fair value of AVTOVAZ financial liabilities measured at amortized cost is determined by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for borrowings with similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

This statutory auditors’ report includes information required by European regulation and French law, such as information about the appointment of the statutory auditors or verification of the management report and other documents provided to shareholders. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. 04 For the year ended December 31, 2019 To the Annual General Meeting of Renault, Opinion In compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we have audited the accompanying financial statements of Renault for the year ended December 31, 2019. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2019 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. The audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee. Basis for Opinion Audit Framework We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. Independence We conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence rules applicable to us, for the period from January 1st, 2019 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Justification of Assessments Key Audit Matters In accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements. Valuation of equity investments Risk identified At December 31, 2019, equity investments are accounted for in Renault SA balance sheet for 18.2 B€, representing one of the most significant caption of the total assets. Investments are valued at acquisition cost at the date of entry, and their recoverable value is then assessed by management as described in Note 2.1 to the notes to the individual financial statements of Renault. Renault SA has opted to account for investments in controlled companies under the equity method. The value of these investments is determined based on their contribution to the consolidated equity of Renault, and the change during the year in the overall share of shareholders’ equity corresponding to these interests is included in shareholders’ equity under Equity valuation difference . GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 417 04 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORTS The other investments mainly relate to Renault’s equity investment in Nissan. This investment is valued at the lower amount between the book value and the value in use, which takes into account the share of net assets and profitability prospects of Nissan. The assessment of the recoverable value of Renault’s investment in Nissan is based on expected profitability and requires judgement from management. In this context, we have considered that the valuation of the investments was a key audit matter. Our audit response In order to assess the reasonableness of the value in use of equity investments, we mainly relied on the work performed for the purpose of the consolidated financial statement audit. Our work mainly consisted in: Regarding Renault’s investments in controlled companies: P Check that the shareholders’ equity in each of these investments corresponds to their contribution to the consolidated equity of Renault. P Check that Renault has performed the necessary adjustments, if any, to take into account potential impairment losses accounted for in the group’s consolidated financial statements. Regarding Renault investment in Nissan: P Assess the reasonableness of the main assumptions used by Renault in the impairment test performed to assess the recoverable value of its investment in Nissan, by referring to Nissan’s stock market value, mid-term plan and historical performance and the growth prospects of the Automotive sector. Specific Verification We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations. Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders. We attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D.441-4 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Report on corporate governance We attest that the Board of Directors’ report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L.225-37-3 and L.225-37-4 of the French Commercial Code. Concerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L.225-37-3 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by the directors and any other commitments made in their favour, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlling and controlled companies. Based on these procedures, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. With respect to the information relating to items that your company considered likely to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, provided pursuant to Article L.225-37-5 of the French Commercial Code, we have agreed this information to the source documents communicated to us. Based on these procedures, we have no observations to make on this information. Other information In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders and holders of the voting rights and the cross-shareholdings has been properly disclosed in the management report.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations. The Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its internal audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures. The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors. Statutory Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements 04 Objectives and audit approach Our role is to issue a report on the financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company. As part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore: P Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. P Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control. P Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements. P Assesses the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein. P Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. GROUPE RENAULT I UNIVERSAL REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2019 419 04 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORTS Report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee We submit to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified. Our report to the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report. We also provide the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) N° 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de déontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit, Risks and Compliance Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.
