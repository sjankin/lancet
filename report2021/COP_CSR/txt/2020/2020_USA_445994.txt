The EPA’s Green Power Partnership program has recognized UNFCU since 2017 for our commitment to supporting clean, renewable energy. 8 | 2019 Impact Report Energy Eficiency Goal: Reduce energy use by 7% in operationally controlled buildings. Not on Track Why are we not on track with this goal? In 2018-2019, UNFCU temporarily saw a 31% increase in ofice space. This was due to the departure of a major tenant from our Long Island City headquarters. With their departure, we had more operationally controlled space, resulting in a temporary increase in electricity use. A new tenant leased the vacant space in late 2019. By the end of 2020, we expect electricity use to decrease to 2-3% below the 2015 baseline.  10.8% 2019 total increase in electricity 3,745,562 kWh 2015 usage. 3,381,086 kWh  11.7% decrease in electricity usage/member. 9 | 2019 Impact Report Reducing Paper Use Goal: Reduce paper use by 25%.

Implement sustainable travel guidelines. Develop and launch green products. Goals Achieved As a credit union, we know that where we put our money matters. That is why, in 2017, we instituted a sustainable procurement policy. We measure, track, and work to inluence our suppliers to help them move the needle on sustainability. UNFCU members and staff can have the peace of mind that our vendor-partners also relect our values. You can learn more about our Supplier Code of Conduct at unfcu.org/global-sustainability-program. UNFCU conducted a sustainability survey of all vendor-partners that met three criteria: 1. Ongoing relationship with UNFCU 2. Signiicant spend 3. High impact services Questions were asked about their sustainability policies, diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and their tracking and management of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We aimed to have 85% of suppliers respond to the survey questionnaire. We received a 100% response rate in 2018 and 2019. The results were tabulated and the suppliers’ achievement levels were graded from A (a sustainability leader) to D (no reported sustainability program). In 2019, the average score of the suppliers we surveyed was a B. UNFCU launched a 12-month Impact Share Certiicate in 2018. Three hundred members have deposited a total of $12 million in this certiicate. The certiicate funds positive impact projects, including: Investment in securities that promote affordable housing, public transportation, and clean water and energy products.  Offering new loans that will enable members to inance environmentally positive initiatives.
