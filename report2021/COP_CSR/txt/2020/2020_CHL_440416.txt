Thus, was born the Itaú Digital Branch. This new service platform, launched in 2019, is the result of the far-reaching digital transformation eﬀorts that have challenged us to rethink, redesign and simplify our processes in order to oﬀer an experience that includes remote, extended-schedule customer service, among other benefits. Our challenge is to oﬀer products and services that create value for our customers’ lives and businesses at the time and place they need them. That is why the digital branch includes an online chat, e-mail service and a specialized team to respond to specific requirements with faster response times than the traditional format. As of January 2020, our two digital branches have 4,500 active customers and oﬀer all products remotely, including mortgage loans. Our customers have positively evaluated the new business model, which we are in the process of expanding in 2020. 21 2.1. Our Way 102-16 Our seven attitudes 1. It is only good for us if it is good for the customer We are people at the service of people, with passion and excellence. We work with and for the customer because they are the reason behind everything we do. 2. Performance fanatics Generating sustainable results is in our DNA. The ongoing challenge of achieving leadership in performance has brought us to this point and will continue to guide our company toward our objectives. 3. People are everything to us Everything we do is done through people, talented people who like to work in a collaborative, highperformance meritocracy. 4. The best argument wins We cultivate a challenging environment, open to questioning and constructive debate. The only hierarchy that matters to us is the hierarchy of best ideas. 5. Simple, always We believe that simplicity is the best road to eﬃciency so we fight to make sure depth is not confused with complexity and simplicity does not become simplism. 6. We think and act like owners We always think like owners of the bank, leading by example and prioritizing collective goals over personal ambition. 7. Ethics are non-negotiable We do the right thing without tricks or short cuts. We exercise leadership in a transparent, responsible way. We are totally committed to society and best practices in governance and management. We are Itaú. We dream it, do it and it works ;) 22 2.1.1.

Ethics as a Priority [Material issue] 103-2, 103-3, 102-17, 205-2 Ethics are non-negotiable for us. Consequently, we have diﬀerent codes, regulations, policies and manuals to guide the conduct of each bank employee. These documents seek to regulate and support our conduct in relation to conflicts of interest, confidentiality and handling of insider information, among other issues.

These have produced significant results for internal processes and customer experience and will continue generating improvements. Three years ago, we began creating digital innovation centers to meet this challenge. These multidisciplinary teams of bank employees work collaboratively, keeping the customer at the center, to test and try new solutions to provide an extraordinary digital experience for those who give us their business. This working method involves an exhaustive, organization-wide review of our processes with the aim of becoming more eﬃcient and harnessing new technology to directly impact our customer experience.

However, they estimate that Moody’s Rating Long-term counterparty risk A2 Long-term foreign currency deposits A3 Long-term foreign currency debt A3 Short-term foreign currency deposits Prime-2 Outlook Stable On May 28, 2019, Standard & Poor’s ratified the ratings at ‘BBB+/A-2’. Our outlooks are ‘stable’, reflecting reduction in nonrecurring events and credit risk provisions that reinforce expectations of improved results in the next 24 months. On one hand, the main barriers to higher profitability are greater industry concentration in Chile, low inflation and hectic economic activity. S&P estimates that the Bank’s capital indicators will continue to be its greatest weakness, given the high burden of goodwill following the Corpbanca-Itaú Chile merger. Our ratings continue to review our business model as we expand platforms, products and Itaú Unibanco segmentation in the retail segment. They focus on the central portfolio of the wholesale segment and increased non-interest income (e.g. cash management). While we have lost some market share over the years, commercial portfolio adjustments fueled increased loan delivery beginning in 2018. At the same time, we saw stabilization in non-recurring impacts and reduced provision expenses, which generated greater gains in the last three years (return on assets was approximately 0.9%, excluding amortization of intangible assets). Furthermore, we maintain a sound level of regulatory capital at 14.3%, which is above the industry average. We also have broad access to financing and maintain adequate liquidity levels. Since the merger, the asset and liability management strategy has been adjusting financing costs, while it seeks to extend maturities and diversify the financing structure. 42 Standard & Poor’s Rating Solvency BBB+ Long-term foreign currency bonds BBB+ Short-term foreign currency debt A-2 Outlook Stable 2.4.6. Local Risk Ratings At the national level, Feller Rate Clasificadora de Riesgo Ltd. (Feller Rate) and Clasificadora de Riesgo Humphreys Ltda (Humphreys) assign local risk ratings. On March 29, 2019, Feller Rate ratified local risk ratings at ‘Aa’ with a ‘positive’ outlook. The rating reflects very strong business and risk profiles; financial backing and adequate funding and liquidity ratings; and moderate generation capacity. The 'positive' outlook reflects a favorable trend in generation capacity, with growing results derived from greater commercial activity and controlled provisions for loan loss. To the extent that we continue strengthening our generation capacity (achieving results consistently within the range of the system average) with controlled credit risk levels, the rating should improve.

Risk Management The risks defined by Itaú are constantly monitored under the institution’s risk management structure based on risk type: Type of Financial Risk Risk Description of the Financial risk refers to the probability that an event has negative financial risk consequences for the organization. The purpose of managing financial risk is not to eliminate it, but rather to limit exposure to negative events in line with the risk appetite of the Bank's Board of Directors and the regulations that govern financial institutions. Along this line, the main risks to which Itaú is exposed are market risk (currency and interest rate) and liquidity risk (diversification of funding sources and uses). Risk management at Itaú The Corporate Treasury Division, in collaboration with the Financial Risk Division, is responsible for using pre-established metrics to manage consolidated market and liquidity risk for the Bank’s operations in both Chile and Colombia. The Assets and Liabilities Committee (ALCO) oversees management and control of market and liquidity risks. In 2019, the Financial Risk Division has continued to consolidate the bases and improve processes and data validation in order to generate financial risk reports. A new model, aligned with industry best practices, was implemented to measure counterparty risk from derivatives. Milestones in 2019 Finally, in the second half of the year and as part of the annual market risk management assessment plan, Chilean regulators visited the Bank and maintained our rating. 45 Type of Risk Credit Risk Description of the Given the nature of these risks and in order to better manage them, we have specialized teams risk for each commercial area: Wholesale Credit and Retail Credit. The Wholesale Credit Division works with the credit risk control area to monitor customer behavior and, if necessary, processes administrative and judicial collections for the Wholesale Banking Division. This division administers the credit approval process for all of this division’s customers, which requires maintaining adequate control at all stages of the process: conducting technical studies of the customers’ economic and financial position; giving presentations on financial projections, sector and economic studies to the pertinent decision-making authorities; as well as carrying out loan analysis, structuring and assessment. The Executive Loan Committee—chaired by the Chief Executive Oﬃcer and comprised of the Chairman of the Board, an appointed director, the Corporate Risk Manager and the Wholesale Credit Manager—is the highest body for local assessment. However, Itaú Unibanco Executive Loan Committee must ratify the local committee's decisions for loans involving exposure amounts and risk ratings in excess of pre-established limits. Risk management The Retail Credit Division is responsible for the credit processes for all Retail Banking segments, at Itaú which includes Itaú, Itaú Personal Bank, Itaú Private Bank, Itaú Companies and Banco Condell. Each segment has diﬀerent characteristics that impact credit analysis and approval. On that basis, proactive origination processes are encouraged, using statistical admission and behavior models as well as diﬀerentiated strategies for each customer type. We use an automated platform to assess credit applications submitted by individual Banco Condell, Itaú and Itaú Personal Bank customers. The platform verifies that each request meets the requirements set forth in the Credit Policy and the corresponding standards for granting the credit . It also controls the level of authority and approval required. However, a structured, case-by-case methodology is used to evaluate financing proposals from Itaú Companies and Itaú Private Bank customers. We promote and develop proactive credit-granting models by generating pre-approved or pre-evaluated oﬀers. Internally developed statistical behavior and approval models are used to identify customers and prospects with high potential and good credit to whom financing is oﬀered in a more active, direct manner. These strategies enabled us to record higher growth than our main competitors in consumer loans in 2019. In 2019, service focused on consolidating credit processes, training teams and ongoing review of the credit portfolio. In the individual banking segments, we made progress on robotic process automation (RPA). These implementations have enabled us to improve eﬃciency and growth capacity in a Milestones in 2019 sustainable manner. In the segments serving legal entities, we made progress on an electronic assessment platform that will replace current manual processes during the first quarter of 2020. The solution will reduce processing times by automating controls and eliminating manual processes. 46 Type of Risk Operational Risk The main purpose of the management model adopted by the Bank and its subsidiaries is Description of the preventative and eﬀective risk management in five stages: identification, prioritization, risk response to risk, monitoring and reporting. Managing operational risk, including legal risk, is fundamental to achieving the organization’s strategic objectives. For this task, we have a functional structure comprised of the Board of Directors, Operational Risk Committee and a division specialized in operational risk, business continuity and internal control. The Operational Risk Division is responsible for creating a regulatory framework for risk management and communicating a risk culture at the Bank, while raising awareness of the four lines of defense: the business and support areas, the Operational Risk Division Compliance and AML Division and the Internal Audit Division. In 2019, eﬀorts were undertaken to reinforce the roles and responsibilities of the four lines of defense in order to work together and maintain an adequate control environment at the organization. Furthermore, in accordance with established methodology, 2019 operational risk management Risk management was marked primarily by the risk self-assessment for the first line of defense, which revealed at Itaú 1,213 risks throughout the organization. Thus, risk response eﬀorts began with the launch of OY, DRO and risk indicators. Eﬀorts to strengthen operations with international units resulted in greater adhesion to corporate methodology and policies. In 2019, the Business Continuity Program expanded its scope to include 100% coverage of the current process map. Furthermore, we updated our methodological framework to include strategies for facing malicious attacks that could aﬀect the Bank’s cybersecurity. Finally, the testing program associated with the risk scenarios described in this year’s methodological framework made considerable progress on the Bank’s approved plans. The program expanded the quantity and quality of the exercises (including cybersecurity) with the final objective of ensuring the capacity to continue serving our customers in the face of events that impact business continuity. The Business Continuity Program expanded its scope to cover 100% of the current processes map. Furthermore, we updated our methodological framework to include strategies to address Milestones in 2019 malicious attacks that could impact the Bank’s cybersecurity. We also implemented the risk self-assessment process, increasing coverage levels for the processes and risk surveys. 47 Type of Risk Compliance Risk Description of the The Compliance and AML Division aims to raise awareness regarding the regulatory risk environment, transmitting Itaú’s ethical conduct standards and safeguarding the brand’s reputation on all markets. All of this is done through an organizational and functional culture that facilitates quick identification and satisfactory resolution of potential conflicts. Regulatory risk management is performed through analysis of regulatory changes and the consequences that could derive from them. Ethical standards are managed and transmitted through a training and communications plan Risk management as well as complaint management. These eﬀorts seek to raise awareness and create a culture of at Itaú business ethics among all Itaú employees. Then, reputational risk management aims to mitigate situations that could expose Itaú to negative perceptions by stakeholders. This is done, through several analyses and reviews of our interactions with diﬀerent market players. In 2019, the positioning of the Compliance and AML Division exponentially increased in terms of employee queries and requests as awareness of the importance of upholding the Milestones in 2019 aforementioned pillars increased. In terms of disseminating ethical guidelines, a communications and training plan was implemented and very widely accepted by employees. 48 Emerging Risks Cybersecurity Description of the Exploitation of vulnerabilities or new laws that involve information assets exposed over cyberspace, causing loss to the information’s confidentiality, integrity and availability or risk compromising customer or third-party data, which could have significant impact and even aﬀect business continuity. Risk management at One of the primary objectives is to guarantee process and operations security in the digitalized environment by continuously strengthening the control environment with solutions that Itaú translate into rapid responses in the event of any type of threat, event or incident. Milestones in 2019 There was significant risk management progress this year. The Cybersecurity and Fraud Division was created, thereby doubling the number of specialists dedicated to these issues. It focuses primarily on establishing a vulnerability management strategy, treating incidents, modeling safe software development, systems security and a personal data protection strategy. The cybersecurity culture plan was strengthened leading up to 2020 and focuses on customers and employees. Additionally, cyber attack simulations were used to assess the capacity to react to and resolve incidents. Emerging Risks Fraud Description of the Transactional fraud using the customers’ products due to absence of systems that enable digital transactions to be stopped. risk Risk management at The objective is to prevent transactional fraud in a timely manner using preventative alerts and taking actions that enable the transaction to be stopped or stolen funds to be retained. Itaú Milestones in 2019 In 2019, initiatives were undertaken to better manage the risk generated by transactions like electronic fund transfers and electronic payments, by establishing limits and adding controls to operations. Prevention tools were implemented for Mastercard and Visa brand credit cards. By assessing transactions in conjunction with adaptive rules we were able to halt digital fraud without impacting customers. Finally, we worked on establishing a comprehensive fraud prevention model that provides a complete vision of customers and, thereby prevents and interrupts fraudulent digital transactions. This model will be the new way Itaú controls fraud for customers. 49 Emerging Risks Money Laundering Description of the Risk of being used as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorism financing or an illicit act via use of our financial instruments to provide a legal source for funds that originate in criminal risk activities. Such an event could compromise our reputation and expose us to the sanctions set forth by law. Risk management at We work to continuously improve and strengthen the foundation of the prevention program, the Know your Customer (KYC) form. We improve systems, processes and monitoring, while Itaú providing technical training and knowledge training for our employees on Prevention Program issues. Training is always based on local regulations and international best practices. Additionally, monthly meetings are held with international units to report on the main eﬀorts and plan new action. Milestones in 2019 In 2019, alert parameters were improved and some new ones were created. We also added dynamism and up-to-date content to e-learning and online courses. As a complement and a continuation of the process for recertifying the prevention model under Law No. 20,393, we created an exclusive Compliance and AML site. 50 2.4.8.

We know that, only with inclusiveness, we can face and overcome each new challenge that the environment and our stakeholders present. We mean diversity in the broadest sense and including the diﬀerent groups present in our society. We have created policies and adopted internal practices to make our teams as diverse as communities where were operate so that we are able to genuinely understand and serve our customers’ diﬀerent needs. The Bank continued the employee health status survey that it has conducted since 2018 in its eﬀort to comply with Law No. 21,015, which promotes inclusiveness of people with disabilities in the working world.

That is why Itaú created the Press Training program to provide tools, answer questions about the financial market and support the field of journalism. The initiative consists of a series of breakfasts for journalists featuring talks by experts on topics related to finance and economics. In 2019, there were four talks that were widely attended and covered by the country’s leading media outlets. Financial Literacy for Employees Build your Future Since sustainability is part of our essence, we are constantly encouraging the transformational power of people. In 2019, this financial literacy program for employees focused on Millennials without children. The initial phase was comprised of three financial strategy workshops for new generations followed by three specific workshops on real estate investment. In total, 166 received training through this new initiative. 4.5.2. Financial Inclusiveness In terms of financial inclusiveness, the Banco Condell unit is specialized in serving the low to middleincome segments, which have low degrees of banking access. Through Banco Condell, we oﬀer a financial inclusiveness alternative, by providing services to people with informal, non-accreditable income. In 2019, we have granted loans totaling MCh$134,382 to more than 70,000 customers at branches throughout the country.

Several players from the public and private sector signed a series of general principles related to managing risks and opportunities in order to help achieve country-wide commitments on environmental issues. The Green Agreement is part of eﬀorts by the Public-Private Working Group on Green Finances, created in July 2019, in which we have participated actively through the Association of Banks and Financial Institutions (ABIF).

Managing Our Waste Electronic and Paper Waste In 2019, we continued our recycling programs for both paper and electronic waste. We provided Sorepa with 29,713 kilos of paper, a figure that shows how our paper recycling increases each year. We also provided more than 1,200 kilos of out-of-use electronic equipment, including 23 kilos donated by bank employees during the company’s annual electronics recycling drive, to the Chilenter Foundation. Proper management of this waste and its valuation through recycling and refurbishing will mitigate 54.6 tons of Co2e, a gas that drives climate change.

The main objective of these meetings was to explain how our Supplier Purchasing and Payment Policy works and understand their concerns about the purchasing process and the Bank in general. The result will provide important input as we build our long-term partnerships with the most strategic suppliers. In 2020, that translated into initiatives like a specialized web portal. 93 6.1. Our Supply Chain 102-9 We have a universe of 1,896 companies registered as bank suppliers. These companies perform activities related to information technology, organizational development and quality of life as well as construction, maintenance and infrastructure, to name a few. Ninety-six percent of them are Chilean and 77% of those are based in the Metropolitan Region.

We Work with Our Suppliers 204-1 Supplier relationships are based on principles of equity, integrity and transparency as part of Our Way. To that end, we have internal purchasing and payment regulations that establish the stages of a purchasing process to ensure that processes are clear, transparent and orderly. Leading up to a bidding process, we safeguard the confidentiality of information so that none of the suppliers has prior access to information. Then, during the call for quotes or proposals phase, we send identical information to all suppliers and any clarification to the bidding documents is made available to all the bidding parties simultaneously. Our sound network of suppliers at the national level is crucial to our daily operations. Since we understand the value of SMEs for the country, there are 959 small and medium businesses in our supplier base, representing 26% of the Bank’s total spending on this item. We worked to establish closer relationships with our suppliers in 2019. We launched a diagnostic that seeks to establish an improvement plan, which will be kicked oﬀ with a virtual platform exclusively for this important group of stakeholders. 2018 2019 Total spending on suppliers ThCh$324,241 ThCh$286,631 Spending on SME suppliers ThCh$55,269 ThCh$84,578 Total number of suppliers 2,038 1,896 Number of SME suppliers 910 959 95 6.2.1.

In 2019, we perfected the supplier assessment process to include relevant issues that ensure mutually beneficial transactions as well as social, economic and environmental criteria that depend on criticality levels. All suppliers must go through an administrative assessment prior to purchasing. Depending on the risk category of the product or service provided, the process includes a maximum of seven areas related to three variables: operational risk associated with the service, amount of the purchase and nature of the service. It seeks to minimize potential financial, reputation, operational and legal impacts during the rendering of service or following completion of the contract.11 To guarantee a comprehensive evaluation, several players participate in the process with specific purposes. 11 We do not have relationships with organizations that use slave or illegal child labor or that exploit prostitution. 96 97 2018 2019 2,038 1,896 Total spending Total number of suppliers 1,545 1,596 evaluated Percent of total suppliers 76 % 84 % evaluated Note: suppliers with assessments current as of 2019. 6.2.2. Supplier Payment Terms We seek sustainable relationships with our suppliers and know that establishing and complying with payment deadlines is essential. Thus, we also ensure that the budgeted investment and/or expense meets the requirements set forth under the Internal Regulations on Purchasing and Supplier Payment for acquisitions of goods and services. In 2019, we consolidated our purchasing area and considerably reduced the number of days for supplier payments.

We were listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability MILA Pacific Alliance Index for the first time and on the Dow Jones Sustainability Chile Index for the fourth straight year. The DJSI is a stock index created in 1999 at the request of the New York Stock Exchange to assess non-financial aspects of leading companies. For the last four years, Itaú has stood out on the local index; however, we decided to go a step farther. This earned us a place on the DJSI MILA, a regional index that lists companies with outstanding performance on sustainability requirements relative to their peers in Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Chile. Furthermore, we have substantially improved our rating since 2018 and are now above the global average for the industry. 100 7.1.

Significant deficit target of 1% will be slow.

Investment, propped up by construction, also To date, the leading risk rating agencies have had a contributed to growing the GDP, which closed 2019 positive reading of the fiscal policy adjustment, up 3.3%, the greatest increase in five years. Despite a given that the starting point (in terms of deficits and favorable dynamic in 2019, the outlook for 2020 is 102 less certain. On one hand, consumer confidence and the significant drop in employment figures suggest that commercial activity could weaken moving forward. On the other, while the social unrest of November 2019 were less generalized and intense than those in other regional economies, they add a note of caution to Colombia’s outlook moving forward. Today, the clearest impact comes from greater fiscal pressure (which could further complicate fiscal convergence moving forward), more than growth. External events applied pressure to regional currencies, including the Colombian peso. Consequently, in the middle of the year the Colombian Central Bank suspended a September 2018 program for accumulating reserves, after acquiring some BUS$2.9 to bring reserves to about 17% of GDP. As in other regional economies, the Colombian peso hit historic lows (3,546 per dollar) in November, when uncertainty regarding the social process in the country was added to global geopolitical risks. This decoupled the behavior of the Colombian peso from oil (the company’s main export), which performed better in the second part of the year. As these risks shot up, the currency gained ground in relation to the dollar, trading under 3,300 pesos per dollar at year end 2019. Structurally, the deficit remains wide (estimated at 4.5% of GDP at the close of 2019, compared to 3.9% in 2018), reflecting robust domestic demand and disappointing oil exports, which constitutes a risk to the country’s currency. This is an additional argument for limiting rate cuts. Throughout the year, the Colombian Central Bank held the reference rate steady at 4.25%. The combination of controlled inflation, impacted only slightly by a shock to food supply; moderate depreciation of the Colombian peso; expectations of well-behaved inflation; and gradual reduction in the product gap, enabled the board to keep rates close to neutral levels and ready to respond to any significant change in the economic environment. Despite the increase in the current account deficit, the Colombian Central Bank has emphasized that its funding dynamic is healthy. Still, securities market intervention is a possibility if volatility increases. Overall, inflation ended up just below the upper limit of the 2-4% range, close to the 3% target. The expectation is that it will gradually slow toward the target in 2020. 103 7.2. The Chilean Banking System The Chilean financial market is comprised of diverse sub-sectors. The largest of these, commercial banking, includes 1 state bank and 16 private banks, which all operate under the same regulatory framework. Some are controlled by a Chilean entity while others are international banks that operate in the country under the direction of a foreign entity. Total Loans Chilean Banking System Source: Financial Market Commission (CMF). Note: Chilean market share was calculated on the basis of CMF consolidated figures as of December 31, 2019. Excludes operations at Chilean banks’ foreign banking subsidiaries (i.e. Itaú Corpbanca Colombia and the National Bank of Florida). In keeping with global trends, the Chilean banking system has undergone consolidation involving mergers and acquisitions of banking entities in recent decades. In Chile, the financial market has become heavily concentrated in a few market leaders. The origins of this process can be traced back to 1990. The industry’s two main banks comprised 34.7% of total loans in 2019.

Specifically, the commercial portfolio managed to grow 10.1% in comparison to the six-year average growth of 7%. This growth was less than in 2018, reflecting stagnated economic activity and highlighting lower GDP projections for 2019 and 2020. While corporate debt as a percentage of GDP fell in 2017, the level of debt taken on by companies began to rise as of the second quarter of 2018, which is in line with this growth in loans. The ratio of debt to GDP for non-financial companies reached 105.9% in the second quarter of 2019. Commercial banks are facing growing competition for commercial portfolios from other financial intermediaries, which provide access to capital markets for large companies as an alternative to bank loans. Given the regulatory framework of the General Banking Law, we aim to maintain a competitive position in the investment banking market through our subsidiary Itaú Asesorías Financieras. Growth in Commercial Loans Chilean Banking System (Percentage) Source: Financial Market Commission (CMF). Note: Loan growth was calculated on the basis of CMF consolidated figures as of December 31st. Excludes banking subsidiary operations abroad. Consumer loans rose 5.5%, the lowest growth recorded in the last six years. Our main competitors in the credit card area are department stores and other non-bank issuers of private credit cards. In November 2019, the banking market was modified when Santander Consumer Finance was integrated into Banco Santander’s operations. The new subsidiary focuses on financing for new and used cars. This integration impacted the consumer market, expanding it by 1.7% (specifically in installment loans) and the overall market by 0.2%. Consequently, market share fell for all the other banks in the consumer portfolio, but without significant impact on each bank’s market share by total loans. 106 Growth in Consumer Loans Chilean Banking System (Percentage) Source: Financial Market Commission (CMF).

In 2016, the real estate industry experienced a significant drop relative to preceding years, due to a tax reform and its impact on the sale of new homes without VAT, which had a substantial aﬀect in 2015. Between 2016 and 2018 the growth rate was relatively stable. However, in 2019 growth was 11.2% greater than in the three years prior, reaching 2013 levels.

Excludes banking subsidiary operations abroad. 107 Insurance companies, now allowed to grant mortgage and consumer loans, became relevant competitors in these markets. On the other hand, we face competition from banks that provide international private banking services, like JP Morgan Chase, BNP Paribas and others. Our competitive advantage in private banking has been the ability to provide customized products and diligently respond to customer needs. Banco Condell, our financing unit specializing in low-income segments, competes with other banks’ consumer banking divisions and several non-banking providers of consumer credit, like department stores. Its competitive advantage lies in its ability to respond quickly, know its customers and provide a fair pricing structure.

As of December implementation period. Between August 2019 and 31, 2019, Itaú’s regulatory capital ratio was 13.1%, January 2020, the CMF has issued the following broken down as follows: regulations for discussion: Itaú Regulatory Capital 1 Core capital = capital and reserves, in accordance with the CMF BIS I definition, includes pertinent adjustments from the business combination. 2 Regulatory capital = capital required under the CMF BIS I definition. 3 Basel ratio = regulatory capital / RWA under the CMF BIS I definition. 113 The Basel ratio is down 146 base points relative to December 2018. This decrease is mainly attributable to: (i) Acquisition of Itaú Corpbanca Colombia shares held by Helm LLC and Kresge Stock Holding Company Inc., in December 2019, which impacted regulatory capital. This impact was partially mitigated by the coverage previously provided in dollars and by capital eﬃciencies; and (ii) 6.8% growth of risk-weighted assets, partially impacted by (a) the increase in fixed assets as a result of applying IFRS 16, which implied constitution of new right-of-use assets under lease agreements; and (b) fluctuation in foreign currency (COP and USD) in relation to the Chilean peso. In 2019, the Chilean peso depreciated 6.8% relative to the Colombian peso and 7.8% relative to the US dollar. Approximately 21% of our consolidated loans are denominated in Colombian pesos; 14% are denominated in US dollars. 7.3.4. Financial Results for 2019 The consolidated results for December 2019 are profit of MCh$127,065, comprised of MCh$115,849 in Chile and MCh$11,216 in Colombia, reflecting a decrease of 26.1% compared to 2018. From a macroeconomic perspective, the events with the greatest impact on our results were: (i) the social unrest with peaceful protests and acts of vandalism that resulted in diminished economic activity in Chile and an increase in delinquency; (ii) lower monetary policy rate in Chile, which went from 2.75% at the beginning of the year to 1.75% at the beginning of November, putting pressure on our liability and capital margins; and (iii) lower variation in the observed UF in Chile (2.7% in 2019 compared to 2.9% in 2018), which impacts our net interest margin and eﬀective tax rate. 114 Results and Comparisons for 2019 and 2018 (In millions of pesos) 2018 2019 Δ '18-'19 ($) Δ '18-'19 (%) Net interest and indexation 846,991 846,718 (273) (0.03) income Net fee and commission income 186,129 174,404 (11,725) (6.30) Net financial operating income 174,199 169,060 (5,139) (2.95) Other operating income (38,289) (20,089) 18,200 (47.53) Total operating income 1,169,030 1,170,093 1,063 0.09 Operating expenses (673,328) (674,984) (1,656) 0.25 Net provisions and write-oﬀs (242,490) (322,693) (80,203) 33.07 Net operating income 253,212 172,416 (80,796) (31.91) Income attributable to 1,528 6,832 5,304 347.12 investments in other companies Income before income tax 254,740 179,248 (75,492) (29.63) Income tax expense (77,894) (46,784) 31,110 (39.94) Profit for the year 176,846 132,464 (44,382) (25.10) Non-controlling interests (4,799) 5,399 10,198 (212.50) Profit attributable to owners of the bank 172,047 127,065 (44,982) (26.15) Additionally, the main factor explaining lower consolidated results is greater net provisions and write-oﬀs of MCh$80,203 (33.1%). The increase originated, to a great extent, as a result of the one-time events shown below, which were partially oﬀset by a lower eﬀective tax rate. In order to illustrate the impact of Colombian operations on Itaú’s consolidated results, the following table discloses Chilean and Colombian figures separately as of December 31, 2019. Importantly, Itaú in Chile accounted for some expenses related to the operations in Colombia, particularly expenses related to the fiscal hedge position, which impacts the net interest margin and the hedge on net investments in a foreign operation, which aﬀects net financial operating income. This is in addition to the inherent eﬀect of the fiscal hedge on net financial operating income and income tax. In our opinion, these adjusted results as of December 31, 2019, are the best approximation to Itaú's standalone operations in Chile. 115 Adjusted Results for Chile and Colombia for the Year Ended December 31, 2019 Profit Attributable to Owners of the Chile Colombia Chile Adjusted Bank Adjustments Accumulated Change (%) Accumulated Change (%) Accumulated Change (%) Accumulated as Change (%) as of Dec ‘19 as of Dec ‘19 Dec ‘19/ Dec as of Dec ‘19 Dec ‘19/ Dec of Dec ‘19 Dec ‘19/ Dec Dec ‘19/ MCh$ MCh$ ’18 MCh$ ‘18 MCh$ ‘18 Dec ‘18 Net interest and indexation 846.,718 -0.03 % 595,014 3.66 % 251,704 -7.79 % 1,234 596,248 3.49 % income Net fee and commission 174,404 -6.3 % 142,323 -7.63 % 32,081 0.12 % 142,323 -7.63 % income Net financial operating 169,060 -2.95 % 126,714 -18.06 % 42,346 116.5 % (11,639) 115,075 -2.65 % income (loss) Other operating (20,089) -47.53 % 88,596) -61.17 % (11,493) -28.84 % (8,596) -61.17 % income Gross operating 1,170,093 0.09 % 855,455 -0.6 % 314,638 2.02 % (10,405) 845,050 2.27 % income Net provisions (322,693) 33.07 % (243,133) 53.62 % (79,560) -5.53 % (243,133) 53.62 % and write-oﬀs Operating income, net of provisions 847,400 -8.54 % 612,322 -12.82 % 235,078 4.85 % (10,405) 601,917 -9.9 % and writeoﬀs Operating (459,499) (674,984) 0.25 % (459,499) -0.3 % (215,485) 1.43 % -0.3 % expenses Net operating 172,416 -31.91 % 152,823 -36.71 % 19,593 66.81 % (10,405) 142,418 587.44 % income Income attributable to 6,832 347.12 % 4,900 1,607.32 % 1,932 55.68 % 4,900 1.607.32 % investments in associates Profit 179,248 -29.63 % 157,723 -34.76 % 21,525 65.74 % (10,405) 147,318 -28.99 % before taxes Income tax -40.10 % (46,784) -39.94 % (41,750) -47.23 % (5,034) -510.94 % 20,653 (21,097) expense Profit for the 132,464 -25.1 % 115,973 -28.69 % 16,491 16.04 % 10,248 126,221 -26.72 % year Profit attributable 126,097 127,065 -26.15 % 115,849 -28.76 % 11,216 18.82 % 10,248 -26.78 % to owners of the bank 116 Net Interest and Indexation Income reduced oﬃce lease expenses.

As of the Itaú Credit Card Benefits Program In 2019, special campaigns sought to attract new customers. The first was “Travel in 90 days”. Ninety days after opening an account plan and meeting a series of conditions (direct salary deposit, accumulation of purchases on credit card and using online purchasing platforms), the customer accumulated enough Itaú Points to exchange them for a ticket to one of several South American destinations. In the next campaign, the customer was oﬀered a choice of three benefit packages: dreamer, traveler or digital. Depending on their choice, they had access to diﬀerent benefits, like financing for the customer’s plans (dreamer), additional Itaú Points to cash in for tickets (traveler) and benefits for online purchases using the credit card (digital). Itaú This business area serves individuals with monthly income between Ch$600,000 and Ch$2.5 million as well as customers with investments of less than Ch$70 million. This mass model is focused on customer self-service through various channels: face-to-face at our branches, digitally through the website and App, through direct e-mail contact with account executives and through calls to the Contact Center. Our goal is to face our customers’ changes and needs with them, oﬀering agile, simple options that enable them interface with the Bank autonomously. Banco Condell This unit specializes in financing for middle and low-income segments who have low banking access and monthly income between Ch$200,000 and Ch$600,000. A financial inclusiveness mechanism, Banco Condell's business model enables it to provide services to people with informal, non-accreditable income. Through Banco Condell we oﬀer our customers insurance policies, certificates of deposit and consumer loans, products that represent the essence of our business. We have continued the Condell eﬃciency model, adding six additional branches in 2019. The first inverse integration involved account executives from the Itaú branch working at the Condell branch in Melipilla. The plan is to follow along these lines to bring our diﬀerent segments to more places while maintaining our customers’ satisfaction. 121 7.4.3.

Subsidiaries Itaú Corredores de Bolsa Limitada This year, the customer has been at the center of securities market operations. The subsidiary sought to boost its market share and provided a value oﬀering that leveraged the Itaú regional franchise. One highlight, Analyst Day, was hosted along with Itaú Unibanco. About 80 institutional customers participated in the two-day event that includes road shows by Brazilian companies for local investors and press breakfasts with institutional analysts and senior management at local companies. 2018 2019 Transaction volume (in billions) Ch$39.867 Ch$44.535 Market share 6.0 % 5.8 % Ranking by value of shares traded 6th place 6th place Average AUM in custody (in billions) Ch$450 Ch$397 123 Itaú Asesorías Financieras Limitada Itaú Asesorías Financieras Limitada provides customers with specialized, customized solutions. Services include: (i) structure and implementation of corporate finance on the banking market, syndicated and bilateral loans; debt restructuring, project finance; (ii) debt structuring on capital markets through bond and commercial paper structuring, issuance and placement; (iii) mergers and acquisitions; capital increases; and (iv) advising and research, in general. These advising services all aim to support our customers in making the right financial and strategic planning decisions. In 2019, we provided local and international customers with diﬀerent advising services, debt restructuring, project finance as well as issuance and placement of corporate bonds. We are third on the ranking of Chilean issuances on the local capitals market. While the area had a strong year commercially, the last quarter ended with a marked slowdown in the structured business and in debt issuance, which resulted in a change in financial and investment strategy for many customers. As a result, and depending on the situation in the country, economic activity is expected to increase along with the number of debt issuances by our customers. Itaú Administradora General de Fondos S.A. (Itaú AGF) This year, we strengthened our oﬀer. In 2018, the focus was on developing products for retail and wholesale banking. In 2019, we complemented our oﬀering with two products for institutional investors and high net worth customers: Brazil Stock Index and Brazil Bond Index Mutual Funds. Both are indexed funds that purchase Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) from our administrator in Brazil. They aim to give eﬃcient, liquid access to the local stock market and Brazilian sovereign debt. Finally, we expanded our leadership in the local Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) market, launching a second ETF in Chile that replicates the index of dividend shares developed by S&P Dow Jones (S&P CLX Dividend Index). This fund is a good investment alternative that widely appeals to our customer base, both institutional investors and retail customers. Strengthening our oﬀer of debt funds, we launched the Dinámico Plus mutual fund as a continuation of our traditional Dinámico mutual fund. The latter aims to implement the best ideas in debt and Latin American currency. At the same time, we implemented a new strategy in our Itaú Top USA mutual fund, which uses derivatives to replicate the S&P 500 index. We also granted greater flexibility to our fund of best ideas in stock from the Andean zone, Andino Retorno Total. At the end of the year, we launched the Itaú Renta Dinámica Mutual Fund, which grants access to global debt with exchange rate hedges. This fund is an interesting alternative for diversifying investment in local debt. It targets a wide customer base ranging from high net worth customers and family oﬃces to retail banking customers. We partnered with HMC Capital to launch the Itau HMC Mezzanine Investment Fund. This alternative to traditional preferential capital funds is the first to give access to mezzanine debt on the Chilean real estate market. In keeping with our sustainable investments, we have formally incorporated environmental, social and governance (ESG) analysis, which was already incorporated into corporate debt, into our variable-income instrument process. To do so, we worked with our contacts in Brazil and the United States to align processes and analysis. In terms of equity under management, we highlight growth of 12.1%, the equivalent of MCh$253,138 in 2019, totaling MCh$2,341,125 in assets under management with mutual fund market share of 4.6%. 124 Sustainability Leadership Our commitment and concern for ESG variables as part of our investment process was once again recognized by Alas20. Itaú Administradora General de Fondos won first place in the three Alas20 Institution areas: Leader in Responsible Investment, Leader in Corporate Governance and Leader in Sustainability Research. Principles of Responsible Investment In order to monitor the impact of these environmental, social and governance issues on investment portfolios, Itaú Asset Management in Brazil joined the Principles for Responsible Investment, backed by the United Nations, in 2008. In Chile, we adhere to the same principles in our investment process. Our responsible investment policy establishes the principles and guidelines for our responsible investment activities. The main objective is to protect our customers’ economic interests.
