It is the coronation effort of a joint Arab-European study of the requirements for education reform and development in the Arab World. CADER is a distinguished model of public private partnership between academia and business that forms a consortium of two diverse regional and local institutions, each of which is an expert in its own field.

CADER provides advanced localized training and professional development consulting services on education reform policy making and planning according to 21st century requirements. CADER's goal is to empower a highly-skilled education workforce to prepare a generation able to compete in the knowledge society. Through its training programs and consultations, CADER plays the role of a change agent that aims at creating new professional standards in education. Our challenge is to build and develop sustainable solutions that foster a deep and long lasting impact in schools by offering flexible, practical and tailor-made professional development programs in order to enhance educators' personal and professional growth and improve their competences. Over the last years, CADER established itself in the field of professional development and mastered a model that contributes to its strength since the model it follows depends on developing competences. CADER's competence-based model is a locallydeveloped model that draws on international proven experiences in the field of education reform and professional development. What distinguishes CADER's model most is its reliance on building knowledge rather than consuming it, providing solutions based on the needs of the workplace and its staff rather than ready-made ones, and promoting life-long learning skills and self-directed learning skills. CADER's employees and Master Trainers are the company’s main resources. They are distinguished by their professional and practical experiences in the field, thereby ensuring that our clients receive the most effective and professional service.
