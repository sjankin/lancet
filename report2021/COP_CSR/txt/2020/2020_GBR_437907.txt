Every employee has access to a handbook and agreement with his/hers responsibilities. We also maintain an open-door policy throughout our business structure to ensure every employee has the authority to make a complaint, suggestion or report to any manager. We pay a lot of attention to our employees’ health and safety. Our daily operations are in full compliance with OHSAS 18001 Health and Safety standards and we provide equipment, training and knowledge to both our manufacture and administrative teams. Implementation We provide Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for our employees from safety shoes to protective glasses. It is our intention that our employees are safe and effective and thus we provide the best available equipment for every task. We upgraded our office equipment so it is easily adjustable to suit the needs of our employees and provided training and information on how to use it properly. In addition we conduct regular annual questionnaires to ensure everything is in working order. All our employees have access to annual occupational health at work assessment and are also entitled to a free eye test and issued safety glasses accordingly. Annual appraisal is given to every employee reviewing past year and wage reviews take place when required. It is also clearly stated in our Ethical Policy that ITL employ staff on the basis of their suitability for the position, as follows: “ITL employ staff bridging the age gap from 16 to 70 years of age, do not discriminate in any way and will not work with companies that do.

We have a written environmental policy in place which is freely accessible on the company website. The environmental impact of our production is mainly connected with materials used, transport and packing of our goods. We encourage our all stakeholders to minimise their adverse impacts on environment as much as possible and we have our own policies in place to minimise our environmental footprint. Implementation We need to be environmentally friendly on two fronts. In our office we installed double glazed windows to save energy used for heating, we have recycling bins placed throughout the office, and lower our electricity consumption by using energy-saving light tubes. In our manufacturing area we have installed modern heating equipment and we follow a 3R Philosophy (Reduce, Re-use, Re-cycle) which significantly lowers packaging for our products. We reuse compressed woodchip boxes for transport of our heavy shipments. We encourage the same philosophy throughout our supply chain both up and down. All our employees are also informed about our environmental effort and are required to assist with the successful implementation of our Environmental Policy. Measurement of Outcomes Instrument Transformers Limited is committed to minimising any adverse effects on the environment, which may result from its activities, processes or products. As a result of our efforts we are ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System) certified. ITL has also never been involved in any legal cases or events related to environment. The processes used in our manufacturing process are designed to have as low environmental footprint as possible and we urge our suppliers to do the same. 10 2-4 Lithgow Place | East Kilbride | Scotland | G74 1PW | United Kingdom T: +44 (0) 1355 236 057 | e: sales@itl-uk.com Anti-corruption Assessment, Policy and Goals ITL has a zero-tolerance for any unethical behaviour, be it bribery, corruption or extortion, which is clearly stated in our Ethical Policy, as follows: “It is our desire at Instrument Transformers Limited (ITL), like that of any business, to make a profit.
