H.E. ANTÃ“NIO GUTERRES Secretary General United Nations New York, NY 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary General, Statement of continued support by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Period 2020 November to 2021 November I am pleased to confirm that Access Spectrum Company Limited supports ten principles of the Global Compact with human rights, labour, environment and anticorruption. With this communication, we express our intent to advance those principles within our sphere of influence. We are committed to making UN Global Compact and its principles into corporate strategy, culture, and day-to-day operations of our company, and to engage in collaborative projects which advance broader development goals of United Nations, particularly Millennium Development Goals. Access Spectrum Company Limited will make a clear statement of this commitment to our stakeholders and the general public. We recognize that a key requirement of participation in the Global Compact is the annual submission of a Communication on Progress (COP) that describes our company's effort to implement the ten principles. We support public accountability and transparency, and therefore commit to report on progress within one year of joining the Global Compact, and annually, thereafter according to the Global Compact COP policy. Sincerely yours, Mr. Tin Htoo Khaing Managing Director Access Spectrum Company Limited.
