Dear readers, In the following pages we provide our Sustainability Report, now in its seventh edition. Over time, the commitment and sense of responsibility of the AIM Group towards its stakeholders have led to the evolution of this valuable tool, transforming it from a simple Corporate Social Responsibility Report of voluntary adoption to a document drawn up according to international standards and guidelines (GRI, Global Compact, SDGs) which for three editions now has also met the regulatory obligation on the non-financial statement (Legislative Decree 254/2016). We believe that this growth and improvement process is still not completed and that the new challenge for the next editions is to convey even more effectively a prospective and shared vision of the Group in the near future. In fact, the 110 years of history of the AIM Group are clear and irrefutable proof of its ability to be sustainable and, at the same time, are a fundamental value of its sustainability strategy, a natural element rooted in its genetic code. This continuously-evolving approach has allowed the AIM Group to grow and achieve success, demonstrating its capability of innovating and being resilient to the changing context. Currently, this heritage of values is an indispensable lever to drive the Group towards new horizons, concentrating energies and resources in pursuing its ability to constantly create value that is shared with its stakeholders and achieving a transition to a “future-proof business model”. Therefore, our objective for the next editions will be the design of an innovative reporting process that allows our stakeholders to see the strong link between our sustainability strategy and the new 2020-2023 Business Plan, which with the commitment, passion and dedication of our people will ensure the creation of a common heritage, a concrete legacy to be transferred to future generations. While thanking all our customers, suppliers, lenders, institutions and local communities and wishing you all an enjoyable read, we would like to give you a quick foretaste of what has been done with regard to a number of aspects which are priorities to us. Commitment to create and distribute value In 2019, the activities carried out by the AIM Group generated and distributed a net global added value of Euro 57 million, also through more than Euro 38 million in supply orders, 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 5 50.9% of which were assigned to companies operating in the local territory. In order to underline the value of sustainability, for AIM, in some of the tenders carried out, the publication of a sustainability report by the supplier was considered a rewarding factor in the choice of the best offer. Understanding stakeholder needs Understanding and acknowledging the needs and demands of stakeholders is a fundamental step in defining business strategies and creating shared value; listening both within and outside of the Group was carried out with continuity and commitment during 2019 and allowed the Group to maintain the Materiality Matrix. Human resources: a capital to be developed The person at the service of the Company, and the Company at the service of the person. As in any balanced ecosystem, cooperation between the parties is essential to ensure balance and growth. The AIM Group is particularly interested in these aspects and is committed to making the most of its human capital. The result of this viewpoint, which has always been one of the cornerstones of the company’s strategy, is the level of employment on permanent contracts, which in 2019 exceeded 95% of the total number of employees. But the optimisation of human capital is not exclusively due to the economic component; each employee received on average more than 10 hours of training, of which more than 60% were dedicated to safety in the workplace. Defending environmental and natural value The circular economy has its roots in the creation of a closed, self-healing and ecosustainable cycle; it is clear that reuse, recycling and recovery of waste represent an essential behaviour for the achievement of these objectives. Also in this field, AIM is strongly committed and active in terms of operations and in terms of raising public awareness. The Group actively supports projects for the transformation of waste into a resource through its reuse; among these, we can mention the Prisca Project, carried out with Cooperativa Insieme, which, through the reconditioning and recycling of waste, allows to give new life to objects that were intended for disposal. In terms of waste recycling, sorted waste collection in the municipalities served reached an average of over 76%, a very important result at national level that shows that awareness raising has been well received by citizens. The General Manager The Sole Director Mr. Renato Guarnieri Mr. Gianfranco Vivian 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 6 METHODOLOGICAL NOTE The AIM Group considers interaction with its stakeholders to be a determining factor in its strategy in order to listen to and understand their needs and requests through direct and continuous listening. Through the Sustainability Report, AIM wants to present the responsible management of the Group and its attention to the impacts on the community in economic, social and environmental terms. This document, which covers the period from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, was prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards guidelines published by the Global Reporting Initiative, GRI-Referenced option. During the analysis, the topics and related indicators (“Disclosure”) of the GRI Standards were selected, which are necessary to give a complete and consistent picture of the economic, environmental and social impact of the Group’s activities, as well as to respond to the requests for information of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016. The list of reported indicators, any boundary omissions and any detailed notes are shown in the final Concordance table. Since 2012, the AIM Group has been drawing up its annual Sustainability Report, officially publishing it on the website www.aimgruppo.it, in the Sustainability section. With the coming into force of Italian Legislative Decree 254/2016, the Report also meets the criteria for reporting non-financial information related in particular to aspects connected to the fight against active and passive corruption, and human rights, environmental, social and personnel-related aspects. Therefore, this document also constitutes the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement. The structure of the document aims to present the activities carried on by the Group in as clear and organised a manner as possible, first providing a broader and more strategic view and gradually concentrating and analysing in detail the relationships with stakeholders and the peculiarities of the activities carried out on the territory. The document includes materiality among the key drafting principles, i.e. the identification of a set of topics which AIM is particularly sensitive to. The selection of topics also included a process of listening to critical stakeholders for the organisation (e.g. banks, customers, employees, suppliers and other players in the territory...), in order to understand their requests in a precise manner. The matrix and the material topics in the document report the results that emerged during the process of materiality related to the drafting of the previous edition of the document (2018). In this edition, it was considered appropriate to operate in continuity with what had emerged in the previous edition: a revision and updating of the entire process would have been incompatible with the exceptional timing requirements for the presentation of the document. The document is drawn up by a working team of AIM personnel; the information and figures set out in the document are taken from documents officially adopted by the Company, or from reports created by personnel from the various operating areas. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 7 In certain cases, the figures set out take account of the performance achieved in the threeyear period from 2016 to 2018, while the income statement and balance sheet figures are taken from the approved Consolidated Financial Statements. The Non-Financial Statement is audited by an independent company, BDO, in accordance with the procedures required by the regulations currently in force. Reporting scope The NFS includes within its scope the companies consolidated on a line-by-line basis in the Consolidated Financial Statements, which are considered significant for the group's business. According to this approach, some companies that are not subject to direct management and control of the Group have not been included in this report. The companies excluded from this report are listed below: Acovis S.r.l.: a company controlled by the AIM Group, which holds 100% of the company’s capital. This company deals with waste management and was excluded from the NFS scope. BLUEOIL S.r.l.: a company controlled by the Group through TREV AMBIENTE S.r.l., which holds 54.12% of the company’s capital. The company is involved in the production of energy from vegetable oils; the complete management of the cogeneration plant for the production of electricity from pure vegetable oil located in Bolzano Vicentino is currently assigned to a third party company. Since the activities carried out cannot be traced back to the operations of the AIM Group, it was decided not to include such information and statistics in this document. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 8 THE AIM GROUP 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 9 ABOUT US AND THE VALUES OF THE GROUP The AIM Group is a multi-utility group operating in the provision of local public services such as the distribution of electricity, gas and heat, environmental hygiene, parking services, and municipal property maintenance (green areas, roads, road signs, cemeteries, council housing and public lighting), and in the sale of electricity, gas and heat, the generation of electricity and the management of plants in the environmental sector.

In order to pursue the Group’s corporate mission and the path towards the integrated management of sustainability, the AIM Group identified, through the adoption of its own Code of Ethics, the general principles and the rules of conduct recognised as having a positive ethical value. In particular, our Values, representing the general principles guiding our operations, are as follows:  fairness, loyalty, integrity and honesty in managing relations with counterparties and with the Group’s own employees;  the optimisation of human resources as the vital factor for the company’s growth and business continuity;  the protection of privacy in instruments and methods in order to ensure the confidentiality of information contained in databanks and personal records;  the protection of the corporate image in order to safeguard the company’s good reputation and credibility;  the quality of the services provided in order to constantly meet users’ requirements;  impartiality in relations with Stakeholders, avoiding any form of discrimination or favouritism inside or outside of the Group.

Furthermore, in developing its own business the AIM Group pursues the ten Principles set out in the Global Compact, and the Goals established by the 2030 Agenda. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 14 With regard to the Global Compact, since 2014 the Group has adhered to this United Nations’ project for the promotion of a corporate citizenship culture that encourages enterprises throughout the world to create an economic, social and environmental framework designed to promote a sound, sustainable global economy (www.globalcompactnetwork.org). Each year, by a specifically established deadline, the AIM Group has to submit a COP (Communication on Progress), whereby it maintains a transparent relationship with the Association, stating how it manages to support and safeguard the ten fundamental Principles through its own operations. The 10 Fundamental and Universal Principles of the Global Compact concern:  human rights  labour rights  the environment  the fight against corruption Attached herewith is the concordance table between the ten fundamental principles and the actions implemented by the AIM Group in pursuit of said principles. The following are the objectives of the 2030 Agenda – also known as the Sustainable Development Goals – to be pursued by the 193 UN member states by 2030. Figure 2 Sustainable Development Goals The table below shows the concordance between the 17 global sustainable development goals and the actions implemented by the AIM Group in pursuit of some of said goals. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 15 MATERIALITY ANALYSIS The AIM Group prepared the materiality analysis by comparing the importance given by the Group and the Stakeholders to the activities carried on and the material aspects reported on in this Sustainability Report. The materiality analysis process initiated for the purposes of the Non-Financial Statement is based on the methodological references provided by the GRI (101 Foundation) and the Communication 2017/C 215/01 from the European Commission ( Guidelines on nonfinancial reporting ). As highlighted in the methodological note, this 2019 NFS was implemented in continuity with that of 2018 and the contents were identified through a materiality analysis process that has led to the identification of priority issues for the Group and its stakeholders. The process was characterised by:  the involvement of the Management Committee (18 persons) of the Group who, during an ad hoc meeting, expressed their evaluations, taking this opportunity as an opportunity for discussion and exchange of ideas on the approach to sustainability of the Group;  sending an online survey to the main stakeholders, including customers, banks, suppliers, shareholders and employees for a total of more than 200 questionnaires. At the end of the indicated listening activities, the aspects were also weighted according to the criteria of dependence and influence. Bringing together the results of the two criteria, and considering the overall interpretation of the business model and business strategies, the 2018 Materiality Matrix is represented below. The aspects were clustered into thematic macro-areas for a better representation of the priority areas:  ETHICS AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT  PROTECTION OF THE CUSTOMER  RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT  PEOPLE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT  SOCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE TERRITORY 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 16 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 17 THE STAKEHOLDERS The AIM Group is committed to sharing the value produced as a result of its business operations, with its own local area and its Stakeholders. The continuous listening to the needs and requests of parties both within and outside of the Group is a key element for AIM, which aims to create, maintain and strengthen its relations with all stakeholders. To this end, the company is committed to guaranteeing adequate time and space for listening and dialogue. The principles that AIM followed when mapping its Stakeholders are geared toward transparency, fairness, social integration and consideration for the future generations, through the activities managed by the various companies within the Group. In particular, for a better representation of its stakeholders, in order to better understand their needs and structure the methods of interaction and dialogue, AIM has chosen to map them, as shown in Errore. L'origine riferimento non è stata trovata.. Figure 3 Map of AIM Group Stakeholders In establishing corporate policies, each category of Stakeholder is broken down into homogeneous segments sharing similar interests, in order to guide managerial decisions towards meeting the specific requirements of individual groups as best as possible. Stakeholder engagement entails diverse means of communication, listening, dialogue and partnership, all designed to meet the actual needs and expectations of Stakeholders in terms of the company’s strategies, and with the aim of improving the Group’s socio-economic impact. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 18 GLOBAL STAKEHOLDERS CATEGORIES COMPACT PRINCIPLES OF CONDUCT RIGHTS AIM, in accordance with its own mission, provides Municipalities with parking, environmental hygiene and energy distribution services, together with other services Local municipalities for the care of the town. and citizens affected AIM undertakes to establish Territory by the Company’s Environment the necessary conditions for strategic and the cultural, social and operational actions economic development of the community, and in particular for a liveable environment and for the safeguarding of the rights of future generations.

The organisational model assigns specific tasks and duties to the various company Functions. In particular, the Sole Director of AIM Vicenza Spa is responsible for the legal representation and the definition of institutional strategies, according to the guidelines given by the shareholders; the General Manager takes all measures aimed at implementing the guidelines set by the corporate bodies.

The internal control and risk management system The Internal Control and Risk Management System of AIM Vicenza S.p.a. applies the administrative liability management system referred to in Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/2001. Said system consists of a series of rules, procedures and organisational structures designed to permit the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of the Group’s principal corporate risks, that is, criminal offences committed in the interest, or for the benefit, of the entity itself by persons vested with representation, administration, management and control functions within the entity, or by the aforementioned persons’ subordinates. The AIM Group has adopted am organisation and control model, and at the same time has appointed the Supervisory Board (SB). The model provides for the initial monitoring of the various operations exposed to the identified risks of crime, and establishes, among other things, a number of specific protocols to be observed in order to prevent those crimes referred to in Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/01 and in other legislation, including the crimes of corruption and extortion. For example, the SB has the following functions:  the supervision of the effectiveness of the Model, by verifying whether actual behaviour is in line with that provided for in the Model itself, through the monitoring of those areas at risk of the commission of criminal offences both those characterising the Group’s traditional business activity and those instrumental in the commission of crimes;  the regular control of the adequacy of the Model, that is, its capacity to prevent undesired forms of behaviour, and of the Group’s ability to constantly meet the requirements of solidity and functionality, through the continuous monitoring of the system of controls and protocols;  to propose adjustments to the Model in the event that the controls operated call for adjustments to be made. The Group’s companies are constantly engaged in keeping the adopted risk control model updated and effective. The Holding Company’s SB has free access to all company documents deemed of relevance, and during the course of 2019, it met 5 times. With a special reference to the areas indicated by Decree 254/2016, the environmental risk factors, related to social aspects, personnel management, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption, are reflected in the management of the Group's activities in order to ensure continuity and efficiency.

Procedures IIIBISOS10III OS24OS30 Table 2 AIM Group SOA Certificates The Three-year Plan for the Prevention of Corruption is the measure through which AIM VICENZA implements its strategy to prevent corrupt practices (see the next paragraph for details). To this end, an analysis was carried out of the level of exposure to the risk of corruption of corporate activities, focusing on the events at risk in the mandatory areas identified by Italian Law no. 190/2012, as well as on other areas potentially exposed to the risk of corruption as a result of the risk assessment carried out as part of the activities also related to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 24 A summary table that identifies the sources to monitor risk management in the various areas is available below.

In particular, with regard to the former, sample checks were carried out for the tender procedures in progress and to ascertain the adaptation of the procedures to the new law provisions on the matter, which found no significant critical issues pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree no. 231/01. Transparency and Anti-Corruption To further strengthen interaction with all Stakeholders, a special section of the company website has been set up, headed “Transparent Administration” (http://www.aimgruppo.it/amministrazionetransparente/) containing both economic-financial, social and governance-linked information, and upto-date data and documents of specific interest, enabling Stakeholders to get a multi-disciplinary, integrated picture of the company. The AIM Group possesses an internal policy designed to ensure that each administrative procedure is characterised by transparency and accessibility, in accordance with existing legislation, that is, with Italian Legislative Decree 33/2013 regarding the reorganisation of provisions concerning the duty to disclose and divulge transparent data and information on the part of the public administration and publicly-controlled enterprises, in regard to activity of public interest governed by national or EU law. The business activities governed include the management of public services. Since 2017, the AIM Group has been included in the category of listed public companies, and the Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority (Anac), in its resolution no. 1134 of 8 November 2017, set out guidelines, considering it appropriate to “further examine the legislation applicable to listed public companies, as defined by Section 18 of Italian Legislative Decree no. 175/2016, already subject to a separate system of obligations and penalties, and thus to erase that part of the guidelines concerning listed companies, pending the results of such examination”. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 26 As a result of the foregoing, AIM Vicenza Spa is exempted from the scope of the provisions regarding transparency under Italian Legislative Decree 33/2013, as are its direct or indirect subsidiaries or investees. The AIM Group, however, continues to disclose information regarding the management of the individual companies, in particular vis-à-vis its Stakeholders, and maintains a level of transparency that is in line with the corresponding legal forms. The AIM Group considers transparency to be a fundamental instrument with which to prevent corruption and to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of its administrative actions. The Code of Ethics is a document expressing a series of “ethical-behavioural” principles that the company adheres to, and which it demands be complied with by its own corporate bodies, employees, collaborators, users and suppliers, and in general by all those who have any dealings with the company. The Holding Company AIM has introduced a series of specific organisational and managerial measures to prevent corruption, and has extended the scope of its own Organisational Model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree 231/2001 to those crimes referred to in Italian Law 190/2012, through the adoption of a Three-Year Corruption Prevention Plan and of a Three-Year Transparency and Integrity Programme, as well as the corresponding updates to such, which constitute an Appendix to the Organisational Model itself. The aforementioned Plan establishes the following objectives:  to reduce the likelihood of cases of corruption;  to increase the capacity to identify cases of corruption;  to create an environment unfavourable to corruption. Since 2015 the AIM Group has developed and implemented a series of organised actions and activities designed to prevent crimes of fraud against the State and the public administration from being committed, together with the crimes of undue inducement to give or promise benefits, extortion and corruption, in relation not only to public administrations but also to private individuals. Observance of the laws and the fight against corrupting behaviour are clearly established in the Group’s Code of Conduct, implemented in practice and in the operating methods established and adopted through company procedures, and is supported, encouraged and monitored by means of the principal instrument of prevention that AIM has created, namely the Anti-corruption and transparency unit (N.A.T. Nucleo Anticorruzione e Trasparenza), which mainly:  carries out internal controls in order to monitor company processes and to identify any critical situations or anomalies;  specifically identifies areas potentially at risk;  maps existing processes;  assesses risk;  identifies appropriate preventive measures. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 27 The AIM Group, aware of the importance of the fight against corruption, decided to strengthen its model of prevention on the basis of the provisions of Italian Law 190/2012 and of the Italian National AntiCorruption Authority's guidelines on the matter. Moreover, in 2019 no corruption actions (active and passive) or legal actions concerning unfair competition or antitrust were recorded, nor were such actions brought by any third parties against the Company itself. It should be noted, in so far as it may be necessary, specifically with reference to Italian Legislative Decree 231/01, that criminal proceedings are pending before the Court of Grosseto for liability under Legislative Decree no. 231/01 in relation to the crime of fraud alleged against the special attorney of SIT, with the aggravating circumstance of significant profit to the detriment of the Municipality of Grosseto. The organisational structure The AIM Group, in order to carry out its operations, established the following organisational structure subdivided into functions, each of which is headed by a Function Manager. 5 6AIM Figure Figure AIMGroup Group corporate corporatestructure structure Corporate bodies The articles of association provide for the following corporate bodies:  The shareholders’ meeting  Management body: Sole Director  Company control body: Board of Statutory Auditors  Control body: Audit firm Moreover, the Corporate Governance Code provides for two additional bodies  The directors’ committee  The management committee 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 28 The Shareholders’ Meeting The Shareholders’ Meeting is responsible for approving the Financial Statements and for deciding on the distribution of profits, for the appointment and dismissal of the Management Body, the Control Body and the Audit Firm.

The Management Committee The Management Committee is composed of the General Manager and the senior or middle managers in charge of companies/divisions/services. It meets once a month to examine issues relating to operations. The key role is played by the Management Body of the Parent Company, AIM Vicenza Spa, which is responsible for the management, coordination and control of the companies belonging to the AIM Group. The executive management of the business constituting the corporate purpose is entrusted to the General Manager, who is also responsible for coordinating the operational structure and the organisation of the work of the AIM Group, including the logistical aspects thereof. Mr. Dario Vianello was appointed General Manager by deed of 26 August 2011. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 31 RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 32 THE SHARE CAPITAL Material aspects  RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS The sole shareholder of AIM Vicenza Spa is the Municipality of Vicenza that owns 100% of the share capital. The Company, vis-a-vis its shareholder, ensures the effective participation of all members of corporate bodies in the shareholders’ meeting through timely information on the items on the agenda, in order to establish a fruitful dialogue among the Shareholder, the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors; in addition, the AIM Group seeks maximum transparency in both corporate disclosures and personal relationships. The relationship, from a corporate point of view, consists of the statutory shareholders' meetings and those envisaged by the articles of association. The company has concluded contracts called service contracts with the Municipality of Vicenza for performance of the activities subject to concessions and/or administrative authorisations. The share capital of AIM Vicenza Spa amounts to Euro 71,293,000 and consists of 1,425,860 ordinary shares, worth Euro 50.00 each, owned entirely by the Municipality of Vicenza. In 2019, the AIM Group paid dividends to the Municipality of Vicenza of Euro 3.7 million referring to the profits allocated from the 2018 Financial Statements. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 33 RELATIONS WITH LENDERS Material aspects  ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  FINANCIAL SOUNDNESS The Group pursues a policy aimed at the utmost transparency and fairness in communications with lenders, maintaining a balanced diversification and distribution of debt. The financial management objective is to guarantee the Group an adequate current and future balance between investments and capital use on the one hand and sources of financing on the other hand and, for the latter, negotiate sustainable conditions, both in terms of repayment plan and rate type and extent. For the performance of its activities, the AIM Group resorts to self-financing as well as to short-term debt capital (to be repaid within the following year) and long-term debt (to be repaid beyond the following year). Net financial debt at 31 December 2019 was equal to Euro 145.21 million. 2019 2018 2017 Current net financial debt -27.53 43.00 25.34 Non-current financial debt 116.83 127.87 135.39 Net financial debt 89.30 84.80 110.05 Table 5 Net financial debt (in millions of Euro) for 2017-2019 The Group’s financial structure shows a modest change in debt; about 80% of the debt structure consists of medium/long-term debts. The credit facilities are not concentrated on a single lender but are distributed among the leading Italian banks with which the Group has entertained consolidated relations for years. The Net Financial Position amounts to Euro 89.30 million, up compared to 2018. The AIM Group is among the first Italian companies operating in the local public services sector which the European Investment Bank has involved in the new loan programme called “Medium Sized Utilities Programme Loan”, intended to support companies’ medium-term development plans. The financial expenses accrued on debt capital in 2019 fell from Euro 5.1 million to Euro 4.7 million with a reduction of 8.6%. The AIM Group, for over 5 years, has entertained relations with the Banca Etica credit institution that recognised the Company’s corporate and environmental requirements, thereby allowing the opening of some credit facilities aimed at the company’s economic-corporate sustainability. It should be noted that in 2017, AIM Vicenza issued the first tranche of an unsecured bond amounting to Euro 50 million through listing on the regulated market of the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE), one of the reference trading venues at the European level for the corporate bond market. This operation was 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 34 followed in 2018 by the issue of a second tranche of the Green Bond, demonstrating the commitment and interest shown by the AIM Group in making investments in favour of growth and sustainable development. The unrated private placement was fully subscribed by institutional investors. The bonds will have a duration of 7 years, expiring in 2025, and an annual coupon of 1.984%. The principal will be repaid according to an amortisation schedule divided into constant annual principal amounts. The proceeds from the issue will be used to fund the important investment programme, in the various business areas, envisaged by the Business Plan approved by the Municipality of Vicenza and will allow, through a diversification of the sources of financing, to continue the Group’s financial consolidation process pursued in recent years. Among others, complex operations will be carried out on the electricity networks and part of the financial resources will contribute towards the upcoming tenders for the award of the methane gas distribution service. The operations planned in the environmental sector are not of secondary importance, among which the construction of a major centre in eastern Vicenza stands out. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 35 RELATIONS WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES Material aspects  RELATIONS WITH REGULATORY AUTHORITIES The AIM Group pursues the objectives set by the reference public institutions and collaborates effectively with their bodies in the regulation and control of local public services. The company pursues these objectives by combining them with its mission and with the need for the organisational and managerial autonomy typical of any economic operator. As laid down by its Code of Ethics, the Company does not grant contributions or benefits of any kind to political parties, movements, committees and political and trade union organisations, to their representatives and candidates, which may, in some way, be linked to the company’s intention to favour them, except those that may be due according to specific regulations and agreements . The AIM Group regularly pays the contributions and registration fees due to entities and institutions. In particular, the entities to which contributions are paid include the following:  Regulatory authorities (ARERA, AA To, ...)  Confederation bodies and membership fees  Utilitalia  Industry Association  Confservizi  Provincial entities (TARI)  Regional entities The Institutions represent a privileged partner with whom to collaborate in the implementation of initiatives designed to generate positive effects on the social and economic fabric of the territory and on the citizens’ quality of life, including by virtue of the essential nature of the services provided by the Group and their impact on the communities. The AIM Group interacts with the various institutional players in compliance with the principles and rules set out in the Group's Code of Ethics, which dedicates Article 4 to relations with political institutions and trade unions. In the relations with reference local authorities, “the company pursues the objectives set by the reference public institutions and collaborates effectively with their respective bodies in charge of regulating and controlling local public services. The Group combines these objectives with its mission and with the need for the organisational and managerial autonomy typical of any economic operator”. In relations with public administrations, “the AIM Group's corporate bodies must conduct themselves with the utmost fairness and integrity vis-à-vis the Public Administration”. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 36 Therefore, there are no logics of conditioning the counterparty decisions, expressed or implemented in any form, aimed at influencing decisions in favour of the Company or requesting or obtaining favourable treatment. It is also forbidden to accept requests from Public Administration personnel aiming to subordinate decisions and acts in favour of AIM Vicenza to awards of whatsoever nature. During business negotiations, requests or business relations with the Public Administration, no actions proposing employment and/or business opportunities that may provide benefits, for oneself or others, to employees of the Public Administration or their relatives or in-laws, must be undertaken directly or indirectly. Relations with Public Administrations are maintained by delegated corporate representatives. All the documentation summarising the procedures through which the AIM Group entered into negotiation or administrative contact with Public Administrations must be duly collected and filed. Upon the occurrence of episodes of this kind, or of more or less explicit attempts, it is required to promptly inform the Supervisory Board. Finally, the Group maintains the utmost transparency and independence in “relations with political and trade union organisations”. The relationship with the institutions is defined by a complex organisational model that assigns specific tasks and duties to the various company Functions, of which reference should be made to the chapter on corporate governance. The AIM Group also maintains relations with trade associations by participating and actively collaborating in benchmarking against other companies and to promote regulatory and technological updates, including Utilitalia, Confservizi and Confindustria. Moreover, the AIM Group maintains relations with the ARERA authority. ARERA is an independent body established by Law 481/1995, which protects consumer interests and the promotion of competition, efficiency and the distribution of services through regulation and control activities. It also performs an advisory role vis-à-vis the Parliament and the Government to which it can submit reports and proposals. The tax burden incurred by the AIM Group was as follows: Taxes and duties Euro/000 2019 2018 Direct income tax for the year, 4,579 3,295 of which: IRES and IRAP 4,579 3,295 Indirect taxes and duties, of 754 742 which: Other taxes 700 689 Vehicle ownership taxes 54 53 Total 5,333 4,037 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 37 Table 8 – The tax burden incurred by the AIM Group in thousands of Euro The AIM Group is attentive to compliance with rules and regulations and has no significant litigation proceedings against the Public Administration. The AIM Group also receives contributions from the Public Administration, mainly from the Cassa Conguaglio del Settore Elettrico, the Adjustment Fund for the Electricity Sector. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 38 GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED ECONOMIC VALUE The added value is the ability of a company to produce wealth and then distribute it to the various stakeholders. The added value can therefore be analysed from two points of view:  that of the wealth produced by the AIM Group (production of added value);  that concerning its distribution among the stakeholders involved in the activities of the AIM Group (distribution of added value). The reclassification of values followed the principles established by the Sustainability Report Study Group (GBS). The measurement of the added value is shown in Table 6. The amount of Added Value distributed to Personnel is equal to 59.21% and consists of wages and salaries, for both employees and collaborators; 9.67% was distributed to the Public Administration through the payment of direct and indirect taxes; 8.20% to Lenders through financial expenses paid to credit institutions; 6.49% to the Shareholder in the form of dividends and reserves; for the Group’s capitalisation, 13.31% was allocated and, finally, 3.11% was disbursed to the Local community, mainly through contributions to social, cultural and sporting initiatives and to consumption and environmental education. Considering that 86.7% of AIM Group employees live in the municipality of Vicenza or in other municipalities in the province of Vicenza, more than Euro 29.3 million was distributed locally in the form of wages and salaries, which contribute significantly to the economic and social growth within the territory. The added value distributed in 2019 is broken down as shown in Figure . DETERMINATION OF ADDED VALUE (Euro/000) 2019 A) Value of production 289,555 1.

In order to further customer retention, all customer relations must be based on the principles of loyalty, helpfulness, transparency and professionalism. To this end, the AIM Group has adopted a Services Charter by means of which it has made a series of undertakings to the public, in regard to the performance of its activity, and on the basis of its UNI EN ISO 9001 certification it undertakes to constantly provide customers with services that meet their requirements and that are compliant with applicable legislation. The AIM Group, through its investees, guarantees its customers equal rights, equal treatment and non-discrimination. The Group is increasingly committed to rendering information about its services simple and readily available. These are the key underlying principles that the Group follows in order to ensure that customer relations are long-lasting, through the adoption of a variety of channels of communication with customers. For years now, the Group has undertaken to comply with general and specific quality standards, and to constantly improve the services provided through technological, organisational and procedural solutions designed to further the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations. QUALITY AND PROXIMITY: RELATIONS WITH ENERGY CUSTOMERS AIM Energy and CogasPiù Energie are the AIM Group’s commercial companies, and they operate in the sale of electricity and natural gas to various types of customer. In the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, AIM served the following number of customers: 2019 2018 2017 Electricity 104,412 94,826 88,030 Natural gas 131,711 129,001 128,028 Total Customers 236,123 223,827 216,058 Table 11 – Customers served by the AIM Group in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 82.33% of Electricity customers are of the residential type, whereas 92.91% of Natural Gas customers are of the residential type. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 43 AIM Energy’s marketing campaign is designed not only to strengthen its own identity in the Veneto region, but also to further reinforce its presence in other Italian regions, such as Lombardy where in 2016 it began a joint project with a marketing agency operating in Milan, Monza and the Brianza area. In order to offer a service that is increasingly efficient and close to customers and potential customers, a sales network was set up in 2018, which at the end of 2019 consisted of 10 agents. The activity of CogasPiù Energie is also aimed at bolstering its own identity in the Region of Abruzzo and, through 21 sales agencies, in many regions of Italy. The strong presence and attachment to the territory that characterises the AIM Group is also unequivocally reflected in the customer base and its concentration. As can be seen in Table 7, about 80% of the contracts are registered in the Veneto region, and in particular in the Vicenza area.

In 2019, more than 27,000 customers subscribed to the STOPCARTA and Vi@Mail services, showing an increase compared to 2018 (18,800). Almost 177,000 electronic bills were issued in 2019, 16% of all bills issued. Moreover, thanks to the possibility of paying bills also through the website, the Group also encourages responsible use of its users' consumption. In 2019, the number of online payments increased significantly, resulting in significant paper saving.

In particular, the Gas Bonus is a discount on the gas bill, introduced by the Government and implemented by the Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water (ARERA) with the cooperation of the nation’s municipalities, to guarantee a saving for those families who find themselves in specific difficult circumstances. The Electricity Bonus is also a discount on the electricity bill, introduced by the Government and implemented by ARERA with the cooperation of the nation’s municipalities. Considering the years from 2017 to 2019, it is clear that there is an upward trend in the number of people who have benefited from this facility in terms of both electricity and gas consumption.

The AIM Group, which has renewed this agreement for the past eight years now, in 2019 disbursed Euro 8,423.22, a sum that was used in 49 local situations of social and economic difficulty. Euro 20,620.85 are added to this sum that AIM, in collaboration with the Municipality of Vicenza, has allocated to help families with financial difficulties. Moreover, AIM Energy also provides for special repayment plans for families in socio-economic difficulties resident in the Municipality of Vicenza. An annual agreement is stipulated with the latter to help with the payment, in instalments, of gas and electricity bills. Finally, special educational/informational projects have been agreed on with the Municipality of Vicenza, designed to inform people about the correct use of electricity so as to avoid unnecessary waste. In 2019, agreements were stipulated with 68 resident families. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 45 Responsible and transparent offers The Group’s commercial companies provide diversified energy offers and tariff plans, suited to the needs of the various types of customer, comprising households and companies. The offers provide benefits in terms of savings through discounts, support services, energy bonuses, electronic billing, online desk and billing based on real consumption. The campaign, aimed at illustrating the difference between protected market and free market, promoted the offers and services developed by AIM Energy in the free market, with a view to brand loyalty and brand reputation consolidation. For the sale of electricity, AIM Energy and CogasPiù Energie continued to promote green energy in 2019 in order to serve end customers in the free market with the supply of electricity produced entirely from certified renewable sources, or with certifications (Guarantees of Origin) that attest to the green source of production. The end customers are therefore guaranteed 100% renewable energy with no additional costs or contractual changes. Other active commercial offers are: Energia Più and Sempre Luce, which allow customers to save 10% on the energy price set by ARERA; Idea Fissa Luce, on the other hand, allows customers to set the price of the commodity for a whole year, while Business Light offers a discount on the electricity market price for small and medium-sized businesses. For the sale of natural gas, the Easy Winter promotion is active, which involves sending monthly bills from November to April, and on a bimonthly basis for the remaining months of the year. This billing method allows the payment of the winter bills, those in which most of the consumption is concentrated, to be spread out. On top of this is the advantage of reporting self-reading, obtaining a Euro 5 discount each, and paying only for the actual consumption. Idea Fissa Gas allows to set the price of natural gas for a year and obtain a further discount through self-readings. Solido Risparmio grants up to 80 m3 of natural gas free of charge for customers with consumption greater than or equal to 1,000 m3 and who pay by bank account or otherwise of 60 m3 in case of payment by postal payment slips. Ben Spesa and IperSpesa offer customers Euro 50 in store credit that can be used at a major local retailer. Another active promotional offer is PiùReale that offers a fixed discount on the commodity price for the supply of natural gas. Agreements The Group's commercial companies entertain relations based on an effective collaboration with the representatives of the various consumer associations operating in the territory concerned. As mentioned, in 2019 AIM confirmed the agreement with Caritas Diocesana in Vicenza, providing the association Diakonia Onlus with a fund needed to help the less fortunate families of the City of Vicenza. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 46 For several years, an agreement has been in place with the Christian Association of Italian workers (ACLI) of Vicenza, which provides exclusive discounts to members in relation to the supply of natural gas and electricity, as well as the agreement in the supply of information on energy consumption to raise citizens' awareness of the correct use of energy. Customer protection and continuous listening In all relationships with customers, the AIM Group ensures compliance with the Privacy Code in the management of personal data (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) and ensures continuous contact thanks to its territorial presence. With reference to energy services, there are 9 sales desks, of which 7 are located in the Veneto region, 1 in Abruzzo and 1 in Lazio. Furthermore, CogasPiù Energie makes 21 sales agencies available in the regions of Abruzzo, Molise, Lazio, Puglia and Lombardy. In the 9 physical desks open to the public, customers can find numerous information leaflets concerning the self-reading service, consumer education campaigns and the many promotions active in the electricity and natural gas market.

During 2019, the restyling of the Customer Area was completed. This was aimed at making existing services more intuitive and easier to use and implementing a set of new digital services to allow customers to have more and more information and manage their contract with increased autonomy. Therefore, since 2019 the Customer Area has been enriched with the following features:  automatic registration of new customers to the portal  viewing the progress of tickets  possibility to update and change contact details  notice about the expiry of current offers and the possibility of renewal  sending files with security codes (OTP)  graphic display of consumption  “communication” area with targeted contents for each customer 2 www.aimenergy.it and www.cogaspiu.it 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 49  schedule showing dates of the future issue and expiry of bills a digital communication programme has also been activated to inform customers about the new services available. AIM Energy, with the guidance and collaboration of the marketing agency selected in 2019, completed a project organised through a number of workshops attended by personnel working in contact with customers (call centre and desk operators, agents, salespeople, marketing personnel and management) to improve brand communication, which resulted in the following Value Proposition: Customer support In order to improve the quality of the service, AIM provides customers with a Customer Relations department that handles customer requests with care and punctuality, including those that can be classified as Complaints. The objective of the ongoing monitoring of complaints by the AIM Group is to identify critical issues and define and implement corrective actions. In particular, the department manages written requests from customers through a specific system. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 50 Customers can find the email address reclami@aimenergy.it or info@cogaspiu.it in their bills. When they use these addresses to report an issue, they automatically receive information on the method and timing of the reply. In addition, a complaint form or other written report can be found at AIM's customer service desk. Since 2016, a page for the direct submission of reports has been active in the restricted access area of the website www.aimenergy.it.

Quality in the electricity distribution service The AIM Group, through its subsidiary Servizi a Rete Electricity and Natural Gas Division, manages the electricity network of the Municipality of Vicenza and the natural gas network in the city and in other 12 municipalities in the province of Vicenza, as well as two other municipalities of the province of Padua and in the municipality of Treviso. For the distribution of electricity, with Resolution 646/2015/R/eel, which came into force on 1 January 2016, AEEGSI approved the Integrated Output-Based Regulation of Electric Power Distribution and Metering Services” for the period from 2016 to 2023. The AIM Group annually reports all indicators requested by the Authority, and these were fully satisfied in 2019. Compliance with commercial quality standards is constantly monitored through the use of dedicated software that can transmit alerts at the same time as every anomaly that is recorded and may generate an order for automatic compensation to be paid. In 2019, Servizi a Rete served 72,385 users, as shown in Table 1813, on a 1,116.87 km network. 2019 2018 2017 Domestic 54,701 54,335 54,021 Non-domestic 17,684 17,691 17,805 Total 72,385 72,026 71,826 Table 1813 – Users of the electricity distribution service served by Servizi A Rete in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 Below are some indicators that measure the quality of the service and can have an impact on end customers. The specific commercial quality standards for electricity were 100% complied with in 2019. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 51 2019 2018 2017 Average number of interruptions no./users:3 Scheduled 0.168 0.18 0.25 without notice 0.873 0.38 1.07 Average duration of interruptions min/user Scheduled 13.445 19.47 28.12 without notice 14.106 7.59 18.29 Electrical losses 6.1% 6.1% 6.1% Table 19 – Quality standards offered by the service of Servizi A Rete in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 Quality in natural gas distribution service For the distribution of natural gas, Servizi a Rete manages gas transport through local pipeline networks, for delivery to end users through two phases: the pick-up of gas from Snam Rete Gas’ pipelines through first-stage pick-up points, followed by its transport and distribution to end users. Gas distribution activities are carried out by the AIM Group according to the rules of functional unbundling envisaged for vertically integrated companies in the sector, in compliance with the principles of economy and profitability and the confidentiality of company data for the purpose of promoting continuity, efficiency and adequate quality levels in the service provided. Overall, in 2019 Servizi a Rete, for the division relating to the distribution of natural gas, managed more than 134,000 users, introducing more than 251 million standard cubic metres of natural gas into the network. As can be seen, the number of users served in 2019 consolidates the trend for the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 2019 2018 2017 no. of users served 134,015 133,866 133,853 Table 140 – Users served by Servizi A Rete in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 The natural gas distribution service makes reference to the commercial quality parameters set by ARERA.

Gas network 1,742 1,573 1,070 interruptions (users) Table 21 – Quality standards offered by Servizi A Rete in the two-year period from 2018 to 2019 The interruptions in the gas supply service take place mainly during the execution of renewal works on the network, upon switching of user connections from the old to the new pipeline. They are divided into scheduled interruptions, if the works are scheduled in advance and citizens can be promptly notified of the interruption, and interruptions without notice, usually in case of breakdowns with immediate operations, or those for which it is not possible to notify all customers involved at least one day prior to the interruption. To limit the duration of the interruptions as much as possible, Servizi a Rete intervenes with the timely scheduling and rationalisation of operations. In all cases in which it is technically feasible, however, Servizi a Rete informs the users involved in the interruptions in advance through the affixing of information posters and, in some specific cases, through telephone contact. The safety of the network is key. The inspection of the networks, an effective emergency response service and the right concentration of the level of odorisation are basic elements for the correct management of the gas distribution system, which is supported by the continuous modernisation of the networks. ARERA envisages obligations for gas distribution companies in relation to network safety, including the inspection of high, low and medium pressure networks with the aim of greater control over losses. It also imposes minimum levels of odorisation for the protection of people and property from damage resulting from accidents caused by the distributed gas. In 2019 Servizi a Rete Gas Distribution carried out 205 call-outs for odorisation checks. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 53 Through Resolution 574/14, ARERA established that gas distribution companies are required to comply with safety service obligations, including those concerning the frequency of network inspections. The current regulation provides for a differentiation of the obligation depending on the type of network and operating pressure, requiring compliance with the following criteria:  100% inspection of high and medium pressure networks: 3 years  100% inspection of low pressure networks: 4 years  100% inspection of HP/MP and LP networks in materials other than cathodically protected steel, polyethylene, re-cast iron and cast iron with joints not in hemp and lead: 1 year. The scheduled inspection of the gas networks also leads to greater control over losses. The initiatives taken by the company to reduce gas losses in the network are focused on the search for leaks, preventive maintenance of the gas pipes and the replacement of the grey cast iron network with hemp and lead joint. In 2019, 86.5% of the network was in steel and polyethylene. The Group has a Gas Emergency Service, active 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, which is activated following reports of potentially dangerous situations related to:  gas losses from the distribution network, from user connection systems, from metering units  gas supply interruption  gas supply irregularity  damage to the distribution network, user connection systems and metering units, in the absence of losses  gas loss downstream of the redelivery point and on any part of the user connection system that is not managed or owned by the distribution company even by those who do not own the pickup point itself. QUALITY AND PROXIMITY: RELATIONS WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE SERVICE CUSTOMERS Through the company Valore Ambiente, the AIM Group manages the urban health service of the Municipality of Vicenza for 62,718 users served.

Valore Ambiente makes available to all domestic users access to 4 recycling centres for the correct disposal of bulky and recyclable waste: North Recycling Centre; West Recycling Centre; South Recycling Centre; and S. Pio X Recycling Centre. The company's commitment to promoting responsible behaviour in the management of waste and resources, respecting the environment and citizens, has continued over the years. There are many initiatives promoted and developed to raise citizens' awareness of collection and more effective consumption. Valore Ambiente, in order to meet the demand for more information to foreign citizens living in the city, has distributed and included on the website 9 guides on waste collection in as many foreign languages (French, Spanish, English, Arabic, Serbian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Bengali, Chinese). In order to prevent the dumping of waste on the ground, Valore Ambiente has strengthened its supervision through video surveillance systems on a police car and provided, for more than 200 hours, a resource on the street to carry out training at strategic points of the city of Vicenza. Over 600 people have been contacted for mutual listening and dialogue. Valore Ambiente began to conduct an additional lay-by cleaning service on Monday mornings to remove any dumped waste. It developed and implemented the service for door-to-door paper and plastic collection lines for commercial users, recreational places such as sports facilities in the city, local festivals and events. A collection service is also active for special waste in the city's neighbourhoods, through a structure that provides for the controlled delivery of small waste that users, who habitually adopt the door-todoor service, hardly hand over to recycling centres: used clothing, batteries, expired pharmaceuticals, neon tubes. Other initiatives carried out for citizens in 2019 Training activities in schools continued during 2019. Collaboration with various high schools has resulted in activities to raise awareness and consolidate good practices for the correct sorting of waste. During the summer a new phase started, in close collaboration with the Education Department of the Municipality of Vicenza, which made it possible for first and second level primary schools to include in their Curriculum Prospectus (POFT) the activity on creative reuse and visits to Collection Centres free of charge. The extraordinary street cleaning service with towing that, in the first week of each month, provides for the simultaneous washing and sweeping of the road and the pavement, as well as the external washing of any bins, in addition to the routine street cleaning and hygiene services that are already carried out throughout the city. A convenient free SMS messaging service has been made available to users that notifies in advance in which streets the washing service will take place and what roads need to be vacated. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 55 The free distribution by Valore Ambiente, for the campaign for the collection of waste cooking oil, of a 3-litre container, equipped with a sieve and airtight cap, for the collection of domestic oil, which can then be emptied at one of the 4 urban recycling centres. The company sought to invest energy and resources in service and practicality, bringing collection points closer to users. Therefore, in collaboration with some supermarkets and businesses, ten green containers were placed in ten strategic points in the city, with a capacity of 500 litres each, equipped with special systems designed to prevent the leakage of liquid. Another service dedicated to users is the collection of garden waste at home. The collection of garden waste is a service offered to users free of charge. Valore Ambiente provides the toll-free number to reserve the collection of bulky waste at home. The service is free and is reserved to domestic users, and envisages one call-out every two months, for a maximum of 5 pieces at a time and 30 pieces throughout the year.

Citizens can report a request for operation through the website. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 58 GROUP'S BUSINESS 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 59 The management of public utility services represents a complex element of management that requires the constant maintenance of delicate balances and continuous innovation to pursue the objectives of effectiveness, efficiency, economy, transparency, technical and economic feasibility, set by Italian Legislative Decree 152/2006 in accordance with the principles of precaution, prevention, sustainability. The Group aims to guarantee the highest quality of the offered services, minimising the possibility of failure and aiming to eliminate, or at least minimise, malfunctions and/or inefficiencies. This quality and level of service is achieved thanks to an infrastructure network closely related to the territory, which guarantees speed and control of the service. In order to better illustrate this link between the Company and the territory, the main technological systems owned by the Group and its investees are listed below: Storage facilities: o Monte Crocetta, with operational head office in Strada Monte Crocetta, is a storage, sorting and recovery facility of urban waste collected in the Municipality of Vicenza together with other smaller quantities of waste from other adjacent municipalities. o Casale, with operational head office in Strada Casale, is a storage facility with selection and sorting of green waste CE200201 from the sorted waste collection of the Municipality of Vicenza o Strada Caperse in Vicenza is a preliminary storage facility for urban waste prior to treatment, which has been active since August 2018 when it replaced the former Biron di Sopra site Landfills: o Grumolo delle Abbadesse: landfill operational since 1999 for special non-hazardous urban waste and solid urban waste; there is a plant for the recovery of the Biogas produced by the old plots of farmland, under the management of Valore Ambiente, with a rated total capacity of 905 kW. o Sandrigo: post-operating landfill located in Masona, where supervisory, environmental monitoring and maintenance activities are carried out. o Lonigo: landfill of non-hazardous waste in “post-operating” phase since 2010 located in Fossalunga where supervisory, environmental monitoring and maintenance activities are carried out. A photovoltaic plant is operational. o Legnago (VR) landfill, located in Torretta for non-hazardous waste with a selection and bio-stabilisation plant. A Biogas energy recovery plant is operational. Treatment facilities: o Sandrigo: lightweight multi-material selection and sorting facility from sorted waste collection, light plastic and metal packaging and recovery of special non-hazardous waste from productive operations. o Grosseto: landfill leachate purification system with reverse osmosis process, with adjoining photovoltaic plant o Collection centres: 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 60 o West Recycling Centre: located in Via Fornaci o North Recycling Centre: located in Via De Faveri o South Recycling Centre: located in Via Venier o Pio X Recycling Centre: located in Via Giuriato ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES Material aspects  SORTED WASTE COLLECTION  CREATION OF SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL VALUE The AIM Group, through the companies of the Group, offers a series of environmental services, such as waste collection and management, urban health and maintenance of urban decorum. Through the company Valore Ambiente, the Group manages the collection, recovery and disposal of solid urban waste and the cleaning of public streets and pavements in the municipality of Vicenza. SIT Spa (Società Igiene Territorio) operates in the environmental hygiene sector, where it collects and transports urban waste providing urban health services and ancillary services to local authorities and environmental management companies, and operating waste treatment, disposal and storage facilities. Moreover, the SIT Group consolidates the company TRE V AMBIENTE S.r.l. on a line-byline basis. The company was established for, and operates mainly in, the marketing of services for the management of special hazardous and non-hazardous waste from local and national artisan and industrial activities. The structure deals with the entire management chain in terms of technicallegislative advisory services and all the implicit and consequent actions, which are divided into two macro-activities. The first one responds to requests for specific action by means of inspections aimed at waste recognition, identification and classification. These activities are guaranteed by the commercial structure which, on the basis of the information acquired in situ, the activities and the use of the raw materials that generated the waste, takes a representative sample of the same and then submits it to analytical tests required by law, which determine its specific identity. All operations are guaranteed by the high level of professionalism and the legal classification of TRE V as a company listed in the Register of Environmental Management Companies, certified in accordance with the UNI EN 14001 Environmental standard, and through a careful and strict selection of suppliers, which entails the assumption of any liability, including criminal liability. The second macro-activity consists in constantly monitoring market needs and critical issues with the aim of responding to the entrepreneurial fabric as a determining stakeholder in all sustainability processes. The continuous transformation and modernisation of production processes generates types of waste that often cannot be dealt with efficiently in the plants in the local territory, or that in any case need appropriate technical-structural modifications in order to manage and pursue the virtuous recovery of waste fractions instead of merely disposing of them, also in compliance with the fundamental principles of the Consolidated Law on the Environment and EU regulations. Therefore, TRE V acts as an observatory of the market demand/supply trends, in order to search for possible solutions, preferentially as regards the structural availability within the Group, also proposing initiatives aimed at adapting existing structures. The intention to provide timely responses to market conditions means that, in addition to enhancing the 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 61 value of the Group’s internal economic advantages, AIM is increasingly and markedly confirming its decisive role as guarantor of the environment and the community. SIT Spa’s investees include LESE (Legnago landfill), AGRILUX (technological plant producing electricity from organic waste), FUTURA (physical and biological treatment plant for unsorted waste and quality composting). Since 2011, S.I.A. S.r.l. (Società Intercomunale Ambiente), controlled by the C.I.A.T. Consortium, which brings together 45 Municipalities in the Province of Vicenza, including the Municipality of Vicenza itself, and an investee of Valore Ambiente, has been managing the construction and operation of the landfill at Grumolo delle Abbadesse, equipped with a system for collecting and exploiting energy from the produced biogas4. Waste management is governed by Italian Legislative Decree no. 152/2006 the Environmental Decree (Articles 177 et seq.) and by Veneto Region Law no. 52/12. AIM manages waste in accordance with the philosophy of prevention, preparation for reuse, recycling, other forms of recovery (for example, the recovery of energy), and disposal, according to the guidelines outlined by the Parliament on the Circular Economy already presented by the European Commission on 2 December 2015, and approved in April 2018 that set the following objectives:  Recycle 55% of urban waste by 2025, 65% by 2030; 75% by 2035;  Reduce landfilling to 10% by 2035. 4 It should be noted that the economic responsibility lies with S.I.A. for the part relating to the expansion, while with regard to the already existing lot, this lies with Valore Ambiente. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 62 AIM's commitment to the creation and development of a sustainable business has always been one of the founding and most important pillars of the group's strategy. Today, the creation of value also passes through the adoption of a sustainable economic model, in which the flows of materials are reused in subsequent production cycles, according to the principles of circular economy, minimising the amount of waste. This approach requires a constant and continuous commitment as well as an organisation as refined and coordinated as possible to increase the efficiency of each phase of transformation. A waste management system aimed solely at sorted waste collection and recycling of material, which is certainly necessary, is no longer sufficient. It is necessary to go further. There is a need to promote waste reduction and to encourage and develop the preparation of such waste for its reuse. Reuse means using an object or material again for its own original purpose or for similar purposes without significantly altering its physical form. In principle, it will become increasingly necessary for publicly-owned companies such as AIM to make efforts not only in response to the needs of private users but also to introduce waste produced by local production activities into the same virtuous supply chain. The statistical data periodically published by the ARPAV Observatory indicates that industrial waste accounts for 60% of all waste produced by the Veneto region, which is mostly managed by private companies that do not always meet the requirements of transparency and virtuosity. This means that industrial waste is often diverted to destinations outside the region or even abroad due to market opportunities, losing a part of the economies of scale that could be enjoyed by the territory and its citizens. In the last five years, the market and the available resources for the recovery and/or disposal of industrial waste have fluctuated greatly due to the lack of plants in the area and the devaluation of secondary raw materials, the latter mostly linked to the saturation on Asian markets, where precious materials such as paper and plastics have been delivered for years due to private-enterprise market opportunities. It will therefore be necessary to set up a strategic technical and economic panel for discussions with trade associations (Confindustria, artisans associations, etc.) in consultation with the Region and the Ministry of Economic Development, and the compulsory National Consortia, in order to develop a “Marshall Plan” for the efficient use of waste at global level in support of citizens but also of the companies where the citizens actually work. Since the entry into force of Legislative Decree 36/2003 in implementation of the EU directive on the promotion of energy recovery from waste instead of its disposal, Italy, unlike the other EU countries, has not complied with the above provisions, leaving itself open to heavy penalties every year, which added to the increase in costs for each citizen and company exponentially increase national production costs, in fact putting the country at a disadvantage compared to the global market. Therefore, initiatives should be encouraged in order to provide correct and accurate information, including scientific information, to the whole community and to institutional bodies to pursue consistently the highest goals for the benefit of citizens, the territory and the country in the wider EU and global contexts. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 63 INITIATIVES TO PROMOTE A CULTURE OF REUSE  COLLECTION CENTRES As part of the planned activities for the management of the various Municipal Collection centres (Recycling centres), the activity of intercepting reusable items from the waste flow is now well established. This activity, launched in 2013 with the operational experimentation of the PRISCA project, also allowed in 2019 over 203 tons of items to be prepared for reuse. Table 174. Quantity of waste for reuse (t) 2019 2018 2017 used clothing 66.77 47.58 56.54 furniture and bulky items 120.85 115.04 91.53 electrical appliances 15.65 19.52 38.35 Total 203.27 182.14 186.42 Table 174 – Quantity of waste reused through the PRISCA Project  THE COLLABORATION WITH INSIEME COOPERATIVA SOCIALE Directive (EU) 851/2018 in force since 04/07/2018 reiterates the provisions of Directive 98/2008 on the hierarchy of waste management: Figure 7 – Insieme Cooperativa Sociale 1. Prevention; 2. Preparation for reuse; 3. Recycling; 4. Other recovery operation; 5. Disposal. In Vicenza, Valore Ambiente, which manages the urban waste recycling chain, is actively involved with Cooperativa Sociale Insieme for a form of waste management that gives precedence, where possible, to reuse over recycling. In order to transform the idea into a concrete act, Insieme has created the Smart Reuse Park, a network of structures and relationships between institutions and private, public and social companies. These smart reuse parks can exploit waste that is still usable and return it to the secondhand products chain, starting from where the waste has its regulatory origin, the collection centre. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 64 Since the end of October, project visits have been planned for 14 schools with over 50 classes and more than 800 pupils involved. The offered environmental hygiene services Municipality of Vicenza The Municipality of Vicenza where Valore Ambiente operates covers a total area of 80.46 km2 and a catchment area of 110,944 inhabitants and a total of 62,718 users, 7,729 of whom are non-domestic users. The method of collection is diversified based on the real nature of the territory and the characterisation of the users, in particular supplementary home services for specific types of waste are active for nondomestic users. Four areas were identified:  Outer areas: the municipal area beyond the outer ring road (Via del Sole, Diaz, Verme, Cricoli, Quadri) comprising the outer neighbourhoods and surrounding villages with low population density.  Inner areas-boundary area: the municipal area situated between the outer ring road and the inner ring road (Viale Milano, Mazzini, d’Alviano, Rodolfi, Legione Galieno, Margherita) comprising the most densely populated neighbourhoods.  City centre area: the area inside the inner ring road.  Monumental area: the monumental zone of the city centre, of greater architectural value. Figure 8 shows the method of collection activated according to the position of each user. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 65 Figure 81 – Waste collection system implemented according to the position of the served users The waste collection system utilised by 62,718 users of Valore Ambiente during the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 is subdivided as follows into different types of waste collection: Year 2019 2018 2017 Type of collection Paper Plastic Residual Paper Plastic Residual Paper Plastic Residual Roadside rubbish 42,873 42,873 9,108 42,641 42,641 9,012 42,487 42,487 8,996 containers/bins Door-to-door 19,845 19,845 19,845 19,737 19,737 19,737 19,683 19,683 19,683 collection Cylinder depository system with 0 0 33,765 0 0 33,629 0 0 33,491 magnetic key operated covers Table 185 – Collection services offered by the AIM Group Compared to the number of containers used for the collection of solid urban waste in the threeyear period from 2017 to 2019, the figures are now stabilising, subsequent to the gradual increase in the number of home pick-up containers and the concurrent reduction in the number of roadside containers from previous years, as a direct consequence of the reorganised waste collection, which has seen a progressive increase in door-to-door collection, as can be seen in Table 19. That said, in 2019, the tons of solid urban waste collected amounted to 70,868.509, increasing by 2.06% compared to the result in 2018 (Table 20).

The service covers the collection from large settlements, which are basically of two types: 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 66  institutional users represented by barracks, institutes, cohabitations, schools, hospitals  authorised production users. In 2019, sorted waste collection stood at 76.10%, slightly higher than the result achieved in the previous year (75.4%). The solid urban waste collected per capita amounts to 638 kg, which corresponds to an average daily collection of 1.7 kg/day, of which 1.3 kg derive from sorted waste collection.

The residual waste with respect to the sorted waste collection is treated at the mechanical treatment plant of Monte Crocetta and sent to the two final plants of the area, namely the Schio Waste-to-Energy Plant, not owned by AIM, and the landfill at Grumolo delle Abbadesse operated by the investee S.I.A. S.r.l. Services for the city Street hygiene is necessary for the decorum and cleaning of streets and public areas, and is a constant commitment of AIM Ambiente towards the territory of the municipality of Vicenza. Street cleaning and hygiene services are carried out exclusively in public areas, or private areas for public use, within the territory of the Municipality of Vicenza. The services offered by Valore Ambiente include: • sweeping the streets (mechanically or manually) indispensable for the urban health and decorum of the city, for the cleaning of streets, squares and pavements. The frequency of manual and mechanical street sweeping is defined according to the characteristics of the area, vehicle traffic and use. The current organisation includes Sunday activities, both morning and afternoon, as well as night time during the week. Manual sweeping activities also include emptying the wastepaper bins, replacing the bag and replenishing the dog waste shovel dispensers. The road area subject to manual sweeping is 376 km, while the mechanically-treated network is 245 km; • street washing, normally active in the period from March to November, when the weather conditions make it possible to ensure the safety of road traffic, to assist the activity of manual and mechanical sweeping for cleaning and hygiene of public streets and pavements. It takes place during the night in the monumental area, and during the day in the areas outside the city centre including rainy days. The activity structured as above is a real sanitisation of the public streets and pavements as it combines the three basic activities: manual and mechanical sweeping and street washing. The road area subject to road washing is 245 km; • cleaning of municipal parks and gardens including regular emptying of waste-paper bins. The frequency of service provision depends on the location and use of the site; the current 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 68 programme envisages service provision at least once every fifteen days, and as often as daily if necessary. • high-pressure water cleaning is an indispensable addition to standard cleaning procedures, and is used to treat important, architecturally prestigious sites, or particular situations of decay, and to rid surfaces of excreta and guano; • collection of leaves, performed using small and large mechanical or vacuum auto-sweepers, operated by workers who either manually, or with the aid of blowers, move the leaves from the roadsides and pavements towards the area where the sweepers are operating, and if necessary using a truck fitted with leaf-vacuuming equipment; • weeding, managed on behalf of the municipal administration, three times a year, through manual and mechanical systems by using a ‘vapodiserbo’ (steaming of weeds), a natural system for the elimination of weeds. The service includes weeding of the roadsides, pavements and the edges of traffic islands along the entire length of the city's road network for a distance of approximately 650 km; • eco-mobile or mobile recycling centre; this is a kind of skip, equipped for the delivery of seven types of special waste. The skip is placed daily in the vicinity of the local markets. In addition to the practical function of waste collection, it acts as a means of communication for the community thanks to the presence of an operator. Other urban health services Through SIT Spa, the Group collects waste in two municipalities in the Vicenza area (Bolzano Vicentino and Costabissara) and one in the Verona area (San Bonifacio), which together have a population of 35,000. 11,868 users were served in 2019, and a total of over 12,500 tons of waste was collected (Table 29). By distributing the amount of waste over the population served, it can be seen that in 2019, 352 kg/inhabitant were collected, in line with the result obtained in 2018 (349 kg). 3,508 tons of waste, amounting to 28% of the total waste collected, were landfilled. The overall percentage of sorted waste of the Municipalities served by the company SIT in 2019 exceeds 76%, a value that is particularly relevant considering the national average value. SIT also carries out in support of the marketing activities of TRE V AMBIENTE a service for the micro collection of special non-hazardous waste in the province, with recovery and disposal in thirdparty facilities. The treatment of waste Material recovery facilities AIM, through its subsidiary Valore Ambiente, also carries out waste treatment activities on behalf of other municipalities, thanks to the use of the Monte Crocetta and Caperse transfer plants, for the treatment and recovery of bulky waste, soils from sweeping activities and organic waste. The amount of waste treated for the other municipalities is 3,085 tons, with an increase of 20% compared to the previous year. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 69 Quantity Unsorted waste (in tons) Unsorted residual 2,962.6 UNSORTED Total 2,962.6 Quantity Sorted waste (in tons) bulky waste to be disposed of 91.7 sweeping waste to be disposed of 453.7 paper 764.1 glass 534.4 organic 3,339.9 garden waste 1,603.80 mixed packaging 1,254.4 other plastic 4.2 wood 536.4 Non-hazardous metal 33 clothing 0 market waste 0 vegetable oils 0 tyres 7.4 pharmaceuticals 4.1 mineral oils 0 batteries 3 Total non-hazardous waste 8,630.1 paints and varnish 0 toxic and flammable containers 0 Hazardous spray canisters 3.2 Total hazardous waste 3.2 bulky waste to be recovered 438.4 sweeping waste to be recovered 0 Other household compost 0 IT waste 0 Total other 438.4 fire extinguishers 0 Debris inert waste (rubble, etc.) 507.75 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 70 Total debris 507.7 TOTAL SORTED 9,579.4 Table 29 – Waste treated by SIT in 2019 Collection centres The four recycling centres are at the service of all domestic users for the correct disposal of bulky and recyclable waste5. The recycling centres take in 13.8% of collected waste, representing an increase over the result achieved in 2018 (8.3%); more than 85% of waste is recovered, and only 14.45% is disposed of as unsorted waste. The adoption of the systems of door-to-door collection and nearby bin collection (cylinder depository system) has strongly encouraged sorted waste collection, and has thus led to an increase in the recovery of bulky waste, largely recoverable and recyclable through treatments carried out in recycling centres. 2019 2018 2017 West in Via Fornaci 6,034.9 5,466.8 4,645.8 North in Via De Faveri 3,239.3 3,099.8 3,083.1 South in Via Venier 312.47 314.9 2,075.0 Pio X 192.60 146.4 21.4 Total 9,779.27 9,027.9 8,025.2 Table 30 – Tons of waste treated in the Group’s recycling facilities in 2019 5 Including: sheets of glass; plastic, paper and cardboard objects and containers; wood; garden waste; iron scrap; furniture; books and items of furnishing; car batteries; vegetable and mineral oils, etc. possible disposal of limited quantities of inert materials, electrical appliances and other durable goods, neon lamps and energy-saving light bulbs, tyres, and cartridges and toner for printers. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 71 2019 2018 2017 Recovery6 Disposal7 Recovery Disposal Recovery Disposal West Recycling 86.1% 13.9% 86.8% 13.2% 87.4% 12.6% Centre North Recycling 85.4% 14.6% 85.7% 14.3% 86.4% 13.6% Centre South Recycling 83.5% 16.5% 83.6% 16.4% 82.8% 17.2% Centre Pio X Recycling 73.6% 26.4% 71.0% 29.0% 62.2% 37.8% centre Total 85.55% 14.45% 86.1% 13.9% 86.8% 13.2% Table 31 – Tons of waste treated in the Group’s recycling facilities in 2019 Landfills The AIM Group, also through its subsidiaries, manages 4 landfills located in the Municipalities of Lonigo (VI), Grumolo delle Abbadesse (VI), Sandrigo (VI) and Strillaie (GR). A system of recovery and exploitation of biogas produced by the stabilisation of stored waste is active in one of these facilities (Grumolo delle Abbadesse); it is used for the generation of electricity (which amounted to 3.45 GWh in 2019), thus allowing the exploitation of the resource and reducing the emission of these greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. At the landfills of Lonigo, Sandrigo and Strillaie, there are three photovoltaic parks for the production of electricity introduced into the network. In the Fossalunga (Lonigo) landfill, there was a biogas extraction facility that produced electricity, but it ceased operation in 2017 following a sharp and progressive reduction in the concentration of methane content in the biogas. The photovoltaic plant installed at this site remains in operation and, in 2019, it generated 936,746 GJ of energy, 99.7% of which was transferred to the network. At the Sandrigo site, within the plastic and metal packaging treatment plant, there is a photovoltaic power generation system which in 2019 produced 145,925 kWh. At the Strillaie (GR) site, on the roof of the leachate purification plant there is a photovoltaic plant, which produced 87,561 kWh of energy in 2019. 6 Recovery refers to any operation the main result of which is to permit the waste to have a useful role to play, by replacing other materials that would have been used otherwise to perform a specific function, or to prepare such waste in order that it may perform such function, inside the facility or in the economy in general. The waste to be recovered is separated into the various supply chains, and is then sent to the various recovery plants on the basis of the type of waste. 6 Any operation other than recovery, including when the operation has the recovery of substances or energy as a secondary consequence. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 72 NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE Material aspects  PROTECTION OF THE TERRITORY The gas sector is governed by Italian Legislative Decree no. 164/2000 (the “Letta Decree”), which launched the deregulation of the national gas system. The methane gas distribution service involves transporting the raw material over the local gas pipeline network, which Servizi a Rete S.r.l. operates in the Municipality of Vicenza and in certain adjacent Municipalities, as concession holder, and in Treviso on the basis of a service agreement with AIM Vicenza S.p.A, the concession holder, for the delivery of gas to end users. Operations consist in two phases: the pick-up of gas from Snam Rete Gas’ pipelines through first-stage pick-up points, followed by its transport and distribution to end users. Gas distribution As regards the proprietary infrastructure used, the total development of the gas network in 2019 is equal to 1,479 km. The infrastructure for the distribution of gas resources is made of different materials, the choice of which comes from technological and performance requirements.

As can be seen, in 2019 the investments in the modernisation of the infrastructure network also involved the updating of the meters with the installation of a total of 34,570 new electronic units (56.10% of all the electronic units installed). Electronic meters now account for 43.57% of installed meters. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 74 2019 2018 2017 NONNONNONACTIVE TOTAL ACTIVE TOTAL ACTIVE TOTAL ACTIVE ACTIVE ACTIVE Traditional 73,127 6,691 79,818 106,883 6,688 113,652 126,988 7,123 134,111 meters Electronic 60,749 869 61,618 26,820 303 27,123 6,667 113 6,780 meters Total number of 133,876 7,560 141,436 133,703 6,991 140,685 133,655 7,236 140,891 meters of which the following numbers 34,616 0 34,616 22,056 0 22,056 6,017 0 6,017 were installed during the year Table 245 – Active and non-active meters in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 One of the elements that has the greatest impact on the environment and on safety during normal operation of the gas distribution service is certainly the dispersion of methane gas in the atmosphere. Methane gas, which is naturally odourless and colourless, is constantly odorised in the collection and metering plants, through a controlled and tested procedure, so that humans can smell it in the event of a leak or of accidental use, and thus limit the risk of harmful or dangerous phenomena. It represents both a dangerous element because of its flammability, and a polluting element because of the high holding power of the terrestrial infra-red radiation, which classifies it as a greenhouse gas. For these reasons, notwithstanding the fact that the quantity of gas lost to the atmosphere is negligible compared to the total amount introduced into the network, the containment and resolution of the problem of gas losses represent the main aim on which the safety, quality and continuity of the service are based. In order to monitor these risks, the principal monitoring systems distributed are remote control systems that monitor the distribution system’s key parameters, and the alarm systems that discourage or give warning of intentional acts. Moreover, planned checks are constantly made for any gas leaks from piping, together with the routine and extraordinary maintenance of the networks. White Certificates (ARERA resolution) The White Certificates or Energy Efficiency Certificates (EEC) are tradable securities that certify the energy savings achieved in end uses of energy, implementing measures to increase energy efficiency. The promotion of energy savings through the system of the White Certificates was provided for by the Ministerial Decrees of 20 July 2004 (Ministerial Decree 20/7/2004 on electricity, Ministerial Decree 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 75 20/7/2004 on gas, as amended). They represent an incentive designed at European level for the achievement of the primary energy reduction targets set in the “20-20-20 Climate and Energy” package following the Kyoto Protocol, that is to say:  reducing CO2 emissions by 20%;  increasing the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 20%;  moving towards a 20% increase in energy efficiency. Distributors of electricity and natural gas are expected to meet certain targets each year in terms of energy savings, measurable in Tonnes of Oil equivalent (TOE) saved; each white certificate is equivalent to savings of one tonne of oil equivalent. Servizi a Rete S.r.l. is an obligated party with regard to both the gas sector and the electricity sector, and each year has always met its own set targets through its support for the modernisation, the rationalisation and the reduction in energy consumption in the various sectors. In the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, ARERA (former AEEGSI) assigned the following white certificates to Servizi a Rete, which for the sake of completeness were broken down by sector: 2019 2018 2017 Gas 22,464 19,836 18,977 Energy 5,776 5,346 5,015 Total 28,240 25,182 23,992 Table 25 – White certificates awarded to Servizi a Rete 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 76 ELECTRICITY MANAGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICE Material aspects  PRODUCTION OF ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES The entire supply chain of the electricity market is composed of 5 phases: Generation, Wholesale, Transmission, Distribution and Metering, and Retail operations to end customers. The AIM Group, through the Energy Division of Servizi a Rete S.r.l. is mainly concerned with the transformation and distribution of electricity throughout the Municipality of Vicenza and public lighting service in the Municipality of Vicenza. Moreover, the Group, through its holding company AIM Vicenza, manages a number of electricity generation plants. Generation of electricity On 27/12/2017, Servizi a Rete s.r.l. transferred its electricity generation business unit to Aziende Industriali Municipali S.p.a. The generation of electricity in 2019 was 216,231 GJ (Table 37) from plants owned by the AIM Group, of which 3.72% was generated from renewable sources. The details on the production of energy from the Group’s plants and on that consumed for their operation are shown in Table 38 and Table 39. 2019 2018 2017 Total non-renewable sources, of 208,198 166,716 244,661 which Thermoelectric Mincio Power Plant8 185,213 139,134 211,963 Cogeneration Cricoli Power Plant 22,985 27,612 32,698 Total renewable sources, of which: 8,033 7,344 6,998 Hydroelectric Lobia Local Plant 1,095 612 762 8 Data obtained from internal surveys, pending confirmation by A2A, the majority shareholder. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 77 Group’s photovoltaic plants 6,938 6,732 6,236 Total electricity produced (GJ) 216,231 174,420 251,659 Table 26 – Electricity produced in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 (in GJ) from sources owned by the AIM Group 2019 2018 2017 Energy consumed for the operation of 6,499 4,835 6,228 the plants Electricity consumed as a percentage 3% 2.82% 2.47% of the total produced9 Table 38 – Electricity consumed in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 (in GJ) by sources owned by the AIM Group The Mincio Thermoelectric Power Plant, jointly owned with the companies AGSM of Verona, A2A of Milan and Dolomiti Energia, is the principal source of electric power for AIM (which owns a 5% share in the plant). The Lobia Local Hydroelectric Plant, which is owned by AIM Vicenza Spa and operated by Servizi a Rete, draws on a diversion from the Bacchiglione River to produce green electricity. In 2019 output increased by 75.01% compared to the same period in 2018. The reduced production capacity (in absolute terms) stems from the collapse in 2013 of part of the masonry structure of the Bacchiglione River intake system, which effectively limited the water flow that could be used for generation of hydroelectric power. The lower output also reflects the machinery maintenance shut-down, which is constantly increasing due to the old age of the plant The electricity produced but not consumed was sold to GSE under the relevant agreement and with specific withdrawal. The production of electricity from sources not belonging to the AIM Group, but connected to the Group’s network, subdivided according to source, in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, is as follows in GJ.

In addition, there are plans for the next phase of the public lighting service and for the operation and maintenance for a period of 15 years. The Concessions acquired, one of which in the Province of Vicenza, 16 in the Province of Padua and 22 in the Province of Belluno, will involve the replacement of the entire set of lamps during 2020 and 2021.

The district heating service project goes back to 1980, when a market survey involving the entire city of Vicenza was conducted, regarding the consumption of thermal energy for heating and hot water purposes. Studies developed by AIM, in the framework of the initiatives for the rational use of energy, as per Italian Law 308/1983, had found favourable conditions for the implementation of a district heating system powered by cogeneration, based on gas engines. The existence of a powerful geothermal reservoir in the deep subsoil of the city of Vicenza (from 1,500 m to 2,100 m) resulted from the geological-mining picture of the area, as previously acquired by the company Agip during the oil exploration activity carried out in the Po Valley. After agreement with AIM, the Agip-Enel Joint Venture decided to drill a well in the area identified by AIM to locate the district heating plant, with the aim of using the geothermal resource, clean and renewable, to replace and integrate the cogenerated heat fed into the distribution network. In 1983, Saipem drilled the geothermal well for the AGIP-ENEL joint venture. The construction of the district heating system, approved by the Municipality of Vicenza in the mideighties, began in the summer of 1988 and the system was started in 1990. The network was 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 81 developed starting from the area of Viale Cricoli, the headquarters of the production plant, towards the city centre. To meet increased heating requirements, the power plant was upgraded in 1997 with the installation of two new cogenerators, commissioned in 2000, and a new boiler in 2008, thus bringing the rated capacity of the plant to produce electrical power up to 4.5 MW, and its capacity to produce thermal power up to 29 MW. In 2011, the second reserve and integration thermal production pole was activated in Via Monte Zebio in Vicenza following the expansion of the city's district heating network. The data relating to the district heating infrastructure and equivalent apartments served in the threeyear period from 2017 to 2019 are shown in the table: 2019 2018 2017 Length of network (km) 23.09 22.53 22.53 Thermal energy to end 140,724 143,856 155,016 customers (GJ) Electricity introduced into 22,968 27,612 0 the network (GJ) equivalent apartments11 11,594 11,308 11,290 (no.) residential type (%) 28.34 28.19 28.07 11 Residential housing unit with trading area and volume of 80 m2 and 224 m3, respectively. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 82 service sector type (%) 71.66 71.81 71.93 heated volume (m3) 2,597,000 2,533,000 2,529,000 residential type (m3) 736,000 714,000 710,000 service sector type (m3) 1,861,000 1,819,000 1,819,000 Equivalent inhabitants 24,579 23,933 served by district heating12 Table 316 – District Heating in 2017 2019 28.34% of the buildings connected to the service in 2019 were of a residential type, while 71.66% (table above) were of the service-sector type. The total user volume heated at the end of 2019 was 2.6 million m3 (table above); a total of 24,579 inhabitants13 were connected to district heating. In 2019, 200,171 GJ of primary energy were consumed14, which, compared to the energy that would have been consumed with a traditional plant, led to a saving of 670 GJ. This saving in consumption resulted in a mitigation of the carbon footprint related to the activity of district heating, which in 2019 emitted 793 tCO2eq. AIM clearly highlights the concepts of sustainability and industrial excellence by directing the production system to energy transition as envisaged under the objectives of the European Commission and national regulations. It is worth noting that in 2019, as a result of the public tender procedure launched by the Veneto Region in 2017, a 30-year geothermal concession was awarded to AIM Vicenza SpA. This energy is considered renewable and is excellent for heating and domestic hot water production. Moreover, the Vicenza City Council approved the agreement for surface rights in the Cricoli area with a term of 30 years. The agreement was signed on 1 July 2019. The objective is to design the service for geothermal production to reach 50% of heat generated from renewable sources, while extending the district heating service to other areas in the city. 12 Evaluated on the basis of the average number of members of a family for each equivalent apartment equal to 2.12 inhabitants (ISTAT, 2019) (A1-A5). 13 Considering the average number of inhabitants per housing unit in the city of Vicenza, published by ISTAT. 14 The method used to calculate emissions and energy savings derives from District heating , Yearbook 2018, published by AIRU and ENEA. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 83 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND REMOTE MANAGEMENT SERVICE Material aspects  QUALITY AND RELIABILITY OF THE SERVICE  EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT Servizi a Rete S.r.l. designs and lays optical fibre networks in the Municipality of Vicenza. The infrastructure is mainly used by the Companies of the Group to create broadband connections between their head offices and their facilities, and by the Municipal Administration for similar connections among municipal offices and for city video surveillance. Moreover, the network is used in the dark fibre mode by national telecommunications operators in order to provide private and business customers with telephone and IT broad-band FTTC and FTTH connectivity. The launch of the Telecommunications Service and its mission were decided by the Municipal Administration of Vicenza when, with Resolution No. 180 of 4 June 2001, it entrusted AIM with the activities of coordinating above-ground and underground operations for the excavation, laying and management of structures for the installation of telecommunications networks within the Municipality of Vicenza, with the aim of entrusting a single entity with the planning, design, construction, maintenance and management of technological systems. The Municipal Administration’s intention was primarily to reduce the impact on the city and its inhabitants due to the excavation work for the laying of telecommunications infrastructure by assigning this task to a single entity. The assignment of this task to AIM Spa, already a major player in the management of underground networks in the city of Vicenza, allowed the city to enjoy in recent years the sustainable development of optical fibre networks and highly reliable telecommunications services thanks to the coordination entrusted to AIM for underground works. In fact, in the design and execution of the laying of new optical fibres, it has been possible to make use of existing cable conduits of other company networks for cable routing, particularly low voltage electricity networks, reducing the need for new excavations. Network maintenance and fault repair activities have also benefited from the availability of the emergency fault management facilities of the gas, electricity and water networks, which provide high service levels. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 84 From an infrastructural point of view, the telecommunications network employed is generally of the ring variety, thus reducing to a minimum any inefficiencies due to faults. The network management service, intended as marketing and maintenance, is carried out by the ICT Services of AIM Vicenza Spa. The ICT Services of AIM Vicenza Spa manage optical fibre connections among various company offices, and on the computer systems adopted to safeguard the technological network used to monitor and control operations. The response service is available for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The optical fibre laid in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 is shown in Table 32. 2019 2018 2017 Km of optical fibre laid 228 225 221 Network nodes and terminal points 366 359 355 managed Vodafone cabins 226 226 226 Table 327 – Development of the optical infrastructure in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 Cybersecurity and personal data protection The telecommunications network of AIM Vicenza Spa has a special feature that distinguishes it from other similar networks. It is in fact a fully private network that connects the various users in point-topoint mode, i.e. employing one optical fibre for each user point. This allows completely isolated data 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 85 transmission within the network in order to guarantee a very high level of security and confidentiality of the transmitted communications and data. Projects for technological innovation Thanks to the cooperation between AIM Vicenza and TIM Telecom Italia S.p.a., regarding experimentation for installing 5G radio stations, the experimentation, research and development operations in relation to the Internet of Things (IoT) continued with the aim of boosting the creation of a next-generation radio network designed to provide Vicenza with a range of advanced services, thus rendering it a smarter city. On this point, in 2018 an experimental project (POC Proof of Concept) was completed concerning the application of “Smart City” technologies in certain processes managed by company services, such as the monitoring of parking, temperatures inside buildings (offices, schools, public residential units), filling of waste containers and traffic light failures. The aim of the project was to verify the potential of these instruments for reducing the operating costs of the services and for increasing the quality of the service provided. The positive results achieved by the POC induced some Group companies to start a transformation of the project from an experimental application to actual service provision during 2019. In particular, the LoRaWAN radio coverage for communication with IoTs has been stabilised, extending it geographically to certain sites of interest to the Companies. Additional sensors have been acquired to meet the needs of Valore Città AMCPS in the field of smart buildings, and in particular in the monitoring of temperature in school buildings and public residential units with the aim of preventing situations of discomfort due to the malfunctioning of heating plants or structural defects in buildings (e.g. unsuitable doors and windows, inadequate systems, etc.). 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 86 In addition, the Remote Management and Automation functional area sees to:  the supervision, 24 hours a day and 365 days a year, of key technological facilities such as the electricity, gas and water distribution networks;  the construction and maintenance of various remote monitoring and control facilities;  the management of radio-communications systems;  the checking and calibration of “electronic measuring transmitters” and “measuring instruments”;  the management of various alarms. In 2019, it managed:  546 remote-controlled technological systems  18,615 reporting points  5,132 controllable points  4,671 measuring points The “reporting” points are devices installed in distribution and other facilities, designed to report information on the state of the facility. “Controllable” points are devices that may be remotely controlled, without the need to be on site when one or more physical operations are required. “Measuring” points are devices installed on site, at the facilities, that establish and measure physical parameters. The variations detected at the remote-controlled points are transmitted in real time to the central monitoring systems, where an operator constantly monitors (24/24) the optimal state of equilibrium of the distribution networks, and if necessary promptly carries out any on-site checks required. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 87 CITY MAINTENANCE SERVICES Material aspects  PROTECTION OF THE TERRITORY Valore Città Amcps provides numerous services, some of which are based on the intercompany framework agreement stipulated with AIM Vicenza Spa on 18 June 2010, under which Valore Città Amcps provides for the Holding Company those services it is responsible for under the Global Service concession signed. The services provided by Valore Città Amcps mainly regard the management of Vicenza Municipality’s assets (roads and vertical and horizontal road signage, underpasses and traffic light systems, municipal buildings, including council housing and the corresponding heating plants, municipal parks and gardens, etc.), the carrying out of construction work, and the management of cemetery services. Real Estate Management The management of public residential buildings Valore Città Amcps manages, on behalf of the Municipality of Vicenza, the municipality’s public residential buildings and emergency housing units (Table 47), as well as certain properties/facilities from the non-disposable assets of the Municipality of Vicenza (Table 50). The service concerns the maintenance/repair, renovation and replacement of finishes on public buildings/housing units, the work required to supplement, or maintain the operation of, existing technological systems, and extraordinary maintenance operations involving the renovation or replacement of structural parts. Valore Città Amcps has a sophisticated remote management system with which it remotely controls the operation of heating systems in the main buildings owned by the Municipality, including schools. This technology is capable of optimising consumption on the basis of outside temperatures, and can promptly report any faults or malfunctioning. During 2019, the Company also extended this remote management system to some public residential buildings. 2019 2018 2017 Number of public residential buildings 1,516 1,516 1,533 Number of households present 1,151 1,208 1,236 Number of empty housing units 24.1% 20.3% 17.4% Number of extraordinary maintenance 161 41 43 operations Table 338 – Results of the public residential building service managed by AIM Amcps in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 88 Managed structures 2019 Sports grounds 13 Care facilities 5 Cemeteries 8 Primary schools 25 Nursery schools 30 Middle schools 12 Decentralised offices 10 Museums, libraries, historical buildings 19 Kindergartens 8 Historic palaces 12 Gyms 27 Municipal parks 52 Crematorium 1 Total 222 Table 49 – Main public structures managed by AIM Amcps in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 In its maintenance activities, AIM Valore Città AMCPS has always favoured the use of eco-sustainable materials and products and promoted energy efficiency measures. The most used types are: building insulation (e.g. external thermal insulation, replacement of doors and windows, etc.) improving the performance of the heating systems in buildings (e.g. boilers, heating fixtures, etc.) In 2019, AIM Valore Città Amcps continued with the work undertaken in the previous year with the construction site in “Impresa Civica” between the Municipality of Vicenza, Valore Città AMCPS and Centro Edile A. Palladio, in accordance with the provisions of a specific agreement for the carrying out of maintenance work on the property of the Municipality of Vicenza, with the students of Centro Edile A. Palladio supporting the workforce of VCAMCPS. A dozen students from Centro Edile had the opportunity to carry out the structural redevelopment works of the small chapel in the Non-Catholic Cemetery. This opportunity allowed the students involved to express and develop their skills and knowledge in a real working environment, also through the experience and professionalism that the Valore Città Amcps operational teams shared with the students, and similarly the company teams had the opportunity to work assisted by the new generations. These initiatives allow AIM Amcps to continue on its path of sustainable development and growth linked not only to economic variables but also to social and environmental variables. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 89 Management of road and cycle/pedestrian works The road management service includes the maintenance of the road network, composed of roads owned or used by the municipality, cycle lanes and pavements and paths, public squares, bridges, ditches, storm drains, parking spaces and car parks operated by AIM Mobilità. Routine maintenance regards the tarmacing of potholes and cracks in roads, by means of a system of identification and geo-localisation of potholes, the repair and maintenance of existing pavements, the repair and maintenance of roadside gutters, of sections of permanent paving, and the patching up of road and pavement surfaces. Extraordinary maintenance, on the other hand, concerns the Municipality ordering the laying and alteration of traffic islands and pedestrian precincts, the laying of new road surfaces, the maintenance of bridges, the construction of new sections of road, and the repair of damage from vandalism or accidents. The road signage service deals with the maintenance of the proper working order of vertical and horizontal road signs, luminous signs, directional and monument signs, present within the Municipality, through routine and extraordinary maintenance operations. Also in this case, AIM Amcps carries out routine maintenance operations, in particular with regard to the preservation of the proper working order of road signs, such as the regular re-painting of horizontal signs, the regular control of road signs to ensure that they are clearly visible, the maintenance of luminous road sign systems. At the same time, extraordinary maintenance operations are carried out relating to the installation of new signs, the replacement of signs that are no longer compliant with requirements and the disposal of obsolete and non-compliant signs. 2019 2018 2017 Km of road managed 544 544 540 Number of potholes reported 3,182 4,076 2,726 Km of cycle/pedestrian lanes 65 65 65 managed Number of sign repair operations 417 540 340 Number of audio-signal buttons for 138 138 138 the visually impaired Table 34 – Results of the management service of roads and cycle/pedestrian paths offered by AIM Amcps in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 The management of public parks and gardens The parks and gardens service regards the maintenance of lawns, flower beds, trees and other plants. The parks and gardens service comprises:  care for grassed areas and lawns: cutting, watering, reseeding and over-seeding 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 90  care for bushes, climbers and hedges: the pruning of deadwood and reduction, weeding, replanting and watering  care for flowed beds and green spaces on roundabouts: weeding, mulching, watering, fertilisation, addition of plant varieties  the care and management of trees: pruning of deadwood, topping, reduction, thinning, suckering, putting in and tying plants to stakes, visual monitoring of plants, instrumental monitoring, emergency watering, phytosanitary control, phytosanitary treatment  watering service: emergency watering, watering of lawns, green spaces on roundabouts, flowers, flower beds in general  weeding service: chemical weeding and weeding by hand  irrigation systems service: checking the operation of systems, and turning them on and off. 2019 2018 2017 m2 of parks and gardens 1,148,689 1,148,709 1,141,165 managed Table 51 – Results of the management service of parks and gardens offered by AIM Amcps in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 In order to counter the presence of weeds in those municipal areas under management, the use of weeding methods, such as the flaming or steaming of weeds, continued. This is to pursue the national guidance for “integrated weed control” aiming at a massive reduction of chemical herbicides. Moreover, for mowing and pruning operations the preference is for the use of electrical and/or in any case, technologically-advanced, high-performance equipment and machinery (chainsaws, blowers, hedge trimmers, hedge cutters, strimmers, pole pruners) that minimise the environmental impact of operations, that is, they reduce emissions and fuel and energy consumption, and considerably reduce noise levels to the benefit both of nearby residents and passers-by, and the operators themselves. Funeral and cemetery service management As from 1 January 2000, the Municipality of Vicenza has assigned Valore Città Amcps S.r.l., by means of AIM Vicenza Spa, the management of funeral and cemetery services. The Company is thus responsible, in addition to burial operations, for the routine and extraordinary maintenance of Vicenza’s cemeteries, from the structures themselves to the access roads, during the various phases of design, works management and construction. The Company is also responsible for looking after the green spaces in the cemeteries, such as the flower beds, trees and plants, as well as votive lighting. It also controls the operations of third parties in regard to the cemetery (the transport of coffins, the laying of tombstones, family tombs, etc.). 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 91 Valore Città Amcps provides all of the cemetery services that the law requires the Municipality to provide, the control and coordination of the fitting, removal, preparation of tombstones and votive lighting, the cremation of bodies at the Maggiore cemetery in Vicenza, and burials. The routine maintenance of cemeteries regards the buildings, systems, machinery, tools, land and green spaces, while extraordinary maintenance regards all cemetery properties and is carried out on the basis of specific assignments ordered by the Municipality. All graveyard maintenance services are excluded, as they are the responsibility of the concession holders. Valore Città Amcps also manages the crematorium at the Cimitero Maggiore in Vicenza, which provided the following services in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019: 2019 2018 2017 No. of cremations 2,624 2,178 2,358 Table 352 – Activities of the crematorium managed by AIM Amcps in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 In order to glean the degree of customer satisfaction with the cemetery services offered by AIM Amcps, the first customer satisfaction survey was conducted at the end of 2018. The service received a good/excellent rating from more than 83% of the voting users (205 in total) with an average of 3.93 on a scale of 1 to 5, which conveys a very good level of satisfaction from the user base. This survey, on the basis of the Services Charter drawn up by the Municipality of Vicenza, must be carried out every two years. ISO 14000 Certification AIM Valore Città Amcps initiated some time ago a programme of sustainable development and growth linked not only to economic variables but also to social and environmental ones, both in terms of awareness and care in carrying out its activities, as well as in terms of guarantees for stakeholders and legislative compliance. With this in mind, the process was begun for obtaining the UNI EN ISO 14000:2015 Certification – international environmental standard. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 92 CAR PARKS AND CAR PARKING SERVICES Material aspects  PROTECTION OF THE TERRITORY Since 2009, AIM Mobilità S.r.l. has managed ground-level and underground car parks, and also free and pay parking areas, in the city of Vicenza. These operations come within the scope of the “Global Service” concession that the parent company, AIM Vicenza Spa, signed with the Municipality of Vicenza on 23 November 2009, resulting in the assignment of only the parking management business to the company AIM Mobilità S.r.l. On 25 February 2016, AIM Mobilità S.r.l. and FTV Spa assigned their respective transport businesses to SVT S.r.l., the balance sheet results of which reveal the following equity investments: a 34.66% stake held by AIM Mobilità S.r.l.; a 65.34% stake held by FTV Spa. Since 1 March 2016, as a result of the assignment of the Local Public Transport business unit to SVT S.r.l., AIM Mobilità has only managed the car parking service. AIM Mobilità S.r.l. has thus continued to manage the car parking service within the Municipality of Vicenza, on behalf of AIM Vicenza Spa, this being a service under concession that is part of Global Service, by carrying out the following activities:  the management of pay barrier car parks, and street-level car parks (parking spaces marked by blue lines are for pay-by-the-hour parking, while those marked by yellow lines are parking spaces for local residents);  the control of, and the issue of fines in relation to, blue and yellow marked parking spaces;  the maintenance and management of public mobility support systems (information panels, etc.). Car parking spaces in the City of Vicenza are subdivided as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Car parking spaces marked by yellow lines 636 634 634 Car parking spaces marked by blue lines 6,316 6,521 6,521 Barrier car parks 4,240 4,488 4,488 Total parking spaces 11,192 11,643 11,643 Table 363 – Car parking spaces in the City of Vicenza in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 93 2019 2018 2017 Cars that entered barrier car parks 2,586,477 2,205,229 2,138,020 Table 374 – Vehicles that have made access to the City of Vicenza barrier car parks in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 With regard to the above table, the difference compared to 2018 is mainly due to the transformation of the street-level car park (parking spaces marked by blue lines) to a barrier car park for the parking area in Via F.lli Bandiera, as well as the partial closure of the Cattaneo Park for environmental clean-up works. As for cars entering barrier car parks, the increase is also due to the reporting from 2019 onwards of cars belonging to users with a car park subscription. Parking in blue-marked parking spaces in the city may be paid for not only in cash through the parking meters, but also by smartphone using apps like “Easy Park” and more recently “MyCicero”, which are also active in other Italian cities. A customised APP for Vicenza has also been developed, AIMFACILE, which is available free of charge for download and can be used to pay for actual parking time in the blue-marked parking spaces and in barrier car parks managed by AIM. Parking fees vary depending on the area, and they get cheaper the further away from the city centre the parking space is. Payment via APP has increased from last year, moving from 5% to 9% of the total payment transactions made during the year for blue-marked parking spaces. Payment for parking services is also available by using the Telepass system; this circuit was used in 1% of payments. Figure 92 Barrier car parks and interchange car parks managed by AIM Mobilità 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 94 The city of Vicenza has 215 parking meters serving the parking areas available to users. There are POS terminals on 91 payment devices (parking meters and automatic tellers), and these readers can be used to pay by electronic cards rather than using cash, facilitating the payment transaction and making it easier and faster. The yellow-line parking spaces in the city are reserved for residents who can use them subject to acquisition of the corresponding parking permit. For these parking areas, a portal called PASS 3.0 has been developed, where customers can conveniently renew their parking permits online from home (also via a mobile device) by paying by credit card. In order to ensure accessibility to the parking service for all citizens and the correct rotation in the paid parking areas, AIM has activated maintenance and emergency services for the payment devices (parking meters and automatic tellers) and control on the regularity of the parking, with the possibility of issuing the penalties under applicable regulations. There are 13 barrier car parks and 2 interchange car parks in the city, accounting for a total of 4,240 available parking spaces. The shuttle bus service enables people who use the interchange car parks to get directly to the city centre in Vicenza, reducing traffic and pollution. In 2019, access to the car parks managed by AIM increased by 17.29% compared to the previous year, recording a total of 2,586,477 accesses. In order to innovate and make parking easier in controlled car parks, AIM Mobilità activated the “POSsibile” payment service on the city’s 13 barrier car parks. Vicenza was the first Italian city to introduce this new “Card in – Card out” contactless payment system, which is based on the use of a credit/debit card and a smartphone providing access to and from car parks, without having to use cash and without having to get out of the car. This completely original system, the first of its kind in Italy, can be used by all those who possess a contactless card, and does not require any registration or pre-authorisation. In 2019, 19% of the transactions in the barrier car parks were carried out using the POS service. In order to contribute to the reduction of traffic in the city, AIM uses variable message panels that constantly inform drivers, in real time, about the availability of parking spaces in the barrier car parks. The data is also available via the portal www.aimmobilita.it. An experimental chatbot has been activated on TELEGRAM (AIM Parcheggi) that allows users to ask about how many parking spaces are available and where. The system is able, at the moment on an experimental basis and just for one car park, to provide a forecast on the future availability of parking spaces for a specific date and time. There are plans to extend the forecasting feature for all the managed car parks and thus provide customers with an additional tool to limit fruitless driving around by directing them to the least busy parking areas. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 95 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 96 PEOPLE MANAGEMENT Material aspects  INVOLVEMENT  PROMOTION OF WELL-BEING IN THE COMPANY  PROTECTION AND OPTIMISATION OF HUMAN CAPITAL  OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY  PROTECTION OF DIVERSITY AND EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES Human resources are an essential business asset. Their development represents a fundamental factor for the performance of the activity and for the achievement of the AIM Group’s objectives. The human resource optimisation principle is one of the guiding values, as indicated in the Code of Ethics. The people of the Group Efforts to optimise Human Capital are also channelled through the use of contractual forms that offer greater guarantees, such as that of permanent employment, which characterises more than 95% of employment contracts. Almost all employees reside within the areas in which the Group operates, in particular Veneto (AIM) and Abruzzo (CogasPiù Energie).

The breakdown of the female presence within the Group’s workforce indicates that women are 23.32% of the company’s population, of which 94.37% is qualified as a white collar worker. 55.63% of the women employed in the Group are in the 30 to 50 age group; during 2019, there were no women in management positions. In order to better reconcile private life and work, the Group implements flexible working hours that allow many employees to perform their job with working hours that can be compatible with their daily private life needs. In the AIM Group, 54 employees take advantage of reduced working hours, with an increase over the previous year, as broken down below by job and gender: Women Men Total % Temporary 6 23 29 4.76% Full-Time 5 22 27 4.43% Part-time 1 1 2 0.33% Permanent 136 444 580 95.24% Full-Time 89 439 528 86.70% Part-time 47 5 52 8.54% Overall Total 142 467 609 Table 418 – AIM Group full-time/part-time employees by gender in 2019 The percentage of employees who take advantage of part-time is 8.87% of which 88.89% are women.

Note also that in 2019 20 disciplinary measures were issued against employees. With regard to the absenteeism rate, intended as the ratio of hours not worked to total hours worked by all employees, it mainly concerns health reasons (3.8%). ** The Group's total absenteeism rate does not include holidays and generic leave of AIM Group human resources. Figure 13 – Absenteeism rate recorded by the AIM Group in 2019 In support of employment and in order to reconcile daily life with personal needs and work commitments, the AIM Group has adopted and intends to adopt some measures, which are currently being developed and studied. These include: Flexibility under exceptional circumstances Part-time on return from maternity leave Smart working Negotiations have begun with the social partners on the creation of a “solidarity bank of hours”. THE PROCESS OF SELECTION The process of recruiting new employees of the parent company and its investees is carried out in accordance with the principles of adequate publicity of the recruitment, 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 101 impartiality and respect for equal opportunities between female workers and male workers. The Evaluation Committee is made up of the Company’s Director or one or two of his delegates, the direct superior of the candidate in the recruitment phase and the Human Resources Manager or his delegate; the Company’s Directors as well as the personnel who hold political offices or union positions may not hold the role of members of the Evaluation Committee. Screening of the CVs is based on the objective and transparent recruitment requirements and criteria established in the recruitment notice, taking into account the organisational position that the candidate is called to fill. At the end of the recruitment process, the Evaluation Committee draws up a document that summarises the recruitment processes adopted, indicating a final ranking based on the criteria followed, proposing the hiring of the candidate(s). In the event of withdrawal of the chosen candidate(s), the next candidate will be hired, moving down in the ranking to the last of the candidates deemed suitable. The CVs received at the office, after a period of two years, will be destroyed, according to the provisions of the current legislation on privacy. Hiring takes place with an individual employment contract, in line with the national collective agreements (of a private nature) applied by the Company depending on the category to which it belongs. Remuneration and corporate welfare The costs that AIM incurs for its employees mainly take into consideration: both immediate (personnel remuneration and miscellaneous expenses) and deferred (severance indemnities) direct remuneration; indirect remuneration (social security contributions borne by AIM Group companies); and remuneration for non-employee personnel. In the performance of their activities, in addition to employees, AIM Group companies make recourse to the professional services of the Management Bodies (non-employee personnel), for the management and control functions. These reclassified personnel costs in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 are shown in Table 44. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 102 Personnel Costs 2019 2018 2017 Total Direct remuneration, of which: 24,103 26,491 26,765 Wages and salaries 22,279 22,505 23,048 Employee severance indemnities 1,243 1,496 1,525 Employee pensions and similar obligations 246 248 247 Miscellaneous services for employees 2,034 1,944 1,706 Other personnel costs 334 299 237 Total Indirect remuneration, of which: 7,116 7,275 7,451 Social security contributions 7,116 7,275 7,451 Employee personnel costs 31,219 33,766 34,216 Board of Directors fee 305 235 275 Board of Statutory Auditors fee 199 193 199 Non-employee personnel costs 504 428 474 Total personnel costs 33,756 34,195 34,690 Table 44 – Personnel costs of the AIM Group for the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 (thousands of Euro) These costs are a significant indicator of the contribution of the AIM Group to employment in the local area (Vicenza and province) in which 86.70% of its employees reside. In terms of distribution of remuneration, the company guarantees equality of remuneration between males and females with the same conditions; this figure is justified and shown in Table 45.

As from 2017, certain AIM Group companies signed, together with the Trade Union Organisations and, where present, the single company union representative, an agreement establishing the Performance Bonus for the two-year period from 2019 to 2020. The possibility of converting, in whole or in part, the amount of the Performance Bonus into forms of welfare was also envisaged. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 103 To all workers who freely choose to convert their Bonus into welfare goods and services, the Company makes available an additional package of welfare goods and services with a value equal to 12% of the converted portion of the Bonus (minimum conversion amount = Euro 250). Among the Flexible Benefits that the AIM Group makes available to beneficiaries are: fuel vouchers, food vouchers, shopping vouchers, health packages, travel packages, cinema, theatre, gym and swimming pool season tickets, educational and training expenses, other care costs, etc. AIM Group companies make available an individual budget to beneficiaries, equal to the portion of the envisaged Performance Bonus, to be paid via the forms described above. Beneficiaries can convert their Bonus into welfare benefits by logging on to the Welfaremeet portal. Failure to choose conversion into one of the proposed benefits will result in full payment of the Bonus in the salary, with reduced taxation. AIM is also designing and developing innovative systems that are increasingly in line with the needs of its workers through new welfare packages, such as the negotiations among the social partners, still in progress, for the conversion of bonus portions into hours of leave for workers. The optimisation of resources For the AIM Group, training is an important aspect of its operations. Given the nature of the activities provided, continuous updating in the regulatory and technical field is essential and is the basis for providing an adequate and efficient level of service. In 2019, the per capita training hours per employee of the AIM Group amounted to 10.13; during this year, 86% of employees took part in at least one training event, an increase on the result achieved in 2018 (76%). Total workforce Total hours Hours per capita Women 142 718 5.06 Men 467 5,450 11.67 Senior managers 9 225 25 Middle managers 18 272 15.11 White collar workers 291 2,800 9.62 Blue collar workers 291 2,871 9.87 Table 46 – Average hours of training by gender and level in 2019 As evidence of the Group’s focus on its employees, in 2019 61.22% of total training hours were dedicated to occupational safety. As regards the remaining training areas, 20% were related to technical issues and 19% to regulatory issues (Figure 10). 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 104 81% of the resources trained are men, a figure in line with the greater presence of men in the Group’s workforce. (Make a new chart) Figure 104 – Type of training provided in 2019 As far as the training of its employees is concerned, the AIM Group organises courses inside the company or in external training centres in the vicinity of the company head office.15 During 2019, the AIM Group collaborated with High Schools and Universities, giving the opportunity to 20 students, for a total of 257 weeks, to be able to test their school/university knowledge in the field, through the implementation of both paid and unpaid internships. 15 In 2018, 94 courses were held internally, and 67 at locations outside the company. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 105 INCENTIVE SYSTEM DEFINITION OF PROFITABILITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY OBJECTIVES: The profitability, productivity and quality objectives to be pursued in 2019 and 2020 in all Group Companies are geared towards the implementation of the development and rationalisation guidelines contained in the Business Plan, as defined and structured in the budgets of each individual Company. The possibility of receiving the Bonus will depend on the achievement of the profitability, productivity and quality objectives of the Group and of each Company/Division/Service. Therefore, the annual Performance Bonus for the employees of AIM Vicenza SpA will be related: a) to the profitability parameter for a percentage of 40%; b) to the productivity and quality parameters and, in particular, to the results obtained in implementing the projects/objectives as set out in this agreement, for a percentage of 60%. The objectives refer to the years 2019 and 2020. PROFITABILITY PARAMETER Given the need to record a positive final result, the Profitability parameter is deemed to be achieved if AIM Vicenza SpA’s EBT for 2019 (2020) is higher than AIM Vicenza SpA’s EBT for the average result in the previous three-years from 2016 to 2018. For the other Group companies, the parameter referred to is EBITDA. The final result, as indicated in the financial statements, must be considered net of any unforeseeable external factors due to any business/organisational choices aimed at guaranteeing the public service. In this case, the result will be normalised on a like-for-like basis without taking into account the change from previous years. The average result for the previous three years shall be considered an adequate benchmark, according to current legislation on de-taxation, in the light of the progress envisaged by the AIM Group’s Business Plan (corporate development and reorganisation). Without prejudice to the above, if AIM Vicenza SpA’s EBT for 2019 (2020) is less than or equal to the average result of the previous three years in a range between 90.1% and 100%, the bonus will be granted proportionally according to the linear interpolation criterion. The profitability parameter shall be deemed not achieved if the value is less than or equal to 90%. PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY PARAMETERS Productivity and quality objectives coincide with the achievement of the projects/objectives set out in this document and referring to the years 2019 and 2020, as well as with the improvement of the quality of the services rendered. The projects/objectives concern the improvement of current activities or the development of new activities aimed at improving the efficiency/quality of the service rendered. Each project/objective is assigned a percentage value based on the achievement of the same by each Company/Division/Service (from 0% to 100%). 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 106 Industrial Relations The National Collective Bargaining Agreements (CCNL) applied in the AIM Group and the labour relations governed by each agreement are as follows: 2019 Public transport and inland navigation CCNL 4 Trade CCNL 20 Senior managers of public utility service companies CCNL 9 Building CCNL 9 Gas-Water CCNL 204 Federambiente environmental services CCNL 135 FISE environmental services CCNL 53 Electricity CCNL 159 Services CCNL 16 Overall Total 609 Table 47 – Collective agreements applied within the AIM Group in 2019 In AIM Group Companies, as required by the National Collective Bargaining Agreements, the negotiating delegations have been set up, consisting of, on the part of the company, the management and the Head of the Human Resources Department, and, on the part of the trade unions, of the single company union representative, where present, and of representatives of the relevant Trade Union Organisations. The Companies inform the trade union organisations of operations of a general nature, concerning employment relations, organisation of the departments and human resources management. Depending on the subject matter, the Companies convene the entire trade union delegation. The trade union membership rate in the AIM Group in 2019, calculated considering the number of personnel having joined the union compared to the total number of employees, was equal to 38.75% (SEE FILES E-E1m); during 2019, 22 union meetings were held. Table 48 shows the statistics on trade union activity within the Group. 2019 2018 2017 Union membership 38.75% 40.0% 41.85% rate % Number of union 22 26 25 meetings Hours of union 1,081.51 949.5 1,206 meetings Absenteeism due to 0% 0.02% 0.06% strike 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 107 Table 48 – Trade union activity within the AIM Group in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019 Note that absenteeism due to strikes shows a clear downward trend in the three-year period from 2017 to 2019, an indication of greater confidence in the Group and appreciation of the climate in the workplace. Occupational Health and Safety Commuting accidents refer to accidents involving employees that take place while commuting from home to the workplace, whose causes depend mainly on factors that cannot be managed by AIM Group companies. As regards accidents in the workplace, in order to prevent them and minimise their number, AIM Group companies carry out the following activities, in line with legislative requirements regarding safety in the workplace:  information on risks in the workplace;  health surveillance (periodic examinations);  preparation of risk assessment documents;  preparation of internal emergency plans;  provision of personal protective equipment (accident prevention equipment);  health and safety training. 2019 Total number of accidents 28 Frequency index 31.05 Severity indicator 0.82 Lost working days (total between occupational disease and accidents) 737 Absenteeism rate 0.07% Work-related deaths 0 Table 49 – Accidents involving AIM Group employees in 201916. Meetings are scheduled during the year involving the Management, the Health and Safety Department, the Company Doctor and workers' safety representatives to manage actual or potential problems related to workers' health and safety. It is believed that the jobs most exposed to high incidence and high risk of specific occupational diseases are those related to construction, road and urban health activities. 16 As indicated by UNI 7249, the severity indicator is calculated considering (total days of absence/total hours worked) x 1000; the frequency index is calculated considering (total accidents/total hours worked) x 1,000,000. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 108 In 2019, the AIM Group maintained the trade union agreement to protect workplace safety concerning adoption of the man on the ground system for isolated or solo workers. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 109 SUPPLIER RELATIONS Material aspects  PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND SUPPLIER ASSESSMENT The suppliers of the AIM Group Companies, meaning in particular contractors of supplies, works and services, occupy a strategic position in achieving the Group’s growth and sustainability objectives. The AIM Group Companies are subject, in the various sectors, to the regulations governing public procurement contracts, the acquisition of assets and the assignment of services and the execution of works to third parties, the main legislative reference of which is the Public Contracts Code. In 2019, AIM also approved the Regulation on sub-threshold procurement contracts. The selection of Suppliers is therefore carried out in compliance with the principles enshrined in the EU Treaty for the protection of competition, as well as the general principles of sound governance, effectiveness, efficiency and economy, aimed at ensuring that acquisitions and awards of contract are carried out with transparency and at the best conditions. The internal rules of awards of contract and performance are also inspired by the legislative principles of proportionality, rotation, non-discrimination and equal treatment between economic operators. The AIM Group, through the Tenders Portal, manages a List of Suppliers (Online Supplier Register), which allows the registration of those who intend to apply and express their interest in being invited to submit bids, without prejudice to the fact that the economic operators are qualified on a case-by-case basis according to the call for tenders. The economic operators to be consulted are identified on the basis of information regarding compliance with requirements related to general qualification, professional ethics, characteristics of economicfinancial and technical-organisational qualification, and in particular, recently, minimum environmental requirements. For some types of supplies and services, the AIM Group Companies require candidates, within reason and where permitted, to possess specific technical, organisational and economic-financial skills, as objective as possible and always proportionate to the nature and the subject of the contracts, as well as, more and more frequently, to prove the fulfilment of the quality standards issued on the basis of the European standards of the UNI EN ISO 9000 series and others. All suppliers and contractors are required to comply with environmental and safety standards, to protect work conditions, and finally to adhere to the Code of Ethics approved by the Group and the management model pursuant to Italian Legislative Decree No. 231/2001. The AIM Group is implementing the dissemination and promotion of sustainable issues and criteria related to procurement and contracts, especially for specific types of purchases and for the performance of works, including through the application of CAMs, the Minimum Environmental 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 110 Criteria required for a contract to be identified as green according to the guidelines of the PAN-GPP, National Green Procurement Action Plan. In 2019, the Group Companies supported various collaborations for the development of sustainable information campaigns targeted at local trade associations interested in the various CAMs. The AIM Group considers it important to spread knowledge and use of environmental certifications, not only referred to products and services but also within the scope of other processes and projects, a requirement that is now consolidating in many tenders, through ISO 9000, ISO 14000, OHSAS and other certifications. The Group aims, in conclusion, to build a transparent, proactive and cooperative relationship with suppliers, involving them in the compliance with the quality, environmental and safety standards adopted by the Group. In 2019, the AIM Group Companies placed orders with a value of Euro 26,884,362.94 through tender procedures under the Public Contracts Code referred to in Italian Legislative Decree no. 50/2016 as amended (above the threshold of Euro 40,000.00), and of Euro 11,484,787.56 with the market survey or direct award procedures for contracts below the threshold of Euro 40,000.00. Figure 115 Total value awarded through tenders and direct awards via market surveys performed by the AIM Group in 2019 Public tenders of the so-called ordinary and negotiated award types The requirements to participate in tenders are related to professional competence as well as to the priority compliance with the requirements of professional ethics. It is also often required to meet requirements relating to economic and financial standing, and technical and professional suitability. In particular, in tenders concerning waste disposal, the legal authorisations required from the Contractor for the transport, storage and disposal of waste, both with regard to the vehicles used and the plants 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 111 of destination, are always verified so as to ascertain the legal suitability to operate with total respect for the environment. The awarding of tenders mainly takes place with the criterion of the most economically advantageous tender, in order to evaluate, according to different parameters based on the type and characteristics of the award, economic, qualitative, social, environmental, ethical and safety aspects. The Group Companies undertake to inform the supplier in a correct and timely manner regarding the characteristics of the contracts, the payment methods and times in compliance with current regulations and internal accounting procedures, contents and contractual clauses in general. The AIM Group guarantees its contractors that the performance of the contract is carried out in a manner consistent with the principles of equality, fairness, diligence and good faith in compliance with current legislation, the contracts signed and internal company procedures. The professional and technical suitability of contractors or subcontractors in relation to works, services and supplies to be awarded either under a tender or by works contract or manpower supply contract is scrupulously verified, providing companies with detailed information on specific risks in the environment in which they are intended to operate and on the preventive and emergency measures taken in relation to their activities. Where applicable, the Companies (and, in particular, the persons responsible for the procedure RUP) prepare the risk assessment document which indicates the measures taken to eliminate or minimise the risks from interference; they draft the interference risk assessment document which includes an evaluation of the standard risks related to the type of work that could potentially derive from the performance of the contract. The companies cooperate in the implementation of the measures designed to prevent and protect from risks on the work site that have an impact on the work activity subject to contract, coordinate the operations aimed at the protection from and prevention of the risks to which the workers are exposed, thereby exchanging information, in order to eliminate risks due to interference between the activities of the different companies involved in the performance of the overall work (Articles 14 and 26 of Legislative Decree 81/2008). The portal for the registration of suppliers is available at http://gareonline.aimvicenza.it/portale/index.php and can be accessed by all economic operators wishing to collaborate with the AIM Group. (The Group Companies, through AIM Vicenza Spa, in particular, use the specific electronic Portal for a more prompt and functional management of the procedures for the acquisition of goods, services and for the assignment of works) I would remove it. All communications between AIM Vicenza Spa and the companies, as far as the management of the receipt of bids is concerned, are transparent as they are guaranteed by the online Tenders Portal. The registration system of economic operators within the Portal, and their subsequent profiling, contributes to expanding the list of potential suppliers, as well as making the supply of goods and services and the assignment of works more open and competitive. Registering suppliers are assigned unique and confidential credentials, which allow access to the Portal and the respective files. The number of (ordinary) public tenders carried out by the Group in 2019 came to 26 for a total awarded value of Euro 12,574,557.25. A total of 18 tenders were called for to evaluate the most advantageous 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 112 offer and 8 tenders were called for running for the price slide. On the other hand, the number of negotiated award procedures during 2019 was 58. Figure 16 – Value awarded through (so-called ordinary) public tenders, broken down by tenders carried out with the most economically advantageous tender and tenders running for the price slide, operated by the AIM Group in 2019 Purchases on the territory In the awarding of tenders relating above all to Companies operating in the environmental field (Valore Ambiente and SIA, in particular, but not only these), if considered appropriate also on the basis of the movement of the vehicles involved, the containment of the movement of vehicles within the territory and the homologation classes referring to the emissions into the atmosphere of the discharges are often evaluated in rewarding terms. The aim of the valuation criteria is to reduce atmospheric emissions and hence air pollution as much as possible. Considering the extent of the movements and the use of means for collecting and transporting waste for disposal, this criterion is particularly effective in terms of respect for the environment and therefore for the objective of sustainability. In 2019, the AIM Group issued 1172 orders to 449 suppliers registered in Vicenza for a total value of Euro 16,350,207.7117. 17 Note that the information entered does not consider the company TRE V in that it does not process orders but only commercial offers. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 113 % of total % of total Commercial orders 2019 2018 orders orders no. of orders of which: 2,356 2,501 Companies registered in Veneto 1,637 1,786 71.4% (no.) of which Companies registered 1,172 1,274 50.9% in Vicenza (no.)

The department in charge of coordinating and achieving these aims is the External Relations and Communication Department which manages relations with the media, ensuring timely and uninterrupted collaboration with information operators and looking after the image of the Holding and of its special-purpose companies, and relations with the third sector associations that have always made Vicenza one of the cities and provinces most rich in volunteer opportunities. In 2019, the External Relations and Communication Department also produced over fifty press releases, which generated around one hundred television reports, and helped to inspire, directly or indirectly, almost two thousand articles in the local and national press, also on the basis of the activities for extraordinary corporate transactions that occurred during the year. In addition, the year 2019 was characterised by an attentive promotion of initiatives that generated social integration, fairness and development sustainability. The criteria adopted in the disbursement of economic resources through sponsorships and donations always comply with the principles of consistency with the corporate purpose of AIM Vicenza SpA, exclude bodies or entities that are clearly political in nature and refer to the Regulation for investments in communication, branding and service advertising to AIM Group customers. During the year, the AIM Group provided its support in the promotion and organisation of numerous cultural, sports, social and environmental events of not only local but also national importance, with an economic commitment of over Euro 300,000. The most significant events included the Biblical Festival, the Municipal Theatre season and summer shows in the city, the great exhibitions in the Basilica Palladiana, the summer activity centres for young children and teenagers, sports events in the city and the charity dinner in support of the Mountain Community of the Sette Comuni following the devastating storm, Vaia. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 115 Support to the community INITIATIVES IN 2019 (Euro) 1,472,620 Social events 30,180 Educational initiatives for children and teenagers 79,830 Cultural initiatives 49,390 Sports initiatives 38,537 Initiatives raising environmental awareness 94,652 Musical initiatives 1,775,210 Total sponsorships provided SOCIAL SUPPORT ELECTRICITY AND GAS SOCIAL BONUS: AIM Energy provided the Electricity and Gas social bonus introduced by AEEGSI (now ARERA) in collaboration with the Municipality of Vicenza to help families in financial difficulties and large families with the cost of gas and electricity. AIM-CARITAS AGREEMENT: the agreement, through which AIM makes available to the association Diakonia Onlus (operating unit of the diocesan Caritas) Euro 20 thousand for individuals and families in momentary financial difficulties, was renewed for the sixth time. The agreement promotes a service aimed at people and families who are unable to meet their economic and financial commitments with respect to essential goods and services, such as electricity and gas, due to job loss, precarious employment or reduced income. “INSIEME PER LA VITA” (Together for Life): the AIM Group signed up to the TV marathon organised by Videomedia and Publiadige that succeeded in raising funds for five non-profit associations: Fondazione OTB in Breganze, social farm IL POMODORO in Bolzano Vicentino, Fondazione San Bortolo in Vicenza, CUAMM in Padua, Associazione Italiana Progeria Sammy Basso onlus in Tezze sul Brenta. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 116 EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES FOR CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS AIM ENERGY CAMP: AIM Energy supported the summer camps called “AIM Energy Camp” for children and teenagers aged 6 to 13 years who took part in many interesting sports activities. CHILDREN AND FAMILY: AIM Ambiente took part in the fifth edition of Children and Family, organising, in collaboration with the operators of the Ecotopia cooperative, play and educational activities on the reuse of materials that would otherwise be destined to become waste. ROSSI HIGH SCHOOL PROJECT: the collaboration with ITIS Rossi, a high school in Vicenza, was also renewed in 2019 in the field of ecology and environmental sustainability. AIM Ambiente organised teacher-led lessons and classroom activities for the first and second classes, with a view to getting the students to learn about the company’s activity and raising their awareness on the correct waste sorting practices with a particular focus on reducing plastic in the classroom. The project ended with the distribution of over 2,500 aluminium water bottles to the students and the installation of a (still and sparkling) water dispenser from the mains in collaboration with VIACQUA. SCHOOLS AND MUNICIPAL THEATRE PROJECT: AIM Ambiente took part in the project promoted by the Municipal Theatre of Vicenza aimed at promoting education in theatrical communication, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability. The project involved over 600 students from primary and secondary schools in the Municipality and province of Vicenza. It included a workshop led by specialist professionals assisted by the class teacher, aimed at the production of a play that was staged at the Municipal Theatre of Vicenza, on three successive evenings, entitled “Like a meteor I’ll change the world”. The play highlighted the theme of eco-sustainability and imagined a world where there is universal respect for human rights and dignity, justice, equality and equal opportunities. 2019/2020 CURRICULUM PROSPECTUS (POFT): AIM Ambiente was included in the 2019/2020 POFT thanks to the activities offered to primary and middle schools in the Municipality of Vicenza involving workshop-lessons during which students carried out activities to raise awareness about waste, with a particular focus on the making the most of recycling, recovery and creative reuse. In addition to traditional teacher-led lessons, there was also a programme of workshops and visits to a recycling centre. AIM AND UNIVERSITY: in collaboration with the undergraduates following a degree course in “Social Marketing, Communication and Change” at the University of Padua, the AIM Group held a series of educational seminars on Corporate Social Responsibility. The students prepared and presented a project of their own, aimed at encouraging sustainable behaviour by citizens with respect to the AIM Group’s services, via the chosen communication channel, i.e. social media. CULTURAL INITIATIVES There were numerous cultural initiatives involving the AIM Group, also together with its companies, as partner and main supporter, including the following: 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 117 EXHIBITIONS: the AIM Group was the main sponsor of the exhibition called “Ritratto di donna: il sogno degli anni venti. Lo sguardo di Ubaldo Oppi” (Portrait of a woman: the dream of the Twenties. Ubaldo Oppi’s point of view) scheduled from 6 December 2019 to 13 April 2020 in the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza. During 2019 AIM also sponsored the exhibition “Was furchten Sie denn jetzt noch?” held in the spaces of the Municipal Theatre of Vicenza featuring a display of over thirty photographic portraits depicting people whose expressions reveal a disappointment in love, an abandonment or a loss. SUMMER EVENTS: the AIM Group sponsored the theatrical, musical and cultural shows organised by Theama Teatro, Stivalaccio, La Piccionaia, Musiche delle Tradizioni and Le Settimane Musicali al Teatro Olimpico that animated the summer months in the city with a calendar of cultural events that was highly appreciated by citizens and spectators who also came from the surrounding cities. LA RUA (the Wheel): on 8 September, for the patron saint’s day of Madonna di Monte Berico, AIM Amcps created the magnificent setting of the Rua, rebuilt by the Company of Viale sant'Agostino in 2007 based on a drawing by Francesco Muttoni. SPORTS INITIATIVES Also sport, as a moment of social aggregation and inclusion, was at the centre of attention of the AIM Group and in particular of AIM Energy, which in 2019 supported the AIM Amateur Sports Group and in particular the fourth edition of “ULTRA & WILD TRAIL” a footrace in the hills of Malo and Monte di Malo that has attracted the participation of over 900 athletes. AIM also supported other sports groups that enrich the recreational offer of the Vicenza area: Araceli Basketball Club, Vicenza Rugby Club, Fencing Club, Brendola Golf Club and the International Tennis Tournament. In 2019, AIM also chose to support the football team, LR Vicenza, to promote a sports project that had been missing in the city for several years. ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AND INNOVATIVE SERVICES VICENZA, RICOSTRUIRE INSIEME LE NOSTRE MONTAGNE (Vicenza, rebuilding our mountains together): AIM Energy sponsored the charity dinner organised in Piazza dei Signori in support of the Municipalities of the Asiago Plateau, hard hit by the storm Vaia. M’ILLUMINO DI MENO (LESS LIGHT ON ME): also this year the AIM Group took part in the initiative to raise awareness on energy savings promoted by Radio Due by switching off the lights in one of the city’s most significant monuments for an hour. YELLOW PAPER CONTAINERS: the entire set of containers used to collect paper have been renovated in over 650 collection points. This initiative means that there is greater flexibility in operations with respect to the needs of the territory. RECYCLING CENTRES OPEN ON SUNDAYS: AIM Ambiente also opened the North and West Recycling Centres on Sundays, from 9 am to 2 pm from March to December. The initiative was 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 118 launched in order to further stimulate the collection of recyclable and reusable materials, given the fact that many users already use and appreciate the service during the week. Not only that: the opening on Sundays also provides citizens with a further opportunity to avoid improper waste deliveries or dumping. WASTE FORUM: AIM Ambiente hosted the fourth edition of the Ecoforum, organised by Legambiente Veneto and held in Venice, Treviso, Padua and Vicenza, open to the 576 municipalities in the region with the theme of “The circular economy of waste”, with a particular focus on “reuse”, “plastic-free” and “environmental offences”. COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGNS: AIM Ambiente has launched an intense communication campaign regarding education on the correct delivery of waste entitled “TI RIFIUTI DI VEDERLO?” (You refuse to see it?), featuring a large inflatable washing machine in the city squares and markets that, on the occasion of the Green Day, become “talking” and allowed adults and children to learn about the AIM services and good practices for proper waste sorting. AIM Mobilità launched the campaign “PARCHEGGIA SENZA CONTANTI” (Cashless Parking) to raise awareness and inform citizens about the many ways other than cash that can be used to pay for parking in Vicenza: credit card, debit card, AIMFacile App and MyCicero App are just some of the ways that make parking in the city easier and safer. MUSICAL INITIATIVES: FESTIVALSHOW: AIM Energy chose to be the sponsor of the highly successful and very popular travelling singing event in the main squares and cities of Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia. The event started in Prato della Valle in Padua and ended in Piazza Unità d'Italia in Trieste after visiting the squares in Jesolo, Bibione, Mestre, Chioggia, Caorle, Lignano, involving over 160,000 people in the 8 locations. TREVISO SUONA JAZZ (Treviso plays jazz): AIM Energy sponsored the event held in the city centre of Treviso with concerts, meetings and workshops. BIBLICAL FESTIVAL: AIM Energy sponsored the 15th edition of the Biblical Festival, an event called this year “POLIS”, which took place in the streets and squares of the city centre of Vicenza and province, Verona, Padua, Rovigo and Vittorio Veneto. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 119 PROTECTION OF THE TERRITORY The AIM Group operates in an area rich in Biodiversity, also due to the fact that the services provided are many and varied in terms of type and location, and therefore all personnel undertake daily to safeguard the environment in which they operate, be it a protected or urbanised area, implementing control and monitoring actions. Before implementing new projects and maintenance activities of a certain importance, which could give rise to environmental impacts in particular areas, the Group submits the intervention to more specialised assessments for the safeguard of the area affected by the service. The Group's electricity generation activities, in particular for the Lobia local Power Plant, have an impact on water resources the Bacchiglione River from which water is taken and in which it is subsequently discharged, and all the activity is managed in compliance with the concession issued by the competent Authorities and with current legislation. In particular, the safeguard of the restocking of the fry is of interest to AIM; this is a regulatory requirement for operators of run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants, since the dam can be an obstacle to the reproduction of freshwater fish which run up and down the river. Therefore, the Veneto Region requires the signing of a contract with its agency Veneto Agricoltura for restocking the rivers with new-born fish ( fry ), produced on farms and then released upstream of the dam and in tributaries, according to a defined criterion. For the other waste production and management activities carried out by the Group, there is no environmental hazard since the areas of the sites are not of the protected type. The Grumolo delle Abbadesse landfill is managed in harmony with the vegetational climate of its location, also as regards the biogas plant. For the natural gas and electricity distribution service, there is no impact on biodiversity, other than the utmost attention to the materials and equipment used to manage the network to guarantee there is no environmental impact. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 120 GROUP CONSUMPTION Material aspects  CONTAINMENT OF EMISSIONS Energy consumption The Group's direct energy consumption refers to the use of fuel for the production of electricity and heat in the Group's plants (cogeneration plant, boilers, landfill) as well as non-renewable primary energy flows not directly connected with energy production (e.g. heating, transport fuels used in performing company activities). Indirect energy consumption, i.e. the electricity that the Group purchases and consumes, refers to the Group's production sites and plants. The electricity used by the energy production plants is partly self-produced and the related values are included in the direct fuel consumption. With the aim of reducing its environmental footprint, the Group certified the electricity used for its activities through the purchase of green certificates; these certificates cover the Group's entire electricity requirements. A total of 13,797 green certificates were purchased.

The company vehicle fleet is subject to particular attention by the Group, which is committed to reducing atmospheric emissions deriving from road traffic, through the systematic renewal of the most polluting vehicles. Emissions The use of fossil fuels is one of the elements most responsible for climate change; reducing their use, together with increasing energy efficiency, is one of the most effective strategies for reducing the greenhouse effect, whose main actor is represented by carbon dioxide. The Group is committed to 18 For the 2019 data, the heat values published by DEFRA 2019 have been taken into account. 19 Considering the green certificates for all Group activities. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 121 reducing these emissions and reporting the performance achieved, in order to ensure transparency and continuous improvement of its performance. The Group's greenhouse gas emissions (GHG Greenhouse Gases) derive in particular from plants (waste-to-energy plant and district heating), from losses in the gas network, from landfills and, albeit to a lesser extent, from technological plants relating to operating sites. Table 53 shows the CO2eq emissions, expressed in tons, related to the use of fossil fuels by the company fleet and the use of natural gas for heating and technological uses (Scope 1).

The avoided greenhouse gas emissions are composed of 5 categories, resulting from:  electricity purchased and consumed by Group companies for their operating activities, entirely generated from renewable sources;  electricity from renewable sources that the Group purchases for its domestic and industrial customers, which guarantee their supply of electricity from renewable sources;  the recovery and use of natural gas produced from biomass in the Group’s waste storage facilities; this gas is used for the generation of electricity, which covers the internal consumption of the plants and the remainder of which is put on the market;  the district heating activity that, thanks to the better efficiency compared to the individual production of thermal energy, allows to reduce the gas emissions deriving from the combustion of fossil fuel and consequently mitigate the emissions in urban environment. 20 The emission factors published by DEFRA 2019 were taken into account for the assessment of CO2eq emissions for Scope 1. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 122 The replacement of public lighting systems with high-efficiency LED elements, as well as the adoption of low-absorption elements and the replacement of low-energy-efficient elements (such as the windows of the Group’s operating sites) reduced over the years the Group’s ecological footprint, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 123 APPENDICES 2019 Sustainability Report – Consolidated Non-Financial Statement 124 TABLE OF CONCORDANCE WITH THE GLOBAL COMPACT The ten principles 2019 Sustainability Report Topic Human Rights Principles 1, 2 Businesses should support and The respect of human rights is explicitly mentioned in respect the protection of internationally the AIM Group Code of Ethics and in the contractual proclaimed human rights within their respective relationships with suppliers.

Vicenza S.p.A. and subsidiaries (the “Group”) as of December 31, 2019 prepared on the basis of art. 4 of the Decree, and approved by the Sole Administrator on March 19, 2020 (hereinafter the NFS ).

Moreover, the sole Administrator is responsible for the identification of the content of the NFS, within the topics specified in article 3, paragraph 1, of the Decree, taking into account the Group’ business and characteristics, to the extent necessary to ensure an understanding of the Group's business, performance, results and the related impacts.

Pag. 1 di 3 Auditors’ responsibility Our responsibility is to express our conclusion based on the procedures performed about the compliance of the NFS with the requirements of the Decree and the GRI Standards selected. We carried out our work in accordance with the criteria established in the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ~ Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (“ISAE 3000 Revised ), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) for limited assurance engagements. This standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance whether the NFS is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement is less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement carried out in accordance with ISAE 3000 Revised, and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters and events that might be identiﬁed in a reasonable assurance engagement. The procedures performed on the NFS are based on our professional judgement and include inquiries, primarily of the company’s personnel responsible for the preparation of the information presented in the NFS, analysis of documents, recalculations and other procedures aimed to obtain evidence, as appropriate. Specifically, we carried out the following procedures: 1. Analysis of relevant topics with reference to the Group's activities and characteristics disclosed in the NFS, in order to assess the reasonableness of the process in place for the selection process in the light of the provisions of article 3 of the Decree and taking into account the adopted reporting standard. 2. Analysis and assessment of the identification criteria of the consolidation area, in order to assess its compliance to the Decree. 3. If applicable: comparison of data and financial economic disclosures presented in the NFS with those included in the A.I.M. Vicenza Group’s consolidated financial statements. 4. Understanding of the following matters: ▪ Business management model of the Group's activity, with reference to the management of the topics set out in article 3 of the Decree; ▪ Policies adopted by the entity in connection with the topics set out in article 3 of the Decree, achieved results and related key performance indicators; ▪ Main risks, generated and/or undertaken, in connection with the topics set out in article 3 of the Decree. With reference to these matters, we compared them with the disclosures presented in the NFS and carried out the procedures described in point 5, letter a). 5. Understanding of the processes underlying the origination, recording and management of significant qualitative and quantitative information disclosed in the NFS. Specifically, we carried out interviews and discussions with the management of A.I.M. Vicenza S.p.A., A.I.M. Energy S.r.l., Servizi a Rete S.r.l., A.I.M. Mobilità S.r.l., COGAS Più Energie S.r.l., Valore Ambiente S.r.l., Valore Città AMCPS S.r.l., SIT Società Igiene Territorio S.p.A. and we also performed limited documentary veriﬁcations, in order to gather information on the processes and procedures supporting the collection, aggregation, processing and transmittal of non-financial data and information to the department responsible for the preparation of the NFS. In addition, with respect to significant information, taking into consideration the Group's business and characteristics, at parent company's level: A.I.M. Vicenza S.p.A. | Independent Auditors' Report on the consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to article 3, paragraph 10 of Legislative Decree no. 254 of December 30, 2016 and of art. 5 of CONSOB Regulation n. 20267 Pag. 2 di 3 a) with regards to qualitative information included in the NFS, and speciﬁcally with reference to the business model, policies applied and main risks, we carried out interviews and gathered supporting documentation to check for consistency with available evidence. b) with regards to quantitative information, we carried out both analytical and limited procedures to ensure, on a sample basis, the correct aggregation of data. c) For the following group companies: A.I.M. Vicenza S.p.A. and A.I.M. Energy S.r.l. selected on the basis of their activities, their performance indicators contribution and location, we carried out some interviews using conference call’s methodology with its management and gather supporting documentation with reference to the correct application of the procedures and methods used to calculate the indicators. Conclusion Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the NFS of A.I.M. Vicenza Group as of December 31, 2019 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of article 3 and 4 of the Decree and the GRI Standards, GRI-Referenced option.
