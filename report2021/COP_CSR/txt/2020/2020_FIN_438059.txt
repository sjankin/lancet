Materials Our production uses high-quality raw materials that contribute to the safety and high quality of our tires. We are continuously exploring the utilization of recycled materials but, in general, recycled materials contain impurities that would degrade our products’ safety characteristics. This is why we primarily use virgin raw materials in our production.
