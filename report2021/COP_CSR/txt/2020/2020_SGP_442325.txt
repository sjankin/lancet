It’s the year when we started to see members stepping up to drive the movement forward. LEG ACY B O O K L AU NCH 52 Changemakers including many of the B1G1 Members as well as some global leaders (like Paul Polman) came together to co-author this remarkable book “LEGACY – the Sustainable Development Goals in Action”. This International Bestselling book gives readers ideas about how every single one of us can contribute towards B 1G1 S TU DY TO U R TO K E NYA creating a sustainable world together. Our 8th Study Tour took a group of B1G1 Members and their family members to Kenya to visit three different Worthy Causes working to transform communities in different ways. Once again, the feedback was ‘life-changing’. B1G 1x When we decided not to host a Global Conference in 2019, many B1G1 members still wanted to experience the community gathering. This led to the curation of new conferences called B1G1x (like TEDx). In 2019, we had three B1G1x events — 2 in North Hemisphere and 1 in South Hemisphere. The B1G1 team also joined the events. 22 L O C A L M E M B E R-R U N E V E N T S Many of the B1G1 Members in Melbourne suggested that we create regular networking events in their city to unite B1G1 Members and their friends. Started in October, this event is serving as the template for a regional event model. X M A S G I V I N G C A M PA I G N “What if you get to give a life-changing gift to someone you care about instead of buying a physical gift?” A simple idea led to the 12 Days of Christmas Campaign, packaging 12 special projects in one bundle. Many B1G1 Members supported this campaign, sharing the joy of giving with others. 20 0 M I L L I O N I M PA C T S In December 2019, just before the end of the year, the total impact count of the B1G1 Community reached 200 million. Considering how long it took us to reach the first million, this is an amazing feat. We are grateful for every business that contributed to this milestone. 23 You can give without loving, but you cannot love without giving.

TIEN When Tien first met Blue Dragon in 2006, he had never been to school. But that’s water under the bridge, because today he’s a true academic star. Tien was born with cerebral palsy to a very poor family. When he was four, their home was a small shack made of nylon, with no electricity and no bathroom, and sunk in the mud of a riverbed. With the family’s meagre resources and his lack of mobility, Tien’s schooling was out of the question. Fortunately, this changed when Tien met Blue Dragon. He was able to start going to school and access the medical care he needed. Blue Dragon also assisted Tien’s family to make improvements to their living situation, although their house is still on the riverbank. For Tien, this means extra effort: when it rains, everything around the house is filled with mud. Pushing the wheelchair to the road becomes a nearly impossible task but his parents support his education with all of their efforts. Despite these difficulties, in 2019, Tien not only didn’t miss a single class, but he also made it into college. Tien, you have so much to be proud of! STO RY F RO M.. BLUE DRAGON C H I L D R E N ’ S F O U N D AT I O N 30 A S TO R Y A B OU T. . CH AKRI YA Sala Baï’s curriculum focuses primarily on learning by doing. Due to the low level of education of their students and the short period of training, 70% of the training given at school is carried out either in the restaurant, the hotel and the beauty spa, or during the two 2-month internships completed at partner establishments. Chakriya Loem (Front Office) intern at the Victoria Hotel shares her first experience about the internship: “At the start of the internship, my tutor asked me what Front Office skills I had. Then he taught me how to make a booking and I was able to train in real conditions. I learned a lot about the procedure for registering clients, recording their booking in the hotel’s computer software, registering their passports. Every day was different. Now I can send confirmation emails in English! I want to learn more. What I particularly like about this training is being in contact with clients, we share a lot of information. Sometimes I gave them advice on places to visit. My colleagues work a lot, they are really smart and they work quickly. I got along very well with them. I want to learn. I watched them and tried to do what they do, that’s also how I learned. I think I’ve improved since I started this internship. I know that my level of English is not good enough but I’m motivated.” STOR Y F R OM ..

STEVE MARABOLI 2020 & BEYOND YEAR 2020 2020 is not just another year — it’s a year for clarity of vision (and purpose too). It’s also a milestone in the sense that we have just 10 years to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Within this decade, we need to overcome many challenges together. Not least, of course, is the speed of climate change and global warming. It may become irreversible if all businesses, governments and leaders fail to change the way we do what we do. In the B1G1 Community, we have a lot of work to do; work to make B1G1 the ‘go-to’ standard for business giving for both small and now larger businesses. It’s a huge year ahead with many developments taking shape with a talented and focused (and growing) team. We look forward to sharing those developments with you and driving the growth of this movement together.

The board helps ensure that decisions around our Worthy Cause Partner selections and the contribution management processes are made with fair and objective views independently without any conflicts of interest. PAUL PETRUCCELLI, PRESIDENT FORMER VP & CHIEF COUNSEL (RETIRED) KRAFT FOOD ASIA PACIFIC Paul is the ‘legal guy’ at B1G1. After a 20-year career as in-house Legal Counsel for Kraft Foods, one of the largest multinational food companies, he decided to focus more attention on giving back. And it was our good fortune to find him. “A decade ago, at a small gathering in Singapore, Masami Sato stood up on a table and spoke from the heart about the power of giving to change the world. I dried my eyes and was hooked. In the intervening 10 years, I have seen just how brilliantly clear and powerful and ennobling that vision was. Now, as the President of our new US-based entity – B1G1 Giving, Inc. – I’m honored to have the opportunity to help continue and expand our mission. Together, we truly are creating a world full of giving. What could be better than that?” LINDA SADDLEMIRE, TREASURER FORMER HEAD OF GLENDORA, CA BRANCH (RETIRED) CLIFTON LARSON ALLEN LLP (CLA) Linda has more than 35 years of experience in public accounting and has been an active member and ardent supporter of B1G1 since 2012. Now that she has retired, she is happy that she can spend more time championing the giving movement through the Board. “B1G1 entered my life when I was the managing partner of a CPA firm in California. We incorporated the philosophy of tying giving to our work, which helped attach deep purpose in our daily work lives. We also participated in B1G1 Study Tours, which offered life-changing experiences for the participants, including myself. I am delighted to be part of the Board of B1G1 Giving and look forward to supporting this beautiful organization in making the world a better place.” 43 Believe you can and you’re halfway there.
