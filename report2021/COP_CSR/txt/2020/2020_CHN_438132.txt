No CSR issues reported this year. 9.4 CSR SUPPLIERS – AUDITS Our Product Manufacturing suppliers are one of our main stakeholders, and are considered as partners by ATLINKS. We do have a long relationship with most of them, but we are always in the move of qualifying new partners for new kind of products. Our Suppliers Selection and Evaluation process is running for many years, and we do have an excellent track of record for all of them. We do request to them to have different Certified Management Systems: Quality and Environmental; and to achieve the maximum of our confidence, a Health and Safety Management Systems, and a Social Accountability Management System. We also monitor by audits the compliance with the RoHS and REACH regulations to avoid hazardous and prohibited substances in our products (already reported above in this document). Our main partner has fully certified the 4 Management Systems. The selection and Evaluation is based in many criteria, and apart for most of the Quality, Financial, and Operational, we also include Corporate Social Responsibility, including: Environment, Health and Safety, and other criteria based on SA8000 standard, like, Discrimination, Child and Forced Labor, Working hours and Remuneration and Discipline. We do perform every year a complete Evaluation on those criteria for 100% of our Product Suppliers.
