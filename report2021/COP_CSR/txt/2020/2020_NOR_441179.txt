UN Global Compact Communication on Progress (COP) PGS ASA 30-Jun-2020 Re: Statement of continued support To our stakeholders, I am pleased to confirm that PGS reaffirms its support to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption. ln this annual COP we refer to our Corporate Responsibility (CR) report 2019. We have aligned our CR reporting process with the annual financial reporting structure, which means that our CR report is summarizing activities and key figures from the year 2019. We also direct you to the Responsibility section (https://www.pgs.com/responsibility/) of the PGS website for a detailed description of how PGS defines CR work and what topics are included under our CR umbrella. The CR report 2019 and the Responsibility web pages together form the 2019 COP report, as they supplement each other. We commit to sharing this information with stakeholders through our primary communication channels and as part of our annual reporting.
