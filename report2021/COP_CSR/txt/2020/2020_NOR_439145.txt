Annual Report 2019 KLP KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2019 KLP – the pension company for the Norwegian local government and healthcare sector Kommunal Landspensjonskasse (KLP) is an unusual finance company, because we are owned by our customers. This means that all wealth creation in KLP benefits the customers. KLP started out as a partnership of small municipalities across the country to provide good pensions in a strong community. Today, KLP is the preferred pension provider for the Norwegian local government and healthcare sectors, one of Norway's largest finance companies and a mainstay of the Norwegian welfare system, with 459,000 members, 310,000 pensioners and 240,000 former members with pension rights. As a customer-owned company, our main task is to deliver our pension services to the best possible quality and at the lowest possible cost and to obtain the best possible return on the pension money that we manage. KLP is a profitable community When KLP makes a profit, we either use it to boost our financial strength, or we give it to our owners. In both cases, the result is that they have to pay less for their pensions. We have the lowest possible costs, so they get as much as possible for schools and nursing homes or other priority tasks that our owners are responsible for. The way in which KLP runs its business therefore has a direct impact on how our owners discharge their social obligations. In 2019 KLP delivered a historically good result, allowing it to return NOK 2,8 billion to the municipalities, county authorities, health enterprises and companies that are our owners. The result also enabled us to further strengthen supplementary reserves with NOK 8 billion, as a buffer if future results should be weak. In addition, owners’ equity was strengthened by NOK 2.3 billion. Providing sustainable pensions Our most important social responsibility is to provide employees in the Norwegian local government and healthcare sectors with the pensions they are entitled to. We use the influence that comes from the NOK 700 billion that we manage to call for faster progress towards a sustainable society. We do this by integrating corporate responsibility into all our activities, increasing investments that promote sustainable development, pushing companies towards more sustainable operations and developing products and services that contribute to positive social development. Our work is based on international standards, and at KLP we use the UN Sustainable Development Goals as a framework for our work on corporate responsibility. We are open about how we work and invest, because responsible business practice is the key to sustainable development. The aim is to make a difference. This means that as well as safeguarding the pension money for the future, we do so in a way that creates a secure future — for people living now and the coming generations.

The assumptions are based on the market situation as at 31 December 2019 and are in accordance with the recommendations of the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board (NASB). Actuarial assumptions KLP’s joint pension scheme for local authorities and enterprises (“Fellesordningen”): An important part of the basis of pension costs and pension obligations is how mortality and disability develop amongst the members of the pension scheme. KLP has used the K2013BE mortality table based on Finance Norway’s analyses of mortality in life insurance populations in Norway and Statistics Norway’s extrapolations. KLP uses own disability table for actuarial assumptions related to disability, a table based on changes in disability figures in KLPs customer base. Withdrawal of contractual early retirement (AFP) (per cent in relation to remaining employees): The costs of AFP depend on how many in each year-group take AFP. On reaching 62 years there are 42.5 per cent who retire with an AFP pension. It is only those who are employed and working right up to retirement who are entitled to AFP. This is taken into account in the calculation of the AFP obligation.

KLP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT NOTES 229 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2019 To: Board of Directors in Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidige Forsikringsselskap KLP SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Independent statement regarding Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidige Forsikringsselskap’s sustainability reporting We have examined Kommunal Landspensjonskasse Gjensidige Forsikringsselskap’s (KLP) key performance indicators for sustainability (sustainability reporting) as of 19 March 2020. Key performance indicators for sustainability are indicators for sustainability performance that KLP measure and control. Key performance indicators for sustainability are available and included in KLP’s annual report 2019, specifically in the chapter Sustainability Report. KLP has prepared the key performance indicators and explained the basis for their preparation in the notes to the tables containing the key performance indicators (criteria). We have examined the basis for the measurements and checked the calculations of the measurements. Tasks and responsibilities of management Management is responsible for KLP’s sustainability reporting and that the key performance indicators are prepared according to the definitions included in the notes and text in the Sustainability Report. Their responsibility includes developing, implementing and maintaining internal controls that ensure the reporting of the key performance indicators for sustainability. Our independence and quality control We are independent of the company in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our independent statement, and we have fulfilled our ethical obligations in accordance with these requirements and IESBA Code. We use ISQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Statements, and Other Assurance and Related Services Engagements and maintains a comprehensive quality control system including documented policies and procedures of the ethical standards, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory claim. The Auditors responsibilities Our responsibility is to express an opinion on KLP’s sustainability reporting based on our control. We have performed our work and will issue our statement in accordance with the Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000: “Assurance engagements other than audits or review of historical financial information . Our work involves performing procedures to obtain evidence that KLP’s key performance indicators are prepared according to the criteria for reporting and measurements that are explained in the text accompanying the tables containing the key performance indicators. The procedures selected depend on our judgement, including assessments of the risks that the sustainability reporting as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the preparation of the subject matter. Therefore, we design procedures that are appropriate to the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. Our control also includes an assessment of whether the applied criteria are appropriate and an assessment of the overall presentation of the subject matter.

The assumptions are based on the market situation as at 31 December 2019 and are in accordance with the recommendations of the Norwegian Accounting Standards Board (NASB). ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS KLP’s joint pension scheme for local authorities and enterprises (“Fellesordningen”): An important part of the basis of pension costs and pension obligations is how mortality and disability develop amongst the members of the pension scheme. KLP has used the K2013BE mortality table based on Finance Norway’s analyses of mortality in life insurance populations in Norway and Statistics Norway’s extrapolations. KLP uses own disability table for actuarial assumptions related to disability, a table based on changes in disability figures in KLPs customer base. Withdrawal of contractual early retirement (AFP) (per cent in relation to remaining employees): The costs of AFP depend on how many in each year-group take AFP. On reaching 62 years there are 42.5 per cent who retire with an AFP pension. It is only those who are employed and working right up to retirement who are entitled to AFP. This is taken into account in the calculation of the AFP obligation.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The Group’s business activities has in general been unchanged compared to the previous year. There has not been any regulatory changes, transactions or other events with material impact on the 2019 financial statements. Therefore, the key audit matters relevant for our audit have been the same in 2019 as for the prior year audit. Key Audit Matter How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter Valuation of investment properties We have focused on this area because it We have evaluated and tested the design and operating represents a substantial part of the assets effectiveness of the group’s internal controls over on the balance sheet and the lack of a valuation of investment properties.

We confirmed that the model calculation was appropriately reflecting Refer to note 3.2, 7 and 16 in the the valuation model and assumptions selected. consolidated financial statements for a further description of the valuation of investment properties. We tested that all investment properties had been subject to valuation by comparing the list of properties in the valuation model against the list of properties booked in the accounting system. We compared the output from the valuation model against the external valuations for a selection of the properties. Management explained significant deviations and we challenged the basis for their view of why the deviations did not warrant a change in book values. We also assessed and came to the conclusion that the information about investment properties were sufficient and adequate.

We have reviewed the actuary’s recalculation of the premium reserves, which the actuary has compared against the premium reserve calculated by the insurance Refer to note 2.14, 3.1, 9.1 and 21 in the system. Furthermore, we have reviewed the group’s roll consolidated financial statements for a forward of technical provisions within life insurance and further description of the calculation of compared the result of this roll forward against the technical provisions – life insurance. technical provisions calculated by the insurance system. The recalculations do not show a significant deviation against the technical provisions calculated by the insurance systems. We have assessed the methodology and tested the significant assumptions applied e.g. risk of mortality, risk of disability, risk of survival and discount rates. In our view, the calculation of technical provisions in life insurance was subject to controls with appropriate design and operating effectiveness. The assumptions in the calculations were applied consistently and in accordance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. We also considered and found that the information regarding the insurance liabilities in notes to the financial statements is sufficient and adequate.

Other information Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises information in the annual report, except the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements The Board of Directors and the Managing Director (Management) are responsible for the preparation in accordance with law and regulations, including fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. (4) KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONSKASSE AUDITORS´REPORT 361 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Independent Auditor's Report Kommunal Landspensjonskasse gjensidig forsikringsselskap In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s and the KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONSKASSE – ACCOUNTS Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with laws, regulations, and auditing standards and practices generally accepted in Norway, including ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: • identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's or the Group's internal control. • evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. • conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern. • evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. • obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. (5) KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONSKASSE AUDITORS´REPORT 362 KLP ANNUAL REPORT 2019 Independent Auditor's Report Kommunal Landspensjonskasse gjensidig forsikringsselskap We communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and KOMMUNAL LANDSPENSJONSKASSE – ACCOUNTS timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements Opinion on the Board of Directors’ report Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, it is our opinion that the information presented in the Board of Directors’ report and in the statements on Corporate Social Responsibility concerning the financial statements, the going concern assumption and the proposed allocation of the result is consistent with the financial statements and complies with the law and regulations. Opinion on Registration and Documentation Based on our audit of the financial statements as described above, and control procedures we have considered necessary in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, it is our opinion that management has fulfilled its duty to produce a proper and clearly set out registration and documentation of the Company’s accounting information in accordance with the law and bookkeeping standards and practices generally accepted in Norway.
