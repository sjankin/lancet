THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES Statement of compliance The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). For the purposes of reporting under the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015, the balance sheet in these financial statements is represented by the statement of financial position and the profit and loss account is presented in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) i) New standards and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2019 Impact of initial application of IFRS 16 Leases In the current year, the company for the first time, has applied IFRS 16 Leases (as issued by the IASB in January 2016) that is effective for annual periods that begin on or after 1 January 2019. IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant changes to the lease accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease requirements and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. The impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 on the Company’s financial statements is described below. The date of initial application of IFRS 16 for the Company is 1 January 2019. The Company has chosen the modified retrospective application of IFRS 16 in accordance with IFRS 16:C5 (b). Consequently, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17. Impact of the new definition of a lease The Company has made use of the practical expedient available on transition to IFRS 16 not to reassess whether a contract is or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of a lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC 4 will continue to be applied to those leases entered or modified before 1 January 2019 The change in definition of a lease mainly relates to the concept of control. IFRS 16 determines whether a contract contains a lease on the basis of whether the customer has the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. This is in contrast to the focus on ‘risks and rewards’ in IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The Company has applied the definition of a lease and related guidance set out in IFRS 16 to all lease contracts entered into or modified on or after 1 January 2019 (whether it is a lessor or a lessee in the lease contract). In preparation for the first‑time application of IFRS 16, the Company carried out an assessment of all the lease contracts. The assessment has shown that the new definition in IFRS 16 does not change significantly the scope of contracts that meet the definition of a lease for the Company Integrated Report and Financial Statements 29 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Statement of compliance (Continued) i) New standards and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued) Impact on Lessee Accounting Former operating leases IFRS 16 changes how the Company accounts for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, which were off-balance-sheet i) Applying IFRS 16, for all leases (except as noted below), the Company: ii) Recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the statement of financial position, initially measured at the present value of future lease payments; iii) Recognizes depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the statement of profit or loss; and iv) Separates the total amount of cash paid into a principal portion (presented within financing activities) and interest (presented within operating activities) in the statement of cash flows. Lease incentives (e.g. rent-free period) are recognized as part of the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities whereas under IAS 17 they resulted in the recognition of a lease incentive liability, amortised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis. Under IFRS 16, right-of-use-assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 impairment of Assets. This replaces the previous requirement to recognize a provision for onerous lease contracts. For short-term leases (lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low-value assets (such as personal computers and office furniture), the company has opted to recognize a lease expense on a straight-line basis as permitted by IFRS 16. This expense is presented within other expenses in the statement of profit or loss. Former finance leases The main difference between IFRS 16 and IAS 17 with respect to assets formerly held under a finance lease is the measurement of residual value guarantees provided by a lease to a lessor. IFRS 16 requires that the Company recognises as part of its lease liability only the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, rather than the maximum amount guaranteed as required by IAS 17. This change did not have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 30 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (continued) i) New standards and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued) Impact on Lessor Accounting IFRS 16 does not change substantially how a lessor accounts for leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types of leases differently. However, IFRS 16 has changed and expanded the disclosures required, in particular regarding how a lessor manages the risks arising from this residual interest in leased assets. Under IFRS 16, an intermediate lessor accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The intermediate lessor is required to classify the sublease as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease (and not by reference to the underlying asset as was the case under IAS 17). The amendments on lessor accounting did not have an impact on financial statements of the Company. Financial impact of the initial application of IFRS 16 2019 Sh’000 Impact on profit or loss Increase in depreciation of right-of-use asset 27,623 Increase in finance cost 6,468 Decrease in rent expense (28,969) Decrease in profit for the year 5,122 In the current year, the Company has applied a number of amendments to IFRS Standards and Interpretations issued by the IASB that are effective for an annual period that begins on or after 1 January 2019. Their adoption has not had any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts reported in these financial statements. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 31 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (continued) i) New standards and amendments to published standards effective for the year ended 31 December 2019 (Continued) Impact of application of IFRIC 23 Uncertainties over Income Tax Treatments The Company has adopted IFRIC 23 for the first time in the current year. The interpretation addresses the determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates, when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments under IAS 12. It specifically considers: • Whether tax treatments should be considered collectively • Assumptions for taxation authorities’ examinations • The determination of taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates • The effect of changes in facts and circumstances The application of IFRIC 23 had no material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Company’s financial statements. Impact of application of Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle The company has adopted the amendments included in the Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 cycle. The annual improvements make amendments to the following standards: • IFRS 3 and IFRS 11 The amendments to IFRS 3 clarify that when an entity obtains control of a business that is a joint operation, it remeasures previously held interests in that business. The amendments to IFRS 11 clarify that when an entity obtains joint control of a business that is a joint operation, the entity does not remeasure previously held interests in that business. • IAS 12 The amendments clarify that all income tax consequences of dividends (i.e. distribution of profits) should be recognised in profit or loss, regardless of how the tax arises. • IAS 23 The amendments clarify that if any specific borrowing remains outstanding after the related asset is ready for its intended use or sale, that borrowing becomes part of the funds that an entity borrows generally when calculating the capitalisation rate on general borrowings. The application of these amendments had no material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in the Company’s financial statements. ii) New and revised standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Company has not applied the following new and revised IFRS Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (continued) ii) New and revised standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the Company has not applied the following new and revised IFRS Standards that have been issued but are not yet effective. Effective for annual periods New standards and Amendments to standards beginning on or after IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts 1-Jan-22 Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a business 1-Jan-20 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of material 1-Jan-20 Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS standards 1-Jan-20 The directors do not expect that the adoption of the Standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company in future periods, except as noted below Amendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a business The amendments clarify that while businesses usually have outputs, outputs are not required for an integrated set of activities and assets to qualify as a business. To be considered a business an acquired set of activities and assets must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. Additional guidance is provided that helps to determine whether a substantive process has been acquired. The amendments introduce an optional concentration test that permits a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. Under the optional concentration test, the acquired set of activities and assets is not a business if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar assets. The amendments are applied prospectively to all business combinations and asset acquisitions for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 January 2020, with early application permitted. The Directors of the Company are currently assessing the impact of these amendments and plan to adopt the amendments on the required effective date if necessary.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Application of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) (continued) ii) New and revised standards in issue but not yet effective (continued) Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of material The amendments are intended to make the definition of material in IAS 1 easier to understand and are not intended to alter the underlying concept of materiality in IFRS Standards. The concept of ‘obscuring’ material information with immaterial information has been included as part of the new definition. The threshold for materiality influencing users has been changed from ‘could influence’ to ‘could reasonably be expected to influence’. The definition of material in IAS 8 has been replaced by a reference to the definition of material in IAS 1. In addition, the IASB amended other Standards and the Conceptual Framework that contain a definition of material or refer to the term ‘material’ to ensure consistency. The amendments are applied prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, with earlier application permitted. The Directors of the Company are currently assessing the impact of these amendments and plan to adopt the amendments on the required effective date if necessary. Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards Together with the revised Conceptual Framework, which became effective upon publication on 29 March 2018, the IASB has also issued Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards. The document contains amendments to IFRS 2, IFRS 3, IFRS 6, IFRS 14, IAS 1, IAS 8, IAS 34, IAS 37, IAS 38, IFRIC 12, IFRIC 19, IFRIC 20, IFRIC 22, and SIC-32. Not all amendments, however, update those pronouncements with regard to references to and quotes from the framework so that they refer to the revised Conceptual Framework. Some pronouncements are only updated to indicate which version of the Framework they are referencing to (the IASC Framework adopted by the IASB in 2001, the IASB Framework of 2010, or the new revised Framework of 2018) or to indicate that definitions in the Standard have not been updated with the new definitions developed in the revised Conceptual Framework. The amendments, where they actually are updates, are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020, with early application permitted. iii) Early adoption of standards The Group did not early-adopt any new or amended standards in 2019.¬¬ Integrated Report and Financial Statements 34 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain properties and financial instruments that are measured at revalued amounts or fair values at the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated and company financial statements is determined on such a basis. In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which is described as follows:• Level 1 inputs are quoted in prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement dated. • Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, and • Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Functional and presentation currency These financial statements are presented in Kenya shillings (Sh) which is the Group’s functional currency, the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Except as otherwise indicated, financial information presented in Kenya Shillings has been rounded to the nearest thousand (Sh 000). Basis of consolidation (a) Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiaries is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 35 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued) Basis of consolidation (continued) (a) Subsidiaries (continued) Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the recognised amounts of acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date; any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration that is deemed to be an asset or liability is recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the total of consideration transferred, non-controlling interest recognised and previously held interest measured is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiaries acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. When necessary amounts reported by subsidiaries have been adjusted to conform with the Group’s accounting policies. The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries, LASER Infrastructure & Technology Solution Limited, LASER Property Services Limited and LASER Insurance Brokers Limited all having financial year end 31 December 2019. (c) Disposal of subsidiaries When the Group ceases to have control any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value at the date when control is lost, with the change in carrying amount recognised in profit or loss. The fair value is the initial carrying amount for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset. In addition, any amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are accounted for as if the group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. This may mean that amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 36 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Revenue recognition Administration income Administration income is billed to customers and is recognised upon performance of services or at a point when the performance obligations associated with these services has been satisfied Consultancy fees Consultancy fees is recognised upon performance of service at a point when the performance obligations associated with these services has been satisfied Other income Includes interest income from staff loans, interest on fixed deposit and loss/gain on revaluation of investment property among other sources of sundry incomes for the Group. Income is recognized at a point in time when earned. Plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges. Depreciation Depreciation on equipment is calculated on a reducing balance basis to write-off the cost of the equipment over the expected useful life at the following annual rates: Motor vehicles 25% Fixtures and fittings 12.5% Equipment 12.5% Computers 30% Gain or loss arising on disposal of property and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss. Intangible assets-computer software costs Costs incurred on computer software are accounted for at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated on a reducing balance basis over the estimated useful lives not exceeding a period of 4 years. Investment properties Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 37 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Investment properties (continued) An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised. Dividends payable Dividends payable on ordinary shares are charged to retained earnings in the period in which they are declared. Proposed dividends are not accrued for until ratified in an Annual General Meeting. Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. (i) Current tax The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. (ii) Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 38 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Taxation (continued) (iii) Current and deferred tax for the year Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Employee benefits costs i) Group’s defined contribution retirement benefit scheme The Group operates a defined contribution and benefit schemes for eligible employees. The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund. The Group’s contributions to the defined contribution plan are charged to the profit or loss in the year to which they relate. ii) Statutory defined contribution pension scheme The Group also is exempt from contributing to the statutory National Social Security Fund. This is a defined contribution scheme registered under the National Social Security Act. The Group’s obligations under the scheme are limited to specific contributions legislated from time to time. iii) Other employee entitlements Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees. A provision is made for the estimated liability for annual leave or compensated absences accrued at the end of the reporting period. Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At the end of each reporting period, the group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 39 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill (continued) Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Financial instruments A financial asset or liability is recognised when the company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets Trade receivables (IFRS 9) Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for services performed in the ordinary course of business. If collection is expected in one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. Receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of receivables is established using an ECL model in line with the requirements of IFRS 9 as outlined in the next section below. The amount of the provision is the difference between the carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. The amount of the provision is charged to profit or loss. Impairment of financial assets (IFRS 9) The Group recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses on investments in debt instruments that are measured at amortised cost or at FVTOCI, lease receivables, trade receivables and contract assets. The amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition of the respective financial instrument. The Group always recognises lifetime ECL for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors, general economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the reporting date, including time value of money where appropriate. For all other financial instruments, the Group recognises lifetime ECL when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. However, if the credit risk on the financial instrument has not increased significantly since initial recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for that financial instrument at an amount equal to 12 month ECL. Integrated Report and Financial Statements 40 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2019 1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued) Financial assets (continued) Impairment of financial assets (IFRS 9) (continued) The Group considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due unless the Group has reasonable and supportable information to demonstrate that a more lagging default criterion is more appropriate. Classification (IFRS 9) As at the reporting date, all the Groups financial assets were at amortised cost. The Group determines the appropriate classification of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets at amortised cost Financial assets including cash and bank balances, staff mortgages and loans, trade and other receivables and related party balances are measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met and the asset is not designated as FVTPL: • the asset is held within a business model that is Held-to-Collect (HTC) as described below, and • the contractual terms of the instrument give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI). Comparatives Where necessary, comparative figures have been adjusted to conform with changes in presentation in the current year.

The capital structure of the Company consists of equity attributable to equity holders, comprising issued share capital and retained earnings. The Company monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. The constitution of capital managed by the Company is as shown below: Group Company 2019 2018 2019 2018 Sh’000 Sh’000 Sh’000 Sh’000 Ordinary Share capital 10,000 10,000 10,000 10,000 Share premium 190,000 190,000 190,000 190,000 Retained earnings 471,985 285,818 425,313 301,926 Equity 671,985 485,818 625,313 501,926 b) Credit risk management Credit risk arises from cash and deposits with banks and financial institutions as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company. Management assesses the credit quality of each customer, taking into account its financial position, past experiences and other factors. Individual risk limits are set based on internal ratings in accordance with limits set by management. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored.
