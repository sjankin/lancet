This was confirmed during 2018, another year of stable performance both financially and with regard to environmental and societal aspects, in which we stayed true to our commitment to create value for all stakeholders. In 2018 the company’s turnover increased by 1% compared to 2017 to 4,269 mil MKD. We achieved slight increase in sales volumes of cement and aggregates and continued our efforts to strengthen the level of services and provide convenience to our customers in order to meet their needs and remain their preferred supplier of high-quality products. We continued to invest in our operations with capital expenditures increase of 20 mil MKD compared to 2017, totalling 277 mil MKD. Environment protection and undertaking initiatives that improve our performance in minimizing the impact of our operations to the environment remained an important goal throughout 2018. In this regard, by introducing and implementing state-of-the-art technologies available in our industry we continued our activities in decreasing emissions, increasing energy efficiency and preserving natural resources, thus contributing to reduction of global warming. As part of these efforts, we started using alternative fuels as replacement for fossil fuels, with up to 15% replacement rate. This is an important step in the right direction in the process of combating climate change as one of the greatest global challenges of our time. Our people remain our biggest asset and investments in their knowledge and skills, as well as health and safety were also among our highest priorities in 2018. We implemented numerous activities in furthering their professional development, attracting and developing talents and maintaining a safe working environment. The efforts in the area of professional development and health and safety are extended to our suppliers and subcontractors through various trainings and application of policies and tools for near miss reporting and hazard identification. 8 Annual Sustainability Report 2018 Message from the CED Cementarnica USJE has been working relentlessly to build and maintain its position of a socially responsible company by engaging with the local community. In 2018 we continued implementing initiatives for fostering employability of young people and our cooperation with local schools and universities in realization of various activities in the area of quality education and environment protection. We hosted many stakeholders at our premises, provided internships and worked with environmental NGOs, while our employees were part of community actions for planting trees, waste cleaning and use of alternative means of transportation. Our commitment to doing business in a financially, socially and environmentally responsible way is reflected in our ongoing participation in the UN Global Compact and the endorsement of its principles. In 2018 we demonstrated progress across all major areas of sustainability: economic, environmental and social, and also aligned our sustainability targets for 2030 with UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the defined Sustainability Development Goals.
