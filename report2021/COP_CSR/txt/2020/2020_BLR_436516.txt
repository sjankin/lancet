Despite the technological, organizational regulating various taxes and fees on its activity, thereby the in the EU will decrease by 0.4%. of steel production in China. multidirectional price trends in and administrative solutions established at the republican probability of tax risk formation There is no rise, the usual The process of reducing the segment of raw materials, in the production activities and local level in Republic of is estimated as low. stimulating measures do not metallurgical capacities in the main effect on marginality ensure enhanced efficiency Belarus, various tax laws and Industry Risks help too much. Because of this, China, which began in 2016, is provided by the price level. regulations are in effect and Metallurgic industry is is still ongoing, but despite Thus, scrap’s notional cost is subject to frequent changes, distinguished by its susceptibility this, steel production in China USD240 per ton , and iron ore additions, amendments. At to cyclic variations of prices is growing, since when one – USD90 per ton (depending on that, the amendments are for raw materials and steel. enterprise closes, new ones the region). Plants operating partly made for the benefit of Demand for steel is determined are opened, including through on iron ore raw materials taxpayers and partly – to their by country-specific levels of mergers and acquisitions. have a rather high margin, disadvantage. Similar situation economic development and Liberalization of the Chinese while enterprises operating is observed in the field of consumption by major steelreal estate market brought new on scrap metal balance on the 48 49 in most countries of the world of risks associated with market with interrupted raw materials there is practically no expansion environments, however, for supplies, it is essential to of demand for steel products, Belarusian enterprises the provide for availability of while new capacities appear. said risks still present a certain “winter buffer” reserves of A reaction to the growing hazard. Concentration of mining such raw materials. imbalance is protectionism. companies and take-over of Industrial Safety, Labour protectionist practices. scrap-producing enterprises Protection and Ecological Risks In 2018, there is a trend by steelmaking companies can We admit that metallurgy of introduction of various result in an additional increase is a potential hazard to the measures (duties, quotas, in prices for raw materials environment and to the people licenses, etc.) in the world with rather limited alternative since such production activities steel industry with the purpose opportunities for steel raw involve high-temperature to protect domestic markets material supplies. In recent processes, aggressive chemical against “unfair exporters”. The years, metallurgists began to environments, volatile byWTO called this trend a “trade actively buy modern equipment product emissions and require war”. The risk of closing of the for their scrap companies, special arrangements in markets from import belongs, absorb the most promising connection with disposal of first of all, to economic policy procurement companies. solid and liquid industrial waste. risks and is very significant since Country and Regional Risks Due to the above, steelmaking it has a direct negative impact Production and business enterprises have to provide for on productive, marketing activities of OJSC “BSW — strict compliance with rather and financial activities of the management company of stringent regulations with metallurgical enterprises. In «BMC» holding” are largely regard to labour protection, March 2018, duties on all steel dependent on cooperation with industrial and fire safety and (25%) and aluminum products Russia. Such close interaction (10%) were introduced in the with a single independent environmental protection. United States in accordance region presents certain risks Ecological requirements with section 232 of the U.S. associated with differences include compulsory payments National Security Act.

These measures have minimization of regional lowering of critical pollutant also been initiated by many economic risks and possible concentrations could result in countries of the world. effects on the enterprise’s increased amounts of obligatory For minimization of this risk, activities resulting from them. payments and fines stipulated OJSC “BSW — management Priorities will include flexible for violations of the law. company of «BMC» holding” supply geography, ensuring carries out an active marketing prompt response to the and sales policy on expansion of environment challenges and market outlets (search for new protection against possible markets and diversification of regional crises. the existing ones). Winter supplies of major By consolidating, raw materials can be affected manufacturers of metal by weather conditions. In order products provide for a reduction to minimize risks associated 50 51 Short-term Targets of the Plant In 2019, the global metal products market is unstable, there is a decrease in prices, and, moreover, product prices are falling at a faster pace than prices for basic metallurgical raw materials. According to the results of the first half of the year, the growth rate of production in actual prices amounted to 107.3%, the growth rate of industrial production in terms of representative goods basket (RGB) was 109.3%, and the export growth rate was 100.5%. Proceeds from sales of products were Br 1.595 million which is higher by 8.2% than those Financial Support Provided by the Government of the first half of 2018. The marketing service of the enterprise (taking into account information from world According to resolutions of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Belarus of June 2, analytical sources) does not give a forecast for a cardinal change in the situation in foreign 2018 No. 418 “Concerning reimbursement of bank loan interest to legal entities implementing markets. With this in mind, revenue from sales of USD 1.48 billion is forecasted for 2019. investment projects in 2018” in 2018 OJSC “BSW – management company of “BMC” holding» was reimbursed the bank loan interest in the amount of Br 11.1 million (USD 5.4 million). The above mentioned amount of state support received by the BSW reduced the deficiency of the circulating assets and allowed the enterprise to use this source of assets for replenishment of own circulating assets – payment for raw materials, payment of wages and freight forwarding by rail. Indirect Economic Impacts The Byelorussian Steel Works’ policy in the of the plant collected Br11,400.00 for rendering field of charity and sponsorship is aimed at charitable assistance. These funds were provided facilitation of the formation of the socially for surgical procedures and rehabilitation, accepted image of the efficiently operating purchase of expensive drugs to the needy including and socially responsible enterprise, to affect to children. A portion of the funds was transferred the public recognition of the social importance to Belarusian Peace Foundation, Belarusian Red of metallurgy, to consolidate its standing and Cross Society, Zhlobin social-pedagogical asylum enhance the loyalty to the BSW on the part of and other organizations. all interactive groups and the civil society. Factory workers do not stop helping the needy The priority directions of corporate charity throughout the year. Thus, the trade-union and sponsorship are determined as follows: committee and the management of the Belarusian environment, support of social facilities in the steel works presents New Year and Christmas gifts area of the plant location. not only to the workers and their children, but The BSW employees personally participate also to pupils of social asylums and patients of in charity actions. During the years of nursing care hospitals. implementation of this objective, an effective Participation of the factory workers in mechanism of operative assistance to people the action of fund raising on purchase of has been developed. school supplies «Kind September 1» became In 2017, the plant’s workers actively traditional. It should be noted that within the participated in the following charity actions: “All fund raising inside the enterprise, the workers children are ours”, “Do good”, “They need your organized a fund-raising campaign on their help”, “Wishing tree” and others. During the year, charity actions with own initiative for those colleagues who have participation of the BSW employees take place children of school age. In 2018, the factory in educational and health care organizations of workers collected Br 1,124.6 in total within the the city and the district. In 2017, the employees framework of action “Kind September 1”. Realization of the scheduled activities had a favorable impact on the plant cooperation with the main groups of stakeholders: authorities, civil society, ecology community and employees. It helped to strengthen the BSW reputation as a socially responsible enterprise and achieve the highest social and economic efficiency from the money spent on charity and sponsorship purposes. 52 53 ENVIRONMENTRELATED ACTIVITY 54 55 Environmental Policy Key Principles and Approaches The enterprise acknowledges the environmental security. and evaluated them by their Long-term strategic objectives determined by the plant for ecological and environmental that its production activity is Implementation of the state significance.

The EMS system adopted by the OJSC “BSW – management company of “BMC” holding” was certified for compliance with the requirements of standards ISО 14001:2015 and STB ISO 14001-2017. The requirements of ISО 14001:2015 cover such activities as design and production of rolled sections and structural shapes, wire rod, seamless pipes, steel cord, wire and steel fiber. The requirements of STB ISO 14001-2017 cover design, development and production of concast billet, section and shaped materials, wire rod, seamless pipes, steel cord, steel wire and fiber. This is the evidence of the systematic approach implemented to reduce ecological risk probability, minimize ecological payments, represent the BSW as an ecologically responsible enterprise and improve interaction with the stakeholders on issues of ensuring compliance with ecological regulations and requirements. In addition to the currently effective approved medium-term ecological programs, the BSW provides for annual development and approval by respective supervision authorities of ecological control programs and environmental protection plans, which, among other things, envisage regular ecological monitoring and control activities in accordance with the Instruction on Environmental Control of Production, rational use of natural resources. Use of natural resources and environmental protection at the enterprise are managed by administrative control actions and economic methods. 56 57 Implementation of Ecological Strategy to point out motherwort (Artemisiavulgaris), on agricultural lands are: a sky lark (Alauda white clover (Trifoliumrepens), and couch-grass arvensis), a whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), a Minimizing the plant’s impact Berezinsky region which is rich in meadows, (Elytrigiarepens) among the ruderal types. gray wren-babbler (Sylvia communis), yellow on the region’s vital activities and a part of which is represented by Description of the fauna of the territory hammer (Emberiza citrinella).
