We have not found any evidence that important issues are not stated or improperly stated. The Verifier has reviewed the overall documents first after requesting the government’s management evaluations; various disclosed and officially announced data and evidentiary materials in relation to the details stated in the Report. Then, the on-site verification1) has been Recommendations conducted in a very limited way. Various environmental, social and economic data and others were confirmed their consistency and matching The Verifier makes the following recommendations for LH to build up and enhance its corporation-wide competence of sustainable management with collected data. And a number of claims in the Report were confirmed by checking relevant interviews and evidentiary materials so as to and to improve reliability of the Sustainability Report: secure the reliability of the verification. We have checked if the financial data included in the Report was properly retrieved from the financial statement made official in the pubic organizations’ management information disclosure system ‘ALIO (http://www.alio.go.kr)’, and we have also checked if the information on greenhouse gas was matched with the verification opinion from a professional organization. Errors found during the verification process or corrections made for improperly stated contents have been reviewed and confirmed through the final version of the Report. Regarding the reporting boundary of the Report, data and information on the outside of the organization (Ex: partner Companies) was excluded from the verification scope. We are clearly stating here that the results may be different if an additional verification is conducted in the future. The verification opinion has been drawn up for the management and stakeholders of LH. However, we are clearly stating that we do not LH is highly recognized for setting mid & long-term tasks to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gases and have any reparation or common liabilities for any consequences after an individual or an organization makes decision based on the opinion. establishing comprehensive measures to respond to greenhouse gas credits as it considers the response to climate crisis as an importance matter. We would like to recommend that LH not only responds to the goal of reducing Verification Result and Opinion greenhouse gases but also sets and manages its own objective for converting into a low carbon company. The Verifier has confirmed that the Report was made in accordance with Core Option of the GRI Standard. At the same time, we have not found LH is also recommended to secure balance of the Report by reporting positive and negative views anything that would lead us believe there is a significant error in the information disclosed through Universal Standards and Topic specific on the main issues to strengthen communications among various stakeholders.
