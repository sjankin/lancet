The number of outbound Japanese passengers decreased year-on-year, resulting in more foreigners visiting Japan than Japanese going abroad for the first time in 45 years. JAL took advantage of robust inbound demand to achieve a record high load factor, while also employing the revenue management system to raise unit passenger revenue and expanding marketing channels for new products and services. Despite these efforts, we saw unit passenger revenue decline by 2.6% from the year before due to lower fuel surcharges. At a time when initiatives are being pursued to reinforce and expand the functions of Haneda and Narita as Japan’s two largest air transportation hubs, JAL opened new Shanghai (Pudong) and Guangzhou routes with daytime service from Haneda and added new flights on its Beijing route in fiscal 2015. We also introduced service between Narita and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the major hub of American Airlines, our transpacific joint business partner. This route has improved connectivity to U.S. and Latin American destinations. We are continuing to introduce aircraft with the JAL SKY SUITE configuration centering on our European and Southeast Asian routes.

In fiscal 2015, JALPAK handled 243,000 passengers traveling to overseas destinations, down 11.7% from the previous year, partly due to uncertainties in Europe.

JAL NAVIA is the primary contact center for the JAL Group. Our employees are 97.5% We take the utmost care to make it easy for anyone to work women, and our management is 90.0% women as well. As head of the Osaka Center, I am simultaneously responsible for managing the business and educating our staff, and to show their talents in our workplaces. while also participating in the overall company operations. I started my career as a cabin attendant. My first experience in a different type of job was in the Labor Services Department. I was appointed to my current position in 2013 after serving as head of the Kansai Airport branch of Japan Asia Airways, the JAL Osaka Airport Cabin Attendants Office and the Narita Cabin Attendants Department. The many opportunities I have been given along the way have brought me to this point. It is not unusual these days for employees to build careers beyond their original positions in much the same way. In addition to childcare leave and child nursing leave, we established a system at JAL NAVIA that enables employees to choose four-hour shifts until their children enter elementary school, and that allows both male and female employees who leave the company to Kyoko Furuta return to their original position within a seven-year period. Osaka Center Head and Executive Officer, We also established Nadeshiko Navia in fiscal 2016 as part of our activities aimed JAL NAVIA Co., Ltd. at assuring a work-life balance. We will continue our efforts to create a workplace environment which enables women to play vital roles and shine. We have a target of doubling the number of women in management positions, such as director, general manager or above, by fiscal 2018. I certainly hope that working women will never let their opportunities slip away, but will continue to aspire to step up to the next level.
