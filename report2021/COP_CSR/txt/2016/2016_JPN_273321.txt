Epson Group Sustainability Report 2016 50 Management of Chemical Substances in Products Epson gives preference to lower-impact alternatives when selecting the components and raw materials that make up its products. Management of Chemical Substances in Products Increasing international restrictions on substances used in products, notably the RoHS Directive and REACH regulation in Europe, have made it essential to closely control the type and quantity of materials used.

We investigate regulations and chemical hazards as early as possible, analyze the information we obtain, and then supply products accordingly. -Measures for Meeting the RoHS Directive Epson has made compatibility with the European RoHS directive2 a standard feature of its entire lineup of products throughout the world, regardless of whether a particular product is bound for the European market or not. Phthalate esters (DEHP, BBP, DBP, and DIBP) will be added to the list of restricted substances in July 2019. Epson began looking into alternatives to these substances in 2009 and by March 2014 had eliminated them from all but a few industrial products and products in inventory. 2 The European RoHS Directive restricts the use of the following six hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment: lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl (PBB), and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) Epson Group Sustainability Report 2016 51 -Actions for REACH Compliance Epson has stayed compliant with the requirements of REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) legislation in Europe. Under REACH, companies that manufacture or import chemical substances must register them in a central database. If a product contains harmful substances (such as substances of very high concern), the company must disclose the substances, notify government authorities, and search for alternatives.

Here we present examples of such environmentally-conscious transportation initiatives in which we introduced high cube containers1 and changed our shipping method. 1 With a height of 9 ft 6 in (about 2.6 m), they are 1 ft (about 30 cm) taller than standard containers, whose height is 8 feet 6 inches (about 2.3 m). Topic 1: Improving Transport Efficiency with High Cube Containers Currently, high cube containers account for about 70% of shipping containers in the marketplace. Hitherto, Epson has used the standard type of container for shipping products from its factories, but with the widespread adoption of high cube containers, we are gradually making the switch. Since the inner dimensions of the containers are higher, palletizing products for standard containers resulted in wasted space amounting to about 10%. Optimizing the pallets for high cube containers reduces the number of containers required, contributLQJWRUHGXFLQJHQYLURQPHQWDOLPSDFWE\UDLVLQJWUDQVSRUWDWLRQHƒ¥FLHQF\ Says Koyuru Naito of Epson‚Äôs Logistics Planning Department who led the initiative, ‚ÄúAll of our arrangements including the number of products shipped and the height of the pallet racks in our ZDUHKRXVHVZHUHRSWLPL]HGIRUSDOOHWVL]HVWRƒ±WVWDQGDUGFRQWDLQHUV,QRUGHUWRLQWURGXFHKLJK cube containers, it was necessary to ask for the cooperation of the warehouse managers at sales companies who receive the containers.

Stress Diagnoses Since 2004, all employees in Japan have received an occupational stress diagnosis when they get their periodic medical checkup. The main purpose is to help employees practice self-care when they feel stress. Occupational physicians, nurses, and industrial counselors follow up with employees diagnosed as highly stressed. This has facilitated early detection and response to mental health troubles. Nationally, a stress diagnosis system came into force in December 2015 based on the Industrial Safety and Health Act. We have updated our own diagnoses by adding considerations required by the law. We have established Group stress diagnosis standards WKDWZHUHGHOLEHUDWHGE\WKH6DIHW\DQG+HDOWK&RPPLWWHHVRI*URXSFRPSDQLHVSODQWVDQGRƒ¥FHVLQ-DSDQ6WDUWLQJLQ)< our stress diagnoses follow these standards.

We have established internal rules that set forth criteria for selecting excellent supplier candidates that can provide us with a stable supply of quality parts and raw materials at fair prices. In accordance with this rule, we now undertake a new supplier evaluation that focuses on appropriate environmental management, fair employment practices, and legalistic approaches to human rights and so on. We decide our suppliers based on this evaluation. We also conduct a comprehensive annual evaluation of every supplier with which we do regular business.

By reviewing the evaluation result, we can gain a clearer picture of a supplier and its practices, therefore contributing to stable supply. If a supplier receives a poor evaluation, we ask the company concerned to submit a corrective action plan. We then re-evaluate the supplier and provide feedback about the results. This process aims to achieve better and stronger relationship with our suppliers. On the other hand, we have set a procedure to terminate transactions with suppliers that have consistently failed periodical evaluations. A supplier that demonstrates poor results for two successive years is put on a watch list, with transactions suspended if this continues for two more years. ,QWKHƒ±VFDO\HDUZHHYDOXDWHGDSSUR[LPDWHO\EXVLQHVVXQLWVRIFRPSDQLHV:HDOVRSUHVHQWHGVXSSOLHUVZLWK Epson‚Äôs Procurement Guidelines and communicated our approach to CSR, which aims to foster trust with all stakeholders, to develop goodwill with the local and international communities, and to contribute to improving society as a whole.
