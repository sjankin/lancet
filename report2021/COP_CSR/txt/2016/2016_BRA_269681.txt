OUR OPERATIONS 2015 Sustainability Report OUR PRODUCTS OVERVIEW GRI G4 INDEX OUR PEOPLE OVERVIEW ∂ Introduction Letter from the CEO Introduction Timeline Performance Scorecard Our Strategy Whirlpool Corporation is the world’s leading manufacturer of major home appliances with record Awards revenue of $20.9 billion in 2015. Our winning portfolio includes trusted appliance brands OUR OPERATIONS throughout the world. OUR PRODUCTS OUR PEOPLE For 104 years, we have been persistent and mindful that there is “no right way to do a wrong thing.” In 2015, we continued our unique sense of responsibility, and are now adding to it by investing to create positive impacts by “doing the right things, the right way.” The right things are those that continue our tradition of GRI G4 INDEX saving time, effort, money, and resources for people in their homes, while investing to lessen our own footprint. Whirlpool Corporation does this by creating purposeful innovation that allows for consumer choice, high performance, and lower environmental impact. This enables people to spend more time doing the things they want to do, like spending time with family and friends creating moments that matter. Investing in our innovation enables us to exceed our consumers’ expectation on both core and environmental performance. We are investing in technologies and lowering our own footprints in the communities in which we operate by using renewables, cutting the resources we use to make products, reusing waste, and recycling our products at the end-of-life. By looking at the entire life of our products using life cycle approaches, combined with our thought leadership, we are addressing the needs of today’s consumer while creating a clear path forward to continuous improvement. We achieve even better results by reaching out to our partners, suppliers, governments, non-governmental agencies and academia, creating collaborations and innovations to help people live more sustainably without compromise. While we continue to innovate throughout the world, launching great products, we are also making a social impact, working with local agencies and organizations to build better communities. Whether it is through our brands who have chosen national charities to sponsor, local charity donations or the thousands of hours volunteered by our employees, we think it is important to help create a collective social impact in communities where we live and work. 02 2 015 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T OVERVIEW Introduction ∂ Letter from the CEO Letter from the CEO Timeline Performance Scorecard Our Strategy Whirlpool Corporation has a long history creating opportunities for people and the communities in which Awards they live. To achieve this success, Whirlpool has operated on a simple guiding principle — “There is no right OUR OPERATIONS way to do a wrong thing.” As we stated in 1969, one cannot separate the products we make from the communities in which they operate. How we connect with our consumers in the home and provide them the time and effort saving convenience of appliances, while improving performance and lowering their impact, OUR PRODUCTS is the core to what we do, creating meaningful, positive change. Whirlpool Corporation helps build better communities by bringing meaningful and innovative solutions to OUR PEOPLE the challenges our consumers and society face everyday. This is essential in growing as a company. We launched several key product innovations last year to deliver on that fundamental promise. In North America, GRI G4 INDEX we launched the next iteration of the heat pump dryer delivering 73% energy savings,* while reducing cost, and in a slimmer size to fit in more places like urban living spaces and smaller homes. We launched our Supreme NoFrost refrigerator in Europe that achieves A+++ –10% energy level, while being No. 1 in food preservation. In addition, the product uses our 6th Sense Live connected technology, which gives food preservation tips and helps families achieve even better results, as well as energy management with Jeff M. Fettig smart grids. Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Taking that purposeful innovation further, we continued our work on the Retrofitted Net-zero Energy, Water, and Waste (ReNEWW) house collaborative, live-in research facility at Purdue University. We are in our second phase of the program and have completed retrofits in the water systems to achieve net-zero water usage in addition to the net-zero energy systems installed in 2014. The ReNEWW house now has over ten collaborators from various industries such as home building, plumbing and HVAC industries. Our successes have been shared with numerous home building, academic, architectural, and designers around the U.S. and we have recently joined the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Sustainable Lifestyles group to facilitate more cross industry collaboration and make the ReNEWW concept global. By bringing technology and people together to achieve purposeful, meaningful and positive change, Whirlpool Corporation is unique in the industry in addressing large societal challenges. We embrace innovation that leads to technology that isn’t in conflict with building lives, homes and communities, but rather brings them together. *Compared to pre-2004 traditional dryers, when paired with matching washer, normal cycle only. 03 2 015 S U S TA I N A B I L I T Y R E P O R T OVERVIEW Introduction Letter from the CEO Timeline ∂ Timeline Performance Scorecard Our Strategy We were focused on sustainability long before it became the norm, and we continue to integrate Awards sustainability into our everyday work.

OUR PEOPLE WIND FARM GRI G4 INDEX Renewable Energy Installations for Manufacturing — We announced plans to use wind energy to power our manufacturing facility in Findlay, OH. The Findlay wind farm is an $18 million “Wind for Industry” project. The wind farm will have five wind turbines installed and Whirlpool will utilize two of them. Through clean, renewable wind energy producing zero greenhouse gas emissions, the wind turbines offset an estimated 13% of the plant’s electric consumption. In addition, for each turbine, Whirlpool will create two $5,000 Megawatt Scholarships to be awarded to local high school students seeking degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The project broke ground on June 15, 2015 and was placed into operation January of 2016. Our overall North America Region (NAR) U.S. wind turbine energy strategy will further drive our goal to decrease the energy intensity for the NAR U.S. Better Plants Program.
