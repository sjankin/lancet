Over 10 years, we have worked hand-in-hand with the world’s most sophisticated brands to develop a unique portfolio of global risk analytics, expert insight and user-centric platforms. These resources enable us to deliver a holistic evaluation of the key strategic, operational and reputational risks facing multinational companies, their suppliers and the raw materials they source for any location worldwide.

Verisk Maplecroft is now a member of the Verisk Analytics (Nasdaq:VRSK) family of companies. Together, these organisations provide leading data analytics solutions that enable customers to define, measure and manage risk throughout their operations, supply chains and investments. Under the Verisk umbrella, we have had greater resources and bandwidth to invest in programmes that further advance our application of the Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. Key highlights include the launch of a new programme to eliminate unconscious bias, (as part of a broader programme focused on the elimination of gender bias); the rollout of an employee wellness programme; and the imminent launch of a public website funded by Verisk that is dedicated to raising awareness of the issues faced by adolescent girls around the globe. Our commitment to the Principles is clearly demonstrated through our extensive range of innovative risk management products and services. These tools help a wide range of multinational clients apply the Principles in their own decision-making. In 2015, we enhanced our solutions so that they better serve our customer base in their efforts to manage risk and to adhere to their social and environmental commitments. We endeavour to share key insights from our research with a broad range of public stakeholders to raise awareness of the key social, environmental and governance risks found across the world. We do this via our significant and growing presence in the international media, through free, publically accessible, thought leadership on our website, and through our public speaking engagements. In addition, we continue to support the Principles through our own corporate values, which now reflect Verisk’s comprehensive nine-point value framework. The first two values are Respect for the Individual and Integrity – both of which speak directly to the Global Compact’s Principles. This report outlines our continued commitment to the aims and interests of the Global Compact. As you will see from this report, Verisk’s acquisition of Maplecroft has expanded the resources we have available to invest in programmes and initiatives that build on our already strong commitment to the Principles of the Global Compact. We have strong backers at Verisk who understand that investment in these programmes is critical to the sustained growth and success of Verisk Maplecroft and of the individuals that make up the company. Sondra Scott, President, Verisk Maplecroft IV © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Verisk Maplecroft has undergone significant positive change since our last Communication on Progress was published. In December 2014, our company was acquired by Verisk Analytics, and became part of the Verisk family of companies. Following our acquisition a new senior management team was appointed, led by our new President, Sondra Scott. Our senior management team reports to the leadership of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which became part of the Verisk family of companies in May 2015. As part of our ongoing integration into the Verisk family of companies, we are currently aligning our policies and processes with those used by Verisk and Wood Mackenzie. For example, throughout 2016 we will be updating our Employee Handbook (which contains many of the policies referred to throughout this report) to better reflect the more mature policies and systems in place at our parent company and sister company. As described in the following pages, part of this process has already begun, with new policies put in place to improve employee benefits – including the provision of more flexible working arrangements, as well as improvements to holiday entitlements and parental leave. In our next Communication on Progress, we look forward to updating readers on our activities and successes in this area throughout 2016. © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 1 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 1 & 2: Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure non-complicity in human rights abuses Our commitment or policy We are committed to supporting and respecting the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.

Another employee survey is planned for early 2016. This will be used to assess the effectiveness of the recently introduced wellness measures – and to inform future efforts to further improve the working environment. © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 5 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 1 & 2 Case study Advanced index methodologies help companies better manage global human rights risks With corporate value chains stretching across multiple countries, thousands of suppliers, inconsistent regulatory regimes and diverse cultures, multinational companies face dynamic environments that consistently challenge the way in which they approach risk management. As a result, companies face increased exposure to human rights risks that are neither well understood nor familiar. In this context, we have enhanced our existing human rights risk indices by adding greater granularity to the data it provides across 198 countries to support companies’ human rights management efforts. The dataset includes 33 indices covering the key issues relating to labour rights and protection, civil and political rights, human security and access to remedy. Improvements to the scoring frameworks have increased the objectivity and accuracy of the indices. New indicator-level data will also be used for predictive analytics, enabling us to forecast future trends in human rights. The data offers companies a wealth of intelligence on current and emerging human rights issues and – by extension – social risk. This can help companies identify and prioritise the issues and determine the level of company engagement needed to address risks in relevant parts of the company footprint and supply chain. Our improvements will not only help companies better manage current human rights issues – but will give them insight into those coming down the line. 6 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 1 & 2 Our targets for next year ■■ To continue to implement our People Strategy, in particular through the provision of more targeted learning and development opportunities for employees, continued participation in the initiatives of the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee, the initiation of new wellness activities and further improvements to the benefits we offer our employees ■■ To strengthen levels of employee engagement through the initiatives outlined in our People Strategy. Engagement levels will be quantified in 2016 by our second employee engagement survey, the results of which we expect will show an improvement in comparison to the preceding year ■■ To continue to expand and enhance our human rights products and services. This will involve making them available to a growing number of multinational companies as well as other relevant organisations. They will continue to support businesses in their efforts to implement the United Nations “Protect, Respect and Remedy” policy framework ■■ To continue to ensure we promote respect for human rights within our own workplace through the ongoing monitoring of our human rights performance ■■ To strengthen our human rights relationships with global influencers, including through dialogue with United Nations agencies and independent human rights organisations on cross-cutting human rights and business issues ■■ To appoint a Head of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), who will be responsible for our internal CSR activities. This individual will work with the Verisk CSR team to ensure alignment with the activities and initiatives of the Verisk family of companies, including those related to human rights ■■ To hold a second annual community service week so that our employees have the opportunity to contribute to their local communities and to continue to support and encourage employee fundraising events for charitable purposes Measurable results or outcomes In 2015, employee concerns were brought to the attention of the company’s new senior management. In part these were identified through the implementation of our first employee engagement survey and the improvements made to our grievance procedure. These issues were promptly resolved in a sensitive manner and appropriate disciplinary action was taken where necessary. Following the change of management, no further issues of this nature have been raised. We believe this is a result of increased employee engagement, a more constructive and respectful working culture and proactive efforts to improve employee wellness. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our working culture, as well as the positive handling of any concerns or grievances that are raised by employees. We will continue to closely monitor and report our performance in this area. © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 7 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 1 & 2 Verisk Maplecroft employees working at Bath City Farm as part of our community service week Case study Reinforcing our corporate social responsibility commitment Following the acquisition of our company by Verisk Analytics in 2015, we reinforced our commitment to CSR – both in our local community and further afield. This included a new policy that gives employees the option to spend one working day per year volunteering in the local community. As a result, we were able to implement our first ever community service week at the beginning of October. During this week, employees carried out fundraising activities to support a range of community projects in the vicinity of our headquarters in Bath, as well as a number of international aid charities. Activities included: ■■ Volunteering at the Genesis Trust Furniture Project ■■ Cooking gourmet meals at the Julian House charity, which provides shelter and food for homeless people ■■ Painting a flat that is used as a refuge for women who have suffered from domestic abuse ■■ Refurbishing existing facilities at Bath City Farm, a charity that provides educational and work experience opportunities for the local community Outside of the local community work, we raised a total of £1,745 for victims of the earthquake in Nepal, children in Syria and a Kosovo-based charity supporting the education of children from different ethnic groups. 8 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 3: Uphold freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining Our commitment or policy We are committed to ensuring that employees have the right to: ■■ Freely join associations of their own choice (for the purposes of rule formation, administration and the election of representatives) ■■ Undertake collective bargaining Our commitment means that we will not only abide by all applicable laws in this respect, but will act in the spirit in which they were made.

Case study Children’s Rights and Business Atlas helps international companies address child labour and other issues Building on more than 10 years of experience analysing and quantifying human rights risk, we collaborated with UNICEF and the Global Child Forum to develop the Children’s Rights and Business Atlas. The online interactive tool enables businesses to identify, prioritise and manage the potential for direct or indirect infringements of children’s rights. The Children’s Rights and Business Atlas is built on the Children’s Rights and Business Principles; a 10-point charter that sets out actions companies can take to respect and support children’s rights. The Principles are supported by guidelines to help companies maximise their positive contributions to, and minimise their negative impacts on, children. We independently researched and evaluated data to measure state protection of children’s rights, as well as respect for children’s rights by business actors, across 198 countries and 10 business sectors. Companies seeking to expand their business operations and supply chain investment portfolio can use the Atlas to identify and understand new country risks, while also assessing risks associated with current operations, business partners or investments. The Atlas is expected to act as a critical asset within companies’ human rights due diligence processes. 14 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 6: Support the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Our commitment or policy We are committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all of our employees.

Case study Rolling out unconscious bias training to ensure an inclusive working environment In June 2015, two of our employees joined a Gender Working Group established by the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee, led by our sister company, Wood Mackenzie. The purpose of the working group is to: ■■ Collate data on the companies’ gender balance, especially at the managerial level ■■ Make recommendations to executive directors to address any imbalances, such as those relating to the attraction, development, retention and promotion of female talent One of the key initiatives implemented by the working group in 2015 was the roll-out of unconscious bias training for all line managers at both companies. The training was conducted by a renowned external provider and its principal aim was to raise awareness of what unconscious bias is, when it can occur and how individuals can address its potential influence when hiring and promoting employees. In particular, the training is intended to help managers avoid unintentionally favouring individuals with whom they identify (based on characteristics such as gender, race or ethnicity), while putting others at a disadvantage. Feedback provided by our managers who received training was overall very positive. Some recommendations for further improvement of the training programme were also received, and these will be integrated into the sessions scheduled to take place in 2016. While the training was implemented in the last two months of 2015, preliminary data collected for the Gender Working Group’s annual report for 2015 suggests that some improvements relating to promotion and gender balance have already taken place in our company and Wood Mackenzie. 16 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 6 Our actions over the last year In our own operations: ■■ Undertook a number of initiatives designed to promote diversity and prevent discrimination throughout our workforce, much of which has been driven by the Wood Mackenzie-led Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee. For example, our employees have participated in the Gender Working Group established by this committee. A key action of the working group has been to commission unconscious bias awareness training for our line managers (for more information see p16) ■■ Integrated the Verisk Values into our working practices, which require employees to show integrity and to respect other individuals ■■ Mapped employee job roles to a new banding structure, which uses market indicators to establish salary benchmarks for each role. As these indicators do not take into account gender, they help ensure equal pay at for men and women at equivalent levels of seniority, experience and capability In our products and services: ■■ Continued to address the challenge of discrimination through our human rights reports and indices, as well as other Global Risks Portfolio products ■■ Provided a free webinar that discussed the development challenges affecting adolescent girls globally. The webinar showcased the ‘Girls Discovered’ online platform, an interactive repository of quantitative data and maps that highlight these issues. We will re-launch this platform in collaboration with Verisk in 2016, under the name of ‘Girl Stats’. For more information, see p28 Our targets for next year ■■ To continue to participate in the initiatives of the Diversity and Inclusion Steering Committee, in particular via the Gender Working Group and further provision of unconscious bias training sessions for managers ■■ To ensure that no instances of discrimination or bullying and harassment occur within our workplace © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 17 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 6 Measurable results or outcomes Grievances In 2015, employee concerns were brought to the attention of the company’s new senior management. In part these were identified through the implementation of our first employee engagement survey and the improvements made to our grievance procedure. These issues were promptly resolved in a sensitive manner and appropriate disciplinary action was taken where necessary. We are confident that the efforts made to strengthen our culture and promote diversity have significantly reduced the likelihood of such concerns re-emerging. In addition, our updated grievance procedure and efforts to increase employee engagement have created an environment in which employees are empowered to raise issues or concerns, before they become grievances. We are committed to the continuous improvement of our working culture, as well as the positive handling of any concerns or grievances that are raised by employees. We will continue to closely monitor and report our performance in this area.

Once these have been established and the data analysed, we hope to set formal environmental targets in 2016 ■■ To endeavour, where practical, to reduce energy and paper consumption on a per capita basis ■■ To consolidate our workspace on to one floor in our Bath office. In 2015, many of our employees relocated to the offices of our parent and sister company – a trend we expect to continue in 2016. As such, our requirement for office space in Bath has decreased. By consolidating our offices on to one floor from the two that we are currently using, we hope to achieve an overall reduction in energy consumption associated with our company’s use of office space (although we recognise that our staff will continue to use energy in the offices they move to) ■■ To launch an online platform that will deliver agri-commodity scores and analysis to clients, allowing users to interrogate the drivers of responsible sourcing risks in their supply chains (for example, the regulatory environment pertaining to water use and management within a country) Measurable results or outcomes From November 2014 to October 2015, our Bath office (where the majority of our workforce is located) used 75,500 sheets of paper – a 59% percent decrease on the preceding year and a significant reduction in per capita consumption. This is largely a result of: ■■ Our employees printing fewer hard copies of client deliverables and encouraging clients to view reports in electronic format ■■ Several of our employees moving to the offices of our parent and sister company From July 2014 to July 2015, our Bath office used 151,147kWhs of electricity, which represents an increase on the baseline figure we established for the preceding year. This increase resulted from our move to a considerably larger office in July 2014 – a move that was necessary to support our company’s ongoing growth. We plan to continue to monitor our office energy consumption levels and hope to make reductions in the future on a per capita basis. © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 21 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 7 & 8 Case study Raising international awareness around the impacts of rising heat stress on global workforces With climate change at the forefront of global consciousness, we released research on the potential impacts of future heat stress on workforces and economic growth to the global media to foster a greater understanding of the issue. This was an issue that had hitherto not been covered in the press. Our Heat Stress Index revealed that global manufacturing hubs in South-East Asia are likely to experience significant falls in productivity over the next 30 years, due to rising temperatures and the effect of extreme heat stress on workforces. The research attracted the attention of more than 30 high-profile publications (including CNBC, The Guardian, CNN, Financial Times and Foreign Policy) ensuring the dissemination of valuable information to help relevant stakeholders to start planning how they can mitigate the cited impacts. Outside of our media work, we have also raised awareness of issues including water stress and climate change vulnerability at high-profile events through speaking appearances. These have included the following events: ■■ International Association for Impact Assessment: Impact Assessment in a Digital Age – Florence, Italy ■■ Sustainable Development in the Food & Beverage Industry – Madrid, Spain 22 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principles 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly technology Our commitment or policy See Principle 7 & 8 Relevant processes, systems, products and services The direct development and diffusion of environmentally-friendly technology sits outside of our core business competencies. However, we try to use environmentally-friendly technology where possible. In particular, our Information Technology and Communication (ITC) team seek to take advantage of innovations in software and hardware that allow us to make more efficient use of existing resources and reduce ITC-related power consumption. Our actions over the last year ■■ Began the process of replacing desktop personal computers (PCs) with laptop computers for the majority of our employees. This process is being undertaken to support the more flexible working arrangements we now offer our employees, but is also beneficial to the environment, due to the lower power requirements of laptop computers ■■ Migrated to the Verisk email system, which meant that our local email infrastructure could be decommissioned. This reduced local server demand and power requirements ■■ Implemented a server ‘virtualisation’ process, which increased the number of ‘virtual’ servers we use and decreased our use of physical servers. Virtual servers do not require dedicated physical IT infrastructure to operate server software (instead drawing on shared hardware) and therefore have considerably lower power and hardware demands Our targets for next year ■■ To continue to replace desktop PCs with laptop computers across our workforce ■■ To continue our server virtualisation process, with the aim of minimising server power requirements and reducing demand for IT hardware ■■ To decommission our third-party hosted physical IT infrastructure by moving to a ‘cloud’ service. Cloud services do not require dedicated physical IT infrastructure and are therefore more efficient and have lower power requirements Measurable results or outcomes During the year, 28 desktop PCs were replaced with laptop computers, supporting flexible working arrangements and reducing IT hardware power demand. Meanwhile, server virtualisation efforts have resulted in a marked decline in server power demand this year, as anticipated. As well as reducing power demand, the process has meant that we have been able to make six servers idle (all of which were in use at the beginning of 2015). These servers can be used should server demand increase in the future (i.e. instead of procuring new hardware). © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 23 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Principle 10: Encourage work against corruption in all forms Our commitment or policy “Our Corruption Risk We are committed to working transparently and are against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery.

Mentoring and advancement is open to all employees regardless of gender, with opportunities and support for all. Our President is Sondra Scott, who is female and is fully committed to providing equal opportunities. We are constantly looking to improve the ratio of females in senior management positions. Achieving and maintaining gender equality in middle management positions We apply the same principle throughout the workforce, promoting balanced leadership at all levels. Equal pay for work of equal value We use market indicators to ensure equal pay for men and women at equivalent levels of seniority, experience and capability. Please see p17 for more information. Flexible work options We offer employees a system of flexible working hours, whereby work start and end times are not fixed. This flexibility gives employees the scope to manage family and other non-work commitments. We launched a new flexible working policy in January 2016 for all employees. This policy provides employees with greater flexibility around their working arrangements, including working hours, working locations and sabbatical leave. Access to child and dependent care We do not currently provide employees with access to child and dependent care on a corporate basis. Support for pregnant women and those returning from maternity leave We provide full support to pregnant women in terms of access to ante-natal care and enhanced health and safety arrangements. While employees are on maternity leave, we offer them Keep In Touch (KIT) days to support their eventual return to work. Prior to returning, discussions are held to assist a smooth reintegration into the workplace, including through the provision of flexible working hours. We introduced a new maternity policy in October 2015, which includes improved benefits for new mothers. We will now ‘top-up’ statutory maternity pay to full pay for the first 18 weeks of maternity leave. Our paternity policy has also been updated to provide the same salary top up for the first week of paternity leave. Recruitment and retention, including training and development, of female employees We are an equal opportunities employer, committed to promoting equality and diversity as well as an inclusive and supportive environment for our employees. We do not discriminate on grounds of gender and men and women are treated equally during the recruitment process and throughout their employment. All employees receive training and have opportunity for professional development after they join the company. 26 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Gender-specific health and safety issues We take every precaution to ensure we provide and maintain working conditions that are safe, healthy and comply with all statutory requirements and relevant codes of practice. This commitment applies to all employees, regardless of gender. Gender-based violence and harassment We deplore all forms of sexual harassment and seek to ensure the maintenance of an inclusive, supportive and safe working environment for all our employees. This commitment applies to all employees, regardless of gender. For more information on this matter, please see p15-18. Education and training opportunities for women workers We are committed to the professional development of all our employees. We undertake to provide all of our employees, regardless of gender, with the training necessary to successfully fulfil their job responsibilities. Creating and maintaining workplace awareness of gender equality and, inclusion and non-discrimination for all workers We are an equal opportunities employer, committed to promoting equality, diversity and an inclusive and supportive environment for our employees. In 2015, two of our employees attended the Gender Working Group, led by our sister company, Wood Mackenzie. The aim of this initiative is to understand more about the gender balance throughout our companies and produce recommendations as to how to encourage the attraction, development, retention and promotion of female talent. In addition, line managers across our company have received unconscious bias awareness training this year as part of an initiative led by the Gender Working Group. This training was aimed at helping participants to manage biases that might not be under conscious control, including those relating to gender. For more information on our efforts to eliminate discrimination, please see p15-18. Mentoring and sponsorship opportunities for women workers We aim to assign employees with work mentors when they start work with us. Work mentors guide new employees through the company’s systems and work methods, and also provide regular feedback on performance. To support this system, during 2015 we provided training for any employees that wanted to learn more about how to mentor colleagues effectively. In addition, all employees can apply for sponsorship to support their professional development.

However, Verisk, our parent company, is in the process of formulating a supplier diversity policy. This policy – which covers procurement in the US – will formalise Verisk’s commitment to building and sustaining relationships with a diverse supplier base.

Research shows that investing in girls is vital for economic growth and for families escaping the poverty trap. In 2015, we received funding from parent company Verisk Analytics to extend the work of ‘Girls Discovered’. This is an interactive data and mapping platform that we established in 2009 in partnership with the Nike Foundation and United Nations Foundation, following calls from international NGOs to collect and present ageand gender-specific development indicators. As part of the extension, the project team has conducted a full re-brand (including a new name – ‘Girl Stats’) and comprehensively revised the datasets and indicators that it hosts. The new, revised platform will be launched in 2016. Girl Stats will help companies understand both the issues girls face and how their operations can positively or negatively affect girls’ lives. It will focus on aspects of girls’ lives that are most relevant to business and to girls’ development, including girls’ access to employment and education, as well as their legal and social status. Girl Stats will provide links to compelling CSR initiatives focused on girls, as well as organisations working with companies to increase their positive impact on girls’ lives. Finally, the website will offer in-depth country-level insights into the situation of girls and young women in emerging markets. 28 © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Gender-sensitive marketing N/A Gender-sensitive product and service development We have developed a range of products and services aimed at helping clients respect the rights of women and girls. For example, we produce the Women’s and Girls’ Rights Index. This global, annually produced index assesses the risks to business from possible association with the practices of state and non-state actors that discriminate against or infringe the rights of women and girls. Another example is the Girl Stats platform that we produce in partnership with Verisk. For more information about this initiative, please see the case study on p28. Other established or emerging best practices We have an unparalleled range of innovative products and services that help clients respect the rights of women and girls (amongst others). Many of these products and services have been designed to incorporate best practice guidance. For example, the methodology behind our human rights indices incorporate the United Nations’ “Protect, Respect, Remedy” Framework as a basis for assessing risk in 198 countries. In addition, the human rights due diligence services that we provide to our clients is fully informed and aligned with the Protect, Respect, Remedy Framework and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

During this time, we have designed and implemented numerous community stakeholder engagements for clients. These projects are carefully planned to ensure that they are free from discrimination and sensitive to gender issues. In many cases, the stakeholder engagement projects that are undertaken require the matter of gender equality to be addressed directly, necessitating a fair and non-discriminatory approach to be taken to data collection. Gender impact assessments or consideration of gender-related impacts as part of its social and/or human rights impact assessments We provide human rights impact assessments as part of a range of human rights due diligence services we offer. These assessments focus on assessing clients’ actual and potential human rights impacts. Assessments include gender-related impacts, and are carried out in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Ensuring female beneficiaries of community programmes N/A Community initiatives specifically targeted at the empowerment of women and girls As discussed in the case study above, we are in the process of developing the ‘Girl Stats’ website in partnership with Verisk. This will be launched in 2016. Girl Stats is a public platform providing comprehensive data on the lives of adolescent girls and young women, aged 15-24, across the globe. In addition, we support the empowerment of women and girls through our community service activities. For instance, as part of our community service week in 2015, our employees helped to redecorate a domestic violence support facility, which provides support and therapy to women and children that have suffered from domestic violence and abuse. © Verisk Maplecroft 2016 | www.maplecroft.com 29 Verisk Maplecroft | 2016 Communication On Progress to the United Nations Global Compact Strategies to ensure that community investment projects and programmes (including economic, social and environmental) positively impact women and girls Our main impact in this respect is through the provision of an extensive range of human rights products and services to our clients. These help clients make a positive contribution to the rights of those affected by their actions, including women and girls. We endeavour to provide access to these products and services to as many organisations as possible. Indeed, we make some of this content publically available (for example via the Girl Stats data platform, which is explained above).
