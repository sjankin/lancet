ACQUISITION OF HOTELES ROYAL In March 2015, NH Hotel Group entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the Latin American chain Hoteles Royal. The company, of Colombian origin, is focused on the development and management of city hotels and is a benchmark player in the corporate segment. The agreement enabled NH Hotel Group to add 20 hotels and 2,185 rooms divided between Colombia (15 hotels), Chile (4 hotels) and Ecuador (1 hotel). The mix of contracts used by Hoteles Royal fits with the expected growth model by NH Hotel Group for the years to come. Hoteles Royal establishments provide a homogenous and consistent product which presents a strong match with the high standards upheld by NH, which facilitates the integration of these new properties into the Company’s portfolio. In 2015, Hoteles Royal fully changed the signage of the 20 hotels of the chain, 10 of which have been brought under the NH Collection brand. Moreover, a high percentage of the operating synergies identified were achieved in this period.

This commitment is part of the culture and is shown in one of the Company’s beliefs: “We are active in the communities where we live”. The Company maximizes its positive impact and generates shared value with initiatives that are adapted to the local needs of each Business Unit, by creating responsible alliances with NGOs and with the collaboration of employee volunteers. To this end, NH Hotel Group has established three lines of global action: Hotels with a Heart, Employment Programmes and NH Volunteers!

The Company consolidated this commitment through agreements with hospitals and foundations in a variety of countries to support children with serious illnesses and their families with limited resources when they need to be accommodated away from their own towns and cities. The Company also has its own special NGO rate, through which it offers discounts of up to 30% off the best rates, and these are available to organisations that have been assessed and approved beforehand by the Corporate Responsibility department. The programme, which from the outset has donated more than 22,000 nights in hotels, was given recognition for this in the most recent edition of the Worldwide Hospitality Awards as the “Best Corporate Responsibility Initiative” worldwide. The participation of the Group’s employee volunteers has been vital to the success of this initiative; they serve as the programme’s “Ambassadors” in each one of the hotels. Since the start of the programme more than 2,000 employees per year have become genuine hosts to the families, helping to make the hotel a second home for them. responsible Alliances NH Hotel Group consolidates its successful responsible Business Unit Italy collaborates with Make A Wish from accommodation, Business Unit Benelux also offered the alliances with solidarity partners in order to develop longInternational, a global partner with whom the Company has families free tickets to enter amusement parks, museums and term projects which could be replicated in other Business been collaborating since 2005, offering all the facilities to circuses, for the enjoyment of the very young.
