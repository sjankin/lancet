For example our Genk site (Belgium) Preventing pollution and emergency cases gained the ISSF award in 2015 for its -72% dust reduction since 2006. Some of our sites store hazardous substances, be they toxic chemicals or potentially explosive fuels (natural gas, etc.). As a consequence, these plants are to In 2015, Aperam recorded 521* tons of be prepared for emergency situations, leakages or fires, and they have set-up ducted dust (G4-EN21), a +18% increase action plans both in the case where the situation is contained within the vs. 2014.

Managing corrosion challenges through a wide range of advanced duplex solutions Through their two-phase 50% austenite/ (Based on ISO 9223-C1-C5 classification) 50% ferrite microstructure, duplex stainless steels exhibit attractive Marine C5M characteristics for the Oil & Gas Industry. Onshore C4/C5 PREN: 33-43 PREN: 33-35 Primarily, they present superior resistance to the various corrosive media that are usually found in both onshore and offshore environments. In addition, its high strength is extremely advantageous in dealing with the high pressures encountered at great depths. However, the elevated costs involved in cases of oil exploitation failures have resulted in the strict selection and qualification of materials by Oil & Gas firms. DX2507 / DX2205 DX2205 This is why the NORSOK standards developed by the Norwegian petroleum industry are so important: they serve as a reference to qualify producers of Corrosion Resistant Alloys and are – as far Industrial C3/C4 Costal C4 PREN: 24-30 PREN: 24-33 as possible – intended to replace oil company specifications. Thus, the stringent qualifying audit focused on the stability and effectiveness of the heat treatment applied to duplex in order to meet the demanding requirements defined in the NORSOK standard M-630. This required tackling a twofold technical challenge at Genk Cold Rolling mill: firstly the setup of four new pyrometers to supervise soaking time and DX2205 / DX2304 / DX2202 thermal homogeneity across the strip DX2507 / DX2205 width, and finally the definition of specific annealing conditions to contain ferrite below 55% while freeing the microstructure from detrimental metallic phases. Urban C3 Inland C1 This NORSOK qualification awards the PREN: 24-30 PREN: 18-26 outstanding teamwork accomplished by the people involved in this project. The approval will also contribute to establish Aperam’s technical credibility regarding duplex manufacturing and help to open up new markets through Oil & Gas projects.
