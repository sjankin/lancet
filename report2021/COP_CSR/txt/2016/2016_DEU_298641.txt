Assessment, Policies and Goals: At Hettl Consult, we adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to national laws. Moreover, we have established some guidelines and policies that underline the company's devotion to the Human Rights principles. Again in 2016, Hettl Consult has not identified any internal human rights issues. For 2016, we will continue to monitor this field of actions and develop advanced measures of implementation as seen appropriate. Hettl Consult has set the goal to perform an internal review of potential field of actions and develop advanced measures of implementation as seen appropriate. Our goal is to maintain our zero abuse record and to continue to be an attractive and responsible employer. Implementation: Hettl Consult enforced a set of policies regarding Human Rights policies. Hettl Consult has published all relevant details on employees’ rights, duties and resources within the organization on its own intranet.

On a regular and structured basis, Hettl Consult employees are asked to give feedback, raise complaints and issues and share ideas for improvement.

All partners offer an Hettl Consult 3/11 UN Global Compact CoP 2016 open door policy that encourages employees to directly express ideas and questions. We actively support a culture of trust and organizational learning. Hettl Consult has received no complaints from employees, business partners or clients in relation to (potential) human rights violations, nor was the organization involved in any human rights incidences before or during the reporting period. Because of the scope of our activities and the limited number of employees, an external audit on human rights performance is not seen as needed.

With the wealth of learning and on-the-job-training offered by Hettl Consult to its employees a key feature of our success and our ability to attract the most important talents for our business, it has been important for Hettl Consult to maintain and enlarge the portfolio of these offerings. Improving the quality of work through an open culture and promotion of diversity We lay emphasis on an open corporate culture, which allows for mistakes to be made and that promotes the strengths of each member of the Hettl Consult team. Participation is a core principle that guides us both in our work with clients and internally, as are open communication, regular and structures feedback and appraisal mechanisms, all of which are actively practiced at Hettl Consult. Hettl Consult 6/11 UN Global Compact CoP 2016 We support the initiative “Diversity as an Opportunity” which was launched by Maria Böhmer, Minister of State in the Federal Chancellery and Federal Government Commissioner for Migration, Refugees, and Integration. The aim of implementing the ‘Charter for Diversity’ within our company is to create a working environment that is free of prejudice. All our employees should experience appreciation – regardless of gender, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion or philosophy of life, disability, age, sexual orientation or identity.

We actively support a culture of trust and organizational learning. Based on the objective to eliminate discrimination and promoting organisational learning and feedback, Hettl Consult is constantly reviewing its project feedback schemes and other feedback mechanisms within its network-based structure. Every year, each employee engages in structured interviews and discussion with their direct reports to set and discuss professional goals and assess personal strengths and opportunities for improvement. Those discussions are guided by the Hettl Consult “LEAD-Navigator®”, a selfdeveloped tool, which is under trademark protection, to assess talents and personal performance.

Assessment, Policies and Goals: Our contribution to environmental solutions is guided by strict internal policies and continued innovation and improvement.

In 2016 all of the following activities were continued and institutionalized: Implementation: Activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and waste With carbon dioxide being the primary cause of human-induced global warming, we work to analyze, identify and substitute our impact as much as possible. We have a travel and car policy that aims to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our employees are required to use the most environment-friendly means of transportation whenever possible primarily public transport. Again in 2016 Hettl Consult supports the use of public transport by financing reduced pricing schemes (BahnCard 50) to replace or reduce airtravel. Those schemes are available to employees also for private use. Starting 2014, all long-distance travel by BahnCard holders has been powered by 100% renewable energy.

Some company cars are pooled and available on a per needs basis. Company cars are leased, and we make sure that they are equipped with the best available filter technology to reduce emissions of fine particulate dust. Hettl Consult 8/11 UN Global Compact CoP 2016 Hettl Consult continued to improve a system for telephone and video conferences for internal meeting across offices as well as with clients. This initiative has allowed us to reduce the number of travelled kilometres, including domestic and transatlantic flights and thus has contributed significantly to the reduction of Hettl Consult’s greenhouse gas emissions. The office heating system is centrally steered and adapts, together with the lighting and blinds system, to the outside conditions, helping reduce energy consumption. We use as our major primary energy a pellet heating system. This allows us to reduce carbon dioxide and to fight against the greenhouse effect. At Hettl consult we build awareness to reduce our waste creation and printing activities by promoting double-sided printing. We only procure high-efficiency and sustainable printers (labelled with the “Energy Star” or “TCO”) to further reduce our environmental footprint.

As mentioned above Hettl Consult lays great importance on the use of organic wholefoods and regional products in our offices. We believe in the merit of unprocessed and local foods and offer these, especially as fruit that is offered to customers and employees free of charge in our offices. All of our fruit is from organic sources (coffee, milk, fruits). In addition we also purchase regional organic products, such as fruit and drinks, via local suppliers. Actions to disseminate greater environmental responsibility For the planning and facilitation of our events and those of our clients and partners, we adhere to guidelines for environmentally-friendly events“ by the German Ministry of the Environment „Leitfaden für die umweltgerechte Organisation von Veranstaltungen“. We work to reduce the use of resources, order regional and seasonal products for catering, and prioritize venues that are easily accessible by public transport.

Measurement of Outcomes: Hettl Consult is using an IT system that facilitates exchange between employees and with external partners. This system includes a general chatroom and various internal theme-based chatrooms, where employees can exchange suggestions and best practice, ask questions and start collective activities. Our continuous improvement system is also a well received and actively used forum for improvements and innovative suggestions to help reduce our environmental impact and to reward environmental responsibility. The results are communicated and when necessary awareness programs for employees initiated. Fuel consumption and CO2 emissions form company cars are recorded. Energy consumption is monitored.
