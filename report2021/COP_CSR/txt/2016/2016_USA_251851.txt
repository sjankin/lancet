Chairman and CEO Joseph L. Hooley is chairman and chief executive officer of State Street Corporation At State Street, corporate responsibility (CR) is firmly ingrained in our culture and business strategy. We know that making a positive impact on the world is not only the right thing to do, it’s smart business. Being a responsible corporate citizen makes sense for all of our stakeholders — our employees, our clients, our shareholders and society at large. Environmental Sustainability Protecting the environment while supporting sustainable development is a major priority for us. In 2015, we continued to make substantial progress toward our goal to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water use by 20 percent per person by 2020, compared to a 2012 baseline. At the end of the year, we had achieved a 17 percent reduction in both categories, while also closing in on our goal of drastically reducing waste sent to landfills. We continue to manage the environmental impact of our operations, with 56 percent of our global square footage of office space now certified to ISO 14001 standards. Our investment in a wind power project near our new office in Gdansk, Poland, helped offset 26,000 metric tons of carbon impact, an amount equivalent to our 2014 business travel emissions. We also acquired 202 million kilowatt-hours of renewable energy certificates (RECs), representing 110 percent of the electricity we purchased in the US in 2015. We are proud to be a leader in helping investors incorporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into their investment decisions. We first started managing ESG portfolios in 1986 and as of the end of 2015 had more than $168.4 billion in ESG assets under management. In December 2015, we launched an exchange traded fund designed to help investors eliminate fossil fuel reserves from their portfolios while maintaining exposure to the core of the S&P 500 Index. Investing in Our Communities The strength of our business is directly linked to the well-being of the communities in which we operate. Our State Street Foundation provided $22.7 million to nonprofit organizations around the world in 2015, including matching employee contributions of $4.15 million to 2,222 charitable organizations. We encourage our employees to be active in our communities, and more than a fifth of them participated in company-sponsored volunteer activities during the year, devoting 116,000 hours of their time to charitable causes. Corporate Responsibility 4 In June, we launched the Boston Workforce Investment Network, or Boston WINs, a four-year pilot program to boost education and job readiness for urban youth in our headquarters city. In an innovative approach to corporate philanthropy, our Foundation pledged to donate $20 million to five nonprofit organizations over four years and hire 1,000 young people who work with them to advance their education and job readiness. All five of these partner organizations have committed to working closely with each other and with State Street to pursue our shared objectives of providing education, training and meaningful career opportunities for Boston youth — and to regularly measure, assess and report our joint progress. Diversity and Inclusion Building a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment are essential elements of our culture. For us, diversity represents the variety of backgrounds, perspectives and experiences within our organization, while inclusion is about soliciting and respecting different perspectives to promote a culture of engagement, innovation and constructive debate and challenge. Our workforce should mirror the clients and communities we serve, and we want our employees to be able to see themselves reflected in their leaders. To this end, we set a series of goals to increase the diversity of our middle management and leadership ranks by the end of 2017, and we will measure progress on diversity and inclusion as part of our annual performance reviews for all managers. Risk Management Our stakeholders expect us to serve them fairly and act appropriately in all we do, and doing so is an essential element of our values. In 2015, we launched a company-wide initiative to elevate risk excellence as a top priority. We strengthened our risk assessment and monitoring capabilities by investing in skilled people, technology and processes. We also rolled out a newly revised Standard of Conduct and Ethical Decision-Making Framework to all employees and stressed the importance of holding ourselves to the highest possible standards and challenging ourselves and each other to make sound decisions. Committed to CR As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we’re committed to advancing its 10 universal principles for responsible business, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) the UN issued in September 2015. These SDGs are aimed at addressing important ESG challenges, and several of them are closely aligned with our goals. We’re pleased with the progress we’ve made advancing our CR agenda, but we recognize there’s more to do. We will continue our work to be a responsible corporate citizen and make a more positive impact on the world. Corporate Responsibility 5 Letter from Pat Centanni, Chairman of the Executive Corporate Responsibility Committee Pat Centanni is an executive vice president and manager of State Street Global Realty, Procurement & Continuity Services. He will retire in June 2016 after more than 25 years at State Street. Every year, I’m excited to see how we can continue to weave corporate responsibility (CR) further into our strategy. From the 2020 environmental goals we set in 2012 to the investments we made this year in our Boston WINs jobreadiness program, we’re preserving our promise of building a sustainable future. Where We Are As a solutions-focused company, we use the insights we gain from talking to our clients to develop solutions for their business. This includes helping them incorporate CR into their own business. But our commitment to CR is more than just the solutions we offer to clients. It’s also how we engage our employees to help them grow in their careers and stay connected to our goals. Our focus on CR helps employees know they work at a company whose values align to theirs. Suppliers are another way we can make a difference. Over the past few years, we’ve taken a close look at our supply chain and have started implementing procurement policies on social and environmental responsibility. Wherever we can, we look to work with partners that demonstrate socially responsible sourcing. Where We’re Going As we look forward, we want to zero in on the most relevant CR topics and make sure top management is informed and can lead the charge. We need to clearly articulate what matters to our business and all stakeholders. In 2016, we’ll continue to promote ESG product and service opportunities through State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) initiatives and by working with our Global Strategy team to develop a corporate-wide approach. When it comes to the environment, we’ll look for additional opportunities to lower our carbon footprint, water usage and waste amount so that we can reach our 2020 goals. An important part of our Way Ahead is also setting new goals. As signatories to the UN Global Compact, we want to make sure our CR and community initiatives align with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. We’ll identify those most material to State Street to establish metrics and report on our progress. And while our human rights statement has served us well since we first issued it in 2008, we’ll be updating it this year for greater clarity. Finally, we’re also considering ways we can include CR in our employees’ annual goals. I think this will truly help strengthen the belief that everyone can contribute to our goals of building a sustainable future.

We update our list of material CR topics every two years based on guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). In 2015, our assessment, which is supported by the CR consultancy Sustainserv, began with a list of 32 CR topics. These were compiled from GRI, the ISO 26000 Guidance on Social Responsibility, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and CR reports of other financial services companies. A number of test questions helped us narrow this down to 15 topics that create the greatest value for our business and stakeholders. These questions addressed whether a topic presents significant risks or opportunities to our company, whether it is related to our values, or whether it has been raised by external partners or employees as impacting their interests. Inviting Feedback To determine the topics most important to our company, we engaged colleagues across business units and from our North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) operations. They completed an online survey based on our test questions and refined the results at an in-person workshop in Boston and online workshops in EMEA and APAC. To assess the topics in a holistic manner, the survey also looked at relevant impacts that could occur in our value chain. To identify the topics most relevant to our stakeholders, we invited a select group of clients, investors, suppliers, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and academics to complete an online survey, supplemented with a few follow-up interviews. In addition, we asked a small group of employees which topics they believed were most important and included their feedback in our final assessments. Ongoing Observation The chart below shows how relevant our 15 focus topics are for our business and stakeholders. It also lists the topics that fell outside of the materiality scope. While we’re not specifically discussing these topics in this report, we’ll continue to manage them appropriately and reassess their relevance for future reports. We decided that some topics were not material on their own, but still contribute to our performance on other topics that are material. Examples include the impact of energy efficiency as well as business travel and commuting on our greenhouse gas emissions, and the impact of human rights policies and training on our responsible sourcing.

Corporate Responsibility 9 Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) perspectives To ensure our CR reporting includes perspectives from all our global regions, we asked regional representatives to help select our most relevant CR topics (see pages 8-9). To avoid a North American bias, we also asked senior management from our regional teams for feedback on how we discuss the relevant topics in the report. While the different chapters throughout this report include regional considerations and examples, we summarize overarching comments from colleagues in EMEA and APAC here. Increasing Demand for ESG Capabilities ESG demand from clients in EMEA was significant in 2015, expressed for example in requests for proposals (RFPs) to conduct business. This aligns with findings from our global survey of 400 pension funds, which revealed that 83 percent anticipate a moderate or high level of interest in ESG investing over the next three years. Eighty percent of those in EMEA reported they were more likely to consider hiring a manager that has ESG capabilities compared with one that doesn’t. Nordic pension funds are particularly active on ESG issues, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global being one of the leaders in the field. Strong Expectations for Governance Since the financial crisis, many APAC regulators have focused on corporate governance. One expectation is for the head of a local legal entity to be fully accountable for local business dealings and decision making. This can have significant impact for multinational banks, such as State Street, that are vertically organized and have globally led systems, infrastructure and functional support. For example, we offshore a number of activities to centers of excellence to increase efficiency and effectiveness. We need to demonstrate to regulators that our local offices have sufficient oversight and decision rights in these arrangements. Also, there is increased expectation from the European Central Bank as well as from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) among others. They want State Street management in EMEA to have local decision-making authority, oversee local implementation of global strategy and have clear accountability. In the UK, the Senior Managers’ Regime (SMR), expected to begin in early 2016, will result in far higher levels of personal accountability for senior executives of the London branches. All other UK-regulated firms are expected to be subject to similar requirements by 2018. Data Protection Required by Regulators and Clients Data governance and data confidentiality are important issues in EMEA. For example, Swiss banking laws limit our ability to share client data across our corporation or systems. Also, regulators across APAC are increasingly focused on customer data protection, privacy and cybersecurity issues, although rules and regulations vary from market to market. For example, in applying our global marketing automation and client relationship tools, we found that in one jurisdiction data has to be stored locally, while in another data encryption is required for data transfer. Customizing our solutions allows us to ensure local compliance. Corporate Responsibility 10 Increasing Requirements on ESG Reporting In the European Union, a directive is unfolding to make reporting on nonfinancial matters including human rights, employee-related issues, diversity and the environment mandatory for thousands of companies by 2018. There are also local disclosure requirements on specific ESG topics. For example, UK anti-slavery law requires employmentrelated disclosures, and the UK government is currently proposing mandatory gender pay disclosure for firms with more than 250 employees. Recently, there have been a number of new requirements and consultation processes on ESG reporting in APAC. For example, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange conducted a consultation in 2015, which resulted in a requirement that each issuer must disclose ESG information annually. The Singapore Stock Exchange also held a consultation on ESG reporting in 2015 and published ESG disclosure rules for consultation in early 2016 as a result. Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and India have established or are developing requirements for disclosures regarding ESG issues. Corporate Responsibility 11 Corporate strategy and corporate responsibility Aligning Corporate Strategy and Responsibility Inspired by the guiding principles of the integrated reporting framework published by the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), our 2014 CR Report took the first step to show how CR issues are part of our business strategy. By exploring how material CR topics align with different parts of our strategy, we understood better how CR supports our strategic goals. Focusing on the future The Way Ahead is our strategy and road map for the future. Designed to move our business forward, it’s focused on four strategic priorities that rest on a foundation of trust, culture, innovation and risk excellence: • Build on our strong core by aligning solutions with client needs and continuing to innovate so that we’re in a stronger position to capture value and improve efficiency. • Achieve a digital enterprise by automating processes and digitizing much of how we do business to benefit our employees, clients and shareholders. • Maintain our capital strength by prioritizing our strong capital position so that we can grow and deliver returns to our shareholders. • Pursue new opportunities by focusing on prospects for growth that are informed by future trends. Long-Term Financial Growth Build Achieve Maintain Pursue On Our a Digital Our Capital New Strong Core Enterprise Strength Opportunities Without a strong foundation, We need to build on what Our strong capital position Because we’re operating we have nothing to build on. we achieved with our IT is a differentiator for us from a position of strength, We need to align solutions and Operations program to from a regulatory and not only can we see changes with client needs, continue drive greater transformation client standpoint.

We will and improve efficiency. our clients, and our and to deliver returns to place a few significant shareholders. our shareholders. long-term growth bets informed by future trends. Talent, Culture, Innovation and Risk Excellence Corporate Responsibility 12 Determining Areas of Impact As part of our CR materiality assessment (see pages 8-9) and in CR working group meetings with global teams, we discussed how CR topics impact our strategy. To fully capture the complex connections between responsibility and business, this year we recorded both the primary impacts of CR topics to our strategy as well as secondary, but still meaningful, impacts. The results are clear: all parts of our corporate strategy can be supported by our attention to relevant CR topics. Two of our priorities — Build on Our Strong Core and Pursue New Opportunities — as well as the foundation of talent, culture, innovation and risk excellence are particularly impacted by this focus. We have initiatives and incentives in place for many strategically important CR issues, such as ethics, risk excellence, and diversity and inclusion. In addition, we’ll continue to explore how our CR programs support how we execute our strategy. Clearly, there are ample opportunities for valuable connections that will drive long-term financial growth and help us continue to build trusted relationships with all stakeholders.

As a financial services provider, it’s more important than ever that our stakeholders see us as a trusted partner. To earn, and keep, this trust, we must hold ourselves to the highest possible standards. All of our business units are responsible for complying with rules and regulations and adhering to our ethical requirements as a first line of defense. Our compliance teams and audit function are the second and third lines. As part of an agreement reached in 2015 with US and Massachusetts banking regulators, we were required to implement enhancements to our anti-money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act compliance programs. Because our reputation rests on the behavior of every employee, we revised our global Standard of Conduct to focus even more on conduct and culture in 2015. We also introduced a new Ethical Decision Making Framework and reinforced our managers’ roles as the first line of defense. Adding Staff and Training In 2015, we expanded our Ethics Office from 11 to 33 members. By establishing new regional ethics leaders in EMEA and APAC, and adding to the overall strength of our team, we’ve enhanced our advice, counsel and monitoring activities company-wide. The ethics team created and provided in-person Ethical Decision Making training to 364 executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents globally in 2015. These EVPs and SVPs then delivered in-person, leader-led training in Ethical Decision Making to more than 7,000 of our senior executives. And more than 1,400 assistant vice presidents and above completed equivalent Integrity at Work trainings in EMEA. Strengthening Personal Accountability Globally, all staff received online training in anti-bribery, conflict of interest and other Standard of Conduct matters. We increased the attention to on-time completion of training and in 2015 achieved 100 percent on-time completion of the Standard of Conduct training — a strong statement of acceptance of personal responsibility. Corporate Responsibility 15 In 2015, we launched a program on risk excellence, including an emphasis on the importance of speaking up and dealing transparently with issues. Risk excellence is separately evaluated as part of our performance review process, and we’ve created incentives for selfreporting failures to follow our compliance policies. Through the end of 2015, 34 percent of all instances of noncompliance with ethics policies per month have been self-reported. This is just one way we’ve David Suetens promoted risk excellence performance. Executive Vice President and International Chief Risk Officer Risk excellence Leading risk management for State Street in APAC and EMEA, David How to Succeed in Business manages regulatory compliance and oversees the tools we use to ensure Financial institutions traditionally see client service and business risk practices globally across the performance as the key components of success. We consider risk organization. excellence an equally important part.

The types of risks an employee might come remain in business.” across can vary quite a bit depending on their position, so these goals have been tailored to make sure they’re applicable and achievable within the broader risk excellence framework. Learning from Our Mistakes In any service-based business, mistakes are made and incidents occur. We want to make sure we respond to these situations in a transparent, timely and effective way — every time. We expect personal accountability and reward employees who quickly identify, escalate and respond to incidents. To gain insight and avoid repeating mistakes, we share lessons learned from handling incidence cases through our risk excellence governance. This can be challenging, as we often have to break silos across business and geographic lines. But the benefit is great: we improve our collective awareness of potential risks and solidify our risk awareness. This is essential for a business built on trust. Corporate Responsibility 16 Creating Value for Clients and Shareholders Lasting, mutually beneficial relationships with both our clients and shareholders are at the foundation of our success. To meet our clients’ emerging challenges, we continually look at how we support them and the solutions we offer. This includes financial products and services that embed environmental, social and governance (ESG) features in their design. When it comes to our shareholders, we maintain close relationships to make sure they understand our goals, how we plan to get there and our progress along the way. Client experience and feedback Staying in Touch Our clients expect excellent service — every day. To deliver on that promise, we’ve worked for many years with National Quality Review (NQR) tools to see what our clients think about the quality of our work and where we can make improvements. These surveys differ by region in terms of approach, areas measured and client feedback. For example, in EMEA the results showed that we continue to maintain our strong level of overall satisfaction. Clients highlighted regulatory change and tax reporting as areas where they would like to see even more insights from us. Building Lasting Relationships In 2014, we piloted a program with 10 of our largest global asset management clients who we support through our Global Relationship Management (GRM) team. In contrast to the NQR surveys, which are focused on general satisfaction levels, we opted to use the Net Promoter System (NPS) with these select clients. The NPS survey addresses three areas: commercial conditions, State Street as an organization and our service quality. Most importantly it asks if the client — based on their experience of working with us — would be willing to act as an advocate for our company. The bar is high: On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the most positive, only a rating of 9 or 10 is counted as a positive result. For clients who we surveyed for the second year using NPS, we saw clear improvements in overall scores, in the number of individual promoters (more than doubling) and the attributes we measured. Also, more people participated in the survey this year at each client. NPS can support our relationships with a wider group within a client’s organization, often even engaging a client’s entire C-suite. This helps us build lasting relationships and also fits well with our increasing focus on relationship governance. Together with the client, we’re in a stronger position to pinpoint what they value most and create a continuous focus for dialogue and improvement. In 2015, we also included in the NPS pilot a number of strategic clients headquartered in Europe and Asia. Valuing Thought Leadership We’ve learned that once service quality is addressed, one of the next areas clients value is thought leadership. In surveys, clients have told us that they can’t find the critical insights we offer anywhere else. For example, they can tap into our experience with disruptive technologies from State Street Global Exchange (SSGX). Access to white papers on current industry challenges as well as future trends also gives our clients a stronger understanding of the markets they operate in. And with marketing automation and client relationship tools, we can see what information clients most actively use so that we can respond to their individual needs. Corporate Responsibility 17 Where thought leadership is of interest to a client, we can invite them to talk with the authors of our white papers or to speak to other experts on our team. We also share insights into what has worked for us and for other clients regarding geographic expansion, product development and topics such as technology, regulation, risk and distribution. Also, our strong engagement in community and environmental protection is compelling to many clients who are developing their own responsibility programs. We’ve even seen an increase on these topics in RFPs. Ethical marketing and fair competition Building a Foundation of Trust As a partner to some of the world’s leading institutions, we must constantly earn their trust. Our commitment to honest and transparent operations is not only in the work we do for our clients and shareholders, it’s part of how we market our services and communicate our mission to the public. Our recently revised global Standard of Conduct clearly prohibits misrepresenting any material facts, and requires that employees understand and uphold the laws regarding cross-selling and bundling of products and services. Marketing Ethically In 2015, we launched a new multi-level compliance program. We made marketing compliance a key area for strengthening our risk excellence, and provided additional resources for achieving this compliance. The new resources included a stronger Compliance Oversight Program (COP) for ethical marketing and creating the new role of a Marketing Risk and Compliance Program Manager. As part of the training on our new global Ethical Decision-Making Framework, we developed ethical dilemma scenarios and added them to the ethics training library for all businesses. Also, our new Global Marketing and Advertising Committee helps us uphold our transparent disclosures on the products and services we offer. Avoiding Improper Gifts While modest gifts and entertainment can help personalize business relationships, we strictly prohibit our employees from giving or receiving anything of value in exchange for or the perception of a specific business advantage. We have a strict annual limit of US$250 for gifts given to an individual, and any gift or entertainment offered to a public employee or US union official requires prior approval. We train employees across the company to make sure they clearly understand their responsibility when entertaining clients or prospects. Upholding Fair Competition We want our clients to select their financial services providers in a transparent and efficient market environment. Our Standard of Conduct clearly prohibits all employees from engaging in any unfair competitive actions or misusing a client’s confidential information. Employees must get advance approval from our chief legal officer or general counsel before discussing pricing strategies with any competitors, or entering into agreements concerning market opportunities. Employees are only allowed to acquire competitive information and market data from public sources, and through lawful means. Corporate Responsibility 18 Data protection and privacy Using Smart Data Analytics to Our Advantage Our clients navigate large volumes of data to make informed investment decisions. By capturing and analyzing data in a meaningful way, we help them assess risk and forecast performance. To make sure we’re staying ahead of the curve when it comes to gathering and protecting data, we continue to evaluate and implement protection technologies across the company. Carefully Managing Data With a business based on trust, our clients must feel confident in our ability to keep data confidential and uphold their privacy. We have several programs in place to maintain strict protocols for how we handle data and manage our IT systems. To handle data appropriately, our Information Security Controls require data to be classified as highly confidential, personal sensitive, confidential, limited access, company internal or general data. In late 2015, we introduced a pilot program with a new tool to automate this classification process, reducing the potential for misclassification and inadvertent data disclosure. Over the next two years, we plan to roll out other data protection tools that will deliver additional access management, encryption and revocation features corresponding to the associated classification levels. Safeguarding Data from External Threats Our Data Loss Protection Program includes technical tools and business processes that monitor and mitigate the risk of data leakage. For example, end-point protection software provides threat detection and analysis of activity. And our Shadow IT program detects communication to external sites and controls undesirable activity and data exfiltration. Corporate Responsibility 19 ESG financial solutions Several parts of our business incorporate ESG strategies in their work. We spoke with four executives from across the organization about the opportunities ESG financial solutions provide for our clients and our company. Chris McKnett Q: What is the role of ESG products and services at State Street? McKnett: We’re one of the big players in the ESG financial solutions is a managing director and head of ESG at State Street Global Advisors (SSGA). space and have more than $168.4 billion in ESG assets under Within the chief investment officer’s management (as of December 31, 2015). We run ESG investment organization, his group focuses on portfolios for specific clients, create ESG-focused products and helping institutional and other clients reflect their ESG views in their integrate ESG factors into broader investment practices. We also investments. provide insights to the marketplace. For example, we led the industry collaborative Project Delphi that together with academic partners uncovers ESG impacts on investment portfolios. The first phase of the Delphi project wrapped up in December 2015 and the findings will be available in 2016. We have 17 ESG products on the market right now. We first started managing ESG portfolios in 1986 and introduced our first fund in 1996. We launched the latest — a fossil fuel-free exchange traded fund (ETF) based on the S&P 500 Fossil Fuel Free Index — at the Jake Rosenfeld end of 2015. is a senior vice president and senior tax counsel at State Street, and the head of Q: Why did you introduce the fossil-free fund? tax-advantaged investments. These McKnett: A year ago, we launched a low-carbon equity ETF. It was investments made on behalf of State the first of its kind in the market and met clear client needs. But Street include low-income housing and some investors, such as a number of university endowments, renewable energy projects. foundations and individuals that aim to divest from firms with fossil fuel reserves, want to go beyond low carbon. Different investment styles work for different clients. In ESG financial services, negative screening to avoid unwanted exposure has been around for a long time. Positive selection to gain exposure to sustainability themes such as low carbon or green bonds was added later. There is also an increasing move toward using ESG factors to capture intangible, off-balance-sheet values in broader investment strategies. Corporate Responsibility 20 Q: Are there other pieces to the ESG puzzle? Batler: In municipal finance, our clients seek to fund infrastructure projects including Capital Improvement Plans (CIP) directly with us or via the public markets. An increasing number of public issuers’ CIPs include infrastructure projects that address environmental or social issues. For example, the San Francisco Public Utility Mark McDivitt Commission has a CIP that includes construction of green is a managing director and the head of infrastructure projects in the city and county. US hedge fund sales focused on foreign exchange (FX) at State Street. His Rosenfeld: Also, our own tax-advantaged investments help finance responsibilities include the execution of social issues such as low-income housing and environmental the company’s renewable energy and carbon offset transactions. causes such as renewable energy. Energy is increasingly generated by privately financed providers that sell to public utilities. We can provide project financing to these generators in addition to our support for municipal utility clients. This lets us bridge both sides of the renewable energy equation. McDivitt: Renewable energy certificates (RECs) can also help. We provide trading solutions for RECs that help clients monetize environmental attributes of renewable electricity generation separately from the electricity itself.

This goes beyond credit ratings and includes, for example, dependency on coal. There are also upcoming mandates to source certain amounts of the energy offered by some utilities from renewables. This will likely change which new energy facilities get built and the market demand for RECs or alternative energy. Corporate Responsibility 21 Rosenfeld: In December 2015, the US Congress extended tax credits for wind and solar projects for several years. We believe this extension, coupled with state renewables mandates and international initiatives such as the Paris Climate Change accord, will help spur a significant growth in the renewable sector. That will lead to a corresponding need for financing in the coming years. McDivitt: Across the company, we’re starting to hear clients ask for better coordinated ESG financial solutions. I would expect there to be more and more opportunities for our different groups to work together to meet their needs. Q: If you could choose one thing you’d like to do, what would that be? McDivitt: It would be very powerful to bring all our disciplines that can support ESG solutions together. Let’s link our capabilities on environmental asset administration, portfolio risk analysis, low-risk trading and “green” investment management to figure out how to help our clients solve ESG issues. We have a big chance here and a huge potential commercial opportunity. That being said, we also have the risk of missing the boat. We could lose out to competitors who are aggressively focusing on ESG capabilities if we’re playing this too defensively. McKnett: There are some questions on how ESG can be best monetized because it’s a heterogeneous category. One area where we see clear emerging interest from clients is in viewing ESG factors and sustainability themes as long-term drivers of investment performance and a component of rigorous investment philosophy and process. Provided we have strong support from senior management and our board, we’re in an excellent position to offer uniquely integrated ESG solutions.

The 2015 investments increased our cumulative TCI portfolio to over $2B in commitments, roughly equal between housing and energy. Corporate Responsibility 24 Asset stewardship More than $400 billion flowed into US-based passive funds in 2015. Unlike active managers who can sell companies when they disagree with management, passive managers represent near permanent capital that cannot vote with its feet — as long as a company is included in the index it remains in the portfolio. That’s Rakhi Kumar why we think passive managers have a clear responsibility to be Head of Corporate Governance long-term asset stewards for their clients and the overall health of at State Street Global Advisors companies, their stakeholders and economies around the world.

All of which impact capital.” shareholder value. In 2014, we introduced new ESG portfolio screening tools to help actively identify companies for engagement and enhance oversight of ESG risk at portfolio companies. In 2015, we engaged a total of 636 global companies representing more than 45 percent of our assets on ESG issues. Increasing Transparency on ESG Efforts to Clients Annually, SSGA develops a series of strategic priorities that drive our engagement with portfolio companies based on developing macroeconomic conditions, emerging ESG trends and client feedback. A significant challenge for all passive index managers invested in thousands of listed companies globally is to provide active oversight of the company. A sector approach lets us take a deep dive into two to three sectors a year and proactively monitor and engage companies on matters such as long-term strategy, performance and ESG issues. Corporate Responsibility 25 Reviewing global holdings within a sector lets us identify business and ESG trends impacting our holdings, and puts us in a stronger position to advise boards and management teams when they seek feedback or direction from large institutional investors. We also share our insights with clients through presentations and report our findings in our Annual Stewardship Report. For 2015, SSGA’s stewardship priorities included a sector focus on pharmaceutical companies, which have to navigate structural change in their sector due to an increase in mergers and acquisitions, and the consumer discretionary sector where macroeconomic and exchange-rate challenges impact business strategy. We worked with companies on board refreshment and diversity, cybersecurity threats and climate change as priority topics. In addition, we focused on US proxy access issues and worked on developing a stewardship program for our fixed income assets. Contributing to ESG Best Practices We’ve taken a leadership position in the market and share our lessons learned with the wider investment community through white papers available on our SSGA website. Our evolving approach to ESG has contributed to the development and broader acceptance of best practices. One example is board refreshment — a key aspect of effective governance. In 2014, we were the first major investor to adopt a policy to address these practices at US portfolio companies. Through this policy, we’ve raised awareness about the need for the orderly succession of directors and fresh skills and expertise.

The economic success of our business also determines our ability to serve all stakeholders. With this in mind, we manage the risks inherent in our business with systems, procedures and oversight to maintain transparency and long-term sustainability. Revenue Increase Despite Lower Global Interest Rates Our total revenue in 2015 increased by one percent over 2014. This was mainly due to increases in our fee revenue, partially offset by a decline in net interest revenue. Servicing and management fees were approximately 76 percent of our total fee revenue. The remainder was due to trading services, securities finance, and processing and other fees. In 2015, total fee revenue increased by three percent compared to 2014. In contrast, net interest revenue decreased by eight percent on a fully taxableequivalent basis in 2015 compared to 2014. Contributing factors were our efforts to optimize our capital position to comply with evolving regulatory requirements on liquidity, lower yields on interest-earning assets and the effect of the stronger US dollar. Increasing Expenses and New Cost Efficiency Program Total expenses in 2015 increased by three percent compared to 2014, primarily driven by an increase in expenses due to more than $400 million in legal accruals, as well as higher information systems and communications costs to support new business and other expenses from professional services. This was partially offset by a $108 million decrease in acquisition and restructuring costs and $251 million from the effect of the stronger US dollar. In October 2015, we announced the next phase of our multi-year transformation program, which we refer to as State Street Beacon. We expect to deliver cost efficiencies through changes in our operational processes and further digitize our processes and interfaces with clients. We expect State Street Beacon, which includes the targeted staff reductions that we announced with our third-quarter 2015 results, to generate approximately $550 million in estimated annualized pretax expense savings over the next five years, including approximately $75 million in 2016. Dividend Increase and Stable Return on Equity During 2015, we declared common stock dividends of $1.32 per share (2014: $1.16), totaling approximately $536 million. Return on average common shareholders’ equity remained flat at 9.8 percent in 2015 compared to 2014. We purchased approximately 20.5 million shares of our common stock at an average per-share cost of $74.07 and an aggregate cost of approximately $1.52 billion. Additional information with respect to our financial results, our common stock purchase program, stock dividends and the method used for computing earnings per share is provided in our 2015 annual report on Form 10-K.

Our promise to maintain an environment where every employee feels valued and able to meet their full potential infuses our company values. It’s also part of our commitment to inclusion, development and engagement, and corporate social responsibility. Hiring the right talent and supporting them in their professional development is key to our success. This includes cultivating employees from diverse backgrounds and nurturing the range of perspectives that keep us innovative and competitive. We also make sure we work with high-quality suppliers that share our values and help us serve our clients well. Because we have a significant supplier base, our selection of suppliers that employ responsible business practices has an impact on local economies, environmental protection, the workforce in our supply chain and broader social issues. Talent recruitment and retention As the business world grows, companies are competing for the same skilled workers. To attract and keep the best candidates, we’re developing a new recruitment branding campaign to refine our image and the message we’re delivering to potential employees. With this new campaign, we explain how our more than 200-year-old custodian bank can offer opportunities that are interesting and rewarding. Diversifying our Talent A diverse workforce inspires innovation and creates better business results. In 2015 we hired 12 full-time employees — eight in North America, two in EMEA and two in APAC — to form a global diversity sourcing team to bring diverse talent into higher-level roles. All of the team members completed specialized recruitment training and received their Diversity Recruiting Certification. (For more on our initiatives to foster diversity, see pages 3436.) The Role of Recruitment Programs Our employees help our company grow and stay innovative. Our hiring increased significantly in 2015 across strategic business areas including regulatory compliance, technology and analytics, showing our commitment to deliver on our corporate strategy (see pages 4-5). Our Future Focus program in the US, which began in 2014, increased the rigor of our entry-level recruitment. In its first year, it brought 26 high-caliber candidates into the company and in 2015 more than 120 were hired through the program. We also expanded our internship programs in 2015 to more than 1,100 participants. In EMEA, we offered a number of internship opportunities to help undergraduates prepare for a career in financial services and to strengthen our pipeline for future entry-level roles. In APAC, we offered university students from Nanyang Polytechnic in Singapore six-month internships. Polytechnic grants them academic credit for the experience, which speaks to the quality of our program. Corporate Responsibility 30 The gap between open jobs and the talent we need to fill them will continue to be a challenge for us. Programs like Future Focus and our Boston Workforce Investment Network (WINs) initiative, which supports inner-city youth in education and job readiness (see pages 44-46), will help us close that gap. Continuing to craft our image as an exciting and fulfilling place to work and sharing our story will give us an edge in the race. Training and professional development By offering numerous avenues for professional development, our employees are able to deepen their skills, our clients receive even better service and our company continues to evolve. Managers as Students In 2015, we analyzed where our managers needed more support. As a result, we piloted our First Line Leader program for new managers in December 2015, and laid the groundwork to launch the program globally in 2016. We also updated our most popular management classes in 2015. Data showed that employees who took these classes had higher performance scores, higher rates of promotions and were more internally mobile. Corporate Responsibility 31 Lastly, we launched an internal professional development program (PDP) in July 2015 that allows assistant vice presidents to enter a two-year job rotation. This program shows how diversity and mobility are important parts of State Street’s future. Through an application process that included a series of interviews and a Hay Assessment, we selected 36 high-performing AVPs for this Ada Kong program and placed them in tactical areas of the business to Assistant Vice President, Fund strengthen their management skills. Administration Regulatory & Tax Services, Hangzhou Supporting the Virtual Learner In today’s digital culture, online learning is a great way to fit One of our high-performing AVPs participating in the internal PDP is Ada professional development into our busy lives. In 2015, we worked Kong. In 2015, Ada was assigned to our hard to evaluate all of our online offerings and make the most Sydney office as part of her PDP job popular and relevant programs easy to access. We also reviewed rotations to work with our APAC and picked the topics for the online management program that Straight-Through-Processing Program team. were the best fit for our business needs. For example, we published an online program in 2015 for all our “During my PDP assignment, I’ve global staff on risk excellence — one of our top corporate objectives probably reached out to the greatest number of people I ever met within the this year. We’re planning a major update in 2017 to make our organization to request information or learning systems more flexible and reach more employees. share knowledge. When you’re outside your comfort zone, it stretches you the Encouraging Collaboration most!” To encourage collaboration across the company, we created a cross-enterprise Learning Council this year. This council bridges all the groups in the company that support employee learning, so they can coordinate efforts and improve our educational opportunities. We also redesigned an internal site — “Managing My Team”— to help managers tap into the information they need, when they need it. Use of the site skyrocketed by 90 percent after the redesign. Corporate Responsibility 32 Wage equity and flexible work options Upholding Wage Equity and Equal Opportunity The ratio of wages of our female employees compared to our male employees in the company is material to our business and of interest to our stakeholders. However, we do not report a female’s basic salary as a percentage to a male’s. A simple across-the-board analysis of an organization of State Street’s size and multiple business-line complexity would not accurately compare similar positions or capture all elements of a total compensation program. Successful companies actively ensure that the visible and invisible barriers to advancement are identified and removed — including closing the gender wage gap. To that end, in 2013, we signed the Boston Women’s Compact, which strives to make Greater Boston the premier place for working women in America. State Street is executing the objectives of the Compact in several ways: by setting organizational goals for diversity, by mentoring women in leadership roles, engaging them in our employee networks and through our flexible work initiative. Increasing Engagement and Productivity Highly skilled, productive employees are vital to our success. We believe that offering flexibility in how, when and where work gets done increases the engagement and productivity of our workforce. Flex work may include a consolidated schedule, as well as working remotely or at a satellite office. And job share opportunities allow more than one employee to share a position on an ongoing basis. Providing Support and Guidance Benefits from flexible work can include enhanced work-life balance and time and cost savings from commuting. The Flex Work Program is integrated with our business strategy and has developed into a proactive, managerinitiated program supported by tools, technologies and resources. Our Flexible Work Employee Network is an inclusive collection of employees who voluntarily work together to support our global workforce around State Street’s formal Flex Work Program. For example, the network provides career development guidance and support to Flex Community followers to help them in career advancement, internal mobility and becoming the voice of flex in their area. In 2015, our Flexible Work Employee Network was ranked No. 7 on the Top 25 Employee Resource Groups by the Association of Employee Resource Groups and Diversity Councils. This affirms the Network’s commitment to best practices and organizational impact. Corporate Responsibility 33 Diversity and inclusion We spoke with Julie Haskell about the role diversity and inclusion play in staying competitive, and the strides we’re making to enhance this aspect of our culture. Q: How do you define diversity in the workplace? Diversity refers to the visible and invisible traits that make us all Julianne Haskell Managing Director, Global unique. It’s about the variety of different backgrounds, perspectives, Inclusion and Diversity experiences and worldviews within our organization. It’s equally important, however, to promote an understanding of inclusion. Julie leads our initiatives on inclusion, diversity and work-life balance. As part Inclusion is created by a set of behaviors and how we feel at work. of this role, she oversees our employee It’s the act of soliciting and respecting diverse perspectives to resource groups, employee surveys and promote engagement, innovation and constructive debate — all key programs to meet our diversity and inclusion goals. to creating a risk excellence culture. Diversity and inclusion are most valuable when present together. By itself, a diverse workforce doesn’t change culture. Providing opportunities that let employees use their unique perspectives and backgrounds is how we create real business value. We want employees to recognize and embrace all dimensions of diversity, and then work to create an inclusive environment where everyone can perform at their best. Q: Where do you see change? In the short time since we embraced this definition of diversity, we’ve already seen positive outcomes. Here’s just one example: We know that in some Asian cultures, certain forms of diversity are not usually expressed in public. In the past, very few of our Asian colleagues were willing to identify with the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community during the annual Hong Kong Pride Parade. Last year, however, we were pleased to see more than 20 employees participate in the parade. The kickoff event of Hong Kong Pride and Friends Network attracted more than 70 attendees including senior management. Our message is being heard! Corporate Responsibility 34 Q: What steps are being taken at State Street to support an inclusive and diverse workplace? We want to create an environment where people of all backgrounds and experiences can succeed. Three key components of our effort are to: • Establish our leaders as champions of diversity and inclusion and give them the tools and resources to help convey the importance and business value of a diverse workforce • Ensure that we’re building a sustainable pipeline of diverse talent for leadership positions • Implement a clear standard to hold leaders accountable for creating a diverse workforce and behaving inclusively One way we celebrate and support our differences is through employee networks. Open to all employees, these networks create volunteer, career development and cultural opportunities. State Street supports 23 employeeestablished networks and affinity groups with more than 100 chapters globally. Q: What are your plans for maintaining diversity and inclusion over the long term? Building a truly diverse and inclusive workforce is a journey for any company. Last year, we took a big step by introducing a three-year strategy to educate employees, shift behavior and embed these elements throughout the company. We’ve already made progress in 2015 by setting new goals, establishing an approach to report progress, sourcing diverse talent from within and improving leadership opportunities for internal talent. We’ll continue to analyze the success of our diversity and inclusion efforts through our biennial employee opinion survey and by participating in external surveys that allow us to benchmark ourselves against our peers.

In 2015, we spent about $3.9 billion globally on products and services including financial, IT, business and professional services, and market data, travel management and office support. The team also sets procurement standards, identifies suitable suppliers, and negotiates favorable price and contract terms. It pinpoints the “best-in-class” processes, technology and tools that will help us reach our spending and risk management objectives. In addition, it selects suppliers that support our drive for social responsibility. Striving for Responsibility Wherever possible we choose to work with suppliers who offer products and services that will reduce our overall environmental footprint as part of our Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Program (EPPP). In cases where the eco-friendly solution is more costly, however, we have to manage trade-offs between environmental and economic goals. In 2015, we expanded our EPPP goals related to our IT purchases and disposals. These goals include the prioritization of purchasing Energy STAR®-certified devices and working with vendors that have a product recycling or take-back program. The EPPP is currently focused on direct suppliers in North America and EMEA, and we hope to expand its scope in 2016. Going forward, we also want to explore including second-tier suppliers used by our major vendors. In addition, we screen new suppliers in North America for environmental and ethical aspects in our RFP process. Exploring Local Sourcing When scale and cost permit, we use local suppliers whenever we can. If our global business needs limit our options for local sourcing, we encourage our larger global suppliers to use local second-tier vendors if they can. Starting in 2016, we plan to explore including local sourcing questions in our Global Procurement’s RFP process. In addition, we plan to monitor which second-tier vendors our larger suppliers use. We’ll also explore how local sourcing and our supplier diversity program — which measures and encourages sourcing from businesses owned by minorities, veterans and women — can support each other. Corporate Responsibility 37 Supporting Communities and the Environment Actively engaging our global communities is one of our fundamental values, and is one reason why our commitment to social and environmental responsibility is a cornerstone of our long-term success. Since 2014, we’ve been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact — a global initiative uniting organizations to help build prosperous societies. These organizations believe responsible business practices create a stable, equitable and inclusive global market. With the same rigor we apply to our business, we use our resources — both human and financial — to support our communities. Not only are we committed to using these resources responsibly to protect the environment, we know we can use them to attract and retain clients and employees and reduce costs. Prosperity and financial security At the Center of the Global Economy As of December 31, 2015, we had $28 trillion of assets under custody and administration and $2 trillion of assets under management.** Our position at the center of the world’s financial markets comes with responsibility — something we never take lightly. We help clients make the right connections, bringing opportunities into focus and paving the way ahead, whether they are based in the most established markets or in those just emerging. The E7, a group of seven emerging economies, will have close to 50 percent of global banking assets by 2050. It held less than 20 percent in 2013. To meet the demand fueled by this globalization, we’re committed to global expansion and further integration of our products and services. Enabling Graceful Retirement Our strong pension fund services help many people around the world retire gracefully. Pension funds have often been expected to play a conservative role in the financial system as long-term investors. As the current investment climate leads them to consider new strategies to deliver value to their members, we help them navigate the challenges in the financial landscape and provide comprehensive investment management solutions, such as target-date funds. Creating Local Jobs With more than 32,000 employees globally, we help to create job opportunities in the communities where we live and work. The new staff we hire comes mostly from the local community. For example, at the level of senior vice president and above, 31 of the 35 new hires in 2015 were local. A significant number of local jobs will also become available through our Boston WINs project (see pages 44-46) over the upcoming years. ** Assets under management include approximately $22 billion as of December 31, 2015, for which State Street Global Markets, LLC, an affiliate of SSGA, serves as the distribution agent. Corporate Responsibility 38 Strengthening communities Fostering Employee Engagement Through our employee engagement surveys, employees have told us they want to pursue projects that are meaningful to them. Two years ago, we transformed our global employee giving program from an annual “giving campaign” to an ongoing awareness and open-choice platform. By encouraging our employees to work directly in their local communities on projects they’re passionate about, we’ve transformed employee engagement. Together with the State Street Foundation, the charitable arm of our business, employee volunteering and giving are also supported by our Giving, Investing, Volunteering by Employees (G.I.V.E) initiative.

It also provides matching gift programs, such as our DoMore grant, which monetizes volunteer hours to increase their impact. To further inspire employees, we started the story-telling initiative “This Is Why I Give” that lets employees share stories from causes they support. In 2015, stories came from more than 150 events organized by our Corporate Citizenship team, our Community Support Program committees and our business teams. These inspirational events included collections for Syrian refugees in Ireland, Italy and Germany; “Chasing Ice” events to raise climate change awareness in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei; and volunteer recruitment events for our Boston WINs program in Massachusetts (see pages 44-46). In 2015, the G.I.V.E. program logged a record 116,000 hours of volunteer service and generated $4.1 million in employee donations. The passion and engagement of our company and staff is also shown in the size of our corporate citizenship social media community, which increased by more than 60 percent in 2015 to more than 3,000 members.

That’s why we encourage all of our senior executives to serve on nonprofit boards, and offer grants and matching gifts to enrich their board service. Our newly launched Senior Vice President Community Leadership Program also supports leaders who have committed time and resources to serving on charitable boards. These programs not only uphold our commitment to charitable initiatives, they also help cultivate our staff’s professional talents and growth. Corporate Responsibility 41 Targeting Support for Education and Workforce Development We make grants to nonprofits and NGOs in 20 of the countries where we operate through our charitable arm, the State Street Foundation. In 2015, the Foundation distributed $22.7 million in funding to nonprofit organizations. Of this, $10 million was in strategic grants for programs aligned with the Foundation’s strategic focus of education and workforce development (see table below for regional breakdown). The remainder included $4.15 million in matching gifts for employee contributions (a 27 percent increase over 2014) and a significant investment in our Boston WINs initiative. 2015 Strategic Grantmaking by Region APAC $712,000 EMEA $1,952,000 Massachusetts $6,250,000 North America (excluding Massachusetts) $1,466,000 Total $10,380,000 Corporate Responsibility 42 State Street Foundation Impact APAC Massachusetts EMEA NA (Excluding Mass.) 2015 Community Organization Impact Community Organization Totals 71 36 $240K 3,935 829 $1,239K 7,775 1,535 $4,487K 2,615 904 $1,274K $ 3,304 7,240K 14,396 Total Grant Value Students on track Students who to attain a secondary attained a secondary school degree school degree 9 58 85 95 1,252 1,032 247 54 17 Number of Grants 4,231 1,012 780 738 6,317 2,799 Participants on track Participants who to attain credentials attained credentials 58 131 304 166 4,905 1,482 1,939 4,278 7,206 6,057 Participants who Participants placed in complete transitional permanent jobs employment Corporate Responsibility 43 Boston WINs We spoke with Mike Scannell about how this exciting new program will help prepare Boston youth for sustainable employment. Q: What is Boston WINs and what led you to introduce this program? We launched the Boston Workforce Investment Network (WINs) Michael Scannell Senior Vice President, Human in June 2015 to support Boston youth in education and Resources workforce preparation. In addition to overseeing State Street’s When I took on responsibility of Corporate Citizenship in early Corporate Citizenship, Talent Acquisition and Global Inclusion areas, 2014, a new vision for the State Street Foundation, our Mike serves as the president of the charitable arm for over 37 years, was beginning to take shape. State Street Foundation, our Our Chairman and CEO, Jay Hooley, challenged us to think charitable arm. differently about our approach to corporate philanthropy and to reconsider how we could deliver the greatest impact for each dollar invested. So I went back to our Foundation team and we got to work. We decided to focus our efforts on education and preparing disadvantaged young people for employment. In a given year, we used to contribute hundreds of grants. Boston WINs helped us narrow our focus. It’s an opportunity to be involved with our nonprofit partners over a longer term and accelerate our impact on education and workforce development. The ultimate goal is to increase the number of career-ready youth in Boston. Q: How is Boston WINs structured? Five nonprofit organizations targeting inner-city Boston youth are involved. We selected these organizations — Year Up, Bottom Line, Boston PIC, uAspire and College Advising Corps — after thorough due diligence. We wanted to engage organizations with strong leadership that shared our vision, who were willing to collaborate and could use our contributions in a meaningful way. Corporate Responsibility 44 With the right group of organizations, we knew we could offer more substantial contributions and provide a platform for improved collaboration that would offer greater value to the community. The program involves three main contributions from us: we provide $20 million over the next four years to our group of partner organizations; we pledge to hire 1,000 individuals served by these organizations over the same time; and we commit to staying involved. This includes having State Street leaders hold board of director positions, encouraging our employees to volunteer and offering a 2-to-1 match of employee donations to these organizations. Q: What would make Boston WINs a success story? We want to make a significant impact on education and career success for Boston youth with this game-changing corporate philanthropy initiative. To help us succeed, we’re outlining our expectations and have engaged a network partner to help facilitate meetings so we can all remain in alignment and track outcomes. As this program gets in full swing, we’ll learn from the experience for engagements beyond the Boston area. Our hope is to take those lessons learned and use the blueprint of Boston WINs to potentially introduce a similar program in other parts of the world where we operate. Corporate Responsibility 45 Boston WINs Through our employees, Foundation and resources, we’ve committed the following to the Boston WINs initiative: $ Volunteers Pledge to hire 1,000 Boston Mentors youth for entry-level positions Board Positions and career opportunities Boston WINs $20 million + 2-to-1 employee matching gift program Corporate Responsibility 46 Environmental sustainability 20/20 Goals 2012 Baseline Emissions 2015 Water 2012 Baseline tons cubic feet 2015 % Reduction % Reduction 20% reduction in scope 1 + 2 utility emissions 20% reduction in water consumption per per employee at office sites with actual data employee at office sites with actual data 4.0 1000 18% 17% 16% 3.0 750 16% 10% 17% 2.0 500 20% 5% 1.0 250 0 Global NA APAC EMEA 0 Global NA APAC EMEA Waste 2012 Baseline 2015 Regional Footprint EMEA percent diverted 2015 by region APAC 2015 Diversion Rate % NA “Zero-Waste” 90% diversion from Distribution of absolute consumption landfill of actual data site waste 100% 90% 91% 100% 89% 21% 27% 34% 74% 5% 3% 75% 75% 13% 50% 50% 74% 70% 53% 25% 25% 0 Global NA APAC EMEA 0 Emissions Water Waste Corporate Responsibility 47 Reducing for the Long Term As part of our responsibility to protect social well-being and our planet, in 2013 we committed to reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 20 percent per person by 2020, compared to a 2012 baseline. In 2015, we continued to make substantial progress toward our goal. At the end of the year, we had achieved a 17 percent reduction in GHG emissions. This reduction was primarily due to our increased occupancy of more efficient office space, a favorable change in emissions factors used in calculations and an increase in the overall number of employees against which emissions are factored. Our environmental data shows the main source of our GHG emissions is the energy we use in our operations, followed by emissions from employee commuting and business travel. By focusing on our operations, while supporting sustainable commuting options and flexible work solutions that reduce commuting, we’re creating significant change that brings us ever closer to our goals. To further mitigate the impact of our global business travel, our investment in a wind power project near our new office in Gdansk, Poland, offset 26,000 metric tons of carbon impact from our 2014 business travel. Making Progress, Creating Challenges We’ve made great progress in the last few years in our energy efficiency. However, this has brought its challenges. To make further progress, we’ll keep tabs on technology and infrastructure innovations to find new opportunities to reduce emissions. Our new global energy policy will support us as well as new certifications to the global ISO 50001 energy management standard. In 2015, our offices in Dublin, Edinburgh and London were certified to this standard. As part of our global expansion, we opened a new office in Gdansk, Poland, in February 2016. We realize that using larger premises will also increase emissions. To mitigate the emissions from this additional office space, we chose an energy-efficient, LEED platinum precertified building. We also continued work on data center virtualization to avoid emissions increases as IT requirements grow. In response to a regulatory requirement defined in the European Energy Efficiency Directive, we also completed energy audits in seven EU office locations. Operations in the UK were covered by our ISO 50001 energy management certification. Receiving Recognition for Our Efforts In 2015, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognized us as one of the nation’s top 100 purchasers of Green Power for our purchase of 211 million kilowatt-hours (kWh) of green-e certified RECs covering State Street’s 2014 purchased electricity in the US. To continue the program we purchased another 202 million kWh, representing 110 percent of purchased electricity in 2015. We were also recognized in 2015 by CDP, a not-for-profit organization supporting environmental impact disclosures by major corporations, for achieving its A-level of GHG emissions performance. We were also included in CDP’s leadership index for achieving a score of 99 out of 100 for our environmental disclosures. Corporate Responsibility 48 Impacts of climate change Strengthening Risk Excellence We focus on managing risk in everything we do. As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact, we’re specifically committed to a precautionary approach to environmental challenges. Also, our ISO 14001 certification at 17 of our largest operations globally requires us to evaluate environmental risks over the long term. In 2015, our Office of Environmental Sustainability developed an environmental risk excellence matrix that evaluated strategic and market risks, regulatory risks, reputational risks and physical risks. While climate change isn’t a major risk to our operations right now, we identified certain risks and mitigation strategies primarily involving strategic and reputational risk. We’ll continue to diligently monitor and evaluate these and the other risks we identified. Turning Strategic and Market Risks into Opportunities Many market players see carbon-related assets as an increasing risk factor for their investments. For example, fossil fuel assets could become “stranded” if new regulations prohibit their extraction. Or, if the cost of low-carbon substitutes declines, it could impact share values of companies that own them. Clients may seek new ways to protect themselves from such risks. Our strong focus on environmental financial solutions turns these risks into opportunities. Products like our lowcarbon exchange traded fund (ETF) and our new fossil fuel-free ETF, together with ESG screening strategies, give us a leading position in the market. For more information on our ESG financial solutions, see pages 20-24. Mitigating Regulatory and Reputational Risks Increasing global and regional climate regulations might require us to mitigate our greenhouse gas emissions even beyond our voluntary commitments. And clients, analysts and industry rankings may put more pressure on us to demonstrate climate leadership. But we’re prepared. We’re committed to our 20 percent carbon reduction goal (see page 47) and continuously monitor our progress. Our ISO 14001 risk reviews and the work of our Regulatory, Industry and Government Affairs team keep us well informed on new regulations relevant to our business. Our public disclosures on corporate responsibility, including this report, make sure we tell a clear story on our sustainability initiatives. Maintaining Business Continuity A business continuity event — big or small — can impact any business with physical operations. Climate change can contribute to such physical risks, for example through more frequent severe weather events or sea level rise. As financial services centers around the world are often by or near the coastline, our peers and our own company may be impacted by these risks. We assess and observe such risks in our ISO 14001 risk reviews and risk register. Our Global Continuity Services team leads our efforts to ensure continuity of our operations in the event of a business interruption. We’re committed to protecting our clients from any service interruptions, including those related to climate change, in addition to taking responsibility for mitigating our own climate impacts. Corporate Responsibility 49 Appendix UN Global Compact alignment In December 2014, we became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), the world’s largest corporate citizenship initiative, which that is based on 10 universal principles. This table shows where information on our approach to the UNGC principles can be found in this report.

Corporate Responsibility 53 Assurance statement 2015 ERM CVS Assurance Statement Independent Assurance Statement to State Street ERM Certification and Verification Services (ERM CVS) was engaged by State Street to provide limited assurance in relation to State Street’s 2015 corporate responsibility reporting as set out below. Engagement Summary Selected information for the year 2015 in the State Street 2015 Corporate Responsibility Report (CR Report) and the 2015 State Street GRI G4 Report as follows: Materiality assessment and stakeholder engagement as described on pages 8 to 9 in the CR Report and in G4-17 to G4-27 in the GRI G4 Report. Scope of our Disclosure of Management Approach (DMA) and the 2015 performance for the 15 assurance material topics identified on page 9 which are reported in the CR Report and engagement marked as “Included in ERM CVS assurance engagement” in the 2015 GRI G4 Report. The 2015 data for the additional environmental targets (water and waste) as reported on pages 3 and 47 in the CR Report and related GRI indicators marked as “Included in ERM CVS assurance engagement” in the 2015 GRI G4 Report. Reporting criteria GRI G4 Reporting Guidelines. Assurance ERM CVS’ assurance methodology, based on the International Standard on Assurance Standard Engagements ISAE 3000 (Revised).

State Street is responsible for preparing the information and data in the 2015 CR and GRI G4 Reports and for its correct presentation, including disclosure of the reporting criteria Respective and boundary. responsibilities ERM CVS’ responsibility is to provide conclusions on the agreed scope based on the assurance activities performed and exercising our professional judgment. Our assurance activities Our objective was to assess whether the selected information is reported in accordance with the principles of completeness, accuracy, consistency and balance as well as with GRI G4 indicator criteria. We planned and performed our work to obtain all the information and explanations that we believed were necessary to provide a basis for our assurance conclusions. A global, multi-disciplinary team of corporate responsibility (CR) and assurance specialists performed the following activities: • Attendance as observer at a materiality workshop in September 2015. • An external factors review of media and Internet sources to understand potential material corporate responsibility issues for the 2015 State Street CR Report. • Attendance and Q&A at the interviews undertaken by the report writers with key State Street management representatives. • A review of documentation relating to State Street’s stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment to ensure the list of material issues reflects the results of these processes. • In order to collect further evidence, we also undertook interviews with key State Street managers representing the following offices: Global Human Resources, ESG Investing, CBRE Real Estate Services (for the GHG and environmental data), Corporate Social Responsibility, Procurement and Compliance & Ethics. • Interviews with relevant staff to understand and evaluate the data management systems and processes (including IT systems and internal review processes) used for collecting and reporting the selected data; Corporate Responsibility 54 • For the selected environmental data, interviews with the external consultant CBRE responsible for collecting and consolidating utility data across State Street’s operations as well as a review of the completeness and accuracy of the data including unit and emission conversion factors for energy use and GHG emissions, the reasonableness of estimations and extrapolations and the accuracy of the consolidation. • A check of the consistency of the financial data with State Street’s 2015 10K submission for the relevant data. • For the selected information, a review of the consistency of reporting in the CR Report with the information in the 2015 GRI G4 Report. The limitations of our assurance engagement For the financial data, we have restricted our work to checking consistency with the audited State Street Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ending December 31, 2015 for the relevant data. We have not assured personal views expressed in the letters and interviews incorporated in the CR Report. Our work was restricted to the 2015 reporting year, so no assurance is given on prior year data, or on future performance or expectations. The reliability of the assured data is subject to inherent uncertainties, given the available methods for determining, calculating or estimating the underlying information. Our conclusions Based on our activities, nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the selected information in the State Street 2015 CR reporting, as described under the “Scope” above, is not fairly presented, in all material respects, with the reporting criteria. Our observations We have provided State Street with a separate, detailed management report. Without affecting the conclusions presented above, we have the following key observations: • State Street has further developed its stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment during 2015. It has used these as a basis for building the CR Report around the 15 material CR topics identified in these processes, providing more focus for this year’s CR Report. However, we note that the CR Report does not always include disclosure of the Management Approach (GRI DMA) and the 2015 performance (GRI indicators) for each material topic, so users need to reference the information in the State Street GRI G4 Report to obtain a more comprehensive picture. We therefore recommend that State Street considers publishing a fully standalone CR Report next year including the DMA elements and key annual performance for each material topic, in addition to insets with interviews or more qualitative information. • While State Street has included more graphics in the CR Report this year, a number of key performance data are reported in the text and are for 2015 only, rather than in comparison to the prior years’ performance. We recommend the consistent use of multi-year graphs for the presentation of key performance indicators for each material topic in next year’s report to give the user a clear picture of performance over time.
