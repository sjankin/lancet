Together with our Italian partner, CNHI/IVECO, we have again proved ourselves as a reliable supplier of high-quality trucks and equipment for diverse and challenging tasks at UN Missions worldwide. In 2015, we continued to support the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan with our mortuary services at Kandahar Airfield. We have been present in Afghanistan since 2008 and hope we can still help the peace and stabilisation efforts by supporting military forces in the country in the future. In 2015, we also had the opportunity to support the Royal Danish Air Force, stationed in Kuwait, with prefabricated buildings for offices and Morale, Welfare and Recreation Services. We hope and expect to expand our camp services worldwide with both tented and containerised solutions. In 2016, we wish to further improve our work with the UN Global Compact’s (UNGC) ten principles and also the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Our main focus for 2016 is to continue to support humanitarian missions worldwide, especially the growing number of refugees and forced displaced people, by means of turnkey camp solutions and logistics operations. Overall, our goal is to provide something better for more people using the right resources.
