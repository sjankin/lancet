In 2016 we will further strengthen our position by conducting internal workshops on the use of social media in a professional role. The purpose is to identify and discuss issues related to this area and to raise awareness among all employees. Our ambition and goal for the year is to keep our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Human Rights intact. Principle 3, 4, 5 and 6 – Labour  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining (P3)  The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour (P4);  The effective abolition of child labour (P5);  and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (P6). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to the strict laws (of Sweden and UK) pertaining to the freedom of association and labour practices, and actively and continuously works to promote equality at the workplace. Our ambition and goal for the year is to keep our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Labour intact. Principle 7, 8 and 9 – Environment  Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges (P7).  Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility (P8)  and encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies (P9). 4C Strategies will continue its progressive work (recycling, cyber meetings, minimizing waste, promoting public transportation and bicycling etc) in this area. No new and additional actions are planned for 2016. However, there are ongoing discussions whether the time has come for 4C Strategies to appoint a dedicated resource for environmental issues. 4C Strategies AB http://www.4cstrategies.com Telefon: +46(0)8-522 279 00 Stockholm info@4cstrategies.com Fax: +46(0)8-20 15 62 2016-11-30 COP 2016 4(4) Principle 10 – Anti-corruption  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery (P10). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to Swedish and UK legislation regarding corruption. 4C Strategies conducts, since a few years back, detailed and regular inspection of all company representation; all bills from travels, dinner and drinks, gifts, conferences, fairs, exhibitions have to be approved by the Line Manager as well as the CEO, and must be presented with a legal receipt or else the employee is not reimbursed. Also since 2015, we run mandatory internal training and education in all important legal areas, including anti-corruption. Measurement of outcomes Human Rights A first workshop for employees on the use of social media in a professional role. During 2016, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Human Rights has been received. Labour The average gender ratio for 2016 was 34% women (same as in 2014 and 2015). In other words, we have not improved nor have we lost ground. Hence, the aim remains to achieve a more balanced ratio. During 2016, no formal complaint or legal issue related to Labour has been received. Environment  We continue use 100% fossil free electricity at the Stockholm office.  More second-hand office furniture has been bought.
