In 2015, main topics of discussion were: System Maintenance – Furnas worked significantly with the Brazilian Association of Large Electricity Transmission Companies (Abrate) in making contributions to Normative Resolution 669, which takes into consideration all the minimum activities required to maintain the system, a matter that has a large financial impact on energy transmission companies. Recommendations included improvements in maintenance procedures. Asset Management – The subject was addressed in discussions in Abrate and the Brazilian Association of Thermoelectric Generators (Abraget), particularly as regards indemnity of non-depreciated assets, facilities transfers to distribution companies and recovery of investment capacity for transmission companies. Along with the Brazilian Association on Maintenance and Asset Management (Abraman), a topic of discussion involved a technical procedure (PAS-55) to improve the management system for all types of physical assets at companies; an issue in line with Furnas’ strategic planning. Currently, this procedure has achieved ISO certification (ISO 55000, 55001 and 55002). For 2016, Abraman plans to develop an MBA on Asset Management. Physical guarantees and hydrological risks – The Brazilian Association of Electric Power Generation Companies (Abrage) has been addressing this issue and, in 2015, was particularly focused on several topics, including a review of the physical guarantee for hydroelectric projects centrally situated in the National Interconnected System (SIN); conceptual discussions about the Generation Scaling Factor (GSF); and the renegotiation of hydrological risk.

With an unfavorable hydrological situation in 2015, it was possible to shut down the generating units for such activities.

The equivalent reservoir, which is represented by the 35,371 total volume of water stored in Furnas' hydroelectric reservoirs, ended the period at 24% capacity. Although relatively low, these levels did not impact the generation of electricity. Because they are part of the National Interconnected System (SIN), the levels of the reservoirs of the hydroelectric plants and the amounts of power to be dispatched are defined by the ONS, which operates the Brazilian reservoir system in an integrated manner, designed to guarantee energy safety at lower costs. |GRI G4-DMA| 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 38 FURNAS ● SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 OPERATING PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION The transmission system's average conjunction with the regional operoperational availability factor ation centers.

In the five units in the Company where, under Occupational Health and Safety Legislation (NR5), there is no requirement to set up a Cipa, employees known as “designees” are nominated for positions on the Cipas. Furnas also has an Accident Prevention and Occupational Health Committee, composed of representatives of all departments, and a Standing Committee for Accident Prevention. |GRI G4-LA5| Formed by union representatives, the Standing Committee was created by union agreement, which includes a specific clause in which the Company agrees to keep it active. The committee monitors workplace health and safety activities and compliance with legislation, meeting periodically in the central office of Furnas. An annual schedule of meetings defines the issues to be addressed regarding questions raised in consultation with employees. |GRI G4-LA8| With the aim of disseminating good practices to ensure the safety and welfare of the workforce, an Internal Accident Prevention Week (Sipat) is organized, with lectures and activities, focused on quality of life and safety. In general, no Furnas or outsourced direct labor employees are involved in workplace activities with a high incidence or high risk of specific disease. However, the Company makes available counseling, treatment and training when necessary to assist employees and family members when faced with serious diseases who rely on health plan coverage.

Furnas has received the Gold Seal in this program since 2012, which is awarded to companies whose inventories are complete inventories and have been verified by Inmetro-accredited agencies, and it should maintain such GHG Inventory recognition for the year of 2015.

FURNAS ● SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 69 ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE Biodiversity |GRI G4-DMA, G4-EN12| The Company’s generation and transmission operations represent a potential impact on biodiversity in the regions where its projects are located. During the process of installing hydroelectric power plants, the main impacts arise from the damming of the river, with the flooding of the river banks and transformation of the section of the river ecosystem (from river to lake), which may provoke changes in the natural habitats of the fauna and flora, such as in the migratory activities of aquatic life and in the food chain. During the operational phase, there may be alterations in water quality, proliferation of aquatic macrophytes and changes in the composition and abundance of fish species. Moreover, restrictions must be observed regarding the occupation and use of land bordering the reservoirs, because they are surrounded by Permanent Preservation Areas (APPs). For transmission projects, preventive measures are adopted as of their conception and definition of the route. Protected areas and native forest fragments are avoided, while taller towers and special cable laying techniques are used to avoid suppression of the vegetation. In the Seedling nurseries (RJ) implementation stage, the impacts result from the opening up of access roads, assembly of the towers and OPERATING UNITS IN AREAS WITH A HIGH BIODIVERSITY LEVEL (km2) |GRI G4-EN11| the laying of cables, with a reduction in plant biomass, fragmentation 2013 2014 2015 of land habitats, interference with the aquatic biota and diminished Adjacent protected areas 160.85 164.71 164.71 abundance and diversity of fauna.
