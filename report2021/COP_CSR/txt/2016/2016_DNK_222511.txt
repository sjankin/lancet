Preface 3 Financial key figures DSB recorded a profit before tax of DKK 580 million in 2015. Adjusted for non-recurring items, the profit is on the same level as in 2014. Passenger revenues fell, primarily as a consequence of the extensive track improvement works carried out during the year. Interest-bearing liabilities were reduced by DKK 2.2 billion to DKK 7.2 billion, and the equity ratio increased to 34.0. The continued significant reduction of interest-bearing liabilities was achieved because DSB’s depreciation on existing rolling stock exceeds the amounts invested in new rolling stock and because of the positive financial results. DSB will be facing extensive and necessary investments in new rolling stock in the coming years. Customer growth continued in 2015. The number of journeys sold rose by almost 2 percent compared with 2014. Increases were contributed by regional journeys on Sealand as well as S-train journeys. S-tog had more customers in 2015 than ever before. But the number of journeys across the Great Belt fell as a consequence of extensive track improvement works and increased competition from busses and private cars. Though DSB, overall, had more customers than in 2014, ticket revenues fell by 4.1 percent. Fewer long journeys led to lower average prices. Based on the satisfactory profit, DSB will be paying a dividend to its sole owner, the Danish state, for the first time since the 2012 accounts. DSB recommends that the Annual Meeting adopt a dividend to the Danish state of DKK 173 million for 2015. In connection with the extension of the political agreement for A Green Transport Policy in 2015, DSB has added DKK 101 million to the pool for improved access to public transport (the parking pool). Customers With 7.5 – on a 10-point scale – customer satisfaction was retained at a high level in a year with many challenges. Among other things, satisfaction with Internet in the train increased, partly as it was extended to cover the whole country for IC3-, IC4and IR4-train sets, and partly because it was made free for all customers and upgraded to 4G. DSB will build on this success in 2016. Among other initiatives, tests of a new entertainment package via DSB’s Internet in the train have been planned for the first half of 2016. 2015 also brought more low-price tickets to the customers. DSB has made a targeted effort to create dynamic pricing of the Orange Tickets. Overall, 581,000 Orange Tickets were sold, which is 131,000 more than in 2014. Finally, it has become easier for the customers to purchase commuter seat tickets and Orange Tickets. Both types of tickets can now be purchased via the DSB app, and the commuter seat tickets are also available from the ticket vending machines at the stations. Purchases in the DSB app may be paid via MobilePay, which less than six months after its launch accounts for more than half of all purchases via the app. The Transport Contract 2015-2024 In March 2015 DSB concluded a new transport contract with the Danish state, which covers both Long-distance & Regional Trains and S-tog. According to the framework of the transport contract, DSB must continue the efficiency enhancements the corporation has implemented in recent years. DSB’s strategy focuses on the corporation delivering annual improvements in terms of operations, and this requirement is highlighted with the new transport contract. In other words: DSB must deliver more train seats to the Danes with the same money. In September 2015 the transport con4 Preface tract was supplemented with an Addendum to the effect that the contract payment to DSB is reduced by DKK 2.7 billion over the duration of the contract. Revenues from transport contracts were reduced by DKK 73 million in 2015 as a consequence. Revenue from transport contracts is affected by the transfer of the Øresund activity on 13 December 2015. Focus on customer punctuality In the new transport contract improvements on customer punctuality is a target. Customer punctuality is measured as customers on time and not trains on time. No distinction is made in customer punctuality between whether the delay was caused by circumstances for which DSB or Banedanmark (Rail Net Denmark) is responsible. S-tog delivered 95 percent of its passengers within the 2:59 minutes margin, once again improving customer punctuality in 2015. The customer punctuality of Long-distance and Regional Trains was 78.5 percent, unfortunately somewhat lower than in 2014. In terms of passengers and customer punctuality, the main challenges were the extensive track improvement works and their effects in 2015. DSB Øresund realised a customer punctuality of 76.6 percent, which is lower than 2014. When it comes to the operator punctuality, which is the punctuality which DSB is able to control, DSB meets the transport contract target. The important infrastructure In the medium as well as in the long term DSB is very dependent on a punctual completion of the planned electrification and roll-out of the Signal Programme. The electrification is essential to ensure that DSB is able to deliver stable train operations during the contract period and that the new electrical rolling stock – in which DSB is planning to invest – can be used in the infrastructure. Investing in new rolling stock is a process that takes four to five years. Therefore, it is essential for the decisions to be made in the coming years that DSB knows when the main route to Århus/Aalborg/Frederikshavn and the routes on Zealand to Kalundborg and to Rødby Havn will be electrified. DSB’s train fleet is ageing. Stable and environmentally friendly train operations with a high punctuality in the future are dependent on the upcoming investments. The challenge is critical on Zealand where regional transport with the double-decker coaches is based on traction provided by 30-year-old diesel locomotives. DSB is taking a number of initiatives to reduce the pollution from these locomotives and ensure their operational stability, but the optimal solution is to acquire new electrical locomotives based on the completed electrification on Zealand. It is also important for the continued efficient operations of trains that the roll-out of the Signal Programme follows the planned schedule. The uncertainty concerning the final specifications for the new signal system adds additional complexity and costs to the task of specifying the requirements for new rolling stock. These challenges are particularly relevant if new rolling stock is to be able to operate on the present as well as the future signal system. IC4 – progress but still many challenges DSB continues to focus on developing IC4and IC2 train sets, and during 2015 the train sets underwent ongoing optimisation of the technical functionality, and a number of important problems pointed out by Swiss Prose and SBB in December 2014 have now been solved. However, there are still extensive challenges to achieving satisfactory operational stability for the train sets. During 2016 DSB will closely monitor, that the operational stability and quality develops as anticipated, in order to assess the role for the IC4 train sets in the future train operations. Preface 5 Employee satisfaction DSB’s annual employee satisfaction analysis and workplace assessment (MTAPV) show that job satisfaction has increased compared with 2014. DSB is pleased to find that job satisfaction is moving in the right direction, although it has not yet reached a satisfactory level. Analysis of train operations For the first time in this Annual Report, DSB has chosen to integrate its analysis of train operations in the report. The analysis provides information about how DSB’s expenses for train operations are made up and what routes make a profit or a loss. The purpose of the analysis is to ensure transparency and contribute to public debate about train operations in Denmark. High-speed trains and IC trains between Copenhagen and Aarhus operated at a profit before the contract payment in 2015. The same applies to S-tog. The remaining lines require a contract payment and a contribution of the profit from the profit-making lines. The difference is due to the number of passengers travelling and thus the capacity utilisation over the period for which the transport contract requires train services. ”DSB’s employees have made a great and committed effort to overcome the many challenges of 2015. The coming years will also require a great effort to be made by the entire organisation to ensure that DSB can continue to deliver a product that lives up to the customers’ expectations, while at the same time constantly enhancing efficiency” Flemming Jensen, CEO Taastrup, 25 February 2016 _________________________ _______________________ Peter Schütze Flemming Jensen Chairman of the Board CEO The interim report is published in both a Danish and an English language version.

The financial management aims to control the financial risks in this relation. The general framework for the financial risk management is laid down in the financial policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. In accordance with the policy DSB Finances supervises, identifies, plans and manages risks. The management regularly supervises DSB’s risk exposure and capital adequacy. The purpose of financial hedging is to limit and control the impact of financial fluctuations on the financial markets on the profit. There are no material changes in DSB's risk exposure or risk management compared with 2014.

It is DSB's policy to always have sufficient capital reserves available. The aim is to always have a liquidity reserve that corresponds to the development in the expected net debt for the approved budget year plus DKK 200 million, but never less than DKK 1.0 billion. The liquidity reserve consists of liquid funds and the possibility of utilising bank facilities. At 31 December 2015 DSB had concluded agreements regarding terminable bank facilities of DKK 1,750 million and non-terminable facilities of DKK 2,500 million to expire during the period 2017-2021 (2014: terminable of DKK 2,270 million and non-terminable of DKK 2,500 million to expire in the period 2015-2018).

The current portion of non-current liabilities includes the market value of currency swaps of DKK 142 million (2014: DKK 108 million). All foreign currency loans have been converted into DKK via currency swaps. In the parent corporation DKK 2,686 million of the debt portfolio was raised without state guarantee (2014: DKK 3,591 million). The remaining loans are all guaranteed by the Danish state, to which a guarantee commission is payable. The fair value of derivative financial instruments used for hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risks associated with financing activities is DKK -830 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: DKK -1,286 million). Consequently, DKK -338 million is recognised in equity (2014 DKK -546 million). At 31 December 2015 derivative financial instruments with a positive and a negative fair value were DKK 216 million and DKK 1,155 million, respectively. Interest rate risk As a consequence of financing activities DSB is exposed to fluctuations in the level of interest rates in Denmark as well as abroad. The primary interest rate exposure in connection with financing relates to fluctuations in CIBOR, LIBOR, NIBOR, EURIBOR and STIBOR. The policy is to convert all loans so that DSB only has interest rate risks in CIBOR and EURIBOR. Interest rate risks are normally hedged through interest rate swaps where a floating-rate loan is converted into a fixed-interest loan. Within a 12-month period the interest rate sensitivity may not exceed DKK 50 million (at an interest rate change of 1 percentage point), the debt portfolio must have a duration of between 3 and 8 years and minimum 50 percent of the debt portfolio is required to have a fixed interest. In pursuance of the above, the weighted average duration of the net debt was 5.5 years (2014: 5.1 years) and 70 percent of the net financial liabilities had been converted into fixed-interest liabilities with an expected maturity of less than one year (2014: 72 percent). Floating-rate debt is adjusted regularly over the year. Exchange rate uncertainty associated with financial activity Foreign exchange risks are hedged on recognised financial assets and liabilities in such a way that minimum 75 percent of the risk is in DKK. In addition, there can only be risks in EUR and other currencies if they are part of the Group companies’ financing or hedging of exposures from Group companies. The most important foreign exchange exposures concern loans raised in EUR, USD, NOK, JPY and SEK that are hedged by means of derivatives, currency swaps. With this hedging DSB is not exposed to any significant foreign exchange risks from financing activities. Other booked positions represent an immaterial part of DSB's currency exposure and future cash flow in foreign currencies is calculated for the coming 12 months, of which an average of 30-70 percent is hedged. 46 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts of the parent corporation Note 11: Financial income and expenses (continued) Foreign exchange risks in connection with operations primarily relate to DSB’s fuel consumption. Other foreign exchange risks in connection with trade with international counterparties are limited, except for SEK and EUR as explained below. DSB has foreign exchange risks in connection with SEK as a consequence of its Swedish Group company which operate under a transport contract in Sweden and a contract concluded regarding maintenance of the Swedish Øresund train sets and in EUR from acquisition of rolling stock. DSB has equity investments in foreign Group companies, whose net assets are affected by exchange rate fluctuations in connection with translation into DKK in the consolidated annual accounts. This translation risk is not hedged. Other than the above, DSB has no significant foreign exchange risks.

Raw materials risk DSB uses fuel and electricity for its operations, which exposes DSB to price risks. At the start of a budget year the exposure must be hedged. The hedging is carried out on an ongoing basis leading up to the budget year. The hedging is carried out through conclusion of raw materials price swap agreements. The hedging carried out of the electricity consumption is used to hedge 73 percent of the expected consumption in 2016 and the rest for the subsequent years. Similarly, 93 percent of the hedging carried out of the fuel consumption is used for the expected consumption in 2016 and the rest subsequently. The hedging carried out reflects DSB’s risk exposure.

Counterparty risk A counterparty risk arises when financial derivative instruments are concluded to hedge the Group’s financial risks or when liquidity is placed with financial counterparties. The risk is that the counterparties fail to fulfil their obligations to DSB. The derivative financial instruments are distributed on seven counterparties (2014: seven counterparties) of which the largest net receivable is DKK 0 million at year-end (2014: DKK 64 million). All financial counterparties have a credit rating of Investment Grade and thus fulfil the creditworthiness requirements of the finance policy. Receivables from derivative financial instruments, cash surplus and deposits total DKK 301 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: DKK 304 million). If the access to offsetting exposure in financial contracts with financial counterparties is recognised, the receivables from these three items total DKK 90 million at December 2015 instead (2014: DKK 142 million). Customers and partners are subject to regular credit rating and monitoring of the individual credit. Historically, DSB has had relatively small losses as a consequence of non-payment by customers or counterparties.

These guarantees are operating guarantees to the awarding authorities and guarantees to the lessor in connection with a train lease. Other financial commitments include the leasing of rolling stock totalling DKK 369 million (2014: DKK 455 million) of which DKK 183 million falls due in 2016 and DKK 186 million in the years 2017-2020. As part of DSB’s agreement with Rejsekort A/S concerning the use of the Rejsekort system, DSB is obliged to pay an annual subscription fee of approx. DKK 126 million for the period 2015-2028. The total obligation for the period 2016-2028 has been stated at DKK 1,655 million, of which DKK 504 million falls due in the period 2017-2020. In 2012 DSB outsourced the majority of its IT operations covering IT services and support to end-users as well as operation of networks, telephony, data centres and DSB’s systems. The total liability in this regard is DKK 236 million (2014: DKK 278 million), of which DKK 121 million falls due in 2016 and DKK 115 million falls due in 2017. In 2012 DSB concluded a lease for Telegade 2 in Taastrup. The lease is non-terminable by DSB for the period until 2021 for parts of the premises an 2026 for other parts of the premises. The maximum commitment in this regard is DKK 271 million (2014: DKK 303 million), of which DKK 32 million falls due in 2016 and DKK 126 million falls due in 2017-2020. As part of its normal business operations, DSB has service and maintenance obligations as well as purchase and selling obligations, including transactions expenses to Rejsekort A/S. Other financial liabilities primarily consist in contracts regarding investment in tangible assets. The remaining purchase obligation regarding IC2 and IC4 train sets was calculated at a total of DKK 153 million (2014: DKK 227 million) before discounts at 31 December 2015. Other matters: The Group's Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for tax on the consolidated taxable income etc. The total corporation tax liability is DKK 95 million at 31 December 2015 (2014: DKK 33 million). The Group’s Danish companies are jointly and severally liable for Danish withholding tax in the form of tax on dividend, royalty and interest. Any subsequent corrections of corporation and withholding taxes may means that DSB's liability is increased. DSB, Kort & Godt A/S, DSB Ejendomsudvikling A/S, DSB Vedligehold A/S and Selskabet af 23.12.2014 are jointly registered for VAT and payroll tax purposes and are jointly and severally liable for payment of the Danish corporation’s and companies’ aggregate VAT and payroll tax liabilities. In 2009 DSB undertook to invest up to DKK 1,000 million in parking facilities etc. via an additional agreement with the Ministry of Transport with a view to securing effective access to and from railway transport in order to increase the number of passengers over the period 2009 to 2020. The investments and related operations will be financed through sale of vacant sites and properties and, if relevant, through public or private co-financing. DSB has committed to financing DKK 720 million. At 31 December 2015 DSB had sold vacant sites with a profit of DKK 599 million (2014: DKK 498 million) and had invested and paid costs for operations in the total of DKK 278 million (2014: DKK 259 million) DSB pays ongoing pension contributions for public servants and employees on terms similar to public servants to the state calculated as a percentage of the pensionable salary to cover the state’s pension obligation for public servants. Upon retirement the state finally takes over the pension obligation. Contribution rates for the ongoing pension contributions are based on assumptions with regard to interest rate, expected retirement age, salary development and mortality etc. In certain circumstances deviations from these assumptions may result in a subsequent adjustment of the contributions in the form of an additional payment to or from the state at the time of retirement. The present contribution rate is 26 percent. DSB has an obligation to pay availability pay for three years to public services made redundant through no fault of their own, pursuant to section 32 of the Danish Public Servants Act. In addition DSB has an obligation to the Agency for the Modernisation of Public Administration to pay pension costs for public servants until the expected pensionable age of 62. There is an agreement between DSB and the minority shareholder in DSB Øresund Holding ApS to the effect that DSB is under an obligation to purchase the minority shareholder’s shares is the minority shareholder wishes to sell its shares. Such a purchase will, however, be subject to certain commercial conditions. There is some uncertainty associated with the nature of the commitment and the value of the option in case it is exercised. DSB is party to a small number of pending lawsuits. The outcome of these is not expected, individually or together, to have any significant impact on the corporation’s financial position.

Note 26: Accounting uncertainty regarding Rejsekort Accounting judgments concerning Rejsekort In 2014 DSB reassessed the expected useful lives of equipment and software etc. relating to the expenses capitalised in DSB in connection with Rejsekort. In this connection the expected useful life of all equipment was reduced to 5 years and all software/strategic development projects to 3 years instead of 5-10 years for both asset categories. The reassessments of the capitalised expenses also affect the recognised results of operations in Rejsekort A/S, which is treated as an associated company in DSB and is thus recognised according to the equity method based on the accounting policies etc. applied by DSB. 60 Consolidated annual accounts and annual accounts of the parent corporation Other financial disclosures Profit and loss

Business activities 77 Activity Area Accounts 2015 DSB is constantly working to optimise and enhance the efficiency of its train operations through ongoing improvements, thus ensuring that DSB remains a competitive, transparent, responsible and solid corporation. In order for DSB to fulfil these objectives, it is important to have in-depth knowledge about the economy of the train services obtained by breaking it down by activity area as well as splitting operations into the various lines. Only with such a detailed understanding can DSB continue to operate effectively and bring transparency to the political debate on the development of public transport in Denmark. During 2015 DSB focused on developing a way to report on the economy of its train operations, divided into Train Services and Train System. The work was based on a further development of DSB’s distribution model, called the Line Economy Model, in order thereby to ensure coherence and consistency between Activity Area and Line Accounts. The breakdown of DSB’s overall accounts is based on a number of assumptions and distribution presumptions, which, naturally, are and should be the subject of discussion. DSB has therefore published the results of its work on the economy of train operations regularly throughout 2015 and invited dialogue through meetings with recognised transport researchers and the Ministry of Transport and Building in order to create the best possible basis for insight into DSB's business. DSB operates trains in Denmark as a single activity, and DSB’s organisation and business processes support the most efficient operation possible of the total volume of train traffic and the other activities operated by DSB as a result of the transport contract with the Danish state and the statutory basis for DSB’s work. The breakdown thus serves an analytical purpose and has been produced by studying passenger revenues and cost distribution rather than basic registrations. The same is the case for the breakdown by lines. The analysis results should therefore be regarded with caution. Public Services delivered in accordance with the transport contract are divided into Train Services, Train System and General Obligations, see Table 1. Train Services concern operator responsibilities for operating trains. Train System is an umbrella term for the activities that provide support for operating trains—everything from running stations, rolling stock and deliveries to operation planning and monitoring as well as traffic information and ticket sales. General Obligations are activities which are independent of train operations, e.g. the running of the Railway Museum and extra costs relating to civil servants. Train Services are further subdivided into Long-distance and Regional Services as well as S-train Services. Train System is split into Stations, Rolling Stock and Systems & Channels. Systems & Channels includes Sales Channels and Customer Service as well as Transport Management and shared functions, see Figure 13. For 2015 DSB’s revenue before leasing out rolling stock is stated as DKK 9,787 million for financing the public service transport delivered. 72 percent of this revenue finances Train Services, while 26 percent finances Train System responsibilities. Almost 2 percent finances DSB’s General Obligations. DSB’s expenses incurred on Public Services total DKK 7,186 million before leasing of rolling stock in 2015. Of this, 68 percent was spent on Train Services and a good 30 percent on Train System responsibilities, with the remaining amount financing General Obligations. Add to the above depreciation, amortisation and write-downs, financial income and expenses and tax. 78 Activity Area Accounts 2015 It applies to both revenue and expenses that expenses concerning the leasing of rolling stock have been disregarded, as the rolling stock in this model is considered to be a profit-neutral intragroup transfer. The analysis assumes that the rolling stock is leased to Train Operations at cost.

Activity Area Accounts 2015 79 The breakdown of Train Operations on activity areas is, as previously mentioned, based on Public Services1, which is a revised statement of the activities carried out by DSB under the transport contract. The Public Services statement is prepared in the format prescribed by the Accounting Regulations for DSB. The basis for breaking down the economy this way is DSB’s Line Economy Model. This model divides DSB’s profit and loss account into activities and calculates the economy of the individual line based on the activities required, i.e. the full costs of e.g. train crew (salaries, pension, managers and planners, IT, uniforms etc.) are allocated to the individual line according to the number of hours worked on the line by the train crew and other staff. Revenue from the transport contract (hereinafter the contract payment) and passenger revenues are distributed on activity areas based on principles established in connection with the transport contract. The distribution in these Activity Area Accounts is based on 48 percent of the contract payment (DKK 1,978 million) going to Train Services, to which also largely all passenger revenues (DKK 4,870 million) are allocated. The balance of the contract payment is distributed to the Train System, i.e. Stations (DKK 534 million) and to Systems & Channels (DKK 1,439 million). Rolling Stock receives a contract payment to cover expenses associated with Trains for the Future (DKK 39 million). General Obligations receive a contract payment (DKK 121 million) to cover e.g. the operation of the Danish Railway Museum and additional costs due to the employment of public servants relative to employees employed under a collective agreement in current operations. It is an analytical choice that the passenger revenues are primarily allocated to Train Services, as the passenger revenues are in reality also used to help finance e.g. stations, sales channels, timetabling, traffic information etc. If the passenger revenues were also distributed on the Train System services, the amount of the contract payment allocated to these activity areas would be reduced. The following sections includes a detailed analysis of the expenses associated with Train Operations, including raw materials and consumables, staff expenses and other external expenses, consisting of e.g. expenses for repair and maintenance of rolling stock as well as cleaning of rolling stock and station areas.

Figure 1: Breakdown of Train Operation expenses 2015 DKK million The activity area Rolling Stock is not included as an expense under Train System, as a lease payment of DKK 1,661 million is made to Train Services for the rolling stock used and the leasing of rolling stock thus appears as an expense. Expenses for Train Services were DKK 6,671 million, of which rolling stock maintenance and leasing of rolling stock account for 48 percent of the total expenses for Train Services, while expenses for train crew accounted for 36 percent, see Figure 1. The rest of the expenses concern energy for train operation, infrastructure charges and replacement services etc. DKK 757 million – or 11 percent of the total Train Services expenses are expenses for supporting functions, including cross-organisational expenses for IT services, staff and joint functions, economy and HR functions as well as working environment and railway safety etc., see Figure 2. Activity Area Accounts 2015 81 Figure 2: Train Service expenses for supporting functions Share in percent The expenses for supporting functions are distributed on activities based on the number of employees – converted into full-time employees – that are used for performing the individual activities. This means that employee-intensive activities are responsible for a substantial part of the expenses. As a consequence Train Services – to which the largest share of DSB’s employees contributes directly as part of the train crew and indirectly in the workshops – carry a relatively large share of the expenses for supporting functions. Expenses for the Train System which is what ensures coherence in Train Services are DKK 2,242 million, see Figure 1. Of this, 26 percent of the expenses are for Station operation (DK 586 million) and 74 percent of the expenses are for Systems & Channels (DKK 1,656 million). Customer-oriented activities such as Ticket Sales Channels (staffed, digital sales and ticket vending machines), Customer Service, Rejsekort (DSB’s co-financing of the Rejsekort system) and Traffic Information account for 57 percent of the expenses for Systems & Channels. Traffic-oriented activitys which accounts for 33 percent primarily includes systems for staff and traffic planning as well as for monitoring and controlling train traffic in the operations centres run by DSB together with Banedanmark. Other activities account for 10 percent of Systems & Channels, see Figure 3. 82 Activity Area Accounts 2015 Figure 3: Systems & Channels Share in percent DSB is committed to ensuring ongoing improvements and enhanced efficiency of its Train Operations to the benefit of customers and taxpayers alike. In this connection the division into activities identifies both possibilities and limitations. For instance, it is possible to reduce staff expenses across several activities through improved planning and increased flexibility in the use of staff or through more effective tools. It is also possible to reduce the cross-organisational expenses, e.g. by simplifying and improving the portfolio management in the IT area and implementing other administrative efficiency enhancements. Finally, it is of decisive importance to ensuring effective Train Operations that the rolling stock is available to the planned extent and in the presumed quality as well as at the least possible cost. This planning and delivery related optimisation is a central task at DSB. In other areas the possibilities of enhancing efficiency are limited because the expenses are outside DSB's control to varying degrees. Activity Area Accounts 2015 83 For instance, the extent of DSB’s Train Services is to a very high degree laid down in the contract, the amount of the infrastructure charges is dictated by others and the extent of replacement services required is determined by infrastructure conditions on which DSB has a limited influence2. At the same time, rolling stock is a long-term investment, which it is difficult to adjust upwards or downwards in the short term and to a certain extent politically determined. Rolling stock and staff requirements in Train Services are dimensioned based on rush-hour traffic where most customers need transport. This means that sufficient rolling stock must be available, which determines the investment in rolling stock and the related workshops for maintenance and preparation of the rolling stock. Insofar as crew is concerned, the time space between earlymorning and afternoon rush hours means that the same crew members cannot cover both rushhour periods within a normal working day. A substantial part of the expenses of Train Services – depreciation on rolling stock, train crew, expenses for electricity or diesel for operation of the train etc. – is in fact independent of the number of passengers. This means that it is very important to the economy of Train Services that the capacity is utilised in the best possible way. These financial considerations must be balanced against the fact that the Train Services provided by DSB aim to contribute to sustainable growth and cohesion in Denmark through access to the train, also in the less densely populated regions and for most of the hours of the day and night. 2 DSB has intensive and well-functioning cooperative relations with Banedanmark with regard to the planning and carrying out of infrastructure works, which contribute to reducing the expenses – and the inconvenience to the customers – in connection with planned and unplanned infrastructure works. 84 Activity Area Accounts 2015 Line Accounts 2015 The expenses for Train Services and the activities in this connection may be further broken down on lines by means of the Line Economy Model, but this adds a further complexity and therefore uncertainty that is not present when looking at the total expenses. In the following line accounts the leasing of rolling stock is as a basis determined based on an average rolling stock use, while all other expenses are distributed according to the Line Economy Model. The reason the accounts are based on an average rolling stock use is that DSB’s rolling stock is part of a pool and is used flexibly with a view to ensuring an optimal use of the resources. This means that the types of rolling stock used on the individual lines may vary greatly over time. However, the analysis has been adjusted for the lines where dedicated rolling stock is used (Odense – Svendborg, Aarhus – Grenaa og S-train). The lease payment for S-trains is, for instance, only based on the actual rolling stock expenses for S-trains, which is operated as a closed system. The expenses are broken down on lines by means of distribution keys, which, inherently, involve a discretionary element. At the same time, the passenger revenues are distributed based on ad hoc counts of passengers, weighing of trains etc. These matters make the analysis basis subject to some uncertainty, which is, of course, increased the more fine-meshed the analyses carried out of the individual lines are. Therefore, the following line accounts must be used cautiously. Extensive track improvement works were carried out over the summer of 2015, which led to a reduced number of passengers as they have chosen other means of transport, but also to marked shifts between the lines used. Particularly InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus operated at a substantially lower frequency due to a lack of available track capacity. By way of compensation, longer express trains were placed in service. Consequently, there was a substitution from InterCity to express trains, but also other lines were affected, e.g. services on the Odense – Fredericia line were cancelled for three months. The extensive changes in travel patterns lead to increased uncertainty as to the distribution of revenue on the individual lines. Therefore, the following line analyses must be used cautiously. InterCity services between Copenhagen and Aarhus InterCity services on the Copenhagen – Aarhus line contributed revenue of DKK 1,263 million in 2015 and expenses, including depreciation, amortisation and write-downs and financial income and expenses, of DKK 1,244 million, see Figure 4. Consequently, regarded in isolation, InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus generated a profit of DKK 19 million in 2015 and did thus not require any contract payment. The profit is substantially negatively affected by the track improvement works on Western Funen over the summer where the number of through departures was reduced, which led to falling revenue and passengers opting for the express train instead. In comparison, InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus generated a profit of DKK 164 million in 2014. Line Accounts 2015 85 Figure 4: Economy of InterCity train services Copenhagen – Aarhus 2015 DKK million The distribution of expenses on this line differs from the general picture due to the relatively high infrastructure charges (20 percent of the total expenses for Train Services for this line), which to a large extent are charges for crossing the Great Belt. The infrastructure charge for this line accounts for more than half of DSB’s total infrastructure charges. Despite the extensive track improvement works carried out over the summer, the InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus line generated a profit in 2015, primarily because the many passengers contribute extensive passenger revenues and because it is possible to utilise the capacity far better than is the case for lines with fewer passengers during the day for which the contract with the Danish state requires train services. The InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus line is a good example of the uncertainty associated with breaking down revenue and expenses on lines. The distribution of revenue is based on weighing of trains, passenger counts etc., which are subject to uncertainty. Add to this the fact that the InterCity traffic is operated in a way that involves the train being split up in Fredericia, Vejle and Aarhus. Part of the revenues attributed to Copenhagen – Aarhus thus comes from passengers travelling with a direct connection to destinations that are not on the line. The number of passengers that would not opt for the train if a direct connection did not exist via the InterCity system is subject to uncertainty. Add to this the uncertainty associated with the distribution of expenses as described above. 86 Line Accounts 2015 InterCity Express train services Revenue from Express train services was DKK 1,171 million in 2015, and expenses were DKK 1,067 million, thus generating a profit of DKK 104 million, see Figure 5. The track improvement work carried out over the summer entailed more passengers and thus an increase in revenues but also a corresponding increase in expenses for leasing and maintenance of rolling stock because longer train sets were used. Express train services generated a total profit of DKK 101 million in 2014. The revenue substitution in between InterCity Copenhagen Aarhus and Express trains has been far from one to one. Track improvement works has had a negative impact on profit for 2015, which is also expectet in 2016 due to the planned works on Eastern Funen Figure 5: Economy of InterCity Express train services 2015 DKK million Expenses for train crew amount to 37 percent of the total expenses due to the fact that more crew members are needed when the train sets are longer. Maintenance of rolling stock and leasing of rolling stock account for 42 percent of the total expenses. The reason for these excellent results in the express train services is primarily – like for InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus, the fact that relatively many passengers per train enable a far better utilisation of capacity than is the case on lines with fewer passengers on average. Line Accounts 2015 87 Train Services on selected lines operated by regional trains Passenger revenues in DSB’s regional train systems are generally not sufficient to cover the expenses of the Train Services. An example from 2015 is the lines operated by regional trains Odense – Svendborg, Odense – Fredericia and Fredericia – Sønderborg/Padborg, see Figure 6. Figure 6: Results on selected lines operated by regional trains 2015 DKK million This means that regional train services on these lines could not have been provided without a contribution from the profitable lines, including the InterCity service between Copenhagen – Aarhus and the express train services, and/or the contract payment from the Danish state. The reason is primarily that there are fewer passengers compared with the service frequency etc. stipulated in the transport contract. This means that the capacity utilisation is not optimal, i.e. many empty seats in the train during the day, where services are required in the transport contract. Consequently, some lines operated by regional trains may have a good capacity utilisation during rush hours, but a relatively poor capacity utilisation outside these hours. Expenses for regional train services on the selected lines generally do not differ substantially from the general picture. The predominant share of the expenses thus concerns the train crew and leasing and maintenance of the rolling stock used, see Figure 7. 88 Line Accounts 2015 Figure 7: Expenses etc. on selected lines operated by regional trains 2015 DKK million On the Odense – Svendborg line the leasing of rolling stock is stated based on the actual expenses paid for the Desiro train sets which are dedicated to this line today. On the Odense – Fredericia and Fredericia – Sønderborg/Padborg lines, on the other hand, the average rolling stock expenses are used because the rolling stock is allocated from the rolling stock pool, see the previous section in this regard. The Odense – Fredericia line was closed for a period of three months as a consequence of the track improvement works of the summer, which explains the very extensive expenses for replacement services, i.e. expenses for busses to transport the passengers instead of trains. Expenses for train crew constitute a particularly large expense item in the overall expenses for train services for the Fredericia – Padborg/Sønderborg line where the trains carry an engine driver as well as a conductor (47 percent). The other two lines are operated by driver-only operated trains. The possibilities of driver-only operation are i.a. determined by the physical conditions in the train and at stations, which must fulfil certain safety standards. Line Accounts 2015 89 S-trains Train services on the S-network generated revenue of DKK 1,457 million in 2015 while expenses – including depreciation, amortisation and write-downs and financial income and expenses – were DKK 1,429 million, see Figure 8. Figure 8: Economy of S-train services 2015 DKK million Train services provided by S-trains generated a profit of DKK 28 million in 2015, corresponding to 2 percent of the passenger revenues and can thus be operated without a contract payment. The profit is negatively affected by write-downs of receivables from fines issued to passengers travelling without a valid ticket (DKK 11 million) concerning previous years as well as increased expenses for replacement services (DKK 4 million). The profit for 2015 is on the same level as the profit for 2014. Expenses for the train crew only amount to 33 percent of the overall expenses for train services on the S-train network, which is due to the fact that the S-trains are driver-only operated. The reason the S-train services can be operated without supplement of contract payment is that the total seating capacity of the S-trains is well utilised during the day compared to e.g. regional train services where the capacity utilisation – outside rush hours – is generally relatively limited. S-train is operated in a closed system with fewer facility centers which makes S-train more effective. 90 Line Accounts 2015 Line accounts for all DSB’s lines in 2015 The line accounts of all DSB’s lines are based on the activity area Train Services which reflect the direct expenses of operating trains. The contract payment of DKK 1,978 million (Long distance and regional services DKK 1,933 million and S-train DKK 45 million) is not distributed on individual lines as such a distribution would be relative to the profit and thus mean that the most expensive lines would get the largest amount of the contract payment, see Table 3. A profit means that the line operates at a profit that is used to finance loss-making lines. A loss, on the other hand, means that the line operates at a loss and therefore must receive financing from profitable lines and/or the contract payment from the Danish state. According to the Accounting Regulations, DSB is required to also specify the individual lines, including all expenses, regardless of whether the individual expense concerns the extent of production. Therefore, the Train System expenses for Stations and Systems & Channels are broken down on lines in Table 4. In practice, this means that e.g. expenses for stations, operation of the Rejsekort system, ticket vending machines, operations centres controlling traffic to limit delays etc. and traffic information have been broken down on lines, even though these activities do not have any direct connection with the extent of traffic on the individual line. The key figures for passenger revenues per seat kilometre and expenses per seat kilometre provide the best indication of how the seat capacity is utilised on the individual lines, See tabel 4. Seat kilometres take into account the number of seats available in the individual train types and the number of train sets/coaches coupled on a line. Train kilometres which are often used as a key figure do not take these differences into account. The statement of passenger kilometres is subject to a not insignificant uncertainty when regarded in terms of lines. The reason is that the statement of journeys and thus how far the individual passenger travels to a great extent is based on passenger surveys that are subject to substantial uncertainty. For instance, DSB have no precise information as to how often or how long a commuter with a season ticket travels, nor do we know what journey line the commuter travels (see page 25).

As a public corporation DSB is required to meet a number of reporting requirements, see Figure 9. The reporting requirements each have their own background and purpose, and their overall objective is to ensure transparency and control of DSB's affairs. The requirements each take a different perspective on the corporation. This makes it difficult to see the connection between the individual reports, which may at the same time impede transparency of DSB’s economy. Figure 9: Reporting requirements in DSB According to the Danish Financial Statements Act, annual accounts must be prepared that include the entire Group and provide knowledge about the financial position of the entire corporation. The purpose of the Accounting Regulations applying for DSB is to separate public services from activities exposed to competition in order to provide information about the activities that are subject to the contract payment and to ensure that illegal state aid is not granted. The Presentation of Main Business Areas which is reviewed by DSB’s external auditors is a division of the parent corporation DSB’s profit into “public services according to a negotiated contract” and “activities exposed to competition”. The transport contract only covers public services provided by DSB under the contract. These services only form part of the parent corporation's activities. This means that DSB Vedligehold A/S is not directly covered by the public service obligation, but is indirectly covered by way of the preparation and maintenance services delivered to and paid for by Train Services. Similarly, the Kort & Godt shops are not covered by the public service obligation either. The Activity Area and Line Accounts are based on DSB’s Presentation of Main Business Areas for 2015 where public services are disclosed separately. The activity area accounts represent an attempt at segmenting DSB’s activities according to the division used in the transport contract. The line accounts are a breakdown of Train Operations on lines according to the Accounting Regulations applicable to DSB. 94 Line Accounts 2015 Figure 10: Elements of Train Operations So far DSB has been operating trains in Denmark as a single activity. In connection with the new transport contract, DSB is required to prepare and carry out a division of Train Operations into activities relating to the actual operation of trains (Train Services) and activities relating to the maintenance of the production apparatus (Train System), see Figure 10. Public services according to a negotiated contract consist of Train Services and Train System as well as General Obligations, see Figure 11. Train Services include activities relating to the operation of trains, including payment for rolling stock and maintenance, while Train System includes activities relating to the production apparatus (rolling stock, stations and cross-organisational systems, including ticket sales channels). General Obligations cover historically related activities, not directly relating to Train Operations (e.g. operation of the Danish Railway Museum). Figure 11: Public services divided into activity areas Comment: Systems & Channels are defined as General Obligations in the transport contract. Difference between annual accounts and activity accounts DSB prepares an activity-based distribution model, called the Line Economy Model, which according to the Accounting Regulations applicable to DSB determines the economy of the activities carried out by DSB according to the transport contract. Public services are stated according to the model and are divided into activity areas and individual lines according to the model. The economy of a line such as e.g. InterCity Copenhagen – Aarhus cannot be determined based on the ordinary accounting registrations because the bookkeeping is designed according to the organisational structure of the corporation, which means across activity areas and the activities carried out by them. This means that largely all expenses are indirect relative to the line, even expenses which are traditionally perceived as direct. The reason is that DSB carries out the Train Operations as a single network. This means that rolling stock and train crew are allocated from a pool, i.e. that a specific IC3 train set operates on Line Accounts 2015 95 several lines, just as the train crew also works on several lines. This applies, for instance, also to most of the derived expenses such as e.g. energy that is purchased in a pool and is not directly attributable to a specific line based on the registered energy expense. The Line Economy Model is based on a combination of full cost allocation and activity-based cost allocation”. The full allocation is based on the requirement of the Accounting Regulations that all expenses must be distributed on the lines. The Line Economy Model is based on DSB’s bookkeeping, which is also the basis for DSB’s annual accounts, but it adds an activity and line dimension that does not exist in the bookkeeping. The Line Economy Model The Line Economy Model is the basis for the Presentation of Main Business Areas, the Activity Area and Line Accounts for DSB. This way a clear connection and a complete transaction trail are created between the individual accounts. The model establishes the Presentation of Main Business Areas by dividing DSB’s activities into “public services according to a negotiated contract” and “activities exposed to competition”. For instance, DSB operates the Aarhus – Odder line for Midttrafik together with the Aarhus – Grenaa line, which is part of the transport contract. The economy must thus be divided in such a way that state aid is not granted for the first line. The challenge is that both the train crew and the rolling stock etc. are used for both lines. Figure 12: Line Economy Model design Public services are further broken down on activity areas and thus the activities carried out by DSB to operate the individual lines. Lines include all items relating to Train Services, see definition above. 96 Line Accounts 2015 Figure 12 describes the principle of the method used in the Line Economy Model in which the accounting entries are grouped and distributed on lines via activities. On a resource level, the bookkeeping is grouped and classified according to production relation so that the supporting functions are distributed according to the relative resource use of the capacity units. The model primarily uses objective and systematic distribution keys based on production information. Distribution of DSB’s Train Operations on the activities Train Services and Train System During 2015 DSB has prepared a number of analyses with the purpose of defining the new activity areas introduced with the transport contract. Figure 13: Activities in Train Services and Train System The activity definitions and classifications used are a precision of the method DSB has used so far for its line accounts, thus supporting a distinction between train services and train system activities. DSB finds that the definitions and classifications used largely support this distinction, but that adaptation will presumably be required in the future. The basic registrations presently have the purpose of supporting the corporation’s current organisation and thus the most effective Train Operations business. Therefore, the reporting on activity areas is based on the distribution keys of the Line Economy Model. Line Accounts 2015 97 Distribution keys The Line Economy Model is developed based on the objective that the model must reflect DSB’s structure in terms of revenue, expenses and production. As the model is a distribution model, the amount of revenue and expenses per line will depend on the choice of expense classifications and distribution keys. The distribution of Train Services activities on lines is generally based on the following principles: • If the activity is only carried out for one single line, it will be allocated directly to that line. • If instead the activity is carried out to be able to provide train services on more or all lines, the expenses will be distributed on lines according to a relevant production parameter. Figure 14: Most important distribution keys for Train Services in the Line Economy Model Figure 14 shows the most important production-based distribution keys used in the distribution of Train Services activities on the individual lines. An example is the total amount of expenses for the activity train operation under train crew, which is distributed on the lines based on the time registrations of the engine drivers which are linked to the individual line via the rolling stock. Another example is the total expenses for maintenance of IC3 train sets, which are distributed relatively pro rata on the lines where the IC3 train set is used, based on the rolling stock class kilometres travelled by the IC3 train sets. A third example is the infrastructure expenses from crossing the Great Belt, which are distributed according to the number of crossings on the individual line. 98 Line Accounts 2015 Distribution of passenger revenues on lines It is not possible to directly calculate the number of journeys in DSB. This is due to the fact that public transport is available by bus, metro and train without the ticket necessarily being for a specific departure. This is the case for season tickets as well as individual tickets, as it is possible to purchase an open ticket for e.g. the Copenhagen – Aarhus line. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether the journey is made by InterCity or express train. Also a journey may involve several operators and lines. For instance, a journey from Tisvildeleje to Bornholm involves the local railway from Tisvildeleje to Hillerød, the S-train from Hillerød to Copenhagen Central Station and InterCity Bornholm from Copenhagen Central Station to Ystad – all on one ticket. The calculation is made even more complicated by the fact that there are many different ticket systems and fare areas today, which requires coordination across various operators. Figure 15: Principles for allocation of passenger revenues on Lines in the Journey Revenue Model DSB has a number of journey sources, see Figure 15, of which the principal are DSB's own ticket sales and journeys in the Greater Copenhagen Area and Rejsekort. The journeys are i.a. calculated through passenger counts on trains and weighing of trains converted into number of passengers. The method may vary from source to source and has been agreed with the other operators within a given fare area. The journeys are then divided into journey relations showing from where and to where the journey was made. This is i.a. done based on the passenger surveys3 of travel patterns that provide a statistical weight that may be applied to the journey sources. 3 The BRIK count in the Copenhagen City and Regional Transport area and the national count carried out by COWI on Long-distance and Regional Trains. Line Accounts 2015 99 Once the journey relations have been determined, the journey line must be determined, i.e. which of several possible lines was used to travel between two destinations. As a journey can be made via several lines, it must be distributed pro rata on the lines so that one journey is divided into one or more portions. Occupancy rates and timetables are used to make such division. The journey portions are used to distribute passenger revenues on lines in the overall Journey Revenue Model. In the Line Economy Model this input is used as the key to distributing the booked passenger revenues. Consequently, there is a certain discretionary element in the passenger revenues distributed on the individual lines. Distribution of revenues from the transport contract on activity areas The Line Economy Model does not distribute the contract payment on lines as there is no unique activity-based method according to which the contract payment can be distributed. It is a condition of the political agreement that train operations are divided into Train Services and Train System. For use for the activity accounts, DSB has chosen to distribute the contract payment according to the following method. Figure 16: Principles for distribution of revenue from the transport contract on activity areas The contract payment to Stations is distributed in such a way that an annual return on the invested capital (ROIC) of 3 percent is ensured. The contract payment for General Obligations (historical) is based on cost recovery. The contract payment to Systems & Channels is based on a profit margin of 5 percent, while the contract payment to Rolling Stock only covers all the project expenses for preparation of the acquisition of new electrical train sets for Denmark as the lease payment for leasing the rolling stock is paid to the Train Services activity. The balance of the contract payment accrues to Train Services where it is distributed in such a way that the profit margin is identical for long-distance and regional train transport and S-train transport. In addition, it is assumed that the passenger revenues accrue to Train Services and thus not contribute directly to the Train System according to the model. 100 Line Accounts 2015 Distribution of lease payments for rolling stock to Train Services All revenue and expenses and depreciation, amortisation and write-downs and financial income and expenses for rolling stock have been pooled, exclusive of Øresund and Trains for the Future which are not included, for Long-distance and Regional Trains and S-trains, respectively. On long-distance and regional lines operated by dedicated rolling stock (Odense – Svendborg & Aarhus – Grenaa), the specific rolling stock expenses for the line are allocated directly to the line in question. The remaining rolling stock pool is regarded as a joint pool that can be placed in service on all lines. Therefore, an average lease payment is calculated for rolling stock based on the number of rolling stock class kilometres travelled on the individual lines. The lease payment for S-trains is based only on the actual rolling stock expenses for S-train rolling stock. Distribution of VAT and tax DSB has the right to deduct part of the purchase VAT because the Group engages in activities that are both subject to and not subject to VAT. The non-deductible part of the input VAT is included in the profit and loss account and in the balance sheet items. VAT is handled separately in the model. DSB’s corporation and companies have a joint VAT registration and the VAT for DSB is booked centrally. Therefore, the year’s net VAT expenses are distributed on the activity areas according to the pro rata VAT associated with the expenses. After that the VAT expenses follow the actual expenses through the distribution model. Corporation income tax is not distributed on activity areas and lines. In the Presentation of Main Business Areas the corporation income tax is distributed between public services according to a negotiated contract and activities exposed to competition. Line Accounts 2015 101 Management statement The Executive Board has today discussed and approved DSB's Activity and Line Accounts for 2015. The Line Accounts are prepared according to the principles and methods that are stipulated in the Accounting Regulations applicable to DSB, considering the interpretations agreed with the Ministry of Transport and Building. We believe that • the Accounting Regulations are complied with in 2015, including that the requisite accounting division has been carried out according to clause 2 of the Accounting Regulations, so that DSB is able to account for the need for subsidies for passenger transport. • the model apparatus and the distribution keys applied are documented in accordance with clause 3 of the Accounting Regulations so that DSB is able to account for the distribution economy of the lines. Taastrup, 25. February 2016 Flemming Jensen Thomas Thellersen Børner CEO CFO 102 Line Accounts 2015 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) At DSB we have incorporated CSR in the way we work – in our policies, processes and practice and in our procurement, environmental considerations and economy. DSB has an ethical policy which commits DSB to comply with the 10 universal principles of the UN Global Compact with focus on human rights and employee rights. DSB's ethical rules require that our suppliers comply with national and international rules regarding child labour, health and safety at work, discrimination, use of forced or involuntary labour, corruption and bribery as well as the environment. As an integrated part of the environmental policy, DSB works actively to reduce the corporation's impact on the climate. DSB joined the UN Global Compact in 2009 and contributes to the work both financially and by annually reporting on its progress. DSB’s CSR activities are not only realised through the way we work at DSB, but also through the requirements we make on our suppliers. In connection with procurement procedures DSB ensures that strategic suppliers are prequalified and informed about our ethical rules (code of conduct). We expect the suppliers to comply with and act in accordance with these basic principles. Cooperation and support DSB has since 2008 cooperated with Natteravnene (“Night Owls”), a national voluntary organisation consisting of more than 5,000 adults. The volunteers walk around at night in the towns and cities, including at stations and in trains. Their purpose is to be good role models, contribute to the sense of safety and security and help children and young people, providing joy of life and promoting integration. In addition to the financial support DSB provides to Natteravnene, they can ride all DSB trains free of charge while doing volunteer work. DSB also cooperates with a number of humanitarian organisations in Denmark by permitting them to collect money for their charitable causes and distribute material to DSB’s customers at the stations. The organisations include Danmarks Indsamlingen (DR and 12 of Denmark’s largest humanitarian organisations), DanChurchAid, the Danish Cancer Society, ActionAidDenmark, Save the Children Denmark, Danish Red Cross, the Danish Refugee Council and the World’s Best News. In connection with the phasing-out of the clip card in the Greater Copenhagen Area, DSB, Metroselskabet and Movia (DOT, Din Offentlige Transport) cooperated to give the customers the possibility of donating the value of their unused clips to the Danish Children’s Aid Foundation. Many customers availed themselves of this offer, and the Danish Children's Aid Foundation subsequently received almost DKK 1 million to support their work to help children in care and vulnerable young people in Denmark. At election time in Denmark, DSB also supports the democratic process by permitting the political parties and their candidates to distribute material at the stations in the period leading up to the election. This was also the case in 2015 in connection with the election to the Danish parliament in June and the referendum concerning the Danish EU opt-outs in December. An inordinately high influx of refugees and migrants was a challenge to the operation of DSB's trains and at the stations in 2015. DSB responded to the challenge in close cooperation with the Danish authorities to ensure that DSB’s customers would experience as little inconvenience as possible. In December DSB made an agreement with Danish Red Cross to the effect that they could temporarily use vacant premises at the Copenhagen Central Station to receive refugees and migrants. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 103 Safety and security Customers and employees of DSB must be able to feel safe and secure. Surveillance cameras in the trains and at the stations contribute to this. In 2015 a total of 2,021 cameras had been installed at 131 stations and 3,824 had been installed in the S-trains. In addition, DSB has two mobile video surveillance systems that can be moved to stations where passengers experience insecurity or which are particularly exposed to vandalism. Figure 1: Satisfaction with feeling safe and secure in the train Scale 0-10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 The cameras are i.a. used to summon the police and extra staff if necessary and to help the police solve cases concerning vandalism, violence, pick-pocketing etc. DSB has also entered into a nationwide cooperation agreement with the Danish National Police regarding the use of videos etc. in connection with police investigations of ‘person under train’ incidents. In 2015 DSB’s surveillance centre contributed to police investigations in 991 cases. In 2015 external security guards patrolled the Copenhagen Central Station and Høje Taastrup station to make sure that passengers and employees could feel safe and secure. Figure 2: Satisfaction with feeling safe and secure at the station Scale 0-10 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 104 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) DSB is currently installing defibrillators at 64 selected train stations across Denmark and in all DSB’s 520 train sets. The installation of defibrillators began in 2014 and is expected to be completed in 2016. By year-end 2015 defibrillators had been installed at 41 stations and in 383 train sets. The installation of defibrillators is the result of a collaboration project between DSB and TrygFonden which also includes the training of 750 DSB employees in life-saving first aid and use of defibrillators. Every year DSB spends large amounts of money on removing graffiti, i.a. to create a nice and clean environment and improve the customers’ sense of safety and security. In 2015 DSB thus spent more than DKK 20 million on removing graffiti from 1,929 train sets. At the stations, DSB and Banedanmark have introduced zero tolerance of graffiti at the stations in the Greater Copenhagen Area and at certain stations on Zealand. This means that the stations most at risk in terms of graffiti are checked for graffiti every day, while the other stations are only checked once a week. The intensified effort to reduce graffiti introduced in 2014 has paid off. For instance, 40 graffiti paintings fewer were removed in 2015 at DSB’s stations east of the Great Belt compared with 2014. Unfortunately, ‘person under train' incidents in connection with suicide and suicide attempts are a recurring event for DSB. In addition to being a tragic event for the persons involved and their family, it also affects DSB's customers and employees by way of train cancellations, delays and crisis counselling for i.a. engine drivers. In 2015 DSB recorded 17 suicides and 1 suicide attempt (18 and 5, respectively, in 2014). Figure 3: Suicide and suicide attempts Number 50 40 30 20 10 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Suicide Suicide attempts Health and safety at work DSB is a Danish employer with many employees, and ensuring health and safety at work is part of our corporate social responsibility. It is important that DSB sends its employees home in the same condition as they were in when they arrived at work. The target for 2015 was to reduce the number of industrial injuries both with and without absence from work and generally to reduce the sickness absence in DSB. In 2015 DSB launched Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 105 several campaigns to avoid industrial injuries aimed at the staff groups most exposed to injuries, i.a. at the workshops and the engine drivers. The total number of industrial injuries in DSB fell markedly by more than 300 registered injuries from 1,335 in 2014 to 1,001 in 2015. Unfortunately, the reduction is driven by injuries without absence – the number of industrial injuries with absence rose by 14 in 2015 compared with 2014. The average sickness absence in DSB fell by 0.4 day per employee to 9.7 days in 2015. In 2015 DSB continued its work to reduce the ultrafine particles that are hazardous to health. These particles are especially emitted by the older locomotives and train sets. This work i.a. involves upgrading the exhaust system at the workshops and introducing various measures that mean that the locomotives need not be started inside the workshops. Figure 4: Reported industrial injuries Number 1400 1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0 Industrial injuries with absence Industrial injuries without absence Total industrial injuries 2013 2014 2015 In order to maintain a systematic approach to health and safety at work, DSB chose to become certified according to the internationally recognised standard for health and safety at work OHSAS 18001 in 2013. In 2015 an external follow-up audit was carried out across the organisation. A total of four deviations were observed, which have all been addressed in separate action plans containing preventive and corrective actions. The deviations were consequently closed by an external certification agency. When many people are gathered at stations and in the trains as well as in connection with ticket inspections, disagreements may arise, which may escalate to threats and violence against fellow passengers and DSB staff. In 2015 DSB experienced a marked reduction in the occurrence of violence and threats against DSB staff. The reduction of violence is by more than 10 percent, while the number of threats was halved. 106 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Figure 5: Violence and threats against DSB staff Number 400 350 300 250 200 150 100 50 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 Violence Threats DSB makes every effort to continue to become better at preventing and handling these situations. This is i.a. done through training DSB’s staff in conflict handling, cooperation with the police and a dialogue with the customers. In case of big events such as festivals and football matches, many customers, often in a festive mood and rather noisy, are travelling to the same destination. In connection with a number of these events, DSB enters into a dialogue with organisers and customers with a view to arranging for a special train for the individual event. The purpose is to ensure that both the participants and DSB’s other customers can have as pleasant a journey as possible and with as few conflicts as possible. DSB has 43 conductors who are especially trained to handle the customers onboard the football trains. In 2015 DSB provided special coaches for 14,500 football fans on 28 football journeys. In addition, special S-trains were provided for a couple of thousands of fans when the football teams Brøndby and FCK met. In 2015 there were no industrial injuries in connection with these journeys. Very little damage to DSB's rolling stock was registered in connection with transporting these football fans. DSB also makes a special effort for children who are part of a family living in separate parts of the country. DSB has 70 trained children’s guides who take care of the children from departure station to destination station. A special coach is reserved for these children, and only the children who have seat reservations for this coach are allowed there. DSB’s children’s guides meet the children at the station, are there for the children if they need help during the journey and make sure that the children get off at the right stations. The special trains with children’s guides are available Fridays and Sundays as well as on other days in connection with national holidays. In 2015 there was a total of 19,462 seat reservations for the special children’s coaches. Accessibility In 2015 DSB improved its service to senior citizens and disabled customers. From 1 August disabled customers requiring assistance could wait until 24 hours before planned departure to contact DSB, thus reducing this period by half compared with earlier. DSB also increased its opening hours for orders by telephone, thus enabling disabled customers to get assistance during all hours when train services are provided. Finally, from the turn of the year 2015/2016, DSB will be offering assistance at all DSB's long-distance and regional train stations and at the Coastal Line. Previously, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 107 this offer extended to only 63 selected stations. In 2015 DSB provided assistance to disabled customers 15,288 times and sold 43,737 companion tickets. DSB wishes to provide easy access to buying a ticket for the journey. Therefore, DSB is developing information and ticket services and apps for mobile phones and computers. In order to ensure that everybody is comfortable with the new ways of buying tickets, DSB offers courses where DSB employees come and tell our customers about how the various ticket buying options work in practice. DSB’s customer service team held 96 meetings of this kind in 2015, primarily with focus on the DanAge Association, computer clubs, libraries and the new initiative: cooperation with the local citizens’ service centres in the municipalities. Diversity In DSB we believe that diversity makes the corporation stronger and increases our competitiveness. Among other things, this is about the diversity in the corporation in the form of gender and ethnicity and about the diversity developed by DSB among its staff through education and experience. At year-end 2015 a total of 27 percent of DSB's employees were seniors (+55 years). 215 employees (2.9 percent) are employed on special terms such as acute jobs, flexijobs, light jobs, partially ready for work and Section 56 jobs. Of DSB’s staff 7.7 percent of the employees and 4.1 percent of the managers have another ethnic origin than Danish. DSB also wants to assume responsibility for helping young people get a job. DSB i.a. does so by taking on apprentices and trainees. In 2015 DSB had 42 trainee positions. Equal representation at management levels is part of DSB’s HR policy. On DSB’s Board of Directors 33 percent are women (not including employee representatives), while the figure is 29 percent for the Corporate Management. Of all managers at DSB 26 percent are women – almost the same percentage as of all employees. DSB’s objective in terms of gender distribution at the various management levels is that the distribution must reflect the gender distribution in the corporation as a whole. DSB will fulfil this objective i.a. by requiring recruitment consultants to provide both female and male candidates and by considering the underrepresented gender in connection with successor planning. 108 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Environment and climate Diesel trains emit particles and also impacts the air quality in other ways. Figure 6: Particle emissions Index 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total particle emissions from the diesel trains fell by 20 percent compared with 2014. The reason is a reduced use of ME-diesel locomotives and MR train sets as well as more IC4 train sets being placed in service as they emit fewer particles. 2015 continued the focus on the number of ultrafine particles in the double-decker coaches pulled/pushed by the ME locomotives. DSB is currently working on implementing various prototypes to reduce the exposure of customers and employees to ultrafine particles. Deutsche Bahn is developing a spoiler that is expected to divert the exhaust away from the coaches so that the number of particles in the coaches will be reduced. The prototype will be fitted in the spring of 2016. Then it will be tested and its environmental impact measured. 90 percent of DSB’s total energy consumption is used for train operations. The train is an energyfriendly mode of transport compared with other modes of transport, regardless of whether the journey is a long journey or only a few stations internally in the Greater Copenhagen Area. Through its environmental policy, DSB continues to focus on increasing efficiency through a reduction of its energy consumption per passenger kilometre and generally to reduce DSB’s impact on the surrounding environment. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) 109 Figure 7: CO2 emissions (Aalborg Copenhagen) Kg per person 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 IC3 Lyn Car (bridge) Airplane + Taxi The assumptions on which the comparison with other modes of transport is based are included in DSB's Environmental Report 2015 or on www.dsb.dk/miljo. Figure 8: CO2 emissions for a 12-km journey in the Greater Copenhagen Area Kg per person 2,5 2,0 1,5 1,0 0,5 0,0 S-train Bus Car In order to render this work visible, DSB has set up a strategic target for sustainability defined as gram CO2 per passenger kilometre. The continued electrification of the main network in Denmark will mean a reduced energy consumption as well as reduced CO2 emissions due to the expected increased share of renewable energy in the Danish energy mix. DSB’s total energy consumption for trains fell slightly compared with 2014. This reflects a reduction of DSB’s diesel operations and a slight increase in the electricity consumption. 110 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Figure 9: Direct and indirect energy consumption GJ (million) 4,5 4,0 3,5 3,0 2,5 2,0 1,5 1,0 0,5 0,0 2012 2013 2014 2015 Heating Electricity in buildings Cars and vans Electricity for trains Diesel for trains Electricity consumption for cars and vans is less than 1 percent of DSB's total energy consumption and is therefore not included in the figure. The energy consumption remains unchanged since 2014 due to reduced heating consumption and increased electricity consumption. DSB’s total CO2 emissions are unchanged compared with 2014, for the train product as well as for the corporation. Figure 10: Development in electricity and diesel consumption per passenger kilometre Index 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Electrical long-distance and regional trains Diesel long-distance and regional trains S-trains 2012 2013 2014 2015 For S-tog the energy consumption per passenger kilometre fell by 3 percent. This fall was obtained through growth in the number of passenger kilometres of 2 percent and a fall in the overall energy consumption of 0.6 percent. CO2 emissions remained unchanged as the CO2 emission from the Danish energy mix rose.

Among others, the following initiatives were introduced in 2015, which will obtain their full effect in 2016: • On the majority of S-train platforms, lighting was replaced by LED in the autumn of 2015. Expected annual savings of 1 GWh • Consolidation of workshop activities Figure 11: CO2 emissions broken down on source Ton 350.000 300.000 250.000 200.000 150.000 100.000 50.000 0 2012 2013 2014 2015 CO2 from selected transport subcontractors CO2 from indirect energy consumption CO2 from direct energy consumption As of 2013 DSB decided against purchasing RECS certificates for power produced by renewable energy sources. This means that the emissions as of and including 2013 are not comparable with the results from 2012. DSB experienced two spillage accidents from trains during operations in 2015. In one of the accidents approx. 400 litres of diesel oil leaked into the ballast. The oil was collected from the ditch and monitoring drilling will be carried out over the coming years to check for percolation to the groundwater. The second accident involved limited spillage. The number of noise and smoke complaints submitted by neighbours and customers fell from 202 in 2014 to 147 in 2015. The complaints represent the total number of complaints received by DSB through the Customer Centre, directly to DSB Environment and through Banedanmark. The complaints in 2015 do not concern one particular area, but are distributed over a wide range of issues. 112 Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Two of the complaints involved municipalities, i.e. the Municipality of Lindholm and the Municipality of Fredericia. The use of the turning track at Lindholm has been heavily reduced from 2016. Changes have been made at the activities in Fredericia and they now produce less noise for the neighbours. In addition, DSB and Banedanmark are having a dialogue with the City of Copenhagen with regard to the possibilities of reducing the noise from the preparation areas at Belvedere situated between Dybbølsbro and Enghave. The measurements carried out by Banedanmark of the air quality at Nørreport show a continued substantial improvement compared with the situation before the rebuilding.
