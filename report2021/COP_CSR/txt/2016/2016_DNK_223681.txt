The debt established under the bond program and the loan from the European Investment Bank are guaranteed by Welltec International ApS, Welltec Holding ApS, Welltec Canada Inc., Welltec Africa ApS, Welltec Latinamerica ApS, RS 2001 ApS, Welltec (UK) Ltd, Welltec Inc. and Welltec Oilfield Services (RUS) LLC.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 25.1 General capital structure The group is financed partly through equity and partly through long-term debt. Management assesses on a regular basis whether the group’s capital structure is in accordance with the group’s and shareholders’ interests. The overall objective is to ensure a capital structure that supports long-term growth and also maximizes returns to the shareholders of the group by optimizing the debt to equity ratio. The group’s overall objective remains the same. 25.2 Market risk Due to the group’s foreign activities and credit facilities in foreign currencies, its profit/loss, cash flows and equity are affected by changes in exchange rates and interest rates for a number of currencies. A significant part of this change in exchange rates has been eliminated by changing functional currency for the Danish companies to US Dollar from 2012. 25.2.1 Foreign currency risk management The reporting currency of the group is US dollars. The functional currency of the Danish companies is considered to be US dollars, and the rest of the group’s subsidiaries have the functional currency of the country in which the subsidiary is domiciled. A proportion of the group’s revenues, expenses and other liabilities are denominated in currencies other than US dollars, in particular Danish kroner, Norwegian kroner and British pounds. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters. The carrying amounts of the group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the end of the reporting period are as follows stated in the material currencies affecting the group: Assets Liabilities (USD in thousands) 2015 2014 2015 2014 DKK 171,293 179,583 (117,730) (125,851) GBP 7,341 10,864 (4,190) (6,671) NOK 27,011 31,543 (15,140) (24,733) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2015 57 NOTES 25.2.2 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in DKK, GBP and NOK against the relevant foreign currencies. The percentage used is the sensitivity rate and is representing Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis includes external loans as well as loans to foreign operations within the group where the denomination of the loan is in a currency other than the currency of the lender or the borrower. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit and equity where the currency strengthens 10% against the relevant currency. For a 10% weakening of the currency against the relevant currency, there would be a comparable impact on the profit and other equity, and the balances below would be negative.

The valuation of securities in 2015 is based on listed prices in active markets. There have been no transfers between levels 1, 2 and 3 in 2015. 25.2.5 Interest rate risk management From the beginning of 2012 the group’s interest rate risk mainly relates to the group’s interest bearing debt to bondholders. The interest is fixed at an effective rate of 8.5%. As the interest rate is fixed the group does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments. Thus any changes in fair value are recognized directly in statement of comprehensive income as financial income or financial expenses. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS / WELLTEC® ANNUAL REPORT 2015 59 NOTES 25.2.6 Interest rate sensitivity analysis The group’s interest-bearing debt for 2015 is primarily fixed to 8.5% due to the bond loan, however the EIB loan has a variable interest of 2.2% + 6 months EURIBOR. A 250 basis point increase or decrease represents Management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. If interest rates had been 250 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the group’s: Profit for the year and equity as of December 31, 2015 would be affected with USD 675 thousand (2014: Unaffected). 25.3 Liquidity risk management It is the group’s policy that capital raising and distribution of cash are managed centrally by the group’s finance department to the extent it is deemed appropriate. The group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows. The group is adjusting centrally the cash outflow in investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in Denmark. Please see note 20.2.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The annual report for 2015 of the parent company Welltec International ApS is presented in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the EU and additional Danish disclosure requirements for annual reports of reporting class C (large) enterprises. Please see the Danish Executive Order on IFRS adoption issued in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act. The annual report is presented in thousands of US dollar (USD), which also is the functional currency of the parent company. The accounting policies are unchanged compared to 2014. Differences compared to the group’s accounting policies The parent company’s accounting policies for recognition and measurement are in accordance with the group’s policies with the exceptions stated below: Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are measured at cost in the parent company’s financial statements. Where the recoverable amount of the investments is lower than cost, the investments are written down to this lower value. Dividend from investments in subsidiaries is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the year it is declared. 2. USE OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS The determination of carrying values and preparation of the annual report build upon estimates made by Management of the likely effect of future events on the value of investments and receivables in/from subsidiaries. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management considers that the following accounting estimates and assumptions are critical in the parent financial statements. Impairment of investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries represents USD 392,576 thousand equalizing 95 % of total assets in the parent company. When considering impairment indicators, Management makes an assessment of whether the Welltec International ApS Group wil be able to generate positive net cash flows sufficient to support the value of the investments. Regarding this estimate and the assumptions made by Management, please see note 2.3 in the consolidated financial statements. The estimates used build upon assumptions which, in the opinion of Management, are valid albeit inherently uncertain and unpredictable. 3. STAFF COSTS There have been no employees in the parent company for the financial years 2013-2015. See note 4.
