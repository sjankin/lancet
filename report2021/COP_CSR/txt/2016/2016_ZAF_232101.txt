The speed and force of these changes impact on our clients, our staff and our operating environment, and bring both risks and opportunities. It is in times like these that a vision-led and values-driven organisation such as Nedbank can differentiate itself. Operating in a much tougher environment Mike Brown Globally, economic conditions remain Chief Executive fragile with growth rates generally disappointing, particularly in emerging markets. Unforeseen and unexpected events are becoming increasingly commonplace, making forecasting difficult and corporate agility more important. In SA, where most of our business is, the impact of the electricity shortages in the first half of the year, followed by the worst drought in decades in the second half, have added to the weak commodity prices, negatively impacting growth. The policy uncertainty that was created by the surprise changes in the Finance Ministry in December contributed to a 25% depreciation in the rand against the US dollar and overall 2015 gross domestic product (GDP) growth of only around 1,3%. Consumer and business confidence are at low levels and social pressures are escalating with household debt and unemployment expected to increase. The interest rate cycle has started with an upward trajectory and the extent of interest rate increases from here will be closely monitored. Of concern to us is that our GDP growth forecast for SA in 2016 is only 0,2%. In this environment of low growth and rising inflation there is a heightened risk of a recession and the ‘In reflecting on the events over the past ratings agencies will be monitoring both growth and expenditure levels closely as financial year, 2015 will be remembered as a business and government work together year of volatility and change around the world to avoid the possibility of an SA sovereign ratings downgrade to below and in SA.’ investment grade.

In 2014 we deepened this partnership by investing R6bn of capital to acquire a strategic interest of 20% in ETI. Our strategic interest in ETI provides the group and our clients with local knowledge on the continent – in particular Central and West Africa – and has improved our access to deal flow in these regions, positioning us well to leverage the growth opportunities in the rest of Africa.

My early impressions are of a group that is well managed by a skilled, responsible and diverse leadership team guided by a strong and appropriately skilled board. I have found a group that is peoplecentred, deeply client-driven and socially relevant, so I have thoroughly enjoyed my immersion into this great company. With my background in the audit profession, I am encouraged by the intense focus on Vassi Naidoo risk management and compliance to Non-executive Chairman ensure a safer client experience. We are building on sound foundations and we have seen another year of resilient growth in a tougher-than-expected macro environment. On behalf of the Nedbank board of directors it is, therefore, my privilege to reflect on our journey to be Africa’s most admired bank. Our purpose – now more important than ever Banks play a crucial role in the financial and economic ecosystem of nations and the world. Their activities also play an important role in building stakeholder trust across society. Forming part of their essential duties to broaden financial inclusion and facilitate access to financial services, banks must ensure that clients can keep their money safe, assist them in making payments, help them save, and make it possible for individuals and institutions to borrow money affordably when they need to invest in assets such as education, housing or renewable energy. ‘I have found a group that is peopleIn SA there is much work to be done to centred, deeply client-driven and socially overcome the challenges of inequality, relevant, so I have thoroughly enjoyed my poverty, unemployment and education, immersion into this great company.’ which are at the heart of our socioeconomic challenges.

Staff attractive, competition among banks increase. are educated to understand and adapt to the change in the risk-and-return profile of products or even redeployed to business areas that we seek to grow more rapidly. Staff roles and processes change according to increased regulatory reporting and risk management requirements. The change in the risk-and-return profile of various products has resulted in Nedbank adopting selective deposit and advances growth as well as risk-adjusted pricing strategies, which impact our clients. The bank’s social and relationship capital in relation to regulators is more important than ever, as systemic risk remains high on the agenda. Shareholder returns are impacted by increased cost of funding, which reduce net interest margins, and increased capital requirements. This results in lower ROE for the banking industry, though banks have become safer as a result. The building or depleting of social and natural capitals is fundamental to our long-term decisionmaking processes and is guided by our Long-term Goals.
