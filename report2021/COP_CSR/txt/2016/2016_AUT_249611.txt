This meets all requirements specified within the COP policy. We continued our progress towards achieving a best-in-class position in our industry. ams as a designer and manufacturer of analog semiconductors can have a direct influence on reducing power consumption in many millions of devices where our products are being used in. At the same time, our focus on consumer, industrial, medical and automotive devices helps our everyday lives become safer, healthier and more convenient. We recognized our responsibility to society and the environment early on, being one of the first semiconductor companies to focus on environmental improvements through our ISO 14001 certification. We have been ahead of our industry in ensuring compliance to RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) in all our products. Since 2003, we strive to reduce our production CO2 footprint while significantly expanding our production capacity. A major reduction of our CO2 equivalents emitted could be reached in 2011 – since then ams buys renewable electricity guaranteed as 100% hydropower. In order to reduce CO2 emissions, we continue with ams’ environmental program for reduction including dedicated activities. Other environmental activities comprise promoting the Marine Stewardship Council’s sustainable fishing. This activity includes using sustainable fish in staff catering and encouraging employees worldwide to reflect on the state of the oceans and use available information so they can make proper choices when shopping for seafood. In addition, all paper used in the company is recycled and all wood products purchased adhere to the Forest Stewardship Council guidelines. We pursue clear activities in human resources and employee relationship management taking our very stringent standards in Austria and ensuring all ams locations reflect the same values. We have also established avenues where employees can voice their grievances anonymously and directly into executive management from anywhere in the world. In addition, we continue to invest in our people on a worldwide basis in training and education to further their professional development. As part of our social responsibility, we also sponsor local improvement programs in areas where we do business. In order to ensure the fulfilment, correspondence or conformity with statutory laws, rules and policies, ISO standards, etc., we made a step further by implementing a compliance board. This builds the framework to address topics related to compliance standards, anti-corruption, internal and external compliance incidents, conflict of interests, Quality, Facility, Environment, Security, Safety, competition and antitrust to the executive board and management. The output of the compliance board meeting includes decisions and actions related to these topics, supports initiatives for improvements, and ensures the effective implementation of the compliance board and management system.

We strive to be one of the most attractive companies to work for and to be a fair and responsible employer that promotes equal opportunities, modern forms of employee development and offers a positive and dynamic working environment. Beside fast growing business we always have strong focus on our high labour standards. page 5/11 A brief description of our Processes or Systems In 2009, we published a Code of Conduct binding on all employees worldwide which integrates the Global Compact principles. For all employees, including our new additions, we integrated the Code of Conduct into the annual staff appraisals. We have a global set of practices in our employee relations, demonstrating our commitment to best practices in HR management. Actions Implemented in the Last Year / Planned For Next Year With the reimplementation of the moderated intranet forum (where employees can voice their grievances anonymously) public feedback to all employee questions were given. In addition we expanded internal tools and systems for employees’ exchange and feedback including our employee representatives. The annual staff appraisals were again held with all employees and managers to support effective communication and to safeguard employee career development. In October 2015 we rolled out our global employee survey to gain feedback on employees’ satisfaction regarding working environment, leadership, benefits as well as on other fields regarding their employment with ams. The employee survey serves as a communicating medium between ams and its employees to ensure a productive and rewarding working environment. We have developed and integrated Core Values and Leadership Principles which represent the fundament of our company. We believe, that our Core Values and Leadership Principles support our vision, shape and reflect our company culture and are the basis for our success.

In 1996 we were one of the first 10 companies in Austria which had implemented an environmental management system according to the European Eco Management Scheme (EMAS). One year later we achieved certification according to ISO 14001. All production and test facilities are today certified according to the latest ISO 14001 standard. We are committed to responsible, visionary environmental management with the aim of contributing to the conservation of an environment worth living in. We recognize that human activities are contributing to global climate change and we will continue to pursue activities to significantly lower our company’s impact on CO2 development. We motivate our employees through information and training on environmental awareness and relevant activities. As a special task we also take steps to make our employees aware of the severe depletion of the oceans’ marine wildlife and promote consumption of fish based on the guidelines of the Marine Stewardship Council. We also promote the protection of forests by committing to the guidelines of the Forestry Stewardship Council in order to guide our activities. A Brief Description of Our Program Carbon dioxide reduction program CO2 emissions are generated by several of our business activities. These include the production itself where we run equipment and maintain the clean room with electrical energy, the usage of natural gas to heat fresh air, heat buildings and generate process heat, the transportation of goods and the usage of perfluorinated gases in the production process. In 2009 we set up a carbon dioxide emission reduction program. Following the first step the evaluation of all carbon dioxide emissions in our production sites (Premstaetten, Austria, and Calamba, Philippines) including related transportation. Actions Implemented in the Last Year / Planned For Next Year The consequent usage of exhaust air cleaning systems for production gases (perfluorinated gases) leads to a continuous reduction of our carbon dioxide equivalent emissions to levels of under 10% of the comparable emission levels without air cleaning. 100% of all production exhaust gases are fed into abatement systems and destroyed by thermal degradation. In past years, we installed page 8/11 additional abatement systems to guarantee an uninterrupted operation. Early 2014 an additional bio scrubber for absorption of solvents in exhaust was installed. With this installation, we could record a significant reduction of emissions by 52% compared to 2013. Another major reduction of the CO2 equivalents emitted could be achieved at the beginning of 2015 by the installation of a heat pump. The heat pump enabled ams to reduce the natural gas consumption by 18.5% compared to 2014. In 2011 we changed also our electricity supplier and therefore the consumption from conventional electricity to 100% renewable electricity made of hydropower. This leads to a reduction of approximately 9000 tons indirect CO2 emissions. 2015 we record an increase in our total carbon dioxide equivalent emissions compared to 2014. The total CO2 equivalents emitted are 30,075 tCO2. This is mainly caused by emissions from ams manufacturing activities in Premstaetten, including also shipping of goods, employee commuting, travelling, etc. ams decided no more to cover emissions from outsourced manufacturing, as these are difficult to assess and would only be estimated. However, related to the company growth in revenue the CO2 equivalents are decreased by 14.8%. Refer to below diagrams in terms of the trend from past years. Measurable Results or Outcomes Total CO2 Equivalent Emissions and CO2 Equivalent / Revenue With the annual CO2 balance ams identifies the main contributors, to evaluate the mitigation potential of different influences. Out of that, a list of possible short term and long-term measures is developed that enables optimizing the GHG balance sheet. page 9/11 Electrical Energy Consumption Indicator per 200 mm Wafer Related to the 200 mm wafer equivalents produced on site, which were started in production, an average of 0.37 MWh per wafer was consumed in 2015. Compared to 2014, the value is decreased by 10.1% per wafer, because of higher utilization of existing production equipment. We have established our supplier audit system for business relevant concerns. In 2015 ams’ suppliers are asked to answer a self-assessment audit on environmental related topics and CSR – including questions on environmental facility control, control on prohibited substances in products and labor, ethics, health & safety. With the result of the self-assessment, ams decide which supplier is audited onsite. Since 2016 ams performs onsite audits which enables us to understand ams’ subcontractors’ situation and implementation for environmental protection and CSR. Further environmental information is available in ams Environmental Report on our website. Anti Corruption Principle 10 Business should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery In 2011 ams started its anti-corruption program. We developed a companywide guideline which led to a nomination of a compliance officer. The responsibility of the compliance officer is to clarify open questions and investigate critical situation. The compliance officer is also part of our corporate CSR board. In 2013 we restructured our existing CSR board and raised the compliance function so that the board is now build by additional roles as they are: VP & General Counsel, VP Human Resources, and Director IT. The new defined compliance board establishes a framework to discuss about compliance topics and incidents. In addition the compliance board developed a training strategy to all staff in order to increase the awareness on compliance matters. This is one method ams is facing compliance page 10/11 topics to its employees. Another focus we set towards our employees is that we included the ams compliance codex in the staff appraisals 2014. This ensures the direct manager is discussing the compliance codex with his/her employee, so we give this topic high importance. Due to Austria’s legal regulations we signed an agreement between the works council and management. Now we have very strict worldwide rules regarding these matters and we have also installed a tool which can be easily used to report incidents. This tool is for instance used when gifts to any employee is made and requests explicit approval from the compliance board. Additionally it is planned to roll out an E-Learning tool for compliance training which will be introduced to every employee via our Intranet. The training can be adjusted any time and should provide guidance in all related compliance matters. This COP will be published on our website www.ams.com page 11/11
