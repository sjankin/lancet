EDF Energy – United Nations Global Active Level Communication on Progress Period covered by our Communication on Progress (COP) June 2015 – June 2016 EDF Energy is committed to fulfilling the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact. We are embedding the Global Compact and its principles into our core business strategy through our Better Energy Ambitions. We continue to promote and encourage a culture of openness, integrity and accountability. This promotes good business practice and positive employee behaviour. It benefits the company, our customers, our employees and our shareholders. We expect all of our employees to behave in a way that protects the interests of the company, their colleagues, the environment and the communities which we serve. In this, our second first Communication on Progress, we set out our approach to further embedding the Global Compact into our day to day business. We also report the actions we are taking to improve how we are implementing the principles. We will communicate this information to our stakeholders via our website, footnotes to our news releases, and through our Better Energy Ambitions report. Yours sincerely Vincent De Rivaz, CBE Chief Executive EDF Energy 1 About EDF Energy EDF Energy is an integrated energy company with over 13,000 employees, which generates electricity for the UK from a nuclear, coal, gas and renewable energy portfolio. We also supply electricity and gas to our residential and business customers. We are a wholly owned subsidiary of the EDF Group, a leading global electricity company which began investing in the UK in 1998. At EDF Energy we are committed to our part in limiting global emissions by producing low-carbon electricity. We are the UK’s largest producer of low-carbon electricity. Within EDF Energy there are two separate businesses: one that produces electricity, called a generation business, and one that buys gas and electricity from the wholesale market to sell onto our customers. This is our customer supply business. The generation business operates the power stations that produce electricity. This goes directly into the National Grid to be transmitted throughout the UK. The gas infrastructure works in a similar way using pipelines. However, EDF Energy doesn’t actually produce gas; we buy it from the wholesale market to supply to our customers, and we store natural gas in disused salt caverns to inject back into the national grid system, to improve the security of supply during periods of high demand. We have published plans to build four new nuclear plants, subject to the right investment framework. That will secure both low-carbon electricity and high quality jobs and opportunities for the communities that we serve near to our new nuclear plants for many years to come. As well as helping our customers to have safe, secure and low-carbon electricity, our Blue products supply low-carbon, nuclear backed electricity. We consistently meet Government targets on energy efficiency, most recently delivering Energy Company Obligation (ECO) targets ahead of the deadline. For further information on how we operate please visit: http://www.edfenergy.com/about/how-weoperate Our Mission Achieving our mission means driving progress for people; being a successful and responsible longterm energy business, trusted by customers and powering a thriving society and a healthy environment. We are committed to being open and transparent and to having high standards of integrity, behaviour and business practice. These objectives are reflected in our Better Energy Ambitions at: http://www.edfenergy.com/about/ambitions 2 Our Commitment to the United Nations Global Compact We support the international commitments for the protection and defence of human rights of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization and reaffirm our adherence to the 10 principles of the Global Compact. Our Ethics and Business Conduct Policy sets out the standards for upholding ethical business practices and demonstrates our commitment to working with integrity, by being honest and transparent about our operations and performance. This policy is available at: http://www.edfenergy.com/about/governance Reconfirming our Commitments to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) It is our aim to ensure that we conduct our business in a way that is ethical. This means taking account of our social, economic and environmental impacts. Since 2005 EDF Group has implemented a CSR Agreement in conjunction with the national and international trades unions. This outlines key employment, social and environmental principles and guidelines which all companies within the EDF Group with more than 50 employees should seek to achieve. Within the UK, the trades unions who are signatories to the agreement are GMB, Prospect, Unison and Unite. Representatives from the national and international trades unions meet annually with management representatives from across EDF Group to review how each company within the Group has worked to achieve the principals and guidelines within the 22 Articles within the CSR Agreement. The Articles cover areas such as Human Rights, Health and Safety, Discrimination, Training and Mobility, Vulnerable Customers and Access to Energy to name a few. Working with our suppliers We recognise the importance of suppliers as stakeholders to our business and understand that our responsibilities extend beyond our own direct activities through our supply chain associations. We therefore expect our suppliers to share our ambitions and emulate our values to ensure safe, sustainable business partnerships. Since 2008 we have been working to ensure that 100% of our strategic and critical suppliers comply with the ten principles of the UN Global Compact. Our supplier registration process includes a risk assessment of the supplier according to human rights (including labour standards); environmental and anti-corruption risk dimensions based upon the risks attributed to the product/service categories which they will supply. How we conduct our business, and the impact and influence we have through our wider supply chain, is just as important as our financial performance. We publish our performance against the 10 principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) to help us focus and improve our performance. In 2015, we spent £2.2 billion with more than 4,000 suppliers, broadly consistent with 2014. We calculate that this supported more than 89,000 indirect jobs in our supply chain. 3 We continued our journey of continuous improvement against the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply (CIPS) Sustainable Procurement Review by: • adopting the CIPS Sustainability Index (SI) for supplier assessment • inviting our Top 200 suppliers (84% of corporate spend) to undertake a CIPS SI assessment (42 have completed and published scores so far) • establishing a Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) and Wellbeing forum where we can collaborate with our strategic supply chain partners across six work streams • supporting our company-wide accreditation against the National Equality Standard • collaborating with our supply partner EY to hold a joint women’s network event We will continue to engage our top suppliers on sustainability. Our target is for 100% of our prioritised suppliers to have completed the CIPS SI assessment by the end of 2016, with improvement plans agreed for any suppliers falling short of the average. We will revise our UNGC compliance target to 95% of suppliers to allow for process timescales and churn within our vendor master database. Upon request, we will provide our suppliers with an interim statement of our compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015, ahead of publishing a full statement on our website in 2017. We also expect our suppliers to respect and emulate our commitment to diversity and inclusion by applying our seven Diversity and Inclusion Principles within their business. Living Wage Foundation Early in 2016, with the support of our Trades Unions, we gained the Voluntary Living Wage accreditation. This means we will continue paying our employees a Living Wage and will work with our supply chain partners to make sure everybody who works in our supply chain is also paid a Living Wage. 4 HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses Assessment, Policy and Goals  EDF Energy endorses the international commitments of the United Nations for the protection and defence of human rights and reaffirms its adherence to the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact of July 2000 (10th principle adopted in June 2004). It undertakes, with the signatory parties, to promote them to its suppliers.  To ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach to legal and regulatory compliance, ethical standards and business conduct, company-wide documents set out the required standards of behaviour from employees which are appropriately communicated and deployed in all organisational areas. Some of these are available on our website at: http://www.edfenergy.com/about/governance  EDF Energy fully supports the rights of all individuals to be treated with dignity and respect at work. Practices, procedures and guidance defining EDF Energy’s commitment to prevent, discourage and deal with bullying and/or harassment are established and applied.  EDF Energy’s approach is aligned with the EDF Group Code of Ethics which mandates respectful treatment of employees and stakeholders, including protecting their human rights. Alleged breaches of company policy and practices are investigated. Employees found to be in breach of the Company’s policies and procedures are liable to action under the relevant Disciplinary Procedure.  As an inclusive company, EDF Energy aims to capture the value that difference brings. Principles and commitments are established in respect of diversity and inclusion with an Inclusion Strategy driving activity and regular external benchmarking taking place to ensure best practice is being achieved. Implementation EDF Energy has implemented the following policies to ensure consistent and ethical practices are applied:  Confidential Reporting of Serious Concerns our procedure encourages workers to disclose serious concerns they have about activities within the Company. This can be done internally or through an external confidential reporting line which is available for all employees, agency supplied workers and managed service workers to report serious concerns. 5  Ethics and Business Conduct Policy the Ethics and Business Conduct Policy sets out the standards for upholding ethical business practices and demonstrates our commitment to working with integrity, by being honest and transparent about our operations and performance. It establishes how appropriate and expected standards of behaviour will be set and communicated to enable EDF Energy to live its values, and is consistent with the EDF Group Code of Ethics.  Employee Code of Conduct sets out what is expected of all employees in terms of behaviour. Employees are required to comply with the Code of Conduct in order to promote good business practice and positive employee behaviour which will benefit the Company, its employees and its shareholders.  Equal Opportunities EDF Energy welcomes the breadth of perspective that employment of diverse individuals can bring and wants to be recognised as an inclusive company. It is fully committed to a policy of fairness and equality for all job applicants, employees and others who work for it, irrespective of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or belief. This approach to fairness and equality 5 also applies to employees who are members or nonmembers of a trade union, part time workers and those on a fixed term contract. EDF Energy’s HR Policy: Equal Opportunities, sets out the Company’s approach.  Harassment and Bullying EDF Energy fully supports the rights of all individuals to be treated with dignity and respect at work. EDF Energy’s policy is that harassment and/or bullying of an individual is unacceptable behaviour which will not be tolerated.  EDF Group EDF Energy ensures the implementation of its ethics approach via the Board of Directors Ethics Committee and through the Group’s Ethics and Ethical Conduct Commission for the management of monitoring alerts. An ethics correspondent has also been appointed by the CEO of each of the companies within the Group.  Biomass Standard and Group Biomass Policy the procurement of biomass for use in our power stations is seen as an area of high risk where human rights could be subject to abuse. Both the EDF Energy Biomass Standard and the EDF Group Biomass Policy outline the minimum standards that must be implemented across the supply chain to ensure that fuel is obtained safely and ethically.  Supply Chain Policy sets out the strategic objectives and outlines the minimum standards that must be implemented across Supply Chain activities, ensuring they are carried out safely and ethically in a controlled and sustainable manner. Our supply chain policy is available at: http://www.edfenergy.com/about/governance Outcomes  EDF Energy conducts systematic risk assessments of potential breaches to ethical standards and has appropriate controls to mitigate the identified risks. EDF Energy has not been involved in any investigations, legal cases or incidents involving human rights. 6  All formal employment complaints are reviewed to determine if there are any lessons learnt and/or changes required to our policies, procedures and processes.  By the end of 2015, 98.5% of our strategic and critical suppliers were compliant with the UN Global Compact.  In the 2015 employee engagement survey, 83% of employees value the EDF Energy culture and values. Our Inclusion Index, which measures our employees’ satisfaction with our Inclusion Strategy stands at 80%  EDF Energy has been awarded the UK’s National Equality Standard, with 21 out of 70 competency areas deemed as outstanding. We are the only energy supplier to be awarded this standard.  Audits of our biomass supply chain have not identified any breaches with our Standard or the Group Policy. The amount of biomass co-fired at our stations has reduced as the economics for our coal stations look less favourable. This has limited the need to source new supplies of biomass and we continue to co-fire our coal fired power stations with olive oil cake. Plans in 2016/17  Implementation of new EDF Energy HR Policy: Physical and Verbal Abuse. Review of HR policies and procedures of HR policies and update to the Inclusion Strategy designed and started to be delivered using National Equality Standard recommendations.  Communicate further to our employees our commitment to the UNGC ten principles through the company intranet and our employee magazine Connect.  Reinforce and communicate our approach to ethics and business conduct Policy through proactive communication via the company intranet.  We are reviewing our Better Energy Ambitions and seeking to improve the way we identify and manage opportunities to make the products and services more circular. We will also explore whether we can use Natural Capital accounting to help improve decision making processes for new developments.  Launch an Operational Forum to review a proposal to adopt a process for independently assessing our Top 200 suppliers (representing 80% of our expenditure) against People, Planet and Profit dimensions and the next 800 suppliers (representing an additional 16% of our expenditure) via an annual Supplier Charter. 7 LABOUR PRINCIPLES: Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labour; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation Assessment, Policy and Goals  As a UK based company we comply with the relevant UK legislation including Agency Worker Regulations, Data Protection Act, Equality Act and Health and Safety.  EDF Energy fully respects the right of our employees to freedom of association and representation either through four trade unions, works councils or any other appropriate forums.  EDF Energy has a well-established consultation and negotiation framework supporting employees on collective agreements. This includes the Company Council chaired by the CEO which meets four times a year, as well as forums at a Business Unit and local level. Minutes from these meetings are communicated to employees through the company intranet.  As an inclusive company, we aim to capture the value that difference brings and we are fully committed to providing and promoting equality and inclusion.  We are fully committed to a policy of fairness and equality for all job applicants, employees and others who work for us irrespective of their age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or belief. This approach to fairness and equality also applies to employees who are members or non-members of a trade union, part time workers and those on a fixed term contract. Implementation  Contract of employment all employees have a contract clearly stating their terms and conditions of employment which comply with the relevant employment laws and include details of the benefits, grievance and disciplinary procedures.  Corporate Responsibility Commitments and the Group Ethics Policy in line with our parent company’s commitments we agree to fully comply with all principles within the UNGC.  Diversity and Inclusion EDF Energy recruits from the widest possible talent pool and assesses potential employee’s assesse every potential employee against our four key behaviours: integrity, inclusion, inspiration and impact. Our approach to diversity and inclusion is reinforced by our employee networks. These provide a platform for employees to connect as a community. 8  Diversity and Inclusion Partnerships we are core members of Business in the Community’s (BITC) Race Equality Campaign, helping to improve opportunities for ethnic minorities and drive gender balance in the workplace respectively. We are committed to building on our position as a Diversity Champion with Stonewall, the UK’s leading Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual charity and members of several other organisations that support Diversity and Inclusion in the workplace.  Diversity Works for London in 2012, we were proud to be one of only four companies to achieve the Diversity Works for London Gold Standard for our approach to Diversity and Inclusion – a nationwide assessment that supports businesses in realising the benefits of diversity in the workplace.  National Equality Standard in 2015, building on the success of the Gold Standard, we were the first UK Energy Company to achieve this new standard, which is a deep review of 70 competency areas on good practice in D&I.  Employee Code of Conduct sets out what is expected of all employees in terms of behaviour. Employees are required to comply with the Code of Conduct in order to promote good business practice and positive employee behaviour which will benefit the Company, its employees and its shareholders.  Health and Safety Policy a healthy workforce is fundamental to our ambition of zero harm and aligns with the Government’s Responsibility Deal to improve public health, which we have signed up to. Our health and safety policy outlines our approach to Zero Harm and how we manage this.  Our Better Energy Ambitions we have a People Ambition “We will inspire and enable our people to perform as a ‘force for good’ driving progress at work and across the communities we serve.

Outcomes  EDF Energy has not been involved in any investigations, legal cases or other events related to the violation of the Global Compact labour principles, or any health and safety prosecutions.  We recorded our best ever TRIR and Lost-Time Incident Rate (LTIR) in 2015. Our rolling 12month TRIR for December 2015 was a 28% improvement on our performance in 2014.  Our overall rolling 12-month Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) was 0.42 incidents per million hours, a 5% improvement on 2014 (0.44). While our TRIR and LTIR remain best in class compared to our peers in the energy sector, we are in no way complacent. 9  To improve our safety performance further, we continue to learn from near-miss safety incidents classified as High Potential Events (HPEs)Our total number of work-related ill health cases decreased by 25% compared to 2014, while sickness absence improved by 6%  In the annual employee engagement survey 94% of employees agree that safety is a priority for everyone.  82% of employees agreed that management supports diversity in the workplace. Plans for 2016/17  Deploy the health and safety culture assessment model across the company.  Fully embed our new HPE process across the business and continue to drive improvements in response to key risk themes – in particular, road risk and working at height.  Facilitate collaborative working among our supply chain partners so we can share best practices in key risk areas, such as working at height and occupational health.  Ensure key business projects, such as Hinkley Point C and Smart Metering, are set up for success in safety terms.  Work on the development and implementation of action plans for continual improvement from the National Equality Standard findings.  We have made a commitment to continue to consult and work jointly with TUs on any significant change programmes.  Provide upon request a copy of the interim Modern Slavery Act statement.  We’ll be complying with new legislation on Gender Pay Gap reporting in 2016. 10 ENVIRONMENTAL PRINCIPLES Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies Assessment, Policy and Goals  We are part of EDF Group and we are the UK’s largest generator and supplier of low-carbon electricity.  To minimise the carbon intensity of our generation, we are investing to improve the reliability and efficiency of our generation fleet, this includes plant life extensions to our nuclear stations.  We plan to build two new reactors at Hinkley Point on the northern Somerset coast next to the existing Hinkley Point A station, which is being decommissioned, and Hinkley Point B station, which is operational.  As part of our Better Energy Ambitions – our plan for a sustainable business we have introduced an ambition ‘To power society without costing the Earth’. This captures our plans to reduce the carbon intensity of electricity generation and to have an increasingly positive environmental impact.  We will ensure every job will be done safely to protect the environment, employees, contractors and the communities that could be impacted by our operations. We will as a minimum comply with all relevant environmental regulations, standards and other codes of practice.  We will operate and maintain our assets within the bounds of permits, consents, licenses and the approved plant designs and safety margins in order to protect environmental safety, while striving to achieve best performance in our sector.  We will ensure we identify our significant environmental impacts and we will take action to manage these and to prevent pollution or environmental damage which may occur as a result of our business operations.  We will focus our improvements in areas where we can make a material difference, setting challenging objectives and targets for ourselves, our contractors and supply chain. We are committed to continuous improvement of our activities, products and services.  We will engage stakeholders with an interest in environmental issues to ensure their concerns and expectations are fully considered, and we will place environmental considerations at the heart of robust and transparent decision-making processes.  We will openly report our performance against our Environmental Improvement Plan. 11  We will continue to develop a culture of environmental responsibility among employees; contractors and suppliers who will apply due care for the environment no matter how urgent or important the task.
