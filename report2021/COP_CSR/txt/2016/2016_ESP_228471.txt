We moved forward in our vision of being a global energy renewable company, leader in value creation, innovation and sustainability, with a growing asset base that reached 9.6 GW of installed capacity, maintaining the highest levels of excellence already achieved. In 2015, EDPR confirmed its positioning as the driver of green energy growth of the EDP Group. A total of 21.4 TWh of green electricity GROWING WITH A corresponds to a 44% of the total electricity demand of the country of Portugal, saving the emission of about 18.7 millions of tons of COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY CO2, contributing to the world fight against the climate change. This THAT FIGHTS THE CLIMATE commitment to the environment is clearly present in the EDP Group CHANGE... values, and this year is reinforced by the global recognition of the threaten that climate change represents in the short term, as became evident during the COP 21 Climate Change conference held in Paris, where the international community agreed to act globally to stop it. ANNUAL REPORT 6 2015 In this environment that was established after the Paris agreement, the close to 200 countries congregated in the COP 21 are now committed to reduce global emissions, each one of them submitting their individual contributions according to their realities. European countries are on top of the reduction targets as the European commission set an ambitious objective for 2030 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% compared to 1990 and to increase the share of renewable energy to at least 27%. Our technology represents an immediate and economically competitive solution to fight the climate change. Thus, EDPR will maintain its positioning as a front-runner in the EU market in the years to come. In addition, the company growth will still rely on the expansion of the US market, where the environmental legislation is still evolving, moving towards an electricity mix with a stronger presence of sustainable energy sources. The execution of our growth plan will be complemented with selected projects in Brazil and Mexico. This new framework reinforces EDPR positioning on the right side of the energy business, leveraging the company commitment to sustainability aimed at the quality of life for current and future generations, generating the solution that on top of being sustainable is currently the most competitive source of energy, with the only exception of large hydro in some cases. Wind onshore is clearly a preferable technology today to conventional thermal generation on a new-build basis. Even in low fuel prices scenarios, yet historically very volatile, wind farms with strong load factors are still able to be competitive. On top of that, turbine and solar panel costs have sunk along the past years and financing costs are improving, grounding solid foundations to the expansion of wind and solar PV development. As a result, EDPR will continue delivering growth on a global scale. The strategic roadmap of focused growth in renewable energy pursued by ... CREATING THE MAXIMUM EDPR and its shareholders puts us a step ahead of the industry and continues to prove successful. VALUE FROM OUR PREMIUM ASSETS... This year, we reached the halfway of our business plan up to 2017, and we are on track to achieve, and even surpass, the defined targets set back in early 2014. One of the strategic pillars concerns a self-funding model that supports the company growth with competitive funding. The company was committed to cover € 700 million of our € 2.5 billion investment for 2014-17 period. During 2014 and 2015, the company has already received proceeds for € 800 million, in a clear indicator of the quality of the company’s installed asset base that has attracted the interest of many institutional investors. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 7 Moreover, EDPR continued gaining visibility on its future growth opportunities at a controlled risk, particularly in the US market where we have signed 1.8 GW of long-term sales agreements since early 2013 providing full visibility to the growth target in the US for 2014-17. All in all, EDPR on target execution will allow the company to deliver solid growth targets toward 2017 and continue to lead in a green and sustainable sector with increased worldwide relevance. In 2015, EBITDA reached an outstanding 1,142M€ and Net Income was 167M€, a +26% and +32% increase vis-à-vis the prior year, respectively. 2014, EBITDA TheIncompany was 903M€ has a dividend and Net pay-out Income ranging was 126M€, between 25% and -2% 35%andof -7% Net annual below thethat Profit year, respectively. priorcontributes The results to leveraging were impacted our shareholders’ by returns. ...

Sincerely, Sincerely, ANNUAL REPORT 8 2015 ANTÓNIO /// JOÃO MANSOMEXIA NETO VICE-CHAIRMAN OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CEO BOARDS OF DIRECTORS INTERVIEW Q1 FIRSTLY, AS A SUMMARY, COULD YOU GIVE US A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE 2015 RESULTS? WITH THE CEO A1: In 2015, EDPR gained visibility. Visibility regarding fulfilment of our 2014-17 business plan, within which we have already reached important goals despite only being at the halfway point. Visibility regarding our growth up until the end of 2017 and post-business plan options. Visibility regarding remuneration in the US, with the extension of the PTC and the continued demand observed for PPAs. Visibility regarding the commitments to fight climate change ratified by countries in the COP21. All this has demonstrated that EDPR is on the right path, and consequently it has won its shareholders’ trust in recent years. Firstly, EDPR’s load factor was above the market average again this year. Despite wind resources in 2015 being lower than forecast, we reached an outstanding load factor of 29%, thanks to the fact that we were able to maintain a technical availability ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 9 above our goal of 97.5%.

We have already completed transactions valued at €800 million, €100 million more than the goal set This year the US government took an important step for the entire four-year period. This crystallises the forward by extending legislation on the PTC for a value created in our wind farms and accelerates its five-year period with a progressive phase-out in line reinvestment. Furthermore, since 2013, EDPR has with what businesses, like our own, wanted in order executed PPAs for a capacity of 1.8 GW, providing total to plan our growth with total visibility.

Within the framework of the 2014situation, it is already a sign of change. It reflects the 17 business plan, we also defined a sustainability need for countries to continue to promote renewable roadmap that we have closely followed and that is technology and the evolution of onshore wind, helping us to strengthen our business model based on specifically, towards greater competitiveness. clean, environmentally-friendly energy to position us a benchmark in sustainability.

This is the case in Brazil, where this year BUSINESS? we were able to secure 140 MW to continue our growth beyond that defined in the 2014-17 business plan.

It is our Q5 NOW THAT WE HAVE REACHED THE greatest asset and this year we broke the barrier of MIDPOINT IN THE 2014-17 BUSINESS PLAN, 1,000 employees distributed among 12 countries and WHAT IS THE COMPANY’S CURRENT SITUATION? comprising 28 nationalities.

It is worth pointing out here that all the within a framework of a prestigious and recognised new director positions have been filled this year by self-funding model designed to accelerate value personnel trained within EDPR, a clear reflection of creation. our efforts to foster opportunities within the company. Thanks to the benefits we offer to ensure a positive work-life balance, we have been recognised as the “Best Place to Work” in both Spain and Poland. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 11 However, on top of our employee’s professional development, our number one priority is their safety and that of any person working at our facilities. Over 90% of our capacity has an OHSAS 18001 certified health and safety management system, which is a guarantee that we have the appropriate procedures in place to ensure the safety of our employees and all the contractors working at our facilities. Furthermore, this year we increased their health and safety training and also carried out various drills so that they are prepared in the event of an accident. Similarly, we also strive to prevent any form of environmental impact and more than 90% of our installed capacity is ISO 14001 certified, certification which demonstrates our commitment to the environment, guaranteeing processes to ensure coexistence and guarantee the lowest possible environmental impact from our activity. We follow a culture of respect for our environment, as reflected in the company’s code of ethics, and we want this to be consistently at the forefront of our employees’ minds on a daily basis. We pursue a deep knowledge among all employees of the company code of ethics, and, therefore, in 2015, a new business ethics training programme was initiated at EDPR. Furthermore, in order to publicise the company’s new anti-corruption policy, specific training was provided in 2015. THE FOREGOING IS CLEAR PROOF THAT SUSTAINABILITY IS FIRMLY INTEGRATED INTO EDPR, BOTH IN THE COMPANY’S DAY-TODAY OPERATIONS AND ITS STRATEGIC PLAN; SUSTAINABILITY IS A PART OF EDPR’S DNA. Q7 LASTLY, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR FINAL MESSAGE TO BE? A7: 2015 was a year of significant progress, demonstrating our capacity to deliver on results. At barely the halfway point in our business plan, we have already exceeded our self-funding goals and have been able to provide visibility regarding the fulfilment of our plan up to 2017. This is all thanks to our employees, which form a team committed to the company and who I want to thank for their dedication and hard work. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank everyone with whom we work with on a day-to-day basis, especially the landowners and other members of the communities where we operate, members of the local and national administrations we work with and all our suppliers, thanks to whom we are able to develop and operate an array of extremely high quality wind and solar plants. Lastly, I also want to thank our shareholders for the confidence they have placed in us and for believing in our vision for the company. Shareholders have been awarded thanks to our delivering on results, something we will continue to do in the coming years, following our current business plan and the forthcoming business plan for 2020, which we will present next May.

GOVERNANCE MODEL Corporate governance is about promoting corporate fairness, transparency and accountability. EDPR’s corporate governance structure specifies the shareholders, board of directors, managers and other stakeholders’ rights and responsibilities and spells out the rules and procedures for making decisions on corporate affairs. It also incorporates the organization's strategic response to risk management. EDPR’s corporate governance model is designed to ensure transparency and accountability through a clear separation of duties between management and supervision of the company’s activities. The corporate governance structure adopted is the one in effect in Spain. It comprises a General Meeting of Shareholders and a Board of Directors that represents and manages the company. As required by the law and established in the company’s articles of association, the Board of Directors has set up four specialized committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Committee on Related-Party Transactions. This governance structure and composition was chosen to adapt the company’s corporate governance model also to the Portuguese legislation and it seeks, insofar it is compatible with the Spanish law, to correspond to the socalled “Anglo-Saxon” model set forth in the Portuguese Commercial Companies Code, in which the management body is a Board of Directors, and the supervision and control duties are of the responsibility of a separate body, a Supervisory Board. EDPR’s model attempts then to establish compatibility between two different systems of company law, through a Nominations and Remunerations Committee and Audit and Control Committee of independent members, although not exclusively separate from the Board of Directors (“BoD”). General Meeting of Shareholders Board of Directors “BoD” Executive General Secretary Committee Nominations and Related-Party Audit and Remunerations Transactions Control Committee Committee Committee GENERAL SHAREHOLDERS’ MEETING General Shareholders’ Meeting is the body where the shareholders participate, it has the power to deliberate and adopt decisions, by majority, on matters reserved by the law or the articles of association. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 29 BOARD OF DIRECTORS António Mexia Chairman Emilio García-Conde General Secretary João Manso Neto Vice-Chairman and CEO Miguel Dias Amaro João Paulo Costeira Gabriel Alonso Nuno Alves CFO COO Europe & Brazil COO North America João Lopes Raimundo Jorge Santos João de Mello Franco José Ferreira Machado Chairman Chairman Chairman Manuel Menéndez Allan J.Katz António Nogueira Leite Francisca Guedes de Oliveira Gilles August Acácio Piloto Executive Committee Nominations and Remunerations Committee Audit and Control Committee Related-Party Transactions Committee Independent Member ANNUAL REPORT 30 2015 BOARD OF DIRECTORS EDPR’s BoD shall consist of no less than 5 and no more than 17 Directors, including a Chairperson. Currently it is composed by 16 board members, out of which 9 are independent. BoD members are elected for 3 years period and may be re-elected for equal periods. EDPR’s BoD has the broadest power for the administration, management and governance of the company, with no limitations other than the responsibilities expressly and exclusively invested in the General Shareholders Meeting, in the company’s articles of association or in the applicable law. Its members must meet at least 4 times a year, preferably once a quarter. Nonetheless, the Chairperson, on his own initiative or that of 3 Directors, shall convene a meeting whenever he deems fit for the company’s interests. EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE EDPR’s Executive Committee (EC) is composed by five members, including a Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO coordinates the implementation of the BOD decisions and the Corporate and General Management functions, partially assigning those to the other executive officers, namely: the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Operating Officer for Europe and Brazil (COO EU & BR) and the Chief Operating Officer for North America (COO NA). The CFO proposes and ensures the implementation of the financial policy and management, including financial negotiation, management and control, cash management optimization and financial risk management policy proposal; he also coordinates and prepares the business plan and the budget, manages the financial statements reporting analyses the operational and financial performance and coordinates procurement function and relations with key suppliers while ensuring the implementation of the procurement strategy and policy. The COO EU & BR and the COO NA coordinate their platforms by developing, establishing and implementing the strategic plan for the renewable energy business in their respective platforms, in accordance with the guidelines set by the BOD; they are also responsible for planning, organizing and managing resources, controlling, measuring and improving the management of projects and subsidiary companies to achieve expected results to make EDPR a leader in the renewable energy sector in their respective platforms. NOMINATIONS AND REMUNERATIONS, RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEES In addition to EC referred above, EDPR governance model contemplates permanent bodies with an informative, advisory and supervisory tasks independently from the BoD, such as: NOMINATIONS AND REMUNERATIONS RELATED-PARTY AUDIT AND CONTROL COMMITTEE TRANSACTIONS COMMITTEE COMMITTEE (Independent members) (Independent members) FUNCTIONS Assist and report to the BoD Perform the duties of ratifying ||| Propose the appointment about appointments, transactions: of the company’s auditors re-elections, dismissals and the internal risk and remunerations of: ||| Between EDPR and EDP management and control ||| Its related parties, systems ||| Members of the BoD ||| Supervise internal audits qualified shareholders, ||| Senior management directions, key employees and compliance personnel or his relatives ||| Prepare an annual report on its supervisory activities ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 31 REMUNERATION POLICY EDPR governance model is reinforced by an incentive structure with transparent remuneration through variable remuneration based on key performance indicators.

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE The organization structure is designed to accomplish the strategic management of the company but also a transversal operation of all the business units, ensuring alignment with the defined strategy, optimizing support processes and creating synergies. EDPR is EDPR organized around around three is organized main elements: a corporate Holding three main Holding and and two two platforms platforms that group all the business that groupunits where all the the company business has presence. units where the company has presence. CORPORATE HOLDING Europe & Brazil North America Spain Portugal France Belgium US West US Central US East & Canada & Mexico United Poland Romania Brazil Kingdom ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL PRINCIPLES The model is designed with several principles in mind to ensure optimal efficiency and value creation. Critical KPIs and span of control are aligned at project, country, platform and holding Accountability level to ensure accountability tracking and to take advantage of complementarities alignment derived from end-to-end process vision. Corporate areas function as competence support centers and are internal service providers to all business units for all geographical non-specific needs. Client-service Business priorities and needs are defined by local businesses and best practices are defined and distributed by corporate units. Execution of activities at holding level are held only when significant value is derived, Lean organization coherently with defined EDPR holding role. Collegial decisionEnsures proper counter-balance dynamics to ensure multiple-perspective challenge making across functions. Platforms organizational models remain similar to allow for: Clear and Easy coordination, vertically (holding-platforms) and horizontally (across platforms); transparent Scalability and replicability to ensure efficient integration of future growth. EDPR HOLDING ROLE EDPR Holding seizes value creation, through the dissemination of best practices in the organization and the standardization of corporate processes to the platforms and the business units to improve efficiency. Its internal coordination model and interface with EDP group impacts both the company’s processes activities performed, processes steps, inputs and outputs, and decision-making mechanisms -, and the company’s structure, with an alignment of functions and responsibilities with the processes configuration. The EDPR Holding structure was designed to accomplish two fundamental roles: Strategic Management and Transversal Operation. Strategic Management covers to a) adopt a coordination model within the group, supporting the Executive Committee in the definition and control of the strategy policies and objectives; b) define specific strategic initiatives; c) review the accomplishment of the company’s business plan; d) define transversal policies, rules and procedures; e) control key performance indicators. Transversal Operation deals to i) ensure the alignment of all the platforms with the defined strategy; ii) capture synergies and optimize support processes; and iii) systematically and progressively concentrate supporting activities in shared service business units with the group. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 33 INTEGRITY AND ETHICS Ethical behaviour is absolutely essential for the functioning of the economy. EDPR recognizes its importance and complexity, and is committed to address ethics and its compliance. But is employees’ responsibility to comply with ethical obligations. GOVERNANCE MODEL FOR ETHICS Ethics are the cornerstone of EDPR strategy, to the extent that EDPR has a Code of Ethics and an Anti-Corruption regulation that go beyond just defining the company principles to be adopted, but also how employees and any other service provider working on behalf of EDPR should behave when dealing with the company stakeholders. The Code of Ethics has its own regulation that defines a process and channels to report any potential incident or doubt on the application of the code. The Ethics Ombudsman is behind this communication channel, and to analyse and present to the Ethics Committee any potential ethical problem. The code is communicated and distributed to all employees and interested parties, and complemented with tailored training sessions. HOW DO WE APPLY OUR CODE OF ETHICS? EDPR’s Code of Ethics applies to all company employees, regardless of their position in the organization and working location, and they all must comply with. Our suppliers should be aligned with the spirit of our Code of Ethics, and this is reflected in our procurement policies. The Ethics Ombudsman plays an essential role in the ethics process. He guarantees impartiality and objectivity in registering and documenting all complaints of ethical nature submitted to him. He monitors their progress and ensures that the identity of the complainants remains confidential, while entering into contact with them whenever appropriate, until the case is closed. Reports of alleged violations of the Code of Ethics must be submitted Identify an alleged violation to the Ethics Ombudsman, indicating personal data and a detailed of the code of ethics description of the situation. Ombudsman performs Ethics Ombudsman first confirms the events reported and submits a a summary investigation preliminary report on the initial confirmations to the Ethics Committee. Ethics Committee decides Ethics Committee analyses every situation reported and decides as if the complaint portrays to whether it should be classified as a violation of the Code of Ethics. a violation When conducting an investigation, the Company shall abide by the law When a violation is confirmed, and its own in-house rules. After the investigation is complete, the the Committee opens an Committee decides whether any corrective or disciplinary action is investigation required. In 2015 there were no communications to the Ethics Ombudsman regarding any irregularity at EDPR and no communications regarding any irregularity with material impact at EDPR though the whistleblowing channel. ETHICS PROGRAM Our commitment to ethics is reflected in our Ethics Program. Launched in 2010 and in order to renew ethical behaviours within the company and transmit the new additions to the code, was performed again during 2015. The Ethics program is an important tool to assess the current status and promote awareness on the issue internally. The Program consists of an interpretative guide of the Code of Ethics, a survey to assess how ethics is understood by EDPR’s workers and a training program. An online pilot training program was launched in 2015 to transmit general concepts to a group of employees, and after the great feedback provided by them it will be expanded to the rest of EDPRs personnel during 2016. ANTI-CORRUPTION REGULATION In order to ensure compliance with the standards of Anti-Corruption Regulation in all geographies where EDPR operates, the Company has developed an Anti-Corruption Policy of application to all EDPR Group, which was approved by its Board of Directors on December, 2014. This Anti-Corruption Policy will involve a series of new procedures regarding the relationships of EDPR employees with external parties, namely the approval of certain actions regarding hospitality to and from external parties, charitable donations, and sponsorships. This Policy was implemented in the Group throughout 2015. ANNUAL REPORT 34 2015 EMPLOYEE RELATIONS EDPR is committed to respect freedom of trade union association and recognises the right to collective bargaining. At EDPR, from 1,018 employees, 20% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements apply to all employees working under an employment relationship with some companies of EDPR group, regardless of the type of contract, the professional group into which they are classified, their occupation or job. However, matters relating to the corporate organization itself, the laws of each country or even usage and custom in each country result in certain groups being expressly excluded from the scope of collective bargaining agreements. The collective bargaining agreements that are applied at EDPR are usually negotiated at state level or regional level, and EDPR may be just one of the players among other leading sectorial companies in the negotiation with employees’ representatives, and in some cases, governmental representatives. In Portugal and Brazil, EDP negotiates its own agreements with employees, and those apply to all employee working for companies of the group, including EDPR. Despite not taking an active part in the negotiations, EDPR wants to facilitate the broadcast of any update in those agreements. EDPR organized training sessions for its employees to inform about the results of those negotiations. During the last years, EDPR has performed different benchmark analysis of the benefits stated at the different collective bargaining agreements that apply to our employees, comparing them against the benefits offered by the company and, in general terms, the company offers a more competitive benefits package compared to what is stated in the collective bargaining agreement. During 2015, representatives of the company held different meetings with employees’ representatives to deal with some critical topics that affect EDPR, such as the health and safety of its employees, or the bonus payment that is being done in Brazil. In France, EDPR representatives defined a roadmap with the elected employees’ representatives with the actions to follow in the short term. A full description of the Ethics governance model can be found in the Corporate Governance Report. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 35 index 2. STRATEGY 39 2.1. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 39 2.1.1.

TRANSITION TOWARDS A LOW CARBON ECONOMY The world is currently facing vital decisions about the energy of tomorrow. While global primary energy demand is likely to grow by more than 30% over the next 20 years, the need to tighten greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to address climate change is one of the main challenges of this century. This challenge, and in particular, the goal of limiting global warming below 2°C recently agreed at COP 21, requires an urgent shift towards a low-carbon economy. The scientific consensus is that the Earth’s climate system is unequivocally warming, and this is extremely likely attributable to GHG emissions from human activities. Indeed, climate scientist have observed that carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere have been increasingly rising over the Scientific evidence for past century: from the pre-industrial level of around 280 ppm (parts per warming of the climate system million), to 397 ppm in 2014. This represents approximately a 40% is unequivocal increase, a trend that is inevitably leading to a rise in temperature levels due to the “greenhouse effect” (by which GHG trap heat in the atmosphere). It has been commonly regarded as an adequate mean to stop this trend and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate avoid the worst impacts of climate change, to keep global warming below Change (IPCC) 2°C compared to the pre-industrial average. THE ENERGY CONTRIBUTION The energy sector is responsible for approximately two thirds of GHG emissions, being the power sector the largest emitter of CO2. This suggest that we are not able to effectively fight against climate change without a shift in the way we produce energy, and in particular, electricity. Therefore, a key pillar of mitigation strategies is the decarbonisation of the energy sector through renewable energy deployment. However, current deployment of renewables, especially in the heating sector and in transport, is still not enough to achieve the required energy-related CO2 reductions, to keep global warming below 2°C. Therefore, the fundamental shift towards decarbonisation is still underway.

The United 1997 Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was GHG reduction binding targets adopted, acknowledging the existence of anthropogenic climate change. for industrialized countries Industrialized countries had the major responsibility for combating it, and the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 provided those countries with binding GHG emissions reduction targets for the period 2008-2012, which 2009 entered into force in 2005. Recognized < 2ºC common objective In 2009, countries failed to extend the Kyoto Protocol, but they managed to recognize the common objective of keeping global temperature increase below 2°C. 2011 In 2011, the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) was created in Developed and developing countries order to seek an agreement before 2015, with legal force, applicable to to agree on a protocol with legal force both developed and developing countries, to be applicable in 2020. In the run-up of the Paris Conference, 186 countries submitted their 2015 commitment to fight climate change (INDCs), with GHG reductions INDCs commitements by country targets for 2025-2030. to reduce emissions by 2025/30 The submitted INDCs showed that pledges would still result in a global warming between 2.4°C and 2.7°C, therefore, above the 2°C threshold. NEXT STEPS Enter into force when 55% of GHG KEY ELEMENTS OF PARIS AGREEMENT emissions ratify the agreement After a four-year negotiation round, bythe end of 2015, the so-called Paris Agreement was finally achieved with 195 countries agreing to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. The agreement can be considered as historical as it reached the following key factors: 195 countries participated in an agreement that reflects a “hybrid” approach, blending a topdown rules-based system and a bottom-up system of voluntary pledges to provide flexibility. Keeping average warming below 2°C was reaffirmed as the common goal, with some parties that should make efforts to limit it to 1,5 °C.

NEXT STEPS The Paris Agreement will be open for signature on April 22, 2016, and will enter into force on the 30th day, after at least 55 parties accounting for 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have ratified it. Therefore, the earliest possible date of which the Agreement could enter into force is end-May 2016 but its unlikely to be so straightforward, with governments needing time to push ratification through their respective governments. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 41 2.1.2. RENEWABLE ENERGY ADVANTAGES In the current decarbonization scenario, with the commitment to keep global warming below +2°C, renewables are expected to play a key role within an energy sector that is the largest contributor to GHG emissions. Renewable energy has proven to be a competitive source of energy, with a strong contribution to GDP growth while on top of mitigating the potential impacts in the economy that climate change would bring. A. AN IMMEDIATE PATH TO DECARBONISE THE GLOBAL ENERGY MIX Ramping renewables is essential to meet climate goals without decelerating economic growth and reducing welfare. In the submitted INDCs prior to COP 21, the growth of the renewable energy capacity (including hydro) is expected to go from 29% in 2013 to a 44% in 2040, about 34% of the generation. However, the fully implementation of the submitted INDCs and policies of similar strength after 2030, probably will still lead to a warming of around 2.4-2.7°C by 2100. To achieve the 2°C target scenario, it would require emissions to be close to zero in 2100, while the 1.5° would even require negative emissions from 2080 onwards, which could be achieved with CO2 removal technologies. According to “IRENA” (International Renewable Energy Agency), doubling the share of renewable energy by 2030 could deliver around half of the required emissions reductions and, coupled with energy efficiency, keep the average rise in temperatures below 2°C, preventing, ultimately, the worst impacts of climate change. Most precisely, doubling the share of renewable energy by 2030 would allow to reduce 8.6 Gt of energy-related CO2 every year until 2030.

BRINGING ECONOMIC GROWTH & IMPROVING ENERGY SECURITY Today, renewable energy technologies are viewed not only as tools for mitigating climate change, but are also increasingly recognised as investments that can provide direct and indirect economic advantages by reducing dependence on imported fuels (and hence, improving trade balances), enhancing local air quality and safety, advancing energy access and security, propelling economic development and creating jobs. GDP growth is one of the outputs of the large deployment of WIND JOB CREATION POTENTIAL IN EUROPE renewables worldwide, thanks to the development of a new industry, which has been representing an increasingly share of the global Total: economy. 794,079 Job creation has been asserted by several studies as one of the Total: benefits of renewables, as they recognize this industry is more 520,659 441,155 labour-intensive compared to fossil fuel technologies which are more Total: 289,255 mechanized and capital intensive. This means that, on average, more 238,155 jobs are created for each unit of electricity generated from renewable 135,863 352,294 than from fossil fuels. According to IRENA, the sector employed 7.7 102,292 231,404 million people in 2014, directly and indirectly, around the world 2010 2020 2030 (excluding large hydropower), an 18% increase from 2013. Wind energy, is responsible for more than 1 million, 31% of them in Indirect Jobs Europe. Direct Jobs Reducing country energy dependency is possible because wind, solar and hydro technologies use endogenous resources. Countries enhance their security of energy supply and minimize their exposure to potential increases in fuel prices. Fuel resources are scarce and concentrated in some geographies which explains its high and volatile price. ANNUAL REPORT 42 2015 Reduce wholesale prices, thus, energy-consumers’ bills, because renewable generation is bid its output in wholesale markets at zero cost as wind or solar energy has no marginal cost. Power prices are determined by the intersection of power supply and demand, bids at zero displace more expensive technologies shifting, consequently, the supply curve. For a same level of demand, when wind production is available, the market price goes down (the so-called “merit order effect ). wind effect in spain pool price It´s a fact that wind power reduces the price of electricity: the more the wind blows, the lower the pool or wholesale electricity market price is, which benefits consumers and companies in their electricity bills. This fact is easily observed in the Spanish market, for instance, in the first two weeks of 2015. At that time, the average daily market price, which is the basis for calculating the energy term of the electricity bill, reached 55.66 €/MWh, representing an increase of more than 67% over the same period of the previous year. What was the reason behind this? Low wind generation. According to data released by the Spanish Transmission System Operator (REE) on January 15th, wind production was 1,494 GWh that is 50% lower than in the early days of 2014. C. RENEWABLES ARE FEASIBLE AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE WIND POWER IS CHEAPER Based on levelized cost of Energy (LCOE) Source: EDPR analysis €/MWh 57-82 77-106 87-104 83-115 94-124 100-170 NUCLEAR WIND CCGT SOLAR HYDRO COAL WIND 106-137 ONSHORE OFFSHORE PV Plummeting costs for renewable energy technologies are making a global energy transition not only possible, but actually, less expensive than the alternative. This is the reason why an increasingly number of private companies are opting for renewables to provide their energy needs, including some of the biggest worldwide as Apple, Ikea, Amazon, Wal-Mart and Lego. Onshore wind is the least expensive in many regions of the world, mainly due to the drop in wind turbines prices (almost a third in the last 6 years). Its increasingly competitiveness is therefore expected to drive future deployment. Bloomberg expects wind capacity worldwide to reach more than 2,000 GW in 2040 (compared to ~370 GW at the end of 2014). Solar PV has also experienced dramatic costs reductions that have boost its competitiveness. Solar PV modules prices have dropped 75% since 2009, and this trend is expected to continue. According to Bloomberg, solar PV is expected to dominate new build around the world with almost 5,000 GW of installed capacity by 2040 (from 177 GW in 2014YE). D. THE COSTS OF ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE MAY BE LOWER THAN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED TO INACTION Many studies have also analysed the costs of addressing climate change compared to the costs of “inaction” (business as usual). Most of the studies agree on the fact that, if we don’t act now, the overall costs and risks of climate change would outweigh the costs of current mitigation options. Most of the studies conclude that, potential impacts of climate change on water resources, food production, health and the environment among others, will provoke important losses for the economies. Instead, the costs of mitigation options (mainly renewables’ deployment) will have a negligible impact on aggregate terms. Focusing on the energy sector, Citi has conducted a study (“Energy Darwinism II”), in which it concludes that the expenditure on energy over the next quarter century, on an undiscounted basis, is remarkably similar in a lowcarbon scenario compared to business-as-usual one. More precisely, the cost of following a low-carbon route in the next 25 years would be of US$190.2 trillion which is even cheaper than the cost in an “inaction” scenario (US$192.0 trillion). This is due to the rapid drop of renewables’ costs, which, combined with lower fuel usage from energy efficiency investments, result in significantly lower long-term fuel bill. Therefore, from an economic perspective, the transition towards a low-carbon economy would have positive effects, not only in aggregate terms, but even in the energy sector. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 43 YES TO WIND POWER The successful “Yes to Wind Power” campaign was launched in Spain in early 2015, and will be rolled out to several other markets in 2016 such as Poland, Romania and Italy. CAMPAIGN OBJECTIVES “Yes to Wind Power” works to spread the word that renewable energy is now one of the least expensive generation technologies in the world, even beating out traditional sources like gas and coal. In addition to the economic benefits, the campaign also emphasizes that promoting a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable energy is one of the most effective and feasible near-term ways of mitigating climate change. Wind power’s scalability, speed of deployment and falling costs make it the best choice to achieve emissions reductions. The end goal of the campaign is to create more advocates for renewables, and increase societal support for the continued development of wind power and other renewable methods of energy generation. CAMPAIGN MEDIA Viral video Website: www.yestowindpower.com Youtube, Facebook, Twitter Leaflet Through “energetic hipster”, a character created to reach the younger public, the campaign has already reached more than 5 million people, offering scientific data in an easy to read and access format. EDPR created a viral video and a web site full of well-researched and credible information including scientific articles and reports about the benefits of wind power and other types of renewable energy. This is made available to the press, opinion leaders and the general public. “Yes to Wind Power” also has a social media component that aims to build an online community around it. The campaign has been featured in thousands of news reports and blogs, including an article in The Wall Street Journal. Campaign’s reach: 1,235,989 hits ANNUAL REPORT 44 2015 2.1.3. SUPPORTIVE POLICY INSTRUMENTS Wind economics, energy policies and environmental concerns continue to drive renewables capacity growth globally. 2015 HIGHLIGHTS 2015 was a record year for the wind industry as annual installations crossed the 60 GW mark for the first time, bringing total capacity to 432 GW. By region, 2015 was undoubtedly a great year for China that surpassed for the first time the astonishing figure of 30.5 GW, a record figure never seen before and clearly above expert’s estimates. In Europe, 12.8 GW of wind were installed during 2015, a 6.5% increase compared to 2014 installations. Germany, that added 6 GW, was again the largest market, both in terms of cumulative capacity and new installations. Poland came second with 1.3 GW added, more than twice the annual installations in 2014. France was third with 1.1 GW, followed by UK which managed to connect 1 GW. Although 2015 was a relatively quiet year for European onshore wind, it was an outstanding year for offshore. EWEA (European Wind Energy Association) reported that 3,019 MW offshore wind capacity were installed in European waters, a 108% increase over 2014. These results make cumulative installed capacity amounting to 11,027 MW, consolidating European leadership in terms of offshore wind. This impressive achievement was primarily driven by the German market, where 75.4% of all new capacity was brought online (2,282.4 MW), a four-fold increase compared to 2014. The second largest market was the UK (566.1 MW, or 18.7% share), followed by the Netherlands (180 MW, or 5.9% share). However, despite German additions, UK continues to be the largest offshore market, with 5 GW of installed capacity representing nearly half of total European capacity. Overall, in Europe, wind power was the energy technology with the highest installation rate, reaching 44% of all new installations. Solar PV came second with 8.5 GW (29% of 2015 installations) and coal third with 4.7 GW (16%). Globally, renewables accounted for 77% of new installations. 2015 was also a very good year for North American wind, primarily driven by US installations: 8,598 MW (a 77% increase over 2014). The US ended 2015 with 74,472 MW, consolidating its second position (after China) in terms of total installed capacity. Mexico installed 714 MW, amid the implementation of its comprehensive electricity market reform, while Canada 1,508 MW, slightly less than in 2014. In Latin America, Brazil lead the way, installing a record 2,754 MW, with cumulative capacity reaching 8.7 GW. It also worth noting that Uruguay added 316 MW, 60% increase versus its 2014 capacity. Other emerging economies also achieved important additions as for example India (2,623 MW, surpassing Spain and becoming the fourth largest market), South Africa (483 MW), Panama (235 MW) or Ethiopia (153 MW), among others. In 2015, the main drivers for wind energy growth were its increasing competitiveness, the need to fight climate change and reduce pollution (particularly choking smog that is dangerously threatening people’s health in many countries). Energy security, increasing power demand in emerging countries, insulation from volatile fuel markets, job creation and local industrial development were also decidedly key, but price and environmental concerns stood out as main drivers in 2015. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 45 EUROPE In October 24th European Council reached an agreement on 2030 Climate and Energy Policy Framework. A binding renewable energy target of at least 27% was set at European level, a binding EU target to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels and a non-binding energy efficiency target of 27% (to be re-visited by 2020). The framework does not mention individual targets for state implementation so it is still not clear how efforts will be conducted at the national level. European Institutions have now to work in the governance system to set the framework to reach this 2030 targets. RENEWABLE CO2 EMISSIONS ENERGY ENERGY REDUCTION EFFICIENCY 2020 20% 20% 20% TARGETS 2030 At least 27% At least 40% At least 27% TARGETS In October 2015, the European Environment Agency published its “Trends and projections” report, according to which the EU would be on tract to meets its climate and energy targets set for 2020. The report states that GHG emissions were already in 2013 19.8% below 1990 levels (and therefore, very close to the 20% target). Regarding renewables share, the 2020 target could be meet, provided that Member States sustain the speed of renewables’ development.

ITALY SPAIN GREECE On track Not on track SPAIN On January 14th 2016 the first auction of RES capacity under the RD 413/2014 framework was held. The auction was designed to provide a similar remuneration scheme that the one that applies to current installations (RD 413/2014). Developers were bidding to build 500 MW of wind energy and 200 MW of biomass plants. The auction was very competitive, around 5 times oversubscribed for onshore wind, and awarded contracts without any incentive, this is, at 100% discount to the opening price. EDPR was awarded 93 MW of wind energy composed by projects of the company’s pipeline located in very high wind resource areas, with some capex already invested and environmental permits near to expire. Given those ANNUAL REPORT 46 2015 very particular conditions, and anticipating an oversubscribed auction following years of no new capacity added in the country by the whole sector, the company decided to bid competitively, even if only benefiting from the floor protection over operation and maintenance cost provided by the auction. The Government has announced that more auctions will be organised, possibly in 2016, to contract the capacity that Spain needs to comply with its 2020 targets. In connection with 2020 targets, the ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism published in December its “National Energy Infrastructure Plan 2015-2020” which includes government’s view on capacity additions by technology throughout the period. According to this document, and in order to comply with the 2020 targets, around 4.5-6.5 GW of wind capacity would be needed. FRANCE In France, the “Energy Transition bill”, whose aim is to build a long-term and comprehensive energy strategy, was finally passed in July 2015. In 66 articles, the text targets to cut France's GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 (and divide them by four by 2050), to halve the country's energy usage by 2050, to reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production, to cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix. Following the provisions of the “Energy Transition Law”, the French government disclosed a draft decree with the details of a new remuneration scheme for renewables. According to this text, renewables will be remunerated by contract-for-difference scheme. However, the implementation for wind energy will probably be delayed to 2018 and up until then, new wind farms will be remunerated according to the current feed-in tariff scheme. POLAND In Poland, a new Renewables’ Act was approved in February 2015, introducing a different support system for new renewables plants. According to the law, the current Green Certificate (GC) system will be replaced by a tender scheme. However, the current GC scheme will be maintained (with some adjustments) for operating plants. These plants will have the choice to remain under the GC scheme or shift to the new scheme through specific tenders for operating assets. ITALY In Italy a new draft decree envisaging new wind tenders for at least the two next years. According to the draft, 800 MW of onshore wind could be tendered, with a reference tariff of 110€/MWh. The publication of the final decree is expected for the first quarter of 2016. UNITED KINGDOM On February 26, DECC (Department of Energy and Climate Change) and National Grid, published the results of the first “Contract for Difference” (CfD) auction. Over 2.1 GW of capacity across 27 projects was awarded a CfD contract. Successful projects include 15 onshore wind projects, 2 offshore wind and 5 solar PV, among others. UK energy secretary Amber Rudd announced a “new direction for UK energy policy” in a speech on 18 November. According to it, the strategy is likely to be focused on gas, nuclear, and provided it cuts its costs, offshore wind. With regards to offshore, she announced that the government would fund three auctions before the end of the decade, with the first probably to be held by end 2016. However, this funding will depend on offshore wind capacity to lower its costs. ROMANIA The European Commission (DG Competition) disclosed in May 2015, its clearance to the Romanian Renewables support scheme amendments notified in 2013 and 2014. Therefore, the amendments have been declared compatible with European regulation, specifically, the European Energy and Environmental State aid Guidelines (EEAG). On December 2015 the Government finally set the value of the GC quota for 2016 at 12.15%, the same value that was proposed by ANRE by the end of July (well below the original 17% set in the original RES Law) BRAZIL There are two types of renewable reverse auctions in Brazil: energy auctions and capacity auctions. Energy auctions result in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) being signed between generators and distributors in order to satisfy distribution companies’ demand. Capacity auctions result in long-term PPAs signed between generators and Brazil’s wholesale market operator, being the main purpose to guarantee the country’s reserve margin and grid safety. In 2015, renewables’ projects participated in four auctions. EDPR was awarded 140 MW of wind in an auction held on November 13th. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 47 EUROPEAN TRADING SYSTEM REFORM The EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) is a cornerstone of the European Union's policy to address climate change and it represents a key tool for reducing GHG emissions cost-effectively. However, the scheme has been witnessing severe challenges. To address them, the European Commission has approved a range of measures. BACKGROUND The EU's emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) was launched in 2005 to promote the reduction of GHG emissions in a costeffective and economically efficient way. It works on a “cap and trade” principle. A cap, set by the EU, is set on the total amount of certain GHG that can be emitted by the industries, power plants and other installations in the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total allowed emissions gradually decreases. Within the cap, companies receive or buy emission allowances which they can trade as needed. However, in recent years, weak demand for allowances, largely due to the economic crisis, has led to a surplus of allowances, which has depressed the carbon price. THE REFORM To address the problem, the EU Commission has introduced two mechanisms: backloading in 2014 and the Market Stability Reserve in 2015. The Backloading was implemented through an amendment to the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation which entered in force on February 2014. It has been designed as a short-term mechanism that consists on postponing the auctioning of allowances. In particular, the auction volume has been reduced by 900 million allowances (400 million in 2014, 300 million in 2015 and 200 million in 2016). By such, the backloading is aimed at rebalancing supply and demand in the short term, and reducing price variations. The Market Stability Reserve (MSR) is a long-term, structural measure approved by the European Parliament of 7 July 2015 and by the Council on 6 October 2015. The MSR aims at reducing the historical surplus of allowances and improving the resilience of the EU ETS by adjusting the supply of allowances to be auctioned. The scheme will start operating in 2019 and is expected to put Europe on the right track to achieve its ambition to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% in 2030 compared to 1990 levels. In accordance with the MSR, when in a given year the total emission allowances exceeds a certain threshold, a percentage of allowances will be automatically withdrawn from the market and placed into the reserve. In the opposite case, allowances will be returned from the reserve to the market. Under the scheme, backloaded allowances (900 million postponed allowances withdrawn from the market at least until 2019), will be placed in the reserve when in starts in 2019. Unallocated allowances from the period 20132020 will be also added in the reserve as soon as in 2020. For the period 2021-2030, market imbalances would also be addressed by a faster reduction of the annual emissions cap. The European Commission is proposing reducing the overall number of allowances by 2.2% each year compared to the current figure of 1.74%. ANNUAL REPORT 48 2015 U.S. TO CONTINUE LEADING THE WAY Growth in the US expected to add +18 GW of renewable capacity per year until 2020 to meet environmental (RPS) targets and wind energy competitiveness, according to NREL. Incentives as PTCs and the prevalence of PPAs also play a key role. Historically, the typical framework of wind development in the US has been decentralised, with no national feed-in tariff. It involves the combination of two key drivers of the top line: PTCs: production tax credits are the dominant form of wind remuneration in the US, and represent an extra source of revenue per unit of electricity ($23/MWh in 2015), over the first 10 years of the asset’s life. There are other mechanisms as well, such as ITCs, investment tax credits equal to 30% of the initial capex usable in lieu of PTCs. PPAs: long-term bilateral power purchase agreements by which a wind developer can sell its output at a fixed price, usually adjusted for inflation or a negotiated escalator. Demand for PPAs has been very strong, driven mainly by the need to meet renewable portfolio standards (RPS) targets but also from increasing improving relative competitiveness of wind energy. The PPA + PTC combination allow wind energy companies to ‘lock-in’ a return over the life of the assets. The final goals targeted by the application of this framework involve cost competiveness and affordability, security of supply and environmental concerns. LONG TERM VISIBILITY OF INCENTIVES Historically, eligibility for production tax credits incentives has been made possible for a couple of years at a time, over a limited period, without any visibility on any further extensions. After many extensions in a ‘stop and go’ approach, companies required visibility on the investment horizon for wind energy companies. The President of the US signed in December 2015 the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, which includes the extension of energy-related tax incentives for renewable energy in the country. As a result of this Act, wind energy projects that begin construction before January 1st 2020 will qualify for 10 years of Production Tax Credits (“PTC”) on the electricity output. Previous to this extension, PTCs were available for wind energy projects that had begun construction before January 1st 2015. The 5-year extension also includes a phase down according to which the PTC value shall be reduced by 20% in the case facility construction begins after December 31st, 2016, and before January 1st, 2018; by 40% if construction begins after December 31st, 2017, and before January 1st, 2019; and by 60% if construction begins after December 31st, 2018, and before January22020. Projects also have the option to choose, in lieu of the PTC, an Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) on the project cost during the same period and with the same phase down percentages. This framework provides long-term visibility and an improved environment for the development of new wind and solar projects, thus creating conditions to allow EDPR to further execute competitive projects in the US and strengthen its presence in a country that is already its main growth market. PTCs are currently crucial, but their relative importance is likely set to decrease over time. The economics of wind power in the U.S. are rapidly improving, necessitating lower and lower PPA prices, to the point where wind is competitive on its own in some areas against other traditional technologies, on a ‘new-build’ basis. The various RPS and other environmental goals will still represent a substantial incentive, PTCs notwithstanding. WIND ENERGY COMPETITIVENESS The improving wind energy economics include decreasing capex and opex per MW, and even more per MWh due to the increase in load factors via technology improvements in wind turbines and also overall excellent wind resources in the US, especially in the regions with best resource available. In the west and east states, load factors are typically within 25-30%, while in the central states those are typically of 30-45%. This naturally makes wind energy further more competitive from a fundamental standpoint, even without incentives. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 49 RPS DEMAND The renewable portfolio standards (RPS) are designed to require power suppliers to provide a minimum share of electricity from renewable sources, on a state-by-state basis. Such standards have increased and by 2015 a total of 31 states have binding RPS objectives, as shown in the table below, which excludes the 7 states with voluntary goals. Although those are implemented by states all-round the US, however a strong cluster is observed in the west/pacific cost and the north east. This typically represents 10% to 25% to be reached by 2020-25 for most states, and often foreseeing a gradual increase in the mandated percentage. Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) set penalties to utilities that do not procure a certain percentage of generation from renewable resources. Utilities can either invest directly in renewable generation assets, purchasing electricity from other renewable generators or purchase RECs. As a result, many utilities setup auction systems (RFPs) to seek long-term power purchase agreements with renewable energy generators. Due to the competitiveness of wind energy, this technology has received the largest share of awarded PPAs.

Power plants are responsible for about one-third of all US greenhouse gas emissions. This plan implies greater reliance on gas (CCGTs account for c. 40% of the planned reduction emissions), but also on alternative energy sources (c. 25% of the planned reduction emissions), and especially wind. GROWTH PROSPECTS US WIND ENERGY ADDITIONS (GW) Demand growth in the U.S. market could still be motivated by other existing forces, primarily the 13.1 planned coal capacity retirements, wind energy competitiveness as well as RPS compliance in several 9.9 states. Approximately 42 GW of coal capacity has been 8.6 8.4 announced to retire through 2020 of which we expect 6.8 wind to absorb a significant share in the replacement of such retirements. Furthermore, renewable energy 5.1 4.9 generation becomes more competitive as a direct result from coal retirement. A higher penetration of energy generated from natural gas can lead to more 1.1 flexible grids, benefitting intermittent resources such as renewables. 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Regarding RPS targets in place to encourage renewable energy demand, we estimate 22 GW of wind will need to be added until 2020 in order to fulfil compliance with targets already established. From wind energy competitiveness alone, we believe an additional 7 GW can be added. ANNUAL REPORT 50 2015 2.2. BUSINESS PLAN 2014-17 EDPR’s value creation strategic plan through 2017 remains in line with previous architecture, supported by three pillars with defined goals: Selective Growth, Increased Profitability and Self-funding Model. On May 2014, EDPR presented to the financial community its Business Plan for 2014-17 at the EDP Group Investor Day held in London, in which were present c.200 financial markets participants. Since its inception, EDPR has been performing a strategy focused on selective growth, by investing in quality projects with predictable future cash-flows, and seamless execution, supported by core competences that yield superior profitability, all embedded within a distinctive and renowned self-funding model designed to accelerate value creation. As a result of undertaking such strategy, at the same time flexible enough to accommodate to changing business and economic environments, EDPR remains today a global leading company in the renewable energy industry. As of today, EDPR is successfully executing its strategic agenda creating solid foundations to outperform its 2014-17 goals.

SELECTIVE GROWTH The selective growth strategic pillar is the guiding principle behind EDPR’s investment selection process, it ensures that the projects that are finally built have the best fit with the Company’s low risk profile at superior profitability. This strategy can be seen in the 2014-17 Business Plan growth options, as projects have been selected according to two key guidelines: 1) Low risk profile New capacity benefits from long-term PPAs already awarded or under stable regulatory frameworks. This guarantees high visibility of the project’s future cash-flows, reducing risk and locking-in project profitability. 2) High operational performance – The projects selected exhibit strong operating metrics, namely above portfolio average load factors. This improves project competitiveness and drives higher profitability. EDPR is well on track to deliver on its business plan target growth of +2 GW (>500 MW/year). EDPR’s Extensive pipeline has been an important contributing factor to the successful execution of this strategy. The availability of multiple projects coupled with strong development expertise guarantees that only the best, fully optimized, projects are finally selected for investment. 60% GROWTH FROM US, DRIVEN BY PPAS ALREADY SIGNED The United States is EDPR main growth driver for the 2014-17 Business Plan timeframe. The PTC tax benefit scheme, strong demand for long-term PPAs from wind energy projects, combined with EDPR’s deep portfolio of projects in this market support this solid growth opportunity. Additionally, self-funding is available through tax equity partnerships with the possibility of asset rotation transactions as well, given the strong interest from infrastructure and pension funds for equity stakes. The December 2015 extension of the Production Tax Credit, that includes a gradual phase down of the PTC value for projects that start construction before 2020, provides further long-term visibility and an improved environment for the development of new wind energy projects. This extension provides visibility to US growth beyond the 2014-17 timeframe, further strengthens the strong fundamental of the US wind market, and support EDPR’s choice to shift growth to the US. Project economics on all of the new investments in the US are strong, with average load factors of about 43%, earning average PPA prices in the first year of $48/MWh, leading to double-digit IRR percentages. 20% GROWTH FROM EUROPE, FOCUSING ON LOW RISK FRAMEWORKS Certain European markets continue to provide good growth opportunities supported by regulatory frameworks that provide a low risk environment. France’s existing feed-in tariff regime provides a stable growth opportunity in Europe. For the 2014-17 Business Plan EDPR targets additions of 60-70 MW through pipeline development, having already installed 42 MW by December 2015. In Italy, EDPR has installed the 30 MW awarded in 2013, and intends to participate in future energy auctions to generate new possible additions. In Poland, EDPR has already installed 99 MW in 2014 and 2015 under the current Green Certificate regime, whilst further growth remains contingent to the approval of a new energy law, expected to be based in energy auctions, where EDPR maintains competitive projects in pipeline. Finally, in Portugal, the total capacity awarded back in 2006 to the ENEOP consortium has been fully installed, the consequent asset splitting executed, and EDPR now fully consolidates 613 MW. 20% FROM SELECTED EMERGING MARKETS, IN PROJECTS WITH LONG-TERM PPAS In Brazil, EDPR will install in 2015-17 the projects with PPA awarded in 2011 and 2013 for a total 236 MW, thus representing a significant increase in capacity from current portfolio of 84 MW. In 2014 EDPR has entered the Mexican energy market signing a long-term electricity supply agreement, for the energy of a 200 MW wind farm to be installed in 2016, representing a sizeable entry into a low risk and attractive market. Mexico is as a country with great potential for wind energy and this entry can provide a solid platform for further growth in this market. Additionally, EDPR is to remain actively prospecting opportunities in new markets with strong fundamentals, namely high growth of electricity demand, robust renewable resources and availability of long-term energy supply agreements awarded through competitive schemes.

They ensure that a project’s energy is sold at a pre-determined price for long time period, generally between 15-20 years. This shields EDPR from any volatility in energy market price, locking-in project profitability. Since 2013 EDPR has signed 1.8 GW in long-term sale agreements providing full visibility to its growth target in US for 2014-17 and to the profitability of our existing fleet with 0.3 GW of new PPAs for operational projects. During 2015 EDPR successfully signed two additional PPA for 200 MW of new capacity, relating to wind farms in Texas and Ohio, to be installed in 2016. These two agreements that were signed with commercial and industrial corporations, one of which Amazon Web Services Inc., are a clear sign of the growing demand for green affordable energy from corporate players. Previously the demand for PPAs came only from traditional utilities, however recently the direct procurement from corporations has increased substantially, adding new demand for EDPR US wind and solar projects. These long term sale agreements demonstrate not just EDPR’s skill in closing commercial deals but foremost the company’s strong ability to position effectively a pipeline of quality projects, in suitable locations and stages of development as a key success factor to capture growth opportunities on-time. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 53 2.2.2. INCREASED PROFITABILITY One of the strategic pillars and that has always been a keystone of the company, setting it apart in the industry, is the drive to maximize the operational performance of its wind farms and solar plants. In this area, EDPR’s teams, namely in operations and maintenance, have established a strong track record that support challenging targets set in the 2014-17 Business Plan. For this period, EDPR has set targets for three key metrics: Availability, Load Factor and Opex/MW. These three metrics provide an overall view of the progress in our operations and maintenance, wind assessment and cost control efforts. They also serve as good indicators for the overall operational efficiency of the company. MAINTAINING HIGH LEVELS OF AVAILABILITY >97.5% Availability measures the percentage of time the fleet is fully operational. If an equipment has a 97.5% availability metric this means that, in a given period, it was available to generate energy 97.5% of the time, which leaves only 2.5% for preventative maintenance or repairs. Availability is a clear indicator of performance of the company’s operations and maintenance practices as it focuses on reducing to a minimum any malfunctions and performing maintenance activities in the shortest possible timeframe. The company always maintained high levels of availability and has registered availability of above 97.6% in 2015, in line with its 2014-17 Business Plan target. EDPR will continue to look for further increases in availability through new predictive maintenance optimization measures supported by the 24/7 control and dispatch centre, in reducing damages most common during extreme weather and improving the scheduling of planned stops. Also a new spare parts warehousing strategy will be key in reducing downtime during unexpected repairs. LEVERAGING QUALITY GROWTH ON DISTINCTIVE WIND ASSESSMENT TOWARD 31.5% LOAD FACTOR Load factor (or net capacity factor) measures the speed and quality of the renewable resource at the wind turbines or solar panels. A load factor of 31.5% means the percentage of maximum theoretical energy output with an equipment working at full capacity, in a given period. For example, for 1MW over a year, it equals to the production of 2.759,4 MWh (31.5% x 1 MW x 24 hours x 365 days). OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE TARGETS BP 14-17 OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE TARGETS >97.5% 31.5% -2% BP 14-17 Availability >97.5% Load 31.5% factor CAGR OPEX/MW -2% Availability Load factor CAGR OPEX/MW EXECUTION 14-15 ON TRACK TO DELIVER ON TARGETS ON TRACK TO DELIVER ON TARGETS EXECUTION • 29% Load Factor 29%inLoad weak wind Factor 15 (below • 97.6% Availability weak wind in 15 (below • -2% Opex/MW 14-15 97.6% Availability P50).

With regards to the operating portfolio, optimizing load factor is linked to improving availability as described and, if possible, introducing productivity enhancement retrofits that boost production by setting older equipment models with the most up-to-date technological improvements available to increase efficiency in the utilization of renewable resources available. With regards to wind farms and solar plants under development, maximizing load factor is mostly the expert work of energy assessment and engineering teams, designing an optimal layout of the plant, by fitting the positioning and choice among different equipment models with the characteristics of the site, specially the terrain, from the collected resource measurements and their estimated energy outputs. The company has consistently maintained levels of load factor in the range of 29-30%, having registered 29.2% in 2015, which is slightly below the 29.4% P50 (mean probability) assessment for the current fleet, and has set a target of 31.5% until the end of the 2014-17 period. INCREASING TURBINE PRODUCTION EDPR is also creating value by improving its assets implementing new technologies on the turbines to boost the power output without requiring major component changes. EDPR’s Performance Analysis teams are collaborating with the manufacturers to determine the best practices to apply this new technology. By monitoring real-time conditions, the rotational speed of the generator can be increased while staying within the existing loads envelope, thus increasing the power output. The extra output increases the revenues of the wind farm, without major investments needed. This technology has successfully being applied on many turbines and it will keep being developed in the following years. INCREASING EFFICIENCY, REDUCING OPEX/MW -2% In addition to all company initiatives to boost production, EDPR also focuses on strict cost control efforts to improve efficiency and gain additional profitability. Leveraging on the experience accumulated over time, we set a target in the 2014-17 Bussiness Plan to reduce Opex/MW by -2% CAGR 20132017. Despite the natural aging of its installed asset base, the company is on track to achieve this objective, with a registered reduction on OPEX of -2% CAGR 2013-15. A strict control over costs has been applied to reduce the manageable company costs structure, also benefiting from the economies of scale of a growing company. With regards to O&M, representing c. 30% of total Opex, EDPR has already delivered results form the implementation of its M3 system and selfperform program to some of the wind farms that are no longer subject to initial warranty contracts. M3 PROGRAM AND SELF-PERFORMANCE “M3” “M3” EDPR 3rd parties OEM11 As EDPR’s fleet becomes more mature the initial Modular Maintenance Model Modular Maintenance Model EDPR 3rd parties OEM Operations and Maintenance (O&M) contracts signed with the turbine suppliers expire. When that happens the company needs to decide between renewing the Maintenance management maintenance service with the OEM or insourcing Maintenance management activities to operate the wind farm on its own, whilst maintaining high levels of availability. Day-to-day work execution Day-to-day work execution The M3 (Modular Maintenance Model) program is our solution. Based on EDPR’s expertise, our O&M teams will decide on the optimal balance between external Logistics for regular spare contractors and in-house maintenance. Usually, EDPR Logistics for regular spare parts parts keeps control of high value-added activities such as maintenance planning, logistics and remote operations while outsourcing, under direct supervision, laborLarge correctives Large correctives intensive tasks. This strategy resulted in estimated savings of around 20% in the wind farms where the M3 system was Technological support Technological support implemented, which account for 40% of Europe’s fleet. In the US, during 2014 we expanded the M3 model to a 1 Original Equipment Manufacturers pilot self-perform program in the Blue Canyon V wind 1 Original Equipment Manufacturers farm. After a market review and a bottom-up analysis, we identified potential savings by fully insourcing O&M activities, given the in-house capabilities developed over the last years. This new program immediately showed savings in operational expenses and increased control over quality. During 2015 self-perform maintenance was implemented in additional facilities whose maintenance contracts were up for renewal. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 55 2.2.3. SELF-FUNDING MODEL EDPR self-funding model has been a cornerstone of EDPR strategy and its success has been crucial for funding growth. The self-funding model relies on a combination of cash-flow from operating assets, external funds from tax equity and other structured project finances as well as proceeds from asset rotation transactions to finance the profitable growth of the business. This model substitutes the previous financing strategy that depended on corporate debt from EDPR’s majority shareholder EDP. OPERATING CASH-FLOW The primary source of funds for the company is the operating cash flow generated from the existing assets, which is firstly used to pay for the debt service and capital distributions to equity partners, while the excess is available to pay dividends to the shareholders of EDPR or to fund new investments. A strong operating cash-flow generation of about € 3.5 billion is expected for the period 2014-17. EDPR has indicated a dividend pay-out ratio policy in the range of 25-35% of its annual net profit, thus allowing that most of the cash-flow available to fund growth. The dividends paid in 2015 amounted to about € 35 million corresponding to the low end of the range relative to the net profit of the previous year, representing only a small share of the available cash-flow generated in the period. US TAX EQUITY AND OTHER PROJECT FINANCE STRUCTURES EDPR always aims to find external financing to its projects, namely through tax equity structures, typical of the US, and through other project finance structures, available in other geographies. The use of such structures fit in the self-funding model because they substitute the need of corporate debt. Moreover, the case of tax equity in the US also enables an efficient utilization of the tax benefits provided by the project thus improving its economics. In a simple view, under the tax equity partnerships, tax equity investors contribute a sizable part of the initial project investment, receiving in return almost all of the PTCs granted to the project for first ten years of operation. In the case of project finance, it is also a means to contract long-term debt in local currency at competitive costs in order to mitigate the refinancing risk and to reduce the foreign exchange risk by having a natural hedge between revenues and expenses. In 2015 EDPR signed three tax equity transactions relating to the total 398 MW capacity added in the US this year, and corresponding to tax equity financing proceeds of US$ 473 million. These transactions bring total tax equity financing proceeds ever raised by EDPR up from US$ 3.1 billion.

This project is a good example of the benefits of using project finance as it provides competitive financing from the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) as well as a natural hedging for currency volatility in the Brazilian real. ANNUAL REPORT 56 2015 ASSET ROTATION Proceeds from asset rotation transactions are also important sources of funds for the self-funding model of EDPR in financing the profitable growth of the business. Such model enables the company to advance the value yet to be realized from the future cash-flows of its existing projects over their long remaining lifetime, and reinvest the corresponding proceeds in the development of new value accretive projects, with superior returns to the costs of the asset rotation proceeds themselves. These transactions involve the company selling minority stakes at the level of the projects (typically of 49%), and still maintaining full management control over these projects. Moreover, the scope of projects for these transactions tend to be mature projects, generally already operating and thus significantly de-risked, with high visibility of future cash-flows, that can be attractive to low risk institutional investors from whom EDPR can then source a competitive cost of finance. In 2015, two transactions were signed in the United States. The first transaction includes the sale of 49% of EDPR’s Lone Valley, 30 MW, solar PV plant to an infrastructure fund. This transaction was completed at a competitive multiple and is EDPR’s first asset rotation transaction involving non-wind assets. The second, the Company’s second largest to date, involves the sale of 34% of a portfolio of operating and under construction wind farms amounting to 1,002 MW in the US. The completion of these two transactions brings the total asset rotation proceeds for 2014 and 2015 to € 800 million, having clearly surpassed EDPR’s Business Plan target of € 700 million. The early completion of this target is a clear indicator of the quality of the company’s installed asset base that has attracted the interest of many institutional investors. During 2015, significant progress was also made with regards to the CTG strategic partnership. Under this agreement EDPR will sell 49% of Polish and Italian assets totalling 598 MW. The transaction scope covers 392 MW in operation in Poland and 100 MW in Italy with an average age of 4 years, as well as 107 MW under construction in Poland and Italy. This transaction adds to the Brazil and Portugal transactions signed with CTG in 2014 and 2012 respectively, as well as the MoU relating to the future sale of 49% stake in the ENEOP consortium signed in December 2013. For the record, the referred strategic partnership between EDP (EDPR’s main shareholder) and CTG was established at the end of 2011 and entered into force in May 2012, foreseeing a total € 2 billion investment by CTG until 2015 (including co-funding capex) in operating and ready-to-build renewable energy generation projects, that may include wind energy assets from EDPR and, as after agreed, selected hydro power plants from other EDP business units.

RISK MANAGEMENT In line with EDPR’s controlled risk profile, Risk Management process defines the mechanisms for evaluation and management of risks and opportunities impacting the business, increasing the likelihood of the company achieving its financial targets, while minimizing fluctuations of results without compromising returns. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS EDPR’s Risk Management Process is an integrated and transversal management model that ensures the implementation of best practices of Corporate Governance and transparency. This process is closely followed and supervised by the Audit and Control Committee, an independent supervisory body composed of non-executive members. The purpose of the Risk Management process is to ensure the alignment of EDPR’s risk exposure with the company’s desired risk profile. Risk management policies are aimed to mitigate risks, without ignoring potential opportunities, thus, optimizing return versus risk exposure. Risk management is endorsed by the Executive Committee, supported by the Risk Committee and implemented in day-to-day decisions by all managers of the company. It is supported by three distinct organizational functions: RISK PROFILER: Responsible for identification and analyses of risks, defining policies and limits for risk management within the company; RISK MANAGER: Responsible for day to day operational decisions and for implementing approved risk policies; RISK CONTROLLER: Responsible for follow up of the result of risk taking decisions and for verification of alignment of operations with general policy approved by the Executive Committee. EDPR created three distinct meetings of the Risk Committee in order to separate discussions on execution of mitigation strategies from those on the definition of new policies: RESTRICTED RISK COMMITTEE: Held every month, it is mainly focused on development risk and market risk from electricity price. It is the forum to discuss the execution of mitigation strategies to reduce merchant exposure. Its purpose is also to control the limits of defined risk policies, with regards to counterparty risk, operational risk and country risk. FINANCIAL RISK COMMITTEE: Held every quarter, it is held to review main financial risks and discuss the execution of mitigation strategies. Exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk from financial counterparties are most relevant risk reviewed in this committee. RISK COMMITTEE: Held every quarter, it is the forum where new strategic analyses are discussed and new policies are proposed for approval to the Executive Committee. Additionally, EDPR’s overall risk position is reviewed, together with EBITDA@Risk and Net Income@Risk. RISK MAP AT EDPR Risk Management at EDPR is focused on covering all market, credit and operational risks of the company. In order to have a holistic view of risks, they are classified in Risk Areas, covering the entire business cycle of EDPR, and in Risk Categories, following a generalized classification of risks. Risk Areas are Countries & regulations, Revenues, Financing, Wind turbine contracts, Pipeline development, and Operations.

ANNUAL REPORT 60 2015 EDPR RISK MATRIX BY RISK GROUP FOCUS ON COUNTRY RISK AT EDPR WHAT IS COUNTRY RISK? Country Risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of a financial loss in a given country due to macroeconomics, political/social issues, natural disasters or legislative decisions. SOURCES OF COUNTRY RISK Economic: Risks from the country’s economic evolution, affecting revenues or costs of the investments. It can be divided in macroeconomics (the conditions of domestic economy) and external sector (international transactions between the country and the rest of the world). Political and social: Includes all possible damaging actions or factors for the business of foreign firms that emanate from any political authority, governmental body or social group in the host country (i.e. war, civil disturbances, etc.). Natural disasters:Natural phenomena (i.e. seismicity, weather) that may impact negatively in the business conditions. METHODOLOGY FOR COUNTRY RISK ASSESSMENT AT EDPR Country Risk Assessment is based on an external assessment consensus of country risk and an internal assessment performed by EDPR, which is used to identify the specific source of risk in order to apply potential mitigation strategies. External Assessment: Internal Assessment: It is the consensus from third parties It is an internal estimate of country risk assessments which allows to differentiate the specific source of risk ECAs Economic sector Private consultants Macroeconomics External sector Credit rating agencies Political Risk Market indexes. Natural Disaster USE OF COUNTRY RISK Country Risk of EDPR’s geographies is monthly monitored and is considered for new investment decisions ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 61 index 3. EXECUTION 65 3.1.

When adding the over 1 TWh produced from our equity projects, enough clean energy was produced 1% 1% to serve 44% of the electricity demand of Portugal. 52% 52% The 8% year-on-year increase in the electricity output benefited from the capacity additions over the last 12 months and ENEOP consolidation. 13% Due to a lower wind resource, EDPR achieved a 29% load factor during 15% 8% 2015, which compares with a 30% load factor achieved in 2014. 9% 26% 23% EDPR also achieved a stellar 98% availability. The company continues to leverage on its competitive advantages to maximize wind farm output FY14 FY15 and on its diversified portfolio to minimize the wind volatility risk. ES PT RoE NA BR PREMIUM PERFORMANCE AND DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO DELIVERS BALANCED OUTPUT EDPR’s operations in North America were the main driver for the electricity production growth in 2015, increasing by +9% YoY to 11.1 TWh and represented 52% of the total output (stable year-on-year). This 33% 32% performance was driven by EDPR’s unique ability to capture the wind resource available along with the contribution from new additions. EDPR achieved a 32% load factor in North America, -1pp vs. 2014. 30% 29% Production growth in Europe was mainly due to reaping the benefits from the installed capacity in 2014, which help offset the decline in year on year 27% load factor. All countries deliver positive growth except for Spain where 26% 2014 was considered an outstanding year in terms of wind resource. Spain (-2pp) and Portugal (-3pp) capacity factors were lower YoY, although the efficiency achieved was in line normal expectations. FY14 FY15 Moreover, EDPR delivered once again a solid premium over the Spanish market average load factor (+2pp). NA EDPR EU The Rest of Europe operations delivered a 27% load factor (24% in 2014) and posted higher year on year generation. Poland and Romania lead the increase in production with +572 GWh YoY as new capacity and a solid resource contributed to the strong performance. Higher production in Italy (+44 GWh) and France (+90 GWh) was due to a mix of new capacity and stronger wind resource. The remaining countries delivered stable growth of 23 GWh. In 2015, EDPR's output in Brazil decreased 6% YoY to 222 GWh, as a result of a weaker wind resource during the year, and led to a lower load factor of 30% (-2pp). CARBON FREE ENERGY The 21.4 TWh of electricity produced by EDPR has zero carbon emissions, thus contributing to the world’s fight against climate change. Based on each countries’ thermal emission factors, an estimate of 18.7 million tons of CO2 equivalent emissions were avoided that would have otherwise been emitted by burning fossil fuels to generate the same amount of electricity in the geographies where EDPR is present. Blue Canyon Wind Farm, in USA ANNUAL REPORT 68 2015 3.1.2. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVENUES TOTALLED 1.5 BILLION EUROS AND EBITDA SUMMED 1.1 BILLION EUROS In 2015, EDPR revenues totalled 1,547 million euros, an increase of 270 million euros when compared to 2014 mainly driven by forex appreciation (+110 million euros), higher volumes (+106 million euros), higher average selling price (+28 million euros) and an update of TEI’s post-flip residual interest accretion (30 million euros). EDPR’s output in the period increased 8% and the average selling price increased by 9% as the result of higher average selling price in Europe. EBITDA increased 239 million euros year on year to 1,142 million euros, as a result of the top-line evolution and partially offset by higher Net operating costs, +31 million euros to 405 million euros. Net operating costs were positively impacted by higher Other operating income, +116 million euros, mainly explained by the gain subsequent to the control acquisition of certain assets of ENEOP, and on the other hand by higher Operating Costs. In the period, Other operating costs increased by +147 million euros, mainly due to write-off impact, following a strict focus of the development efforts in regions with sound business fundamentals, and at lesser extent to forex translation. As a result, EBITDA margin increased from 71% to 74%.

ROBUST CASH-FLOW Operating Cash-Flow reached 701 million euros and net investments reached 719 million euros, benefiting from the execution of the asset rotation strategy. In 2015, EDPR received proceeds of 395 million euros from the sale of non-controlling interests. On the back of its asset rotation strategy, was completed the settlement of Fiera Axium transaction, signed in 2014, and the financial closing of the sale of a minority interest in an operating solar PV power plant in the US. As a result, for both transactions, EDPR received a net amount of 316 million euros, considering agreed transaction values, less cash owed from the signing to the settlement dates and net of transactions costs. In 2015, also occurred the financial closing of the sale of Brazilian minority interests assets to CTG, in the context of the partnership with EDP. Capital expenditures (Capex) totalled 903 million euros reflecting the capacity additions in the year and the capacity under construction. Financial investments totalled 157 million, mainly related with settlement of ENEOP asset split, the acquisition of a 45% stake in EDPR Brasil and the acquisition of minority stakes in already controlled SPVs in Spain. As a result of forex translation (impact 130 million euros), investments done in the period, robust cash-flow generation, the execution of the asset rotation strategy and close monitoring of operating costs, Net Debt increase by 425 million euros, reflecting 3.2x Net Debt to EBITDA, versus 3.6x in 2014.

These are our internal communication channels that keep employees informed and connected every day: I N T R A N E T : Our award-winning intranet platform takes online interaction among employees to a new level, by including social media-style features and advanced customization options. It’s a place to share information, work together, and learn about the projects and news from EDPR and EDP E D P O N R E N E W M A G A Z I N E : Our print magazine has been a mainstay of EDP Group’s internal communications since 1988. The OnRenew edition, specific to EDPR, shows the company and its people through stories, opinion articles and editorials. E D P O N T V : Our TV Channel has been broadcasting on our offices and online over the past 8 years. Includes dynamic news reports and interviews on news and events. It is the medium that truly puts a face on our projects and initiatives. H R P H O N E A P P : In 2015, EDPR has created a new phone app to provide employees with news, access to selection processes or measures in a practical and simple way. This tool proves to be particularly useful to keep connected to often-travelling and geographically dispersed employees. I N T E R N A L N E W S L E T T E R S : Monthly newsletters give a broader reach to news and information regarding our projects, teams, successes, and Human Resources Phone App strategies. In addition to these communication channels, we hold companywide Annual Meetings that allow employees to streamline their long-distance communication to improve their day-to-day work, share their concerns, and get to know the business goals set by EDPR’s top management. We also hold meetings and team building events; conference calls regarding results, and a robust website that informs both internal and external stakeholders. In this sense, in 2015 we have initiated the Talking to Improve initiative, where different departments are invited to share with the CEO its surveys services results, with the internal feedback provided by other departments about the service offered, and identify areas for improvement and strengths. All of these communication efforts work to motivate employees, promote knowledge sharing and bring people together. ANNUAL REPORT 80 2015 3.2.2.

RELATÓRIO ANNUAL EREPORT CONTAS 88 88 2015 2015 3.5. INNOVATION Innovation is about new technologies for more renewable energy such as offshore wind but that is not all: it is also about attitude, looking for ongoing improvement every day at what we do. Our company has been implementing successful innovative solutions to increase the operational and economic performance of our assets for years, throughall the lifecycle of our projects: improving the design of the layouts to achieve the best wind resource, decreasing construction costs and risks and increasing the production of our operational power plants developing new technological solutions designed in-house. After great results, the innovation efforts will continue in our onshore operations, as well as EDPR’s new focus on finding feasible solutions in the offshore section of our business. To do so our company participates in two projects that focus on the foundations, one of the most important elements of the power plant. Both based in the coast of Aguçadoura (north of Portugal), thus sharing knowledge and resources, WindFloat and DEMOGRAVI3 will help to reduce costs opening new markets for the offshore wind industry. WINDFLOAT The ‘WindFloat’ project is one of the flagstaffs of the renewable R&D project list at EDP, with a deep waters offshore prototype that has reported excellent results after four years in operation under harsh conditions, having to endure waves up to 15 meters high, off the northern coast of Portugal. This is the most ambitious innovation project on floating offshore technology conducted worldwide so far, the first wind energy turbine in open waters in the Atlantic ocean, and also the first time for a triangular semisubmersible floating structure supporting a 2 MW wind turbine allowing the utilization of offshore winds with great stability at water depths below 40 meters, existing at long distances from the coast. It is the first offshore wind energy project in the world not requiring the use of any heavy offshore lifting equipment. The whole process of final assembly, installation and commissioning was performed on land, in a controlled environment. When the construction on land was completed in dry docks, the structure was towed for about 350 kilometres in the open water. The capability to undertake the towing operation under such circumstances can be attributed to the performance and stability of WindFloat. These factors also allow any ready-to-use commercial wind turbines of any manufacturer to be installed on WindFloat. The project is a partnership between EDP, Repsol, Principle Power, A. Silva Matos, Vestas and InovCapital and is also supported by the Innovation Support Fund (FAI), involving more than 60 suppliers, more than two thirds are Portuguese. After successfully finalizing the first phase of the project, next steps consists on the installation of a full scale floating wind farm of 27 MW. DEMOGRAVI3 In November 2015 EDP was granted European funding to develop new technology for offshore wind power. DEMOGRAVI3 is a project that aims to develop an innovative gravity based foundation for offshore wind turbines and will be funded by the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 programme. The consortium developing this new project will be coordinated by EDP, through EDPR. DEMOGRAVI3 will test a wind turbine with an innovative gravitational foundation made of concrete and steel. The project will last for four years, including the installation of a wind turbine taking advantage of the underwater cable connecting the WindFloat turbine to a substation on land. Unlike the solution based on a floating platform successfully tested with Windfloat, DEMOGRAVI3 will be installed on the seabed, although it will already be assembled and floated to the mooring place. The whole structure of the turbine and its constituent elements will be assembled on shore and then transported. The main innovation of this structure thus avoids the necessity for heavy lift vessels to anchor and assemble all the turbine components in an offshore environment. The project includes other technological partners such as: TYPSA, ASM Energia, Univ. Politécnica de Madrid, WavEC, Acciona Infraestructuras, Fraunhofer Gesellschaft IWES, Gavin & Doherty Geo Solutions and Global Maritime AS. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 89 index 4. SUSTAINABILITY 93 4.1.

We produce clean and EDPR Environmental green energy, energy without emissions. Our strategy towards the environment is based on four pillars: the generation of CO2-free and Policy available at water-free energy, a strategy to minimize impacts during the life-cycle of www.edprenovaveis.com our wind farms, a culture of respect for the biodiversity and a culture of a responsibility and recycling. EDPR is strongly committed to contribute to the protection of the environment and biodiversity through a proactive environmental management of its wind farms in operation, as is stated in our Environmental and Biodiversity policies. EDPR promotes biodiversity conservation and aspires to have an active role in contributing to the world’s objective of reducing biodiversity loss. Wind farms development and operation typically occurs in rural areas where wind resource is abundant and the operation of wind farms is compatible with current ecosystem. We define specific measures to monitor and promote the local fauna conservation in all our business activities as reflected in our company’s Biodiversity Policy. The operation stage of wind farms, with a useful life of 25 years, stands as the core of our business. According to this, we are really conscious of the importance of proper management of environmental matters in our facilities in operation, which is assured through the Environmental Management System (EMS). Our environmental strategy focuses on three core aspects: legal compliance, management of environmental risks and continuous improvement. Numerous environmental appraisal and monitoring procedures are incorporated in all phases of the business processes ensuring that these central pillars are enforced. For additional information on indirect economic impacts of our energy, please refer to the Business Environment Section. G4 EN3 ENERGY CONSUMPTION WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION Wind turbines require a small amount of electricity to operate. This energy consumption is generally self-consumed. Given the intermittency of wind generation we sometimes need to consume electricity from the grid. The indirect CO2 emissions related to the consumed electricity is around 0.1% of the emissions avoided by the company. 300x MWh 2015 2014 % ENERGY CONSUMPTION Wind farms: Electricity consumption (MWh) 66,602 62,153 7% EDPR produces about Offices: 300 times the electricity Electricity consumption (MWh) 4,816 3,458 39% Gas (MWh) 27 28 -2% consumed Note: Gas conversion factor: 0.2931 Kwh/m3. Calculated according to the DEFRA standard. Note 2: 2014 data has been restated, including US windfarm offices electricity consumption in offices consumption, previously included in wind farms consumption. G4 EN6 REDUCTION OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION Our activity is based on clean energy generation, and we produce about 300 times the electricity we consume. However, we are conscious about promoting a culture of rational use of resources and we promote many internal campaigns to promote sustainable behaviours as is explained in our website www.edpr.com. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 99 G4 EN8 TOTAL WATER WITHDRAWAL BY SOURCE WATER CONSUMPTION PER TECHNOLOGY Generation from wind energy does not consume water in its operational processes. The water is consumed only for human use. The consumption duvidas of water per GWh generated accounts for 0.51 litres/MWh. Even so, the company actively seeks to adopt more eco-efficient practices. An example of this is that in 2015 38 substations had rain water collection and treatment systems installed to cover their own water supply needs, 7 installed during the year.

As a result, there is a reduction in the reported emissions year on year. Note: To calculate the emissions avoidance, the energy generation has been multiplied by the CO2 eq emission factors of each country and state within the US. We considered the emission factor of just fossil fuel energy, as we considered that by increasing the generation of renewable energy, we are displacing these technologies, while other renewable technologies and nuclear plants will continue with its quota of generation. G4 EN23 TOTAL WEIGHT OF WASTE BY TYPE AND DISPOSAL METHOD The main contribution to the hazardous waste produced by wind farms is related to oil and oil-related wastes such as oil filters or oil containers, used mainly for lubrication of the turbines. The consumption of this oil is based on certain pre-defined replacement time frequencies (between 2 and 5 years, based on the component, oil type and manufacturer). During 2015, the recovery rate was 73% impacted by a significant spill with a volume of 320 liters of oil and glycol spilled. The increase in hazardous wastes is mainly due to the contamined soil. This soil was removed and fully restored. Excluding this fact the recovery rate will have been 98% what certifies that the company has been actively working to improve the recycling rate of its hazardous wastes, through authorized waste haulers. The increase shown in non-hazardous wastes is driven by metals and glassfiber from 2 nacelles burned. These metals where fully recovered. The following table summarizes the amount wastes generated per GWh in our facilities and the rate of recycling. 2015 2014 (%) WASTE GENERATED BY EDPR 1 Total waste (kg/GWh) 72.8 . 55.2 32% Total hazardous waste (kg/GWh) 32.7 . 26.2 25% % of hazardous waste recovered 73% 96% 23% The following table summarizes the amount wastes generated: 2015 2014 (%) WASTE GENERATED BY EDPR 1 Total waste (t) 1,556 1,092 42% Total hazardous wastes (t) 700 518 35% Total hazardous waste disposed (t) 186 21 785% Total hazardous waste recovered (t) 514 497 3% Total non-hazardous wastes (t) 856 574 49% Total non-hazardous waste disposed (t) 608 385 58% Total non-hazardous waste recovered (t) 248 189 31% ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 103 Annual fluctuations in hazardous waste generated are heavily dependent on the pluri-annual oil replacement programs above mentioned. Nonhazardous wastes generated by the company include metals, plastics, paper or domestic garbage which is recycled in their vast majority. Note 1: In Europe, the method of disposal has been indicated by the waste hauler, while in the US the disposal method has been determined by the organizational defaults of the waste hauler. Waste generated by EDPR does not include Brazil wind farms. Note 2: For the purposes of this report, all wastes have been classified as Hazardous or Nonhazardous according to European Waste Catalogue; however, in each country where EDPR has a geographic presence, each wind farm is required to adhere to national law by following company procedures for handling, labelling, and storage of wastes to ensure compliance. In cases, like in the United States, when our operations generate small quantities of substances which fall into additionally-regulated categories–such as used oils and universal wastes–we follow strict standards for handling and disposal of these waste types to ensure we remain compliant with all applicable laws.

In addition, the company has a Code of Ethics that contains specific clauses on the respect for human rights. In compliance with the Code, EDPR expresses its total opposition to forced or compulsory labour and recognizes that human rights should be considered fundamental and universal, based on conventions, treaties and international initiatives like the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labour Organization and the Global Compact. Our Procurement Manual also includes a chapter that guides each Purchasing Department to put these principles into practice, therefore when procuring and contracting goods and services EDPR appeals to all reasonable endeavours so that selected suppliers accept to comply with the UN Global Compact’s ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption.

ANNUAL REPORT 120 2015 4.6. EXTERNAL CHECKS 4.6.1. INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE REPORT Independent Assurance Report to the Management of EDP Renováveis, S.A. We performed a limited assurance review on the non-financial information contained in EDP Renováveis, S.A., (hereinafter EDP Renováveis) Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 (hereinafter ‘the Report’). The information reviewed corresponds specifically to the GRI indicators described in the 03 Execution and in the 04 Sustainability sections. EDP Renováveis management is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Report in accordance with the core option stated by the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, GRI G4 version, of the Global Reporting Initiative as described in the 4.6.2 section of the Report. The Report follows the Materiality Matters Check criteria, which had been confirmed by the Global Reporting Initiative. Management is also responsible for the information and assertions contained within the Report; for determining its objectives in respect of the selection and presentation of sustainable development performance, including the processes for determining the material issues and the key stakeholder groups; and for establishing and maintaining appropriate performance management and internal control systems from which the reported performance information is derived. Our responsibility is to carry out a limited assurance engagement and to express a conclusion based on the work performed. We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board and also in accordance with the guidance set out by the Instituto de Censores Jurados de Cuentas de España (ICJCE). These standards require that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material misstatement. KPMG applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the Internal Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior. Our limited assurance engagement consisted of making enquiries of management and persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures. These procedures included:  Verification of EDP Renovaveis processes for determining the material issues, and the participation of stakeholder groups therein.  Interviews with relevant staff at group level and selected business unit level concerning sustainability strategy and policies and corporate responsibility for material issues, and the implementation of these across the business.  Evaluation through interviews concerning the consistency of the description of the application of EDP Renovaveis policies and strategy on sustainability, governance, ethics and integrity.

Our multidisciplinary team included specialists in social, environmental and economic business aspects. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is lower than that of a reasonable assurance engagement. This report may not be taken as an auditor's report. Our conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this Independent Review Report. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions. Based on the limited assurance procedures performed and the evidence obtained, as described above, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the information presented in the EDP Renovaveis Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2015 is not prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines version 4.0 of the Global Reporting Initiative, as described in point G4-32 of the GRI Index, including the reliability of data, adequacy of the information presented and the absence of significant deviations and omissions.

ANNUAL REPORT 132 2015 14. DECISIONS THAT CAN ONLY BE ADOPTED BY A QUALIFIED QUORUM EDPR has approved on the last General Shareholders Meeting of April 9th 2015, a modification of the Articles of Association in order to adapt them to the changes introduced by the regulation set by the New Spanish Law, which are more favourable to the shareholders, and more protective of their position. Among others, one of such modifications was related to the qualified quorum and the reinforced majority as described below. According to EDPR’s Articles of Association and as established on the law, both ordinary and extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meetings are validly constituted when first called if the Shareholders, either present or represented by proxy, represent at least twenty five percent (25%) of the subscribed voting capital. On the second call, the General Shareholders’ Meeting will be validly constituted regardless of the amount of the capital present. To validly approve the issuance of bonds, the increase or reduction of capital, the transformation, global assignment of assets and liabilities, merger or spin-off of the Company, the transfer of the Registered Office abroad, the elimination of preemptive rights of new shares and in general any necessary amendment to the Articles of Association, in the Ordinary or Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting, it is required that on first call, the Shareholders, either present or represented by proxy, represent at least fifty percent (50%) subscribed voting capital and, on second call, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the subscribed voting capital. In relation to the quorum required to validly approve these matters, in accordance with the Law and the Articles of Association, when the shareholders attending represent more than fifty percent (50%) of the subscribed voting capital, the above mentioned resolutions will be validly adopted by absolute majority and in the case the shareholders attending represent between the twenty-five percent (25%) and the fifty percent (50%)but without reaching itthe favourable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the present or represented capital in the General Shareholders’ Meeting will be required in order to approve these resolutions. EDPR has not established any mechanism that may intend to cause mismatching between the right to receive dividends or the subscription of new securities and the voting right of each common share and has not adopted mechanisms that hinder the passing of resolutions by shareholders, including fixing a quorum for resolutions greater than that provided by the law. II. MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION A. COMPOSITION 15. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MODEL EDPR is a Spanish Company listed in a regulated stock exchange in Portugal. EDP Renováveis’ corporate organization is subject to its personal law and to the extent possible, to the recommendations contained in the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code, (“Código de Governo das Sociedades”) approved by the Comissão do Mercado de Valores Mobiliários (CMVMPortuguese Securities Market Commission-) in July 2013. This governance code is available to the public at CMVM’s website (www.cmvm.pt). The organization and functioning of EDPR corporate governance model aims to achieve the highest standards of corporate governance, business conduct and ethics referenced on the best national and international practices in corporate governance. EDPR has adopted the governance structure in effect in Spain. It comprises a General Shareholders’ Meeting and a Board of Directors that represents and manages the Company. As required by law and the Articles of Association, the Company’s Board of Directors has set up four committees. These are the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee and the Related-Party Transactions Committee. In order to ensure a better understanding of EDPR corporate governance by its shareholders, the Company posts its updated Articles of Association as well as its Committees Regulations at www.edprenovaveis.com. The governance model of EDPR was designed to ensure the transparent, meticulous separation of duties and the specialization of supervision. EDPR’ bodies for the management and supervision model are the following: General Shareholders’ Meeting Board of Directors Executive Committee Audit and Control Committee External auditor The purpose of the choice of this model is to adapt, to the extent possible, the Company’s corporate governance structure to the Portuguese legislation. The governance model adopted by EDPR therefore seeks, as far as it is compatible with its personal law, to correspond to the so-called “Anglo-Saxon” model set forth in the Portuguese Commercial Companies Code, in which the management body is the Board of Directors, and the supervision and control duties are of the responsibility of an Audit and Control Committee. The experience of institutional operating indicates that the governance model adopted by the shareholders is appropriate to the corporate organization of EDPR activity, especially because it affords transparency and a ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 133 healthy balance between the management functions of the Executive Committee, the supervisory functions of the Audit and Control Committee and oversight by different Board of Directors special committees. The institutional and functional relationship between the Executive Committee, the Audit and Control Committee and the other non-executive members of the Board of Directors has been of internal harmony conductive to the development of the Company’s business. 16. RULES FOR THE NOMINATION AND REPLACEMENT OF DIRECTORS According to Article 29.5 of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to advise and inform the Board regarding nominations (including by co-option), re-elections, dismissal and remuneration of Board Members and of its duties, as well as regarding the composition of the several Committees of the Board. The Committee also advises on the appointment, remuneration and dismissal of top management officers. The Committee proposes the nomination and re-election of the Directors and of the members of the various Committees by presenting a proposal with the names of the candidates that considers have the best qualities to fulfil the role of Board Member. The Board of Directors submit a proposal to the General Shareholders’ Meeting, which should be approved by majority for an initial period of three (3) years and may re-elect these members once or more times for further periods of three (3) years. Pursuant to Articles 23 of the Articles of Association and 243 of the Spanish Companies Law, shareholders may group their shares until constituting an amount of capital equal or higher than the result of dividing the company’s capital by the number of Directors, and in such case said shareholders are entitled to nominate a number of Directors equal to the result of the fraction using only whole amounts. Those making use of this power cannot intervene in the nomination of the other members of the Board of Directors. In case of a vacancy, pursuant to Articles 23 of the Articles of Association and 244 of the Spanish Companies Law, the Board of Directors may co-opt a shareholder, who will occupy the position until the next General Shareholders’ Meeting, to which a proposal will be submitted for the ratification of said co-option. Pursuant to Article 248 of the Spanish Companies Law, the co-option of Directors must be approved by absolute majority of the Directors at the meeting. 17. COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Pursuant to Articles 20 and 21 of the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board of Directors shall consist of no less than five (5) and no more than seventeen (17) Directors.

Within this context, it should be particularly stressed that the External Auditor’ independence was safeguarded by the implementation of the Company’s policy for the pre-approval of the services to be hired to External Auditors (or any entity in a holding relationship with or incorporating the same network as the External ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 143 Auditors), which results from the application of the rules issued by SEC on this matter. According to such policy, the Audit and Control Committee makes an overall pre-approval of the services proposal made by the External Auditors and a specific pre-approval of other services that will eventually be provided by the External Auditors, particularly tax consultancy services and services other than “audit and audit related” services. IV-V. STATUTORY AND EXTERNAL AUDITORS 39-41. According to the Spanish law, the External Auditor (“Auditor de Cuentas”) is nominated by the General Shareholders’ Meeting and corresponds to the statutory auditor body (“Revisor Oficial de Contas”) described on the Portuguese Law. Consequently, the information regarding points 39 to 41 is available on chapter V of the report, points 42 to 47. 42. EXTERNAL AUDITOR IDENTIFICATION The External Auditor is, since 2007, KPMG Auditores S.L., a Spanish Company, whose partner in charge of EDPR accounts auditing is, currently and since January 2014, Estibaliz Bilbao. KPMG Auditores S.L. is registered at the Spanish Official Register of Auditors under number S0702 and with Tax Identification Number B78510153. 43. NUMBER OF YEARS OF THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR KPMG Auditores S.L. is in charge of EDPR’s accounts auditing having carried these duties during eight consecutive years from the date EDPR became Public Interest Entity. 44. ROTATION POLICY According to CMVM’s Recommendation IV.3 of its 2013 Corporate Governance Code, the companies shall rotate the auditor after two or three terms whether they are of four or three years, respectively, being the maximum nine years. On the other hand, according to the personal Law of EDPR -the Spanish Law-, recently amended in October 2015, the maximum term for an auditing firm is established in a 10 year term, from the date the company is declared a “Public Interest Entity”. In the case of EDPR, this date when the IPO was launched is 2008. On of December 31st, 2015, KPMG Auditores S.L. has ended its eighth (8th) consecutive year as EDPR’s External Auditor from the date that it became Public Interest Entity. The Company is compliant with Recommendation IV.3 of the Portuguese Corporate Governance Code and also with its personal Law. 45. EXTERNAL AUDITOR EVALUATION The Audit and Control Committee is responsible for the evaluation of the External Auditor according to the competences granted by its Regulations. The evaluation of the Audit and Control Committee is made once a year. The Audit and Control Committee acts as the company speaker for the relevant matters with the External Auditor and establishes a permanent contact throughout the year to assure the conditions, including the independence, adequate to the services provided by them related to the auditing process, and receiving and maintaining information on any other questions regarding accounting subjects. In 2015, according to the Audit and Control Committee’s competences and in line with Recommendations II.2.2, it was the first and direct recipient and the corporate body in charge of the permanent contact with the external auditor on matters that may pose a risk to their independence and any other matters related to the auditing of accounts. It also receives and stores information on any other matters provided for in legislation on audits and in auditing standards in effect at any time. The External Auditor within the scope of its duties, verified the implementation of the remuneration policies and systems of the corporate bodies as well as the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal control mechanisms and report any shortcomings to the supervisory body of the Company. 46. NON-AUDIT SERVICES CARRIED OUT BY THE EXTERNAL AUDITOR According to the rules described on topic 29 of this Report, in EDPR there is a policy of pre-approval by the Audit and Control Committee for the selection non-audit services according to Article 8.2, b) of the Audit and Control Committee Regulations. Below are the details of non-audit services provided during 2015 by the External Auditor for EDPR’s business units: KPMG's assistance in the process of IRS tax examination and Tax Equity investments. Tax services to prepare technical memos on PTC qualification for different wind farms. KPMG's assistance in divestment and acquisition structures and financial restructurings. KPMG was engaged to provide the above mentioned services due to it’s in depth knowledge of the Group’s activities and tax related matters. These engagements did not risk the independence of the External Auditor and were pre-approved by the Audit and Control Committee prior to rendering the services. ANNUAL REPORT 144 2015 47.

INTERNAL ORGANISATION I. ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION 48. AMENDMENTS TO THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION Amendments to the Articles of Association of the Company are of the responsibility of the General Shareholders’ Meeting who has the power to decide on this matter. According to Article 17 of the Company’s Articles of Association (“Constitution of the General Shareholders’ Meeting, Adoption of resolutions”), to validly approve any necessary amendment to the Articles of Association, the Ordinary or Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting will need: On first call, that the Shareholders either present or represented by proxy, represent at least fifty percent (50%) of the subscribed voting capital. On second call, that the Shareholders either present or represented by proxy, represent at least twenty five percent (25%) of the subscribed voting capital. In the event that the shareholders attending represent more than fifty percent (50%) of the subscribed voting capital, the resolutions referred to in the present paragraph will only be validly adopted with absolute majority. If the shareholders attending represent between the twenty-five percent (25%) and the fifty percent (50% -but without reaching itthe favourable vote of two-thirds (2/3) of the present or represented capital in the General Shareholders’ Meeting will be required in order to approve these resolutions. Accordingly with theentering into force of the new wording of the Spanish Companies Law (“Ley de Sociedades de Capital”), Ley 31/2014, EDPR made the necessary amendments to the Articles of Association to adapt them to the Law. The modifications introduced were approved on the last General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 9th 2015. II. REPORTING OF IRREGULARITIES 49. IRREGULARITIES COMMUNICATION CHANNELS WHISTLEBLOWING EDPR has always carried out its activity by consistently implementing measures to ensure the good governance of its companies, including the prevention of incorrect practices, particularly in the areas of accounting and finance. EDPR provides the Group workers with a channel enabling them to report directly and confidentially to the Audit and Control Committee any practice presumed illicit or any alleged accounting and/or financial irregularity in their Company, in compliance with the provisions of CMVM Regulation no. 4/2013. With this channel for reporting irregular accounting and financial practices, EDPR aims to: Guarantee conditions that allow workers to freely report any concerns they may have in these areas to the Audit and Control Committee; Facilitate the early detection of irregular situations, which, if practiced, might cause serious damage to the EDPR Group, its workers, customers, and shareholders. Contact with the Company’s Audit and Control Committee is only possible by email and post, and access to information received is restricted. Any complaint addressed to the Audit and Control Committee will be kept strictly confidential and the whistleblower will remain anonymous, provided that this does not prevent the investigation of the complaint. She/he will be assured that the Company will not take any retaliatory or disciplinary action as a result of exercising his/her right to blow the whistle on irregularities, provide information, or assist in an investigation. The Secretary of the Audit and Control Committee receives all the communications and presents a quarterly report to the members of the Committee. In 2015 there were no communications regarding any irregularity at EDPR. ETHICS CHANNEL AND CODE OF ETHICS EDPR has a Code of Ethics published on its intranet and its website, which includes principles like transparency, honesty, integrity, non-discrimination, equal opportunity, and sustainability. The Code of Ethics has been widely circulated among employees of the Group through internal communications mechanisms, individual shipments, delivery to new employees, and intranet publishing. On February 2014, the Board of Directors approved an updated version of the Code of Ethics. There is a strong commitment by the Company in relation to the dissemination and promotion of compliance with the Code available to all employees through training, questionnaires, and open discussions of the findings. There is also an Ethics Channel and Ethics Regulation to articulate any specific claims of the Code of Ethics and to resolve doubts on all matters relating to the Code of Ethics. ANNUAL REPORT 146 2015 Communications regarding possible breaches of the Code of Ethics are sent to the Ethics Ombudsman, who performs a first analysis, forwarding its conclusion to the Ethics Committee of EDPR, which receives, records, processes, and reports it to the Board of Directors. In 2015 there were no communications to the Ethics Ombudsmen regarding any irregularity at EDPR. The Ethics Code is available at our website www.edprenovaveis.com ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICY In order to ensure compliance with the standards of Anti-Corruption Regulation in every geography where EDPR operates, the Company developed in 2014 an Anti-Bribery Policy of application to all EDPR Group, which was approved by its Board of Directors on December 19th, 2014. This Anti-Corruption Policy implies a series of new procedures regarding the relationships of EDPR employees with external parties, namely the approval of certain actions regarding hospitality to and from external parties, charitable donations, and sponsorships. This Policy was implemented in the Group in 2015, through the introduction of several approval systems in the corporate’s employee channels in order to ensure transparency and prevent any corrupt business practice, and was communicated to all EDPR employees. Once this implementation was finished, the corresponding training sessions were organized for part of our employees, and also made available in the intranet, in order to ensure appropriate knowledge and understanding of the Policy. The Anti-Corruption Policy is available at our website www.edprenovaveis.com III. INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT 50. INTERNAL AUDIT EDPR Internal Audit Department is composed by seven people. The function of EDPR’s Internal Audit is to carry out an objective and independent assessment of the Group’s activities and of its internal control situation, in order to make recommendations to improve the internal control mechanisms over systems and management processes in accordance with the Group’s objectives. Additionally, EDPR has a Responsibilities Model and a SCIRF Manual (Internal Control System over Financial Reporting), in which individuals, governing bodies and committees responsible for implementing and managing the internal control system are indicated. The Responsibilities Model includes the functions and main activities in the management and maintenance of the system at all levels of the organization including monitoring activities related to the annual cycle, the implementation of controls and documentation of evidence and supervision activities. The SCIRF Manual incorporates the general principles of the Internal Control System over Financial Reporting as well as the methodology used, the procedures for ensuring the effectiveness of internal control and design of models, documentation, evaluation and reporting. In line with the general principles of the model adopted by EDPR for the management of the SCIRF, the COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework 2013 (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission), the responsibility for supervising the Internal Control System lies in the Board of Directors and the Audit and Control Committee. The CEO is accountable before the Board, must ensure the proper functioning and effectiveness of the SCIRF, promoting its design, implementation and maintenance. The Executive Committee must support the CEO in this task, guiding the development of the Entity Level Controls of the Company and the controls in their areas of responsibility, relying when necessary on other levels of the organization. Also, the Senior Managers are responsible for evaluating any deficiencies and implementing appropriate improvement opportunities. To fulfil these responsibilities, EDPR’s Internal Audit offers support and advice to the management and BOARD OF DIRECTORS development of the SCIRF. 51. ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF INTERNAL AUDIT EXECUTIVE AUDIT AND CONTROL The Internal Audit function in EDPR Group is a COMMITTEE COMMITTEE corporate function carried out by the Internal Audit Department, that reports both to the Chairman of EDPR’s Executive Committee and to EDPR’s Audit and Control Committee. INTERNAL AUDIT 52. RISK MANAGEMENT EDPR’s Risk Management is as an integrating element of all organizational processes and decisions and not a stand-alone activity separated from the main activities of the company. It includes from strategic planning to evaluation of new investments and contracts. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 147 Risk Management at EDPR is supported by three distinct organizational functions, each one with a different role: Strategy (Risk Profiler), Management (Risk Manager) and Controlling (Risk Controller). Market, credit and operational risks are identified and assessed and, following the result of the assessment, Risk Policies are defined and implemented across the company. These policies are aimed to mitigate risks without compromising potential opportunities, thus, optimizing return versus risk exposure. During 2015, EDPR defined or reviewed four Global Risk Policies: Energy Hedging Policy, Counterparty Risk Policy, Operational Risk Policy and Country Risk Policy. These policies are already implemented. 53. RISK MAP RISK AREA RISK GROUP RISK CATEGORY Risk Management at EDPR is ||| Country Risk STRATEGIC focused on covering all risks of COUNTRIES & ||| Competitive Landscape Risk the company. In order to have a REGULATIONS ||| Regulatory Risk (renewables) holistic view of risks, they are grouped in Risk Areas, covering BUSINESS ||| Energy Production Risk the entire business cycle of EDPR, ||| Equipment Performance Risk and in Risk Categories, following a REVENUES ||| Electricity Price Risk standard classification of risks. ||| Commodity Price Risk Risk Areas are Countries & regulations, Revenues, Financing, ||| Interest Rate Risk MARKET Wind turbine contracts, Pipeline ||| Exchange Rate Risk development, and Operations. ||| Inflation Risk Within each Risk Area, risks are FINANCING ||| Liquidity Risk classified in Risk Groups. ||| Counterparty Credit Risk ||| Counterparty Operational Risk COUNTERPARTY Risk Categories are Market, ||| Investments Decisions Criteria Risk Counterparty, Operational, Business and Strategic. Each Risk STRATEGIC Group can also be classified into a ||| Technology Disruptions Risk Risk Category. Thus, for each Risk TURBINES ||| Wind Turbine Price Risk CONTRACTS Group there is a corresponding ||| Wind Turbine Supply Risk BUSINESS Risk Area and Risk Category. PIPELINE ||| Execution Risk DEVELOPMENT ||| Development Risk The definition of Risk Categories at EDPR is as follows: OPERATIONAL ||| Physical Risk 1. Market Risk It refers to the ||| Information Technologies Risk risk to an institution resulting ||| Legal Claims Risk from movements in market prices, OPERATIONS ||| Personnel Risk in particular, changes in electricity ||| Processes Risk prices, interest rates, foreign ||| Reputational Risk STRATEGIC exchange rates and other commodity prices. 2.Counterparty Risk (credit and operational) Risk that counterparty to a transaction could default before final settlement of the transaction’s cash flows. A direct economic loss would occur if transactions with the counterparty had positive economic value at the time of default. Even in the case of not defaulting, it may not comply with its contract obligations (timing, quality, etc.), implying additional higher costs due to its replacement or to delays in fulfilling the contract 3. Operational Risk (other than counterparty) – Defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events (other than counterparty). 4. Business Risk Potential loss in the company’s earnings due to adverse changes in business volume, margins or both. Such losses can result above all from a serious deterioration of the weather conditions, or changes in the regulatory environment. Changes in electricity prices are considered a market risk. 5. Strategic Risk It refers to risks coming from macroeconomic, political or social situation in countries where EDPR is present, as well as those coming from a change in the competitive landscape, from technology disruptions, from investment decisions criteria or from reputational issues. 1. Market Risk 1. i) Electricity price risk EDPR faces limited electricity price risk as it pursues a strategy of being present in countries or regions with long term visibility on revenues. In most countries where EDPR is present, prices are determined through regulated framework mechanisms. In those countries with no regulated tariffs, power purchase agreements are negotiated with different offtakers to eliminate electricity and Green Certificate or REC price risks. ANNUAL REPORT 148 2015 Despite EDPR’s strategy of eliminating market price risk, EDPR still has some wind farms with merchant exposure. In Europe, EDPR operates in countries where the selling price is defined by a feed-in-tariff (Portugal, France and Italy) or in markets where, on top of the electricity price, EDPR receives either a pre-defined regulated premium or a green certificate, whose price is achieved on a regulated market (Spain, Belgium, Poland and Romania). EDPR is also developing investment activity in the UK, where current incentive system is based on green certificates but will change to a feed in tariff. In countries with a pre-defined regulated premium or a green certificate scheme, EDPR is exposed to electricity price fluctuations. Considering current PPAs in place, EDPR is exposed to electricity price risk in Romania, in Poland and partially in Spain. Additionally, in European countries with a green certificate scheme (Romania and Poland), EDPR is exposed to fluctuation on the price of green certificates. The US market does not provide a regulated framework system for the electricity price. Nevertheless, renewable generation is incentivized through PTCs (Production Tax Credits) and regional RPS programs that allow receiving RECs (Renewable Energy Credit) for each MWh of renewable generation. REC prices are very volatile and depend on the regional supply/demand equilibrium in the relevant market. Most of EDPR’s capacity in the US has predefined prices determined by bundled (electricity + REC) long-term contracts with local utilities in line with the Company’s policy of avoiding electricity price risk. Despite existing long term contracts, some EDPR’s wind farms in the US do not have PPA and are selling merchant with exposure to electricity and REC price risks. Additionally, some wind farms with existing PPAs do not sell their energy where it is produced and are therefore exposed to basis risk (difference in price between the location where energy is produced and that where energy is sold). In Ontario (Canada), the selling price is defined by a long term feed-in-tariff, thus, there is no electricity price exposure. In Brazilian operations, the selling price is defined through a public auction which is later translated into a longterm contract. Electricity price exposure is almost null, with little exposure for the production above or below the contracted production. Under EDPR’s global approach to minimize the exposure to market electricity prices, the Company evaluates on a permanent basis if there are any deviations to the pre-defined limits (measured through EBITDA at risk, Net Income at risk and total merchant exposure). EDPR intends to eliminate Green Certificates and REC price risk with the signing of bundled PPAs with private offtakers, which include the sale of the electricity and the Green Certificate or REC. In some cases, the offtaker may be interested in contracting only the Green Certificate or the REC, thus a GCPA (Green Certificate Purchase Agreement) or a RECPA (REC Purchase Agreement) is signed. During 2015, EDPR signed new long-term PPAs in the US for 517 MW. In those geographies with remaining merchant exposure, EDPR uses various commodity hedging instruments in order to minimize the exposure to fluctuating market prices. In some cases, due to the lack of liquidity of financial derivatives, it may not be possible to successfully hedge all merchant exposure (i.e. no financial derivatives exist for green certificates nor RECs). In 2015, EDPR financially hedged most of its remaining merchant exposure in Poland, Romania, Spain and the US. As aforementioned, some US wind farms have exposure to REC price risk and/or basis risk (difference in electricity price between locations). EDPR hedges REC prices through forward sales and basis exposures through financial swaps or FTR (Financial Transmission Rights). 1. ii) Risks related to financial markets EDPR finances its wind farms through project finance or corporate debt. In both cases, a variable interest rate might imply significant fluctuations in interest payments. On the other hand, due to EDPR’s presence in several countries, revenues denominated in different currencies. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on financial results. 1. ii) a) Interest rate risk Given the policies adopted by EDPR Group, current exposure to variable interest rate is not significant and financial cash flows are substantially independent from the fluctuation of interest rates. The purpose of interest rate risk management policies is to reduce the exposure of long term debt cash flows to market fluctuations, mainly by contracting long term debt with a fixed rate. When long term debt is issued with floating rates, EDPR settles derivative financial instruments to swap from floating to fixed rate. EDPR has a portfolio of interest-rate derivatives with maturities of up to 13 years. Sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest-rate fluctuations are periodically performed. Taking into account risk management policy and approved exposure limits, the Finance team submits the financial strategy appropriate to each project/location for the Executive Committee’s approval. Global Risk Area supports the Finance team in interest rate hedging decisions. Repricing calendar of debt is continuously monitored together with interest rates in order to detect good timing for interest rate hedging. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 149 1. ii) b) Exchange rate risk EDPR has international operations and is exposed to the exchange-rate risk resulting from investments in foreign subsidiaries. Currency exposure in operating wind farms is to U.S. dollar, Romanian leu, Polish zloty, Brazilian real, British pound and Canadian dollar. EDPR hedges risk against currency fluctuations by financing in the same currency as the revenues of the project. When local financing is not available, EDPR hedges debt cash flows though cross currency interest rate swaps. EDPR also hedges net investments in foreign currency through cross currency interest rate swaps. Finally, EDPR contracts foreign exchange forwards to hedge the risk in specific transactions, mainly in payments to suppliers which may be denominated in different currencies. EDPR’s hedging efforts minimize exchange rate volatility, but do not eliminate completely this risk due to high costs associated to hedging FX in certain situations. 1. ii) c) Inflation risk In some countries, regulated remuneration is linked to inflation. Exposure to inflation may be naturally hedged with exposure to interest rates and EDPR regularly analyses inflation exposure and its relationship with interest rates to adjust level of interest rate coverage in project finance structures. 1. ii) d) Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of EDPR not meeting its financial obligations. Liquidity risk is mainly related to extreme market movements in electricity prices, interest or exchange rates. EDPR tracks liquidity risk in the short term (margin calls, etc) and in the long term (financing sources) in order to meet strategic targets previously set (EBITDA, debt ratio and others). EDPR’s strategy to manage liquidity risk is to ensure that its liquidity is sufficient to meet financial liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, and without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to EDPR’s reputation. Different funding sources are used such as Tax Equity investors, multilateral organizations, project finance, corporate debt and asset rotation in order to ensure long-term liquidity for financing planned projects. 1. iii) Commodity price risk (other than electr.) In projects in which there is a significant number of years between investment decision and start of construction, EDPR may be exposed to the price of the materials used in turbine manufacturing, foundations and interconnection through escalation formulae included in the contracts with suppliers. In order to manage this risk, EDPR may hedge some of the market exposure in OTC/future commodity markets depending on the potential losses and the cost of the hedge. 2. Counterparty Risk Counterparty credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction could default before the final settlement of the transaction’s cash flows. An economic loss could occur, either a direct economic loss if the transaction has a positive value at the moment of default (counterparty credit risk) or a replacement cost due to change of the counterparty (counterparty operational risk). During 2015, EDPR updated its Global Counterparty Risk Policy. 2. i) Counterparty Credit Risk If the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty has a positive economic value at the time of default, an economic loss would occur. To control credit risk at EDPR, thresholds of Expected Loss and Unexpected Loss are established as defined in Basel Standards and re-evaluated monthly. If threshold is surpassed by any counterparty or by the company as a whole, mitigation measures are implemented in order to remain within the pre-established limit. 2. ii) Counterparty Operational Risk If the transactions or portfolio of transactions with the counterparty does not have a positive economic value at the time of default, it will impact operations. Despite no direct loss at the time of default, the replacement of the counterparty could imply a cost to EDPR due to potential delays, higher contract value with a new counterparty (replacement costs), etc. Construction and O&M subcontractors are counterparties to which EDPR is exposed from an operational point of view. To minimize the probability of incurring in potential replacement costs with counterparties, EDPR´s policy concerning counterparty operational risk is managed by an analysis of the technical capacity, competitiveness, credit notation and replacement cost of the counterparty. ANNUAL REPORT 150 2015 3. Operational Risk 3. i) Development Risk Wind farms are subject to strict regulations at different authority levels (international, national, state, regional and local) relating to the development, construction, grid interconnection and operation of power plants. Among other things, these laws regulate landscape and environmental aspects, building licenses, land use and land securing and access to the grid issues. While level of exigency might be different depending on the geographies, EDPR acknowledges a trend for legislations to align towards concentrating the most restrictive rules and development risks on the consenting (environmental and urban permissions) and interconnection (connection of the wind farm to the national grid). In this context, EDPR’s experience gathered in different countries is useful to anticipate and deal with similar situations in other countries. During the development and design phase, EDPR focuses on the optimization of its projects. By mastering the variables, such as choice of locations, lay-out, etc, the objective is to make our projects more resilient to permitting risks. Additionally, EDPR mitigates development risk by generating optionality, with development activities in 12 different countries (Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK, Italy, US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico) and a portfolio of projects in several stages of maturity. EDPR has a large pipeline of projects that provide a “buffer” to overcome potential delays in the development of prioritized projects, ensuring growth targets and being able to compensate permitting delays in some geographies. 3. ii) Execution Risk During the construction of the foundations, interconnection and substation of a wind farm, and the installation of the wind turbines, different events (bad weather, accidents, etc) might occur that could imply an over cost or a delay in the commercial operation date of the wind farm: The delay implies a postponement of cash flows, affecting profitability of the investment. When a wind farm has a PPA, a delay of the commercial operation date might imply the payment of LDs , with the consequent loss of revenues and the impact on annual financial results. During the design phase, EDPR engineering teams supervise the engineering and the installation method. Construction is subcontracted to technically capable construction companies. In both cases, a critical path analysis is performed to assess the reliability of construction and installation plan. 3. iii) Physical assets Wind farms in construction and in operation are exposed to weather hazards, natural disasters, etc. These risks depend on the location. All wind farms are insured the physical damage during construction and operation. During operation, any natural disaster, weather hazard or accident will be partially insured to revenues lost due to the event. 3. iv) Information Technology IT (Information Technologies) risk may occur in the technical network (information network for wind farms operation) or in the office network (information network of corporate services: ERP, accounting…) EDPR mitigates this risk creating redundancy of servers and control centers of wind farms. Redundancy is created in a different location to anticipate potential natural disasters, etc. 3. v) Legal claims (compliance) EDPR faces potential claims of third parties and fraud of its employees. EDPR revises periodically its compliance with all the regulations that affects its activity (environmental, taxes…) 3. vi) Personnel EDPR identifies two main risk factors regarding personnel: turnover and health and safety. Turnover: Cost of replacing an employee. A high turnover implies direct costs of replacement and indirect costs of knowledge loss Health and safety: Likelihood that a person may be harmed or suffers adverse health effects if exposed to a hazard. EDPR mitigates turnover through constant reassessment and benchmarking of remuneration schemes in different geographies. Additionally, EDPR offers flexibility to its employees to improve work life balance. In 2015, EDPR was elected as “Great Place to Work” in Spain and Poland. EDPR aims zero-accidents at work by constantly training in health and safety issues and certifying its facilities according to the OHSAS 18001 standard. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 151 3. vii) Processes Internal processes are subject to potential human errors. Internal Audit Department regularly reviews internal processes and recommends the establishment of new controls or the improvement in the implementation of existing procedures. 4. Business Risk 4. i) Energy Production Risk The amount of electricity generated by EDPR’s wind farms is dependent on weather conditions, which vary across locations, from season to season and from year to year. Variation on the amount of electricity that is generated affects EDPR’s operating results and efficiency. Not only the total wind production in a specific location is relevant, but also the profile of production. Wind usually blows more at night than at daytime, when energy prices are lower. Generation profile will affect the discount in price of a wind farm versus a baseload generation. Finally, curtailment of a wind farm will also affect its production. Curtailment occurs when the production of a wind farm is stopped by the TSO (Transmission System Operators) for external reasons to the company. Examples of cases of curtailment are upgrades in transmission lines, high level of renewable generation production with low demand (very exceptional). EDPR mitigates wind resource volatility and seasonality through geographical diversification of its asset base in different countries and regions. EDPR acknowledges the correlation between different wind farms in its portfolio that allows for this geographical diversification, which enables EDPR to partially offset wind variations in each region and to keep the total energy generation relatively steady. Currently, EDPR is present in 12 countries: Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, UK (no generation), Italy, US, Canada, Brazil and Mexico (no generation). In some geographies there is an inverse correlation between wind volume and electricity price, implying a natural hedge. EDPR has analysed in detail the potential use of financial products to hedge wind risk, and EDPR might use this product to mitigate risk in specific cases. Profile risk and curtailment risk are managed ex-ante. For every new investment, EDPR factors the effect that expected generation profile and curtailment will have on the output of the wind farm. Generation profile and curtailment of EDPR’s wind farms are constantly monitored by Risk department to detect potential future changes. 4. ii) Equipment Performance Risk Output from wind farms and solar plants depends upon the operating availability of the turbines and solar panels and the operating performance of the equipment, mainly the components of wind turbines and transformers. EDPR mitigates this risk by using a mix of turbine suppliers which minimizes technological risk, avoiding exposure to a unique manufacturer. EDPR also engages wind turbine suppliers through medium-term full-scope maintenance agreements to ensure alignment in minimizing technology risk. Finally, EDPR has created an O&M program with adequate preventive and scheduled maintenance program. EDPR externalized non-core technical O&M activities of its wind farms, while primary and value added activities continue controlled by EDPR. 4. iii) Regulatory Risk (renewables) The development and profitability of renewable energy projects are subject to policies and regulatory frameworks. The jurisdictions in which EDPR operates provide different types of incentives supporting energy generated from renewable sources. Remuneration schemes have become less competitive in some countries due to the financial crisis and it cannot be guaranteed that current support will be maintained in all EDPR’s geographies or that future renewable energy projects will benefit from current support measures. Regulation promoting green energy has been revised or is under revision in some of the countries where EDPR is present. In the US, renewable generation from wind will be incentivized through Production Tax Credits (PTC) at a Federal level for all projects beginning of construction up to 2019. Level of incentives will be progressively fading out. Additionally, wind production is also incentivized through State RPS Programs that allow receiving RECs (Renewable Energy Credit) for each MWh of renewable generation. EDPR is managing its exposure to regulatory risks through diversification, by being present in several countries and through participation as an active member in several wind associations. Regulatory Risk in each of EDPR’s countries is monitored continuously, considering current regulation, potential drafts of new laws, feedback from associations, evolution of installed renewable generation capacity and other ANNUAL REPORT 152 2015 inputs. EDPR has developed an internal quantitative assessment of Regulatory Risk that serves as an indicator for changes in supporting schemes. This measure is updated annually in all EDPR’s geographies. Regulatory Risk is also considered ex-ante, at the moment of the investment, through sensitivity analyses that are performed to evaluate its impact in project profitability under different scenarios. 4. iv) Wind Turbine Price Risk Price of wind turbines is affected, not only by market fluctuations of the materials used in the turbines, but also by the demand of wind turbines. For every new project, EDPR secures the demand risk that might increase price of the turbines. 4. v) Wind Turbine Supply Risk The demand for new wind farms may offset the offer of turbines by WTG manufacturers. Currently, the local component requirement in some geographies (Ex: Brazil) creates this shortfall situation. EDPR faces limited risk to the availability and price increase of WTG´s due to existing framework agreements with major global wind turbines suppliers. The Company uses a large mix of turbines suppliers in order to diversify wind turbine supply risk. For geographies with specific requirements of local component, EDPR does not engage in a project before securing the supply of wind turbines. 5. Strategic Risk 5. i) Country Risk Country Risk is defined as the probability of occurrence of a financial loss in a given country due to macroeconomics, political or natural disasters. EDPR has defined a Country Risk Policy that assesses country risk through an internal scoring based on publicly available data. This internal scoring is compared with external assessments from renowned parties. Each risk factor affecting country risk is evaluated independently to decide on potential mitigating actions: Macroeconomic Risk: Risks from the country´s economic evolution, affecting revenue or cost time of the investments Political Risk: All possible damaging actions or factors for the business of foreign firms that emanate from any political authority, governmental body or social group in the host country Natural disaster risk: Natural phenomena (seismicity, weather) that may impact negatively in the business conditions. Before approving a project in a new geography, EDPR analyses the risk of the new country and compares it to our existing portfolio. Mitigation measures may be decided when this risk is above a certain threshold. During 2015, EDPR updated its Global Country Risk Policy. 5. ii) Competitive landscape In the renewable business, size can be an advantage or disadvantage in specific situations. For example, in development of wind farms, small and dynamic companies are usually more competitive than larger companies. On the other hand, when participating in tender processes for offshore wind farms, the size of the investment benefits larger companies. Additionally, the consequences of a change in the competitive landscape due to mergers and acquisitions may also be a risk for EDPR. To mitigate the risks, at EDPR there is a clear knowledge of our competitive advantages and try to leverage on them. When EDPR has no advantage versus its competitors, alternatives are considered in order to become competitive. For example, for offshore wind farms, EDPR has partnered with large companies with previous experience in large electricity generation projects or offshore construction, in order to benefit from their knowledge and become a more competitive consortium. 5. iii) Technology disruptions Most renewables are relatively recent technologies, which are continuously evolving and improving efficiency. As such, some initially expensive technologies can become competitive in a relatively short time. EDPR focuses in onshore wind technology, which in most geographies is the most competitive renewable technology at the moment. However, EDPR is progressively investing in other technologies that are starting to be competitive and may become more efficient in the future, like PV solar and wind offshore. 5. iv) Investment decisions criteria Not all projects have the same risk profile. This will depend on merchant exposure of remuneration, construction risk, etc. In order to take proper business decisions, EDPR uses Risk Adjusted Metrics for investment decisions, which take into consideration the different risks inherent of each project. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 153 5. v) Reputational risk Companies are exposed to public opinion and today’s social networks are a rapid mean to express particular opinions. A bad reputation could eventually harm financial results of a company in the short and in the long term. Sustainability makes part of the essence of EDPR. EDPR is not only committed in building a better future for our children, but also in doing it well, in an ethical and sustainable manner, consequently limiting reputational risk. 54. RISK FUNCTIONS AND FRAMEWORK Risk Management at EDPR is supported by three distinct organizational functions, each one with a different role: Strategy (Risk Profiler), Management (Risk Manager) and Controlling (Risk Controller). RISK FUNCTIONS DESCRIPTION Global Risk Department provides analytically supported proposals to general strategic issues Strategy – General risk strategy & policy Responsible for proposing guidelines and policies for risk management within the company Implement defined policies by Global Risk Management – Risk management & risk business decisions Responsible for day-to-day operational decisions and for related risk taking and risk mitigating positions Responsible for follow-up of the results of risk taking decisions and for contrasting alignment of Controlling – Risk control operations with general risk policy approved by the board The Risk Committee is the forum where the different Risk Functions discuss the policies to be implemented and control the risk exposure of the company. EDPR’s Risk Committee integrates and coordinates all Risk Functions and assures the link between corporate’s risk appetite and defined strategy and the operations of the company. EDPR created three distinct meetings of the Risk Committee in order to separate discussions on execution of mitigation strategies from those on the definition of new policies: Restricted Risk Committee: Held every month, it is mainly focused on development risk and market risk from electricity price. It is the forum to discuss the execution of mitigation strategies to reduce merchant exposure. Its purpose is also to control the limits of defined risk policies, with regards to counterparty risk, operational risk and country risk. Financial Risk Committee: Held every quarter, it is held to review main financial risks and discuss the execution of mitigation strategies. Exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit risk from financial counterparties are most relevant risk reviewed in this committee. Risk Committee: Held every quarter, it is the forum where new strategic analyses are discussed and new policies are proposed for approval to the Executive Committee. Additionally, EDPR´s overall risk position is reviewed, together with EBITDA@Risk and Net Income@Risk. 55. DETAILS ON THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IMPLEMENTED IN THE COMPANY REGARDING THE PROCEDURE FOR REPORTING FINANCIAL INFORMATION With the purpose of not only controlling risks, but also managing them ex-ante, EDPR has created Global Risk policies that are enforceable at a Global Level. These policies are proposed and discussed in the Risk Committee and approved by the Executive Committee. During 2015, EDPR defined or reviewed four Global Risk Policies, which are already implemented: Energy Price Hedging Policy Counterparty Credit Risk Policy Operational Risk Policy Country Risk Policy Compliance with Global Risk policies is verified every month in the Restricted Risk Committee. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEM OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING EDPR has an Internal Control System over Financial Reporting (SCIRF) updated and monitored in line with international standards of Internal Control. This system covers the main aspects of the COSO framework: maintaining a control environment for the preparation of qualified financial information, assessment of the risks of financial reporting, existence of control activities to mitigate risks of error, information and communication and evaluation mechanisms. ANNUAL REPORT 154 2015 SCOPE REVISION AND UPDATE The SCIRF Manual includes the annual update of the scope that aims to identify companies, areas and processes that must be included in the scope of SCIRF, according to criteria of materiality and risk, including the risk of error or fraud. The risk analysis included in the scoping process for SCIRF, includes both the different types of risk (operational, economic, financial, technological or legal) and the control objectives of financial reporting (existence and occurrence, completeness, measurement, presentation, disclosure and comparability, and rights and obligations in terms of their potential impact on the financial statements). The results of the updated scope with the methodology outlined are communicated at all levels of the organization involved in the SCIRF and supervised by the Audit and Control Committee. CONTROL ACTIVITIES In documented SCIRF processes and controls, information capture mechanisms are established (including identification of the scope of consolidation) and steps and checks that are carried out for the preparation of the financial information that will be part of consolidated financial statements are specified. The procedures for review and approval of financial information are provided by the areas of Planning and Control, and Administration, Consolidation and Tax. Financial information is supervised in the scope of its competences by the Audit Control Committee, prior to the formulation of the accounts by the Board of Directors. The SCIRF includes control activities related to these processes, embodied in Entity Level Controls, Process Controls and General Computer Controls. These processes include review and approval activities of the financial information which are described in the processes of elaboration of individual accounts, preparation of consolidated accounts and processing of consolidated financial statements. EDPR has descriptions of Competency Profiles for the Positions to be carried out in the exercise of the main features of each position that includes a description of the main responsibilities. These include the descriptions of the key positions of those involved in the preparation of financial information. These descriptions include responsibilities in the preparation of financial information and compliance with internal control procedures. The documentation of processes and associated controls designed include among others, the completion of closure activities by completing monthly closing checklists by entity, setting time limits for the closures, the identification of the relevance of the operations in order to be reviewed at the appropriate level, conducting analytical reviews of financial information, the existence of limitations in systems to prevent erroneous records or by unauthorized persons, analysis of deviations from the budget, the analysis in Executive Committees of relevant and significant facts that could cause a significant impact on the accounts, or the allocation of responsibilities for calculating amounts to be provisioned for them to be carried out by authorized personnel with the right skills. In addition to the mentioned processes, major transactional processes resulting from the scope are documented. The description of the activities and controls are designed with the aim of ensuring the registration, evaluation, appropriate presentation and disclosure of transactions in financial reporting. Control activities of EDPR’s SCIRF also include those relating to systems and information technology (Computer General Controls) following an international reference, the COBIT framework (Control Objectives for Information and related Technologies). The importance of this area is that information systems are the tools with which financial information is prepared, and is therefore relevant for transactions conducted with them. These control activities include those related to access control to applications and systems, segregation of duties, management of corrective and preventive maintenance, new projects implementation, administration and management of the systems, facilities and operations (back-ups, security incidents) and their proper monitoring and planning. These activities are developed taking into account the requirements of control and supervision. Among the activities of SCIRF’s scope update, there is a periodic analysis of the existence of service suppliers that perform relevant activities in relation to the processes of preparing financial information. SCIRF SUPERVISION The Audit and Control Committee supervises the SCIRF in the scope of the exercise of their activities through the monitoring and supervision of the developed mechanisms for SCIRF’s implementation, evolution and evaluation, and the results of the scope analysis and the extent of the situation in terms of coverage. To this extent, the Internal Audit Department assists the Audit and Control Committee. EDPR has an Internal Audit Department under the Chairman of the Executive Committee. The Audit and Control Committee supervise the Internal Audit Department as establishes the Basic Internal Audit Act. The main functions of the Internal Audit Department are set out in the Basic Internal Audit Act, which includes, among others, the evaluation activities of internal control systems, including the internal control system over financial reporting. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 155 The annual work plans of the Audit Department obtain the opinion of the Audit and Control Committee. The Internal Audit Department reports to the Audit and Control Committee about the status and the performance of the audit works. Among these activities, Internal Audit supports the Audit and Control Committee in supervising the implementation and maintenance of SCIRF and reports the results of the evaluation, improvement actions identified and their evolution. The entity has action plans for improvement actions identified in SCIRF’s assessment processes, which are accompanied and supervised by the Internal Audit Department, considering their impact on the financial information. Also in the year 2015, as in previous years, a process of self-certification was made by the heads of the various process owners regarding proper documentation update on SCIRF controls and processes in their area of responsibility and the implementation of controls with corresponding evidence. SCIRF EVALUATION Besides the monitoring and evaluation activities described in the preceding paragraph, in case the auditors identified internal control weaknesses in the scope of their financial audit work, they are expected to communicate these circumstances to the Audit and Control Committee, which regularly monitors the results of the audit work. Additionally, in 2015 the EDPR Group decided to have its SCIRF audited by the external auditor. As a result of its evaluation, the external auditor issued a report with a favourable opinion on the SCIRF of the EDPR Group, according to ISAE 3000 (International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000). IV. INVESTOR ASSISTANCE 56. INVESTOR RELATIONS DEPARTMENT EDPR seeks to provide to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders all the relevant information about the Company and its business environment, on a regular basis. The promotion of transparent, consistent, rigorous, easily accessible, and high‑quality information is of fundamental importance to an accurate perception of the Company’s strategy, financial situation, accounts, assets, prospects, risks, and significant events. EDPR, therefore, looks to provide investors with accurate information that can support them in making informed, clear and concrete investment decisions. The Investor Relations Department was created to ensure a direct and permanent contact with all market related agents and stakeholders, to guarantee effective communication, equality between shareholders and to prevent imbalances in the information access. The EDPR Investor Relations Department (IR) is the intermediary between EDPR and its actual and potential shareholders, the financial analysts that follow Company’s activity, all investors and other members of the financial community. The main purpose of the department is to guarantee the principle of equality among shareholders, by preventing asymmetries in access the information and reducing the gap between market perception and Company’s strategy and intrinsic value. The department responsibility comprises developing and implementing EDPR’s communication strategy and preserving an appropriate institutional and informative relationship with the financial market, the stock exchange at which EDPR shares trade and the regulatory and supervisory entities (CMVM – Comissão de Mercado de Valores Mobiliários – in Portugal and CNMV – Comisíon Nacional del Mercado de Valores – in Spain). EDPR is clearly aware of the importance of detailed and transparent information, delivered on-time to the market. Consequently, EDPR publishes Company’s price sensitive information before the opening or following the closing of the NYSE Euronext Lisbon stock exchange through CMVM’s information system and, simultaneously, make that same information available on the website investors’ section and through the IR department’s mailing list. In 2015, EDPR made 49 press releases, including quarterly, semi-annual and annual results presentations and handouts elaborated by the IR Department. In addition, the IR Department also elaborates key data files and interim presentations which are available on the website investors’ section. On each earnings announcement, EDPR promotes a conference call and webcast, at which the Company’s management updates the market on EDPR’s activities. On each of these events, shareholders, investors and analysts had the opportunity to directly submit their questions and to discuss EDPR’s results as well as the Company’s outlook and strategy. EDPR IR Department is coordinated by Rui Antunes and is located at the Company’s head offices in Madrid, Spain.

REMUNERATION I. POWER TO ESTABLISH 66. COMPETENCES TO DETERMINE THE REMUNERATION OF THE CORPORATE BODIES The Nominations and Remunerations committee is a permanent body belonging to the Board of Directors with an informative and advisory nature. Its recommendations and reports are non-binding. As such, the Nominations and Remunerations Committee has no executive functions.

The Declaration on the Remuneration Policy is submitted by the Board of Directors to the approval of the General Shareholders’ Meeting as an independent proposal. According to the Company’s Articles of Association the Board of Directors remuneration is subject to a maximum value that can only be modified by a Shareholders agreement. II. REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 67. NOMINATIONS AND REMUNERATIONS COMMITTEE The Composition of the Nominations and Remunerations Committee is reflected on topic 29 of the report. The Nominations and Remunerations Committee did not hire any external consultancy services corresponding to 2015. 68.

III. REMUNERATION STRUCTURE 69. REMUNERATION POLICY Pursuant to Article 26 of the Company’s Articles of Association the Directors shall be entitled to a remuneration which consists of (i) a fixed amount to be determined annually by the General Shareholders’ Meeting for the whole Board of Directors and of (ii) attendance fees regarding the Board Meetings. The above mentioned article also establishes the possibility of the Directors being remunerated with Company shares, share options, or other securities granting the right to obtain shares or by means of share-indexed remuneration systems. In any case, the system chosen must be approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting and comply with current legal provisions. The total amount of the remunerations that the Company will pay to its Directors under the terms provided in the previous paragraphs shall not exceed the amount determined for that effect by the General Shareholders’ Meeting. The maximum remuneration approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting, for all the members of the Board of Directors was € 2,500,000 per year.

The maximum annual remuneration approved by the General Shareholders Meeting for the variable remuneration for all the executive members of the Board of Directors was € 1,000,000 per year. EDPR, in line with EDP Group corporate governance practice, has signed an Executive Management Services Agreement with EDP, under which the Company bears the cost for such services to some of the members of the Board of Directors to the extent their services are devoted to EDPR. The non-executive Directors only receive a fixed remuneration, which is calculated on the basis of their work exclusively as Directors or with their membership on the Nominations and Remunerations Committee, Related Party Transactions Committee, and the Audit and Control Committee. Those members who are seated in two different Committees don’t accumulate two remunerations. In these cases, the remuneration to be received is the one that corresponds to the highest value. EDPR has not incorporated any share remuneration or share purchase options plans as components of the remuneration of its Directors. No Director has entered into any contract with the Company or third parties that have the effect of mitigating the risk inherent in the variability of the remuneration established by the Company. In EDPR there aren't any payments for the dismissal or termination of Director's duties. The remuneration policy for the Directors of the Company is submitted each year to the General Shareholders’ Meeting for approval. 70. REMUNERATION STRUCTURE The remuneration policy applicable for 2014-2016 as proposed by the Nominations and Remuneration Committee and approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting on April 8th, 2014 (the Remuneration Policy), defines a structure with a fixed remuneration for all members of the Board of Directors and a variable remuneration, with an annual component and a multi-annual component for the members of the Executive Committee. The Remuneration Policy, including the minor amendments approved by the General Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 9th, 2015, remained unaltered during 2015. On the topic below can be found a reminder of the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) stated in the Remuneration Policy for variable annual and multi-annual variable components. 71. VARIABLE REMUNERATION Variable annual and multi-annual remuneration applies to the members of the Executive Committee. The variable annual remuneration may range from 0 to 68% of the annual fixed remuneration and the multiannual remuneration from 0 to 120% of the annual fixed remuneration. For Executive Committee Members that are also Officers, there will be a qualitative evaluation of the CEO about the annual performance. This evaluation will have a weight of 20% for the final calculation in the annual variable remuneration and 32% in the multi-annual variable remuneration. The other 80% will be calculated based on the weights indicated in the next paragraph for the annual variable remuneration and 68% for the multiannual variable. The key performance indicators (KPIs) used to determine the amounts of the annual and multi-annual variable remuneration regarding to each year of the term are aligned with the strategic grounds of the Company: growth, risk control and efficiency. These are the same for all members of the Executive Committee, although with specific targets for the platforms in the case of COO’s. For the years 2015 and 2016 and in order to align the indicators with the company objectives a new KPI has been included “Asset Rotation & Tax Equity”. The indicators are as follows: TARGET GROUP KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR WEIGHT Total Shareholder Return vs. Peers & PSI 20 15% Growth Incremental MW (EBITDA + Net Equity) 10% Risk – Return ROIC Cash % 8% Asset Rotation & Tax Equity 7.5% Efficiency Technical Availability 6% EBITDA 12% Other Sustainability 7.5% Opex / MW Net Income 12% According to the Remuneration Policy approved by theEmployee General Shareholders’ satisfaction Meeting, the maximum variable 5% Capex / MW remuneration (annual and multi-annual) is applicable if all the above mentioned KPI’s were achieved and the performance evaluation is equal or above 110%. Appreciation of the Remuneration Committee 5% ANNUAL REPORT 160 2015 72. MULTI-ANNUAL REMUNERATION The Remuneration Policy incorporates the deferral for a period of three years of the multi-annual variable remuneration, being the relevant payment conditioned to the lack of any willful illicit action, known after the appraisal and which endangers the sustainable performance of the company, in line with CMVM corporate governance practices. 73. VARIABLE REMUNERATION BASED ON SHARES EDPR has not allocated variable remuneration on shares and does not maintain Company shares that the Executive Directors have had access to. 74. VARIABLE REMUNERATION BASED ON OPTIONS EDPR has not allocated variable remuneration on options. 75. ANNUAL BONUS AND NON-MONETARY BENEFITS The key factors and grounds for any annual bonus scheme are described on topics 71 and 72.

ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 191 01. THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE EDP RENOVÁVEIS GROUP EDP Renováveis, Sociedad Anónima (hereinafter referred to as “EDP Renováveis” or “EDPR”) was incorporated on 4 December 2007. Its main corporate objective is to engage in activities related to the electricity sector, namely the planning, construction, operation and maintenance of electricity generating power stations, using renewable energy sources, mainly wind. The registered offices of the company are located in Oviedo, Spain. On 18 March 2008 EDP Renováveis was converted into a company incorporated by shares (Sociedad Anónima). As at 31 December 2014 the share capital was held 62.02% by EDP S.A. Sucursal en España ( EDP Branch ), 15.51% by Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico, S.A. (“HC”) and 22.47% of the share capital was free-floated in the NYSE Euronext Lisbon. On December 18th 2015, EDP S.A. Sucursal en España acquired to Hidroeléctrica del Cantábrico, S.A., its block of shares, so that, as at December 2015 EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A holds directly, through its Spanish branch, a qualified shareholding of 77.5% of the share capital and voting rights of EDPR. As a result of this acquisition, HC no longer holds any shareholding in EDPR (see note 27). As at 31 December 2015, EDP Renováveis holds a 100% stake in the share capital of the following companies: EDP Renewables Europe, S.L. (EDPR EU), EDP Renewables North America, L.L.C. (EDPR NA), EDP Renewables Canada, Ltd. (EDPR Canada), South África Wind & Solar Power, S.L.U., EDP Renováveis Servicios Financieros, S.L. and EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A. (EDPR BR). The Company belongs to the EDP Group, of which the parent company is EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A., with registered offices at Avenida 24 de Julho, 12, Lisbon. In December 2011, China Three Gorges Corporation (CTG) sign an agreement to acquire 780,633,782 ordinary shares in EDP from Parpública Participações Públicas SGPS, S.A., representing 21.35% of the share capital and voting rights of EDP Energias de Portugal S.A., a majority shareholder of the Company. This operation was concluded in May 2012. The terms of the agreements through which CTG became a shareholder of the EDP Group stipulate that CTG would make minority investments totalling 2,000 million of Euros in operating and ready-to-build renewable energy generation projects (including co-funding capex). Within the agreement mentioned above, in June 2013, EDPR completed the sale of 49% equity shareholding in EDPR Portugal to CTG through CITIC CWEI Renewables S.C.A. and, on May 2015, EDPR closed the sale of 49% of the following EDPR Brasil subsidiaries to CTG through CWEI Brasil participaçoes LTDA. (see note 5): Elebrás Projetos S.A, Central Nacional de Energia Eólica S.A, Central Eólica Baixa do Feijão I S.A, Central Eólica Baixa do Feijão II S.A, Central Eólica Baixa do Feijão III S.A, Central Eólica Baixa do Feijão IV S.A, Central Eólica Jau S.A. and Central Eólica Aventura S.A. In this context, EDPR Group has entered into new agreements with CTG during 2015, which are still subject to regulatory and third party approvals and other precedent conditions, so that no accounting impacts are booked in 2015 in this respect (see note 40). EDPR EU operates through its subsidiaries located in Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Poland, Romania, Italy and United Kingdom. EDPR EU's main subsidiaries are: EDP Renováveis Portugal, S.A. (wind farms in Portugal), EDP Renovables España, S.L. (wind farms in Spain), EDP Renewables France (wind farms in France), EDP Renewables Belgium (wind farms in Belgium), EDP Renewables Polska, SP.ZO.O (wind farms in Poland), EDP Renewables Romania, S.R.L. (wind farms in Romania), EDP Renewables Italy, SRL (wind farms in Italy), EDPR UK Limited (offshore development projects) and EDPR RO PV, S.L.R. (photovoltaic solar farms in Romania). EDPR NA's main activities consist in the development, management and operation of wind farms in the United States of America and providing management services for EDPR Canada. EDPR Canada's main activities consist in the development, management and operation of wind farms in Canada. The purpose of EDP Renováveis Brasil is to aggregate all the investments in the renewable energy market of Brazil. EDP Renováveis Group, through its subsidiaries has an installed capacity, as follows: INSTALLED CAPACITY MW 31 DEC 2015 31 DEC 2014 United States of America 4,203 3,805 Spain 2,194 2,194 Portugal (*) 1,247 624 Romania 521 521 Poland 468 391 France 364 340 Brazil 84 84 Belgium 71 71 Italy 100 90 Canada 30 30 9,282 8,150 (*) Includes Eneop portfolio as a result of the Eneop Consortium´s deal (see note 43). This portfolio capacity was included in 2014 as equity consolidated companies in the amount of 533 MW. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 192 2015 Additionally, the EDP Renováveis Group through its equity-consolidated companies has an installed capacity, as follows: INSTALLED CAPACITY MW 31 DEC 2015 31 DEC 2014 United States of America 179 179 Spain 177 174 Portugal 533 356 886 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA The United States federal government and various state governments have implemented policies designed to promote the growth of renewable energy, including wind power. The primary federal renewable energy incentive program is the Production Tax Credit (PTC), which was established by the U.S. Congress as part of 1992 EPACT. Additionally, many states have passed legislation, principally in the form of renewable portfolio standards (“RPS”), which require utilities to purchase a certain percentage of their energy supply from renewable sources, similar to the Renewable Energy Directive in the EU. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 includes a number of energy related tax and policy provisions to benefit the development of wind energy generation, namely (i) a three year extension of the PTC until 2012 and (ii) an option to elect a 30% Investment Tax Credit ( ITC ) that could replace the PTC through the duration of the extension. This ITC allows the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects placed in service or with the beginning of construction in 2009 and 2010. In December 2010, the Tax Relief, Unemployment, Insurance and Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 was approved and includes an one year extension of the ITC, which allow the companies to receive 30% of the cash invested in projects with beginning of construction until December 2011 as long as placed in service until December 2012. On 1 January 2013, the US Congress approved The American Taxpayer Relief Act that includes an extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind energy, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) instead of the PTC. Congress set 31 December 2013 as the new expiration date of these benefits and changed the qualification criteria (projects will only qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2013). The legislation also includes a depreciation bonus on new equipment placed in service which allows the depreciation of a higher percentage of the cost of the project (less 50% of the Investment Tax Credit) in the year that it is placed in service. This bonus depreciation was 100% in 2011 and 50% for 2012. On 16 December 2014, the U.S. Congress approved the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 that included an extension of the PTC for wind, including the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Congress set a new expiration date of 31 December 2014 and kept the qualification criteria (projects can qualify as long as they are under construction by year-end 2014). On 15 December 2015, the US Congress approved the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016” that included an extension of the PTC for wind, as well as the possibility of a 30% Investment Tax Credit instead of the PTC. Developers now have until the end of 2016 to start construction of new wind farms to qualify for 10 years of production tax credits at the full level. Congress introduced a phase out for projects that start construction after 2016 and before 2020. These projects will still qualify for production tax credits, but at reduced levels. The levels are 80% for projects starting construction in 2017, 60% in 2018, and 40% in 2019. Developers of projects that start construction before 2020 may elect to claim 30% investment tax credits instead of production tax credits, subject to a similar phase out. The phase out reduces the value of the 30% investment tax credit to 24% in 2017, 18% in 2018, and 12% in 2019. Neither production tax credits nor investment tax credits are allowed for wind projects that start construction in 2020 or later. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for solar projects. Solar projects that are under construction by the end of 2019 will now qualify for the 30% ITC. The credit is reduced to 26% for projects starting construction in 2020 and to 22% for projects starting construction in 2021. The credit drops to a permanent 10% level for projects that begin construction in 2022 or later or that begin construction before 2022, but are placed in service in 2024 or later. Projects must be placed in service by the end of 2023 to qualify for a credit above 10%. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN SPAIN On December 2012, following Law 15/2012 of 27 December, the Spanish Government approved a 7% tax on electricity generation, as well as new taxes on nuclear and large-scale hydropower, plus a new carbon levy. These taxes have been applied since 2013. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 193 On 4 February 2013, the Spanish Government published the Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 “on urgent measures in the electrical system and financial sector” that included a set of regulatory modifications applicable to the Spanish electricity sector and affecting wind energy assets. The main measures of RD-L 2/2013 were: • New index to annually update all regulated activities in the electricity sector. This new index is the annual inflation (“IPC”) excluding some components of it, such as tax variations, non-manufactured products and energy products • Sole formula to remunerate special regime facilities: the remuneration through the price market + premium is eliminated. Therefore, the remuneration of all the special regime facilities had to be done under the regulated tariff formula, unless the titleholder of the facility decided to perceive only the market price, but without a premium • Other consequences for facilities that had previously chosen the option “market + premium”. Those facilities that between January 1st, 2013 and February 2nd, 2013 (date of entry into force of the Royal Decree-Law) had sold their energy according to that system, perceived an amount equivalent as if they had chosen the regulated tariff option. On 12 July 2013 the Spanish Council of Ministers approved a comprehensive reform of the Spanish energy sector aimed to end with the Spanish tariff deficit. The energy reform has been afterwards implemented by means of a new Energy Sector Act, a Decree-Law, eight Royal Decrees and three Ministerial Orders. As a part or this Energy Reform, the RD-L 9/2013 was passed in July 2013. According to it, renewable energy facilities would be subject to a new framework, by which they would be remunerated by the market price plus a payment per installed MW allowing that the return on investment would be equivalent to the Spanish Government 10-year bonds yield plus a spread of 300 bps (being based on the asset’s regulatory life). The RD-L also suppresses the renewables remuneration for reactive power (2€/MWh). On 26 December 2013, the Spanish government published a new regulation that will govern the electricity sector (Law 24/2013) replacing the existing from 1997 (Law 54/1997). The law refers to the need to finish with the sector’s structural deficit that had been accumulated during the last decade, as the motivation to undertake the reform. Two years after, it seems that this target is to be achieved. Indeed, in November 2015, the CNMC (National commission of markets and competition) published the final balance of the Spanish electricity system for the year 2014 delivering a surplus of +550.3 M€, being the first surplus of the Spanish electricity system after 9 consecutive years of deficit. The Spanish Government published in 20 June 2014, the Order IET/1045/2014, which included the parameters to remunerate the renewable energy assets, under the new remuneration framework that was approved by the Decree-Law 413/2014 of June 2014. The final legislation had no significant changes to the previous draft versions. In the case of wind farms onshore, the DL 413/2014 confirmed that the wind farms in operation in 2003 (and before) would not receive any further incentive, while the incentive for the rest of the wind farms would be calculated in order to reach of 7.398% return before taxes. In October 2015 the Government approved the Royal Decree 947/2015 and a Ministerial Order aimed at allowing the installation of new renewable capacity through competitive tenders. On December 3rd 2015, the conditions for the upcoming auction were published. Also in October 2015, the Government approved the “National Energy Infrastructure Plan 2015-20”, envisaging an increase in wind capacity of 6.5 GW and the “Plan de Relazamiento de la Industria Eólica”, consisting in 15 specific measures focused in relaunching the wind manufacturing sector. Some of the measures are focused to spur the competitiveness of the Spanish wind manufacturer sector, while others are aimed at increasing turbine exports and others at boosting R+D. On January 14th 2016 the first auction of RES capacity was held. The auction was designed to provide a similar remuneration scheme that the one that applies to current installations (RD 413/2014). Following this framework, tender participants were requested to bid discounts on the “initial investment” (CAPEX) parameter which would then, by being plugged in the formula set by RD 413/2014 determine the “Rinv” (investment premium) that would eventually be awarded. Developers were bidding to build 500 MW of wind energy and 200 MW of biomass plants. The auction was very competitive, around 5 times oversubscribed for onshore wind, and awarded contracts without any incentive, this is, at 100% discount to the opening price. EDPR was awarded 93 MW of wind energy. The Government has announced that more auctions will be organised, possibly in 2016, to contract the capacity that Spain needs to comply with its 2020 targets. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 194 2015 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN PORTUGAL The Portuguese legal provisions applicable to the generation of electrical power based on renewable resources are currently established by Decree-Law 189/88 dated 27 May, as amended by Decree-Law 168/99 dated 18 May, Decree-Law 312/2001 dated 10 December , and Decree-Law 339-C/2001 dated 29 December. Also relevant is Decree-Law 33-A/2005, dated 16 February 2005 (“DL 33-A/2005”), which establishes the remuneration formula applicable to energy produced by renewable sources. The Portuguese Government published on 28 February 2013, the Decree Law 35/2013, that maintains the legal stability of the current contracts (following Decree-Law 33-A/2005) and protects the value of the investments made by the wind energy producers. However, this Decree Law opened the possibility for voluntary changes of the existing feed-in tariff. the Government proposed four alternative tariff schemes to be elected by each of the wind developers, that include the following: i) alternative cap and floor selling prices; ii) alternative durations to the new scheme beyond the initial 15 years of the current contracts; and consequently iii) alternative levels of investment (on a per MW basis) to adhere a new scheme. EDPR and ENEOP chose a 7 year extension of the tariff defined as the average market price of previous twelve months, with a floor of 74€/MWh and a cap of 98€/MWh values updated with inflation from 2021 onwards, in exchange for a payment of 5.800€/MW from 2013 to 2020. The Environment and Energy Ministry published, on 24 July 2014, the Decree Law 94/2014 that allows the increase of installed capacity of wind farms up to 20%. The additional production generated from the capacity increase will have a fixed remuneration of 60 Euros/MWh, whilst the remaining production is remunerated at the previous tariff. On 7 April 2015 the Administrative Order 102/2015 was published, which establishes the procedures for the placement of additional energy and for the repowering authorisation of wind farms previously defined by DecreeLaw 94/2014 of 24 June. The main measures introduced by this legislation are: (i) the energy produced by repowering wind farms (increasing the number of wind turbines in existing wind farms) is remunerated at a fixed rate of 60€/MW; (ii) the energy corresponding to the difference between installed capacity and the injected energy in the network is remunerated at 60€/MW; and (iii) Recognition of the wind farms repowering as an independent generator. On April 23 European Commission approved Portugal’s plans to support 50 MW of wave, tidal and floating offshore wind turbine demonstration projects (25 MW windfloat project). REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN FRANCE The electricity industry in France is governed primarily by Act 2000-108 (amended by Acts 2004-803 and 20061537) (“Act 2000’), passed on 10 February 2000, which regulates the modernization and development of public energy services and is the general legislative framework for the operation of wind facilities in France. Act 2000 allows wind operators to enter into long-term agreements for the purchase and sale of their energy with Electricité de France (EDF), the national incumbent. The tariffs were initially set by Order of July 10, 2006 which was repealed in August 2008 due to formal defect in its approval, and then republished without any amendment in December 2008. The tariffs are the following: i) during the first ten years of the EDF Agreement, EDF pays a fixed annual tariff, which is €82 per MWh for applications made during 2006 (tariff is amended annually based, in part, on an inflation-related index); ii) During years 11 to 15 of the EDF Agreement, the tariff is based on the annual average percentage of energy produced during the wind facility's first ten years (these tariffs are also amended annually, based, in part, on an inflation-related index); iii) Beginning in the year 16, there is no specific support and wind energy generators will sell their electricity at the market, thus receiving market price. On March 2012, the legality of the 2008 feed-in tariff ministerial order for wind farm projects was questioned before the French Council of State (Conseil dÉtat) on the basis that the required notification to the European Commission on State Aid has not been done. Following this appeal, the French Council of State decided to raise the issue for a preliminary ruling before the EU Court of Justice. After years of litigation, the French Council of State decided to cancel the French Wind Tariff on May 2014. The EU Court of Justice argued that it constituted illegal State Aid as France failed to notify the European Commission of the subsidy back in 2008. Shortly after, the French Government approved and released a new tariff decree ( Arrêté du 17 juin 2014 ) that had previously received clearance from the European Union. This new decree contains the same parameters than the former decree and has come into force with retroactive effects. Therefore, it will not endanger or modify any power purchase agreement signed under the 2008 Order. In July 2015, the “Energy Transition bill”, whose aim is to build a long-term and comprehensive energy strategy, was finally passed. In 66 articles, the text targets to cut France's GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 (and divide them by four by 2050), to halve the country's energy usage by 2050, to reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production, to cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix. Following the provisions of the “Energy Transition Law”, the French government disclosed a draft decree with the details of a new remuneration scheme for renewables. According to this text, renewables will be remunerated by contract-for-difference scheme. However, the implementation for wind energy will probably be delayed to 2018 and up until then, new wind farms will be remunerated according to the current feed-in tariff scheme. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 195 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN POLAND The legislation applicable to renewable energy in Poland is primarily contained in an Energy Act passed on 10 April 1997, which has subsequently been amended by Act 24 July 2002 and the Energy Act of 2 April 2004, which came into effect in January 2005 (together, the ‘‘Energy Act’’). The Energy Act introduces a support scheme for renewable energy facilities. The law includes a system of obligatory purchase Green Certificates by companies selling electricity to end-consumers, with mandatory quotas. These power companies are obliged to: a) obtain GC and submit them to the Energy Regulator, or b) pay a substitution fee calculated in accordance with the Energy Act. If suppliers fail to meet their obligation (either the submission of GC or the payment of substitution fee), they must pay a fine, equal to 130% of the substitution fee in that year. Under the current legislation, the following quota apply (as amended by the ministerial decree of 18 October 2012): 2016: 15.0%, 2017:16.0%, 2018:17.0%, 2019:18.0% , 2020:19.0% and 2021:20.0%. However, this initial scheme was amended in 2015. In February 2015 a new Renewables Law was approved, introducing a different support system. According to the law, the current Green Certificate (GC) system will be replaced by a tender scheme. However, the current GC scheme will be maintained (with some adjustments) for operating plants. These plants will have the choice to remain under the GC scheme or shift to the new scheme through specific tenders for operating assets. In mid-December, as a result of the changes in Parliament (Poland’s general election on 25 October was won by the right-wing Law and Justice Party), the new government postponed the implementation of tenders to July 2016. Therefore, up to this date, the GC system will be maintained. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN BELGIUM The regulatory framework for electricity in Belgium is conditioned by the division of powers between the federal and the three regional entities: Wallonia, Flanders and Brussels-Capital. The federal regulatory field of competence includes electricity transmission (of transmission levels above 70 kV), generation, tariffs, planning and nuclear energy. The relevant federal legislation is the Electricity Act of 29 April 1999 (as modified) (the ‘‘Electricity Act’’). The regional regulatory entities are responsible for distribution, renewable energy and cogeneration (with the exception of offshore power plants) and energy efficiency. The relevant regional legislation, respectively, is: (a) for Flanders, the Electricity Decree of 17 July 2000; (b) for Wallonia, the Regional Electricity Market Decree of 12 April 2001; and (c) for Brussels-Capital, the Order of 19 July 2001 on the Organization of the Electricity Market. The Belgian regulatory system promotes the generation of electricity from renewable sources (and cogeneration) by a system of GC as described below. The Belgian federal government is responsible for offshore power plants and for imposing obligations on the transmission system operators. The various GC systems are very similar across the three regions and are similar to the GC system for federally-regulated offshore power plants. There are currently differences in terms of quotas, fines and thresholds for granting GCs. In Wallonia, GC are allocated for a maximum of 15 years. After the 10th year, the amount of GC can be reduced on the basis of the so-called “k factor”. This parameter is calculated according to several criteria, including the additional operating costs of the renewable electricity production compared to conventional energy sources (Art. 15 Arrêté du 30 novembre 2006). The value of the “k-factor” to be applied to a certain installation is the one in force by the time it was granted its certificate of origin (Art. 15 Arrêté du 30 novembre 2006). However, from 1 January 2015, the number of GC allocated to each technology is calculated according to a new methodology taking following factors into consideration (Art. 15, Arrêté du 30 novembre 2006): • The net amount of electricity produced • The energy performance coefficient of the installation • The economic performance coefficient of the technology, which is adjusted by the Walloon regulatory Authority (CWaPE) every 2 years (for onshore wind) Green Certificates benefit from a minimum price of 65€ and the penalty for non-compliance is set at 100€ per missing GC. On 21 March 2012, Walloon government approved a decree which fixed the quotas of GC until 2020. The quotas are: (i) 19.4% in 2013; (ii) 23.1% in 2014; (iii) 26.7% in 2015; (iv) 30.4% in 2016. A new tax for wind generators was approved in Wallonia in July 2012. According to this regulation, all generators earning GC shall pay 0,54 €/MWh. The energy regulator of Wallonia (CWaPE) is the beneficiary of this tax, aimed at supporting the costs originated by green certificates management. REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN ROMANIA The promotion of electricity generated from renewable energy sources in Romania was set with the Electricity Law 318/2003. In 2005 a Green Certificate (GC) mechanism was introduced with mandatory quotas for suppliers, in order to comply with their EU renewable requirements. The regulatory authority establishes a fixed quota of electricity produced from renewable energy systems which suppliers are obliges to fulfil. Law 220/2008 of November, introduced some changes in the GC system. In particular, it allowed wind generators to receive 2GC/MWh until 2015. From 2016 onwards generators would receive only 1 GC for each MWh during 15 years. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 196 2015 The law also guaranteed that: • The trading value of GC would have a floor of 27€ and a cap of 55€, both indexed to Romanian inflation • The access to the National Grid for the electricity produced from renewable sources. Law 220/2008 on renewable energy was amended by the Emergency Order 88/2011. A key aspect of this amendment was the overcompensation analysis which is to be carried out on a yearly basis. ANRE (Energy Regulator) has to monitor the benefits obtained by renewables’ producers and annually prepare a report on this regard. If overcompensation is observed, ANRE has to propose a reduction of the applicability period of the support scheme or the number of GCs initially granted to the technology. This reduction would be applied only to new plants. Law 123/2012 of 19 July 2012 on Electricity and Natural Gas eliminated the provision of bilateral contracts not publicly negotiated as a mean to sale electricity. Thus, trading of electricity must be carried out on a centralized market. The Romanian Parliament passed on 17 December 2013, the law for the approval of the Government Emergency Ordinance 57/2013 (the Ordinance). The law brought several amendments to the Ordinance and implicitly to the Renewables Law (i.e. Law 220/2008). The amendments were: The postponement of GC for operating plants. The postponement only applies to renewable energy operators accredited by ANRE before 2013. Wind power producers receive 2 GCs/MWh until 2017 (inclusive) of which 1 GC is postponed from trading from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2017. Solar producers have 2 GCs (out of 6 GCs) postponed from trading from 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2017. The GCs postponed will be gradually recovered until 31 December 2020 (starting on 1 April 2017 for solar PV and 1 January 2018 for wind); Wind facilities accredited after this date receive 1.5 GC/MWh until 2017 and 0.75 GC/MWh from 2018 onwards during 15 years. All these GC are immediately tradable; Solar facilities only receive 3 GC from 1 January 2014 onwards. On 24 March 2014, the President of Romania ratified EGO 57/2013 with the following amendments: (i) Reduction of the GC validity from 16 months to 12 months; and (ii) the obligation for ANRE (Energy Regulator) to communicate in each year the GC quota for the next year. At this regard, ANRE released on 27 June 2014, the 2015 mandatory quota for acquisition of green certificates at 11.9%. The European Commission (DG Competition) disclosed in May 2015, its clearance to the Romanian Renewables support scheme amendments notified in 2013 and 2014. Therefore, the amendments have been declared compatible with the European Energy and Environmental State aid Guidelines (EEAG). Other main 2015 regulatory development was the approval of Law 122/2015 amending the Renewables’ Law. The main objective was to grant a temporary accreditation from ANRE (Energy Regulator), to renewables’ plants above 125 MW (but below 250 MW) that had not obtain an individual reply from the EC, and therefore, allow them to benefit from the GC support. The Law 122/2015 also included other amendments to Romanian renewable energy law, being the most important ones: suppliers’ obligation to purchase GC on a quarterly basis, the opening of the GC scheme to imported electricity and the removal of the right to receive GC for the electricity sold at negative prices On December 2015 the Government finally set the value of the GC quota for 2016 at 12.15%, the same value that was proposed by ANRE by the end of July (well below the original 17% set in the original renewable energy Law). REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN ITALY On 6 July 2012, the Government approved a new renewable regulation by means of the Decree on Renewables (DM FER) introducing a feed-in-tariff support scheme (therefore, shifting away from the former GC system). The key aspects of the new regulation provided by the DM FER were the following: (i) wind farms over 5 MW would be remunerated under a feed-in tariff scheme defined by tenders; (ii) capacity to be tendered to be set by different technologies’ capacity paths; (iii) the reference tariff for 2013 was 127 €/MWh for onshore wind and tender participants would bid offering discounts on a reference tariff (in %); (iv) The reference tariff would decrease 2% per year and will be granted for 20 years. The new system replaces the previous one based on GCs. Under the previous system producers obtained their revenues from the sale of the electricity in the electricity market and from the sale of GCs. Wind farms built until December 2012 (with some exceptions) continued to operate under the previous system until 2015 (from 2015 onwards, the GC system was transformed into a feed-in-premium). Spalma Incentivi Decree, published in November 2014, stipulated that wind farms under the GCs scheme could voluntarily adhere to an extension of the incentivation period of 7 years in exchange of a permanent reduction of the premium/GCs received, being the coefficient of reduction calculated individually for each wind farm depending on their remaining regulatory life. As the option was voluntary, wind farms that refused to accept this change remained under previous GCs scheme. Wind farms had to decide whether or not to adhere to the extension before 17 February 2015. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 197 Since the implementation of the tender system, 3 reverse-auction have been held. It´s expected that a new decree will be passed in 2016 aimed to release new wind tenders for at least, the next two years. According to the draft, 800 MW of onshore wind could be tendered, with a reference tariff of 110€/MWh. REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE ACTIVITIES IN BRAZIL The Electrical Sector in Brazil is regulated by Federal Law nr 8,987 of 13 February 1995, which generally rules the concession and permission regime of public services; Law nr 9,074 of 7 July 1995, which rules the grant and extension of public services concession or permission contracts; Federal Law nr 10,438 of 26 April 2002, which governs the increase in Emergency Electric Power Supply and creates the 3,300 MW Program of Incentives for Alternative Electricity Sources (PROINFA); Federal Law nr 10,762 of 11 November 2003 and Law nr 10,848 of 15 March 2004, concerning commercial rules for the trade of Electric Power; and, subsequent amendments to the legislation. The Decree nr 5,025 of 30 March 2004, regulates the Federal Law nr 10,438 and states the Alternative Energy Sources economical and legal framework. PROINFA participants have granted a PPA with ELETROBRÁS, and are subject to the regulator (ANEEL) authority. However, the first stage of PROINFA has ended and the second stage is highly uncertain. After PROINFA program, renewable producers obtain their remuneration by participating in auctions where price is the only criteria. Winners of the auctions obtain a PPA contract at the price bid. Public Electricity Auctions are technically lead by the state “Energy Planning and Research Company” (EPE), who registers, analyses and allows potential participants. On 13 November 2015, the latest Reserve Auction (A-3) took place. As a result, Brazilian government contracted 1.664 MW of wind (548 MW) and solar PV (1.1 GW) capacity for a 20-year long-term contract through this auction. The auction exclusively sought wind and PV projects, with power delivery start date being 1 November 2018. Wind ceiling price was BRL 213/MWh. EDPR, through its subsidiary EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A., secured in this auction a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement to sell electricity in the regulated market. The energy will be produced by a 140 MW wind farm to be installed in the Brazilian State of Bahia with operations expected for 2018. The initial price of the long term contract was set at R$199.37/MWh, indexed to the Brazilian inflation rate. 02. ACCOUNTING POLICIES A) BASIS OF PREPARATION The accompanying consolidated annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting records of EDP Renováveis, S.A. and consolidated entities. The consolidated annual accounts for 2015 and 2014 have been prepared to present fairly the consolidated equity and consolidated financial position of EDP Renováveis, S.A. and subsidiaries at 31 December 2015 and 2014, the consolidated results of operations, consolidated cash flows and changes in consolidated equity for the years then ended. In accordance with Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 of 19 July 2002, from the European Council and Parliament, the Group's consolidated annual accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and its predecessor body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and its predecessor bodies. The Board of Directors approved these consolidated annual accounts on 23 February 2016. The annual accounts are presented in thousands of Euros, rounded to the nearest thousand. The annual accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the application of fair value basis for derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading and available-forsale, except those for which a reliable measure of fair value is not available. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with the IFRS-EU requires the Board of Directors to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and of the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and related assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered reasonable in accordance with the circumstances. They form the basis for making judgments regarding the values of the assets and liabilities whose valuation is not apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The areas involving the highest degree of judgment or complexity, or for which the assumptions and estimates are considered significant, are disclosed in note 3 Critical accounting estimates and judgments in applying accounting policies. Accounting policies have been applied consistently by all Group companies and in all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated balance sheet, consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes thereto for 2015 include comparative figures for 2014, which formed part of the consolidated annual accounts approved by shareholders at the annual general meeting held on April 9th, 2015. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 198 2015 However, according to the resolution of January 29, 2016 of the Spanish Institute of Accounting and Auditing (ICAC) about the information to be included in the notes to the financial statements relating the average period of payments to suppliers, the information disclosed in note 34 does not include comparative information for 2014. B) BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION Controlled entities Investments in subsidiaries where the Group has control are fully consolidated from the date the Group assumes control over their financial and operating activities until the moment that control ceases to exist. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Joint arrangements The Group classifies an arrangement as a joint arrangement when the jointly control is contractually established. An investor controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee, independently of the percentage of voting rights held. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that collectively control the arrangement. After determining the existence of joint control, the Group classifies joint arrangements into two types joint operations and joint ventures. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint operators) have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement, so the assets and liabilities (and related revenues and expenses) in relation to its interest in the arrangement are recognised and measured in accordance with relevant IFRSs applicable. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement (i.e. joint ventures) have rights to the net assets of the arrangement, so this investment shall be included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of joint ventures, included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in a jointly controlled entity, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of that entity. Entities over which the Group has significant influence Investments in associates are included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method from the date the Group acquires significant influence to the date it ceases. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its financial and operating policies. The existence of significant influence by the Group is usually evidenced by one or more of the following: Representation on the Executive Board of Directors or equivalent governing body of the investee; Participation in policy-making processes, including participation in decisions about dividends and other distributions; Existence of material transactions between the Group and the investee; Interchange of managerial personnel; Provision of essential technical information. The consolidated financial statements include the Group's attributable share of total reserves and profits or losses of associates, included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the Group's carrying amount is reduced to zero and recognition of further losses is discontinued, except to the extent that the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to cover such losses on behalf of the associate. Business combination From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2008) in accounting for business combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 199 Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: • The fair value of the consideration transferred; plus • The recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus • If the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less • The net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss. Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. Some business combinations in the period have been determined provisionally as the Group is currently in the process of measuring the fair value of the net assets acquired. The identifiable net assets have therefore initially been recognised at their provisional value. Adjustments during the measurement period have been recorded as if they had been known at the date of the combination and comparative information for the prior year has been restated where applicable. Adjustments to provisional values only include information relating to events and circumstances existing at the acquisition date and which, had they been known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. After that period, adjustments to initial measurement are only made to correct an error. Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquire. When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss. Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition. Accounting for acquisitions of non-controlling interests From 1 January 2010, acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Previously, goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, which represented the excess of the cost of the additional investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the net assets acquired at the date of the transaction. Investments in foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations, are translated to Euro at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income in the translation reserve. On disposal of a foreign subsidiary, the related exchange differences previously recognised in reserves, are accounted for in the income statement. as part of the profit or loss on disposal. When the settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such a monetary item are considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income, and presented in the translation reserve in equity. Balances and transactions eliminated on consolidation Inter-company balances and transactions, including any unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in those entities. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 200 2015 Common control transactions The accounting for transactions among entities under common control is excluded from IFRS 3. Consequently, in the absence of specific guidance, within IFRSs, the EDP Renováveis Group has developed an accounting policy for such transactions, as considered appropriate. According to the Group's policy, business combinations among entities under common control are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the EDP consolidated book values of the acquired company (subgroup). The difference between the carrying amount of the net assets received and the consideration paid, is recognised in equity. Put options related to non-controlling interests EDP Renováveis Group records written put options at the date of acquisition of a business combination or at a subsequent date as an advance acquisition of these interests, recording a financial liability for the present value of the best estimate of the amount payable, irrespective of the estimated probability that the options will be exercised. The difference between this amount and the amount corresponding to the percentage of the interests held in the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Until 31 December 2009, in years subsequent to initial recognition, the changes in the liability due to the effect of the financial discount are recognised as a financial expense in the consolidated income statement, and the remaining changes are recognised as an adjustment to the cost of the business combination. Where applicable, dividends paid to minority shareholders up to the date the options are exercised are also recorded as adjustments to the cost of the business combination. In the event that the options are not exercised, the transaction would be recorded as a sale of interests to minority shareholders. As from January 2010, the Group applies IAS 27 (2008) to new put options related to non-controlling interests and, therefore, subsequent changes in the carrying amount of the put liability are recognised in profit or loss. Business combinations achieved in stages In a business combination achieved in stages, the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred, (ii) the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquiree (iii) the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business; over the net of amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, is recognized as goodwill. If applicable, the defect, after evaluating the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized in the acquiree, the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business; and the valuation of the net assets acquired, is recognized in the income statement. The Group recognizes the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquired business and the carrying value in consolidated results according to its classification. Additionally, the Group reclassifies the deferred amounts in other comprehensive income relating to the previously held equity interest to the income statement or consolidated reserves, according to their nature. C) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. These exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities accounted for at historical cost are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency non-monetary assets and liabilities stated at fair value are translated into Euros at the exchange rates at the dates the fair value was determined. D) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING Derivative financial instruments are recognised on the trade date at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value of derivative financial instruments is re-measured on a regular basis, being the gains or losses on re-measurement recognised directly in the income statement, except for derivatives designated as hedging instruments. The recognition of the resulting gains or losses on re-measurement of the derivatives designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the risk being hedged and of the hedge model used. The fair value of derivatives correspond to their quoted market prices as provided by an exchange, or is determined by through the use of net present value techniques, including discounted cash flows models and option pricing models, as appropriate. HEDGE ACCOUNTING The Group uses financial instruments to hedge interest and foreign exchange risks resulting from its operational and financing activities. The derivate financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded as for trading. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 201 The derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments are recorded at fair value, being the gains and losses recognised in accordance with the hedge accounting model adopted by the Group. Hedge accounting is used when: (i) At the inception of the hedge, the hedge relationship is identified and documented; (ii) The hedge is expected to be highly effective; (iii) The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured; (iv) The hedge is revalued on an on-going basis and is considered to be highly effective over the reporting period; and (v) The forecast transactions hedged are highly probable and represent a risk to changes in cash flows that could affect the income statement. Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are accounted for as described below. Cash flow hedge The effective portion of the changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge model is recognised in equity. The gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship are recognised in the income statement in the moment they occur. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in equity are also reclassified to the income statement over the periods in which the hedged item will affect the income statement. When the forecast transaction hedge results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, the gains or losses recorded in equity are included in the acquisition cost of the asset. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity at that time stays recognised in equity until the hedged transaction also affects the income statement. When the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses recognized in equity are recorded in the income statement. Net investment hedge The net investment hedge is applied on a consolidated basis to investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies. The exchange differences recorded against exchange differences arising on consolidation are offset by the exchange differences arising from the foreign currency borrowings used for the acquisition of those subsidiaries. If the hedging instrument is a derivative, the gains or losses arising from fair value changes are also recorded against exchange differences arising on consolidation. The ineffective portion of the hedging relation is recognised in the income statement. E) OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group classifies its other financial assets at acquisition date in the following categories: Loans and receivable Loans and receivable are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently are measured at amortised cost less impairment losses. Impairment losses are recorded based on the valuation of estimated losses from non-collection of loans and receivable at the balance sheet date. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, and can be reversed if the estimated losses decrease in a later period. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss This category includes: (i) financial assets held for trading, which are those acquired for the purpose of being traded in the short term, and (ii) financial assets that are designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. Available-for-sale investments Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale and that are not classified in any of the other categories. The Group’s investments in equity securities are classified as available-for-sale financial assets. Initial recognition, measurement and derecognition Purchases and sales of: (i) financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and (ii) available-for-sale investments, are recognised on trade date, the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the assets. Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, in which case these transaction costs are directly recognised in the income statement. Financial assets are derecognised when: (i) the contractual rights to receive their cash flows have expired, (ii) the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership or (iii) although retaining some, but not substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership, the Group has transferred the control over the assets. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 202 2015 Subsequent measurement After initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value and gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. Available-for-sale financial assets are also subsequently carried at fair value. However, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the financial assets are derecognised or impaired. When this occurs, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are immediately recognised in the income statement. Foreign exchange differences arising from equity investments classified as available-for-sale are also recognised in equity. Interest calculated using the effective interest rate method and dividends, are recognised in the income statement. The fair values on quoted investments in active markets are based on current bid prices. For unlisted securities the Group determines the fair value through: (i) valuation techniques, including the use of recent arm’s length transactions or discounted cash flow analysis and (ii) valuation assumptions based on market information. Financial instruments whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are carried at cost. Reclassifications between categories The Group does not reclassify, after initial recognition, a financial instrument into or out of the fair value through profit or loss category. Impairment At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed as to whether there is objective evidence of impairment, including any impairment resulting in an adverse effect on estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the recoverable amount of the financial asset is determined, and the impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. A financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after their initial recognition, such as: (i) in the case of listed securities, a significant or prolonged decline in the listed price of the security, and (ii) in the case of unlisted securities, when that event (or events) has an impact on the estimated amount of the future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets, that can be reliably estimated. Evaluating the existence of objective evidence of impairment involves judgement, in which case the Group considers, among other factors, price volatility and current economic situation. Thus, when listed securities are concerned, it is considered as continuous a devaluation in the listed price of the security for a period over 24 months and as significant a devaluation of the security's value above 40%. If there is objective evidence of impairment on available-for-sale investments, the cumulative potential loss recognised in fair values reserves, corresponding to the difference between the acquisition cost and the fair value at the balance sheet date, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the income statement, is transferred to the income statement. F) FINANCIAL LIABILITIES An instrument is classified as a financial liability when it contains a contractual obligation to transfer cash or another financial asset, independently from its legal form. These financial liabilities are recognised (i) initially at fair value less transaction costs and (ii) subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method. The Group derecognises the whole or part of a financial liability when the obligations included in the contract have been satisfied or the Group is legally released of the fundamental obligation related to this liability either through a legal process or by the creditor. G) BORROWING COSTS Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of assets are capitalised as part of the cost of the assets. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. To the extent that funds are borrowed generally, the amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation are determined by applying a capitalisation rate to the expenditures on these assets. The capitalisation rate corresponds to the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the enterprise that are outstanding during the period, other than borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset. The amount of borrowing costs capitalised during a period does not exceed the amount of borrowing costs incurred during the period. The capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when expenditures for the asset are being incurred, borrowing costs have been incurred and activities necessary to prepare all or part of the assets for their intended use or sale are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying assets for their intended use or sale are completed. Capitalisation of borrowing costs shall be suspended during extended periods in which active development is interrupted. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 203 H) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are stated at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. In case of projects in a development stage, costs are only capitalized when it is probable that the project will be finally built. If due to changes in regulation or other circumstances costs capitalized are derecognized from property plant and equipment, they are recognized in the profit and loss caption of “Other expenses”. Replacements or renewals of complete items are recognized as increases in the value of property, plant and equipment and the items replaced or renewed are derecognized and recognized in the “Other expenses” caption. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment. The cost of acquisition includes interest on external financing and personnel costs and other internal expenses directly or indirectly related to work in progress accrued solely during the period of construction. The cost of production is capitalised by charging costs attributable to the asset as own work capitalised under financial expenses and personnel costs and employee benefit expense in the consolidated income statement. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Subsequent costs are recognised as separate assets only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group. All repair and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred. The Group assesses assets impairment, whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the impairment being recognised in the income statement. Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on the other assets is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, as follows: NUMBER OF YEARS Buildings and other constructions 8 to 40 Plant and machinery: Wind farm generation 25 Other plant and machinery 4 to 25 Transport equipment 3 to 5 Office equipment and tools 2 to 10 Other tangible fixed assets 3 to 10 I) INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Group´s intangible assets are booked at acquisition cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. The Group does not own intangible assets with indefinite lives. The Group performs impairment tests, whenever events or circumstances may indicate that the book value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being any impairment recognised in the income statement. Acquisition and development of software Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software. These costs are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives. Costs that are directly associated with the development of identifiable specific software applications by the Group, and that will probably generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. These costs include employee costs directly associated with the development of the referred software and are amortised using the straight-line method during their expected useful lives. Maintenance costs of software are charged to the income statement when incurred. Industrial property and other rights The amortisation of industrial property and other rights is calculated using the straight-line method for an expected useful live expected of less than 6 years. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 204 2015 Green Certificates As per Romanian Regulatory Framework, there's a category of Green Certificates (GCs) which although granted are restricted for sale until 2017 (solar) and 2018 (wind). These deferred GCs are recognised as intangible assets when generated at fair market value. These GCs will be offset as they will be collected. Power purchase agreements Acquired Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) are booked as intangible assets and amortised using the straightline method according with the duration of the contract. J) NON-CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Non-current assets or groups of non-current assets held for sale (groups of assets and related liabilities that include at least one noncurrent asset) are classified as held for sale when their carrying amounts will be recovered mainly through sale, the assets or groups of assets are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The Group also classifies as non-current assets held for sale, non-current assets or groups of assets acquired exclusively for its subsequent resale, that are available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable. The measurement of all non-current assets and all assets and liabilities included in a disposal group, is adjusted in accordance with the applicable IFRS standards, immediately before their classification as held for sale. Subsequently, these assets or disposal groups are measured at the lowest between their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. K) IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is then estimated. For goodwill the recoverable amount is estimated at each reporting date. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the cash-generating unit). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units which are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro-rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in circumstances that caused the impairment. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. L) LEASES The Group classifies its lease agreements as finance leases or operating leases taking into consideration the substance of the transaction rather than its legal form. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers to the lessee substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Operating leases Lease payments are recognised as an expense and charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate. M) INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of the acquisition cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories includes purchases, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated selling costs. The cost of inventories is assigned by using the weighted average method. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 205 N) CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT The Group classifies assets and liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position as current and noncurrent. Current assets and liabilities are determined as follows: Assets are classified as current when they are expected to be realised or are intended for sale or consumption in the Group’s normal operating cycle, they are held primarily for the purpose of trading, they are expected to be realised within twelve months of the balance sheet date or are cash or a cash equivalent, unless the assets may not be exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months from the balance sheet date. Liabilities are classified as current when they are expected to be settled in the Group’s normal operating cycle, they are held primarily for the purpose of trading, they are due to be settled within twelve months of the balance sheet date or the Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Financial liabilities are classified as current when they are due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, even if the original term was for a period longer than twelve months, and an agreement to refinance, or to reschedule payments, on a long-term basis is completed after the reporting period and before the consolidated financial statements are authorised for issue. O) PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when: (i) the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation, (ii) it is probable that settlement will be required in the future and (iii) a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made. Dismantling and decommissioning provisions The Group recognises dismantling and decommissioning provisions for property, plant and equipment when a legal or contractual obligation is settled to dismantling and decommissioning those assets at the end of their useful life. Consequently, the Group has booked provisions for property, plant and equipment related with wind turbines, for the expected cost of restoring sites and land to its original condition. The provisions correspond to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation and are recognised as part of the initial cost or an adjustment to the cost of the respective asset, being depreciated on a straight-line basis over the asset useful life. The assumptions used for 2015 and 2014 are: EDPR EU EDPR NA Average cost per MW (Euros) 14,000 22,045 Salvage value per MW (Euros) 41,000 32,148 Discount rate Euro [1.90% 2.50%] PLN [3.00% 4.00%] USD [3.85% 5.00%] CAD [3.35% 4.25%] RON [4.50% 5.65%] Inflation rate Euro zone [1.75% 1.85%] Poland 0.90% USA 2.50% Canada 2.25% Capitalisation (number of years) 25 25 Decommissioning and dismantling provisions are remeasured on an annual basis based on the best estimate of the settlement amount. The unwinding of the discount at each balance sheet date is charged to the income statement. Tax liabilities Liabilities for payment of taxes or levies related to an activity of the Group are recognized as the activity which triggers the payment is carried out, according to the laws regulating such taxes or levies. However, in the cases of taxes or levies with right of reimbursement of the amount already paid proportionally to the period of time in which there is no activity or the asset which triggers the payment is no longer owned, liabilities are recognized on a proportional basis. P) RECOGNITION OF COSTS AND REVENUE Costs and revenues are recorded in the year to which they refer regardless of when paid or received, in accordance with the accrual concept. Differences between amounts received and paid and the corresponding revenue and expenditure are recorded under other assets and other liabilities. Revenue comprises the amounts invoiced on the sale of products or of services rendered, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts, after elimination of intra-group sales. Revenue from energy sales is recognised in the period that energy is generated and transferred to customers. Deferred Green Certificates (GCs) are recognised as revenue at fair market value. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 206 2015 Q) FINANCIAL RESULTS Financial results include interest payable on borrowings, interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, unwinding of the discount of provisions and written put options to non-controlling interests, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses on financial instruments and the accrual of tax equity estimated interest over outstanding liability. Interest income is recognised in the income statement based on the effective interest rate method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the entity's right to receive payments is established. R) INCOME TAX Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to a items recognized directly in equity, in which case is also recognized in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, deferred tax is not recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. S) EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, excluding the average number of ordinary shares purchased by the Group and held as treasury stock. T) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include balances with maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition, including cash and deposits in banks. This caption also includes other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and specific demand deposits in relation to institutional partnerships that are funds required to be held in escrow sufficient to pay the remaining construction related costs of projects in institutional equity partnerships in U.S.A., in the next twelve months. The Group classifies as cash and cash equivalents the balance of the current accounts with the Group formalized under cash-pooling agreements. U) GOVERNMENT GRANTS Government grants are recognised initially as deferred income under non-current liabilities when there is reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grant. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are recognised. V) ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES The Group takes measures to prevent, reduce or repair the damage caused to the environment by its activities. Expenses derived from environmental activities are recognised as other operating expenses in the period in which they are incurred. W) INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IN U.S. WIND FARMS The Group has entered in several partnerships with institutional investors in the United States, through limited liability Company operating agreements that apportion the cash flows generated by the wind farms between the investors and the Company and allocates the tax benefits, which include Production Tax Credits (PTCs), Investment Tax Credits (ITC) and accelerated depreciation, largely to the investor. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 207 The institutional investors purchase their minority partnership interests for an upfront cash payment with an agreed targeted internal rate of return over the period that the tax credits are generated. This anticipated return is computed based on the total anticipated benefit that the institutional investors will receive and includes the value of PTC’s / ITC's, allocated taxable income or loss and cash distributions received. The control and management of these wind farms are a responsibility of EDPR Group and they are fully consolidated in these financial statements. The upfront cash payment received is recognised under ‘Liabilities arising from institutional partnerships’ and subsequently measured at amortised cost. This liability is reduced by the value of tax benefits provided and cash distributions made to the institutional investors during the contracted period. The value of the tax benefits delivered, primarily accelerated depreciation and ITC are recognized as Income from institutional partnerships on a pro-rata basis over the 25 year useful life of the underlying projects (see note 7). The value of the PTC's delivered are recorded as generated. This liability is increased by an interest accrual that is based on the outstanding liability balance and the targeted internal rate of return agreed. After the Flip Date, the institutional investor retains a non-significant interest for the duration of the structure. This non-controlling interest is entitled to distributions ranging from 2.5 % to 6 % and taxable income allocations ranging from 5% to 17%. EDPR NA has an option to purchase the institutional investor’s residual interest at fair market value during a defined period following the flip date. A liability to provide for the institutional investors’ minority interest is accreted on a straight-line basis from the funding date through the Flip Date. 03. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES The IFRS set forth a range of accounting treatments and require the Board of Directors to apply judgment and make estimates in deciding which treatment is most appropriate. The main accounting estimates and judgements used in applying the accounting policies are discussed in this note in order to improve the understanding of how their application affects the Group’s reported results and disclosures. A broader description of the accounting policies employed by the Group is disclosed in note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Although estimates are calculated by the Board of Directors based on the best information available at 31 December 2015 and 2014, future events may require changes to these estimates in subsequent years. Any effect on the financial statements of adjustments to be made in subsequent years would be recognised prospectively. Considering that in many cases there are alternatives to the accounting treatment adopted by EDP Renováveis, the Group’s reported results could differ if a different treatment was chosen. EDP Renováveis believes that the choices made are appropriate and that the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, the Group’s financial position and results. The alternative outcomes discussed below are presented solely to assist the reader in understanding the financial statements and are not intended to suggest that other alternatives or estimates would be more appropriate. Fair value of derivatives Fair values are based on listed market prices, if available, otherwise fair value is determined either by dealer prices (both for that transaction or for similar instruments traded) or by pricing models, based on net present value of estimated future cash flows which take into account market conditions for the underlying instruments, time value, yield curves and volatility factors. These pricing models may require assumptions or judgments in estimating fair values. Consequently, the use of a different model or of different assumptions or judgments in applying a particular model may have produced different financial results for a particular period. Fair value measurement of contingent consideration The contingent consideration, from a business combination or a sale of a minority interest while retaining control is measured at fair value at the acquisition date as part of the business combination or at the date of the sale in the event of a sale of a minority interest. The contingent consideration is subsequently remeasured at fair value at balance sheet date. Fair value is based on discounted cash flows. The main assumptions consider the probability of achieving each objective and the discount factor, corresponding to the best estimates of management at each balance sheet date. Changes in assumptions could have impact on the values of contingent assets and liabilities recognized in the financial statements. Review of the useful life of assets related to production The Group regularly reviews the useful life of its electrical generation installations in order to bring it into line with the technical and economic measurements of the installations, taking into consideration their technological capacity and prevailing regulatory restrictions. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 208 2015 Impairment of non-financial assets Impairment test are performed whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets is less than the corresponding net book value of assets. On an annual basis, the Group reviews the assumptions used to assess the existence of impairment in goodwill resulting from acquisitions of shares in subsidiaries. The assumptions used are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic indicators and business assumptions used by management. The net interest in associates is reviewed when circumstances indicate the existence of impairment. Considering that estimated recoverable amounts related to property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are based on the best information available, changes in the estimates and judgments could change the impairment test results which could affects the Group’s reported results. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant interpretations and estimates are required in determining the global amount for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Different interpretations and estimates would result in a different level of income taxes, current and deferred, recognised in the period. Tax Authorities are entitled to review EDP Renováveis, and its subsidiaries’ determination of its annual taxable earnings, for a determined period that may be extended in case there are tax losses carried forward. Therefore, it is possible that some additional taxes may be assessed, mainly as a result of differences in interpretation of the tax law. However, the EDP Renováveis and its subsidiaries, do not anticipate any significant changes to the income tax booked in the financial statements. Dismantling and decommissioning provisions The Board of Directors considers that Group has contractual obligations with the dismantling and decommissioning of property, plant and equipment related to wind electricity generation. For these responsibilities the Group has recorded provisions for the expected cost of restoring sites and land to its original condition. The provisions correspond to the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation. The use of different assumptions in estimates and judgments referred may have produced different results from those that have been considered. Green Certificates As a consequence of the regulatory framework in Romania related to Green Certificates (GCs), the Group has the following assumptions: (i) For estimating the price of GCs, the model is based on current regulation including the latest developments published in the last months and estimations on renewable capacity to be added in the following years; (ii) The GC model determines whether there will be excess or deficit of GCs to evaluate the price to apply; In order to determine whether there will be excess or deficit of GCs, we compare demand with supply of GCs. Demand of GCs is calculated by multiplying gross electricity consumption and quotas of renewable electricity. Electricity demand growth is based in latest external estimates, including those from Romanian regulator ANRE. EDPR has made sensitivity analyses to the quotas and has assumed a conservative scenario that considers the latest regulatory changes. Entities included in the consolidation perimeter In order to determine which entities must be included in the consolidation perimeter, the Group evaluates whether it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. This evaluation requires judgement, assumptions and estimates in order to conclude whether the Group is in fact exposed to variable returns and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Other assumptions and estimates could lead to a different consolidation perimeter of the Group, with direct impact in the consolidated financial statements. 04. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES The businesses of EDP Renováveis Group are exposed to a variety of financial risks, including the effects of changes in market prices, foreign exchange and interest rates. The main financial risks lie essentially in its debt portfolio, arising from interest-rate and the exchange-rate exposures. The unpredictability of the financial markets is analysed on an on-going basis in accordance with the EDPR’s risk management policy. Financial instruments are used to minimize potential adverse effects resulting from the interest rates and foreign exchange rates risks on EDP Renováveis financial performance. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 209 The Board of Directors of EDP Renováveis is responsible for the definition of general risk-management principles and the establishment of exposure limits. Recommendations to manage financial risks of EDP Renováveis Group are proposed by EDPR's Finance and Global Risk Departments and discussed in the Financial Risk Committee of EDP Renováveis, which is held quarterly. The pre-agreed strategy is shared with the Finance Department of EDP Energias de Portugal, S.A., to verify the accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors of EDP. The evaluation of appropriate hedging mechanisms and the execution are outsourced to the Finance Department of EDP. All transactions undertaken using derivative financial instruments require the prior approval of the Board of Directors, which defines the parameters of each transaction and approves the formal documents describing their objectives. Exchange-rate risk management EDPR/EDP Group’s Financial Department are responsible for managing the foreign exchange exposure of the Group, seeking to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the net assets and net profits of the Group, using foreign exchange derivatives, foreign exchange debt and/or other hedging structures with symmetrical exposure characteristics to those of the hedged item. The effectiveness of these hedges is reassessed and monitored throughout their lives. EDPR operates internationally and is exposed to the exchange-rate risk resulting from investments in foreign subsidiaries. With the objective of minimizing the impact of exchange rates fluctuations, EDP Renováveis general policy is to fund each project in the currency of the operating cash flows generated by the project. Currently, the main currency exposure is the U.S. Dollar, resulting from the shareholding in EDPR NA. With the increasing capacity in other geographies, EDPR is also becoming exposed to other currencies (Brazilian Real, Zloty, New Romanian Leu and Canadian Dollar). To hedge the risk originated with net investment in EDPR NA, EDP Renováveis entered into a CIRS in USD/EUR with EDP Branch and also uses financial debt expressed in USD. Following the same strategy adopted to hedge these investments in USA, EDP Renováveis has also entered into CIRS in BRL/EUR and in PLN/EUR to hedge the investments in Brazil and Poland (see note 36). Sensitivity analysis Foreign exchange rate As a consequence a depreciation/appreciation of 10% in the foreign currency exchange rate, with reference to 31 December 2015 and 2014, would originate an increase/(decrease) in EDP Renováveis Group income statement and equity before taxes, as follows: THOUSANDS OF EUROS 31 DEC 2015 PROFIT OR LOSS EQUITY +10% -10% +10% -10% USD / EUR -359 439 -359 439 31 DEC 2014 PROFIT OR LOSS EQUITY +10% -10% +10% -10% USD / EUR 5,825 -7,119 5,825 -7,119 This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely interest rates, remain unchanged. Interest rate risk management The Group’s operating cash flows are substantially independent from the fluctuation in interest-rate markets. The purpose of the interest-rate risk management policies is to reduce the exposure of debt cash flows to market fluctuations. As such, whenever considered necessary and in accordance to the Group's policy, the Group contracts derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risks. In the floating-rate financing context, the Group contracts interest-rate derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows associated with future interest payments, which have the effect of converting floating rate loans into fixed rate loans. All these hedges are undertaken on liabilities in the Group’s debt portfolio and are mainly perfect hedges with a high correlation between changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and changes in fair value of the interest-rate risk or upcoming cash flows. The EDP Renováveis Group has a portfolio of interest-rate derivatives with maturities up to 11 years. The Financial Department of EDP Group undertakes sensitivity analyses of the fair value of financial instruments to interest-rate fluctuations or upcoming cash flows. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 210 2015 About 92% of EDP Renováveis Group financial debt bear interest at fixed rates, considering operations of hedge accounting with financial instruments. Sensitivity analysis Interest rates EDPR/EDP Group’s Financial Department are responsible for managing the interest rate risk associated to activities developed by the Group, contracting derivative financial instruments to mitigate this risk. Based on the EDPR Group debt portfolio and the related derivative financial instruments used to hedge associated interest rate risk, as well as on the shareholder loans received by EDP Renováveis, a change of 50 basis points in the interest rates with reference to 31 December 2015 and 2014 would increase/(decrease) in EDP Renováveis Group income statement and equity before taxes, as follows: THOUSANDS OF EUROS 31 DEC 2015 PROFIT OR LOSS EQUITY + 50 BPS 50 BPS + 50 BPS 50 BPS Cash flow hedge derivatives 15,668 -16,388 Unhedged debt (variable interest rates) -594 594 -594 594 15,668 -16,388 31 DEC 2014 PROFIT OR LOSS EQUITY + 50 BPS 50 BPS + 50 BPS 50 BPS Cash flow hedge derivatives 12,343 Unhedged debt (variable interest rates) -1,094 -12,844 -1,094 1,094 12,343 -12,844This analysis assumes that all other variables, namely foreign exchange 1,094 rates, remain unchanged. Counter-party credit-rate risk management in financial transactions The EDP Renováveis Group counter-party risk exposure in financial and non-financial transactions is managed by an analysis of technical capacity, competitiveness and probability of default to the counter-party. EDP Renováveis has defined a counter-party risk policy inspired in Basel III, which is implemented across all departments in all EDP Renováveis geographies. Counterparties in derivatives and financial transactions are restricted to highquality credit institutions or to the EDP Group. Most relevant counterparties in derivatives and financial transactions are companies within EDP Group. Financial instruments contracted outside EDP Group are generally engaged under ISDA Master Agreements. The credit quality of external counterparties is analysed according to the counter-party risk policy of the Group and collaterals are required when exposure is above the pre-established limits. In the specific case of the energy sales of EDPR EU Group, the Group’s main customers are operators and distributors in the energy market of their respective countries (OMIE and MEFF in the case of the Spanish market). Credit risk is not significant due to the limited average collection period for customer balances and the quality of its debtors. Additional counter-party risk comes from the countries that set renewables incentives, which it is usually treated as regulatory risk. In the specific case of EDPR NA Group, the Group’s main customers are regulated utility companies and regional market agents in the US. As it occurs in Europe, credit risk is not significant due to the limited average collection period for customer balances and the quality of the debtors. However, the exposure to customers in long term contracts also comes from the mark-to-market of those contracts. This exposure is managed by a detailed assessment of the counter-party before signing any long term agreement and by a requirement of collaterals depending on the exposure and on the rating. EDP Renováveis believes that the amount that best represents the Group's exposure to credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of Trade receivables and Other debtors, net of the impairment losses recognised. The Group believes that the credit quality of these receivables is adequate and that no significant impaired credits exist that have not been recognised as such and provided for. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the possibility that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group strategy to manage liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have significant liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation. The liquidity policy followed ensures compliance with payment obligations acquired, through maintaining sufficient credit facilities and having access to the EDP Group facilities. The EDP Renováveis Group undertakes management of liquidity risk through the engagement and maintenance of credit lines and financing facilities with its main shareholder, as well as directly in the market with national and international financial institutions, assuring the necessary funds to perform its activities. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 211 Market price risk As at 31 December 2015, market price risk affecting the EDP Renováveis Group is not significant. In the case of EDPR NA, the great majority of the plants are under power purchase agreements, with fixed or escalating prices. In the case of EDPR EU, the electricity is sold in Spain, France, Italy and Portugal through regulated tariffs whether in Romania and Poland most plants sell their electricity and green certificates under power purchase agreements with fixed prices or floors. For the small share of energy, green certificates and RECs generated with market exposure, this risk is managed through electricity sales swaps and REC swaps. EDPR EU and EDPR NA have electricity sales and REC swaps that qualify for hedge accounting (cash flow hedge) that are related to electricity sales for the years 2016 to 2019 (see note 36). The purpose of EDP Renováveis Group is to hedge a volume of energy generated to reduce its exposure to the energy price volatility. Capital management The Group’s goal in managing equity, in accordance with the policies established by its main shareholder, is to safeguard the Group’s capacity to continue operating as a going concern, grow steadily to meet established growth targets and maintain an optimum equity structure to reduce equity cost. In conformity with other sector groups, the Group controls its financing structure based on the leverage ratio. This ratio is calculated as net financial borrowings divided by total equity and net borrowings. Net financial borrowings are determined as the sum of financial debt, institutional equity liabilities corrected for non-current deferred revenues, less cash and cash equivalents. 05.

Statutes of limitation differ from country to country, as follows: USA, Belgium and France: 3 years; Spain, United Kingdom, Italy and Portugal: 4 years or, in the case of Portugal, if tax losses/credits have been used, the number of years that such tax losses/credits may be carry forward; Brazil, Romania, Poland, Italy and Mexico: 5 years; and Canada: 10 years. Tax losses generated in each year are also subject to Tax Administrations’ review and reassessment. Losses may be used to offset yearly taxable income assessed in the subsequent periods, as follows: 5 years in Poland; 7 in Romania; 10 in Mexico; 12 in Portugal; 20 in the USA and Canada; and indefinitely in Spain, France, Italy, Belgium, Brazil and the United Kingdom. Moreover, in the United Kingdom tax losses may be carried back to the previous tax year and in the USA and Canada to the 2 and 3 previous years, respectively. However, the deduction of tax losses in Portugal, Spain, Brazil, France, Italy and Poland may be limited to a percentage of the taxable income of each period. EDP Renewables Group companies may, in accordance with the law, benefit from certain tax benefits or incentives in specific conditions, namely the Production Tax Credits in the US which are the dominant form of wind remuneration in that country, and represent an extra source of revenue per unit of electricity ($23/MWh in 2015 and 2014), over the first 10 years of the asset’s life. EDP Renewables Group transfer pricing policy is in line with the rules, guidelines and best international practices applicable across all geographies where the Group operates, in due compliance with the spirit and letter of the Law. Changes in the tax law with relevance to the EDP Renewables Group in 2015 The statutory corporate income tax rates applicable in Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom were reduced in 2015, as follows: In Portugal, from 23% to 21%, as per Law 82-B/2014, published on 31 December 2014 (State Budget Law for 2015), effective from 1 January 2015, onwards; In Spain, from 30% to 28%, according to Law 27/2014, of 27 November 2014, also with effect from 1 January 2015 onwards; and In the United Kingdom, from 21% to 20% in 2015, effective from 1 April 2015, as per the Finance Act 2013.

The decrease in goodwill movement in EDPR EU Group in the year 2014 is related with the cancellation of the success fee associated to a project in EDPR France. Transactions related to movements in goodwill disclosed above were made before 1 January 2010, date of the adoption of the revised IFRS 3, therefore have been accounted for as described in the accounting policy 2 b. Goodwill impairment tests EDPR Group The goodwill of the EDPR Group is tested for impairment each year with basis of September. In the case of operational wind farms, it is performed by determining the recoverable value through the value in use. Goodwill is allocated to each country where EDPR Group performs its activity, so the EDPR Group aggregate all the CGUs cash flows in each country in order to calculate the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 225 To perform this analysis, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method was used. This method is based on the principle that the estimated value of an entity or business is defined by its capacity to generate financial resources in the future, assuming these can be removed from the business and distributed among the company’s shareholders, without compromising the maintenance of the activity. Therefore, for the businesses developed by EDPR's CGUs, the valuation was based on free cash flows generated by the business, discounted at appropriate discount rates. The future cash flows projection period used is the useful life of the assets (25 years) which is consistent with the current depreciation method. The cash flows also incorporate the long-term off-take contract in place and longterm estimates of power prices, whenever the asset holds merchant exposure. The main assumptions used for the impairment tests are as follows: Power produced: net capacity factors used for each CGU utilize the wind studies carried out, which takes into account the long-term predictability of wind output and that wind generation is supported in nearly all countries by regulatory mechanisms that allow for production and priority dispatching whenever weather conditions permit; Electricity remuneration: regulated or contracted remuneration has been applied where available, as for the CGUs that benefit from regulated remuneration or that have signed contracts to sell their output during all or part of their useful life; where this is not available, prices were derived using price curves projected by the company based on its experience, internal models and using external data references; New capacity: tests were based on the best information available on the wind farms expected to be built in coming years, adjusted by probability of success and by the growth prospects of the company based on the Business Plan Targets, its historical growth and market size projections. The tests considered the contracted and expected prices to buy turbines from various suppliers; Operating costs: established contracts for land leases and maintenance agreements were used; other operating costs were projected consistent with the company’s experience and internal models; Terminal value: considered as a 15% of the initial investment in each wind farm, considering inflation; Discount rate: the discount rates used are post-tax, reflect EDPR Group’s best estimate of the risks specific to each CGU and range as follows: THOUSANDS OF EUROS 2015 2014 Europe 3.8% 6.0% 4.0% 6.4% North America 4.5% 6.6% 5.1% 7.1% Brazil 9.6% 11.7% 8.6% 10.3% Impairment tests done have taken into account the regulation changes in each country, as disclosed in note 1. EDPR has performed the following sensitivity analyses in the results of impairment tests performed in Europe, North America and Brazil in some of the key variables, such as: 5% reduction of Merchant Prices used in the base case. This sensitivity analysis performed for this assumption independently would not suppose any impairment for the goodwill allocated to each country, except for Romania amounting to 9,392 thousands of Euros. 100 basis points increase of the discount rate used in the base case. This sensitivity analysis performed for this assumption independently would not suppose any impairment for the goodwill allocated to each country, except for Romania amounting to 9,392 thousands of Euros. 18.

The net investment derivatives are related to the Group CIRS in USD and EUR with EDP Branch as referred in the notes 38 and 39. The net investment derivatives also include Currency forwards in CAD and CIRS in PLN and BRL with EDP with the purpose of hedging EDPR Group's operations in Canada, Poland and Brazil. Interest rate swaps relate to the project finances and have been formalised to convert variable to fixed interest rates. Cash flow hedge power price swaps are related to the hedging of the sales price. EDPR NA has entered into a power price swap to hedge the variability in the spot market prices received for a portion of the production of Maple Ridge I project. Additionally, both EDPR NA and EDPR EU have entered in short term hedges to hedge the short-term volatility of certain un-contracted generation of its wind farms. In certain U.S. power markets, EDPR NA is exposed to congestion and line loss risks, which typically have a negative impact on the price received for power generated in these markets. To economically hedge these risk exposures, EDPR NA entered into Financial Transmission Rights (“FTR”) and a three year fixed for floating Locational Marginal Price (LMP) swap. The trading derivative financial instruments are derivatives contracted for economic hedging that are not eligible for hedge accounting. These include a USD/EUR forward contract with EDP Servicios Financieros used to mitigate the exchange rate risk arising from the net assets in USD, as a complement of the net investment hedge. Fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on quotes indicated by external entities. These entities use discounted cash flows techniques usually accepted and data from public markets. The only exceptions are the CIRS in USD/EUR with EDP Branch and the USD/EUR forward contract with EDP Servicios Financieros, which fair values are determined by the Financial Department of EDP, using the same above-mentioned discounted cash flows techniques and data.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Fair value of financial instruments is based, whenever available, on quoted market prices. Otherwise, fair value is determined through internal models, which are based on generally accepted cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models or through quotations supplied by third parties. Non-standard instruments may require alternative techniques, which consider their characteristics and the generally accepted market practices applicable to such instruments. These models are developed considering the market variables that affect the underlying instrument, namely yield curves, exchange rates and volatility factors. Market data is obtained from generally accepted suppliers of financial data (Bloomberg and Reuters). Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 250 2015 As at 31 December 2015 and 2014, the following table presents the interest rate curves of the major currencies to which the Group is exposed.

Available-for-sale financial instruments and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Listed financial instruments are recognized at fair value based on market prices. The financial instruments for which reliable fair value estimates are not available, are recorded in the statement of financial position at their cost. Cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and suppliers These financial instruments include mainly short term financial assets and liabilities. Given their short term nature at the reporting date, their book values are not significantly different from their fair values. Financial debt The fair value of the financial debt is estimated through internal models, which are based on generally accepted cash flow discounting techniques. At the reporting date, the carrying amount of floating rate loans is approximately their fair value. In case of fixed rate loans, mainly the intercompany loans granted by EDP Group, their fair value is obtained through internal models based on generally accepted discounting techniques. Derivative financial instruments All derivatives are accounted at their fair value. For those which are quoted in organized markets, the respective market price is used. For over-the-counter derivatives, fair value is estimated through the use of internal models based on cash flow discounting techniques and option valuation models generally accepted by the market, or by dealer price quotations. CIRS with EDP Branch (note 36) With the purpose of hedging the foreign exchange risk resulting from the net investment in EDPR NA, the Group entered into a CIRS in USD and EUR with EDP Branch. This financial derivative is presented in the statement of financial position at its fair value, which is estimated by discounting the projected USD and EUR cash flows. The discount rates and forward interest rates were based on the interest rate curves referred to above and the USD/EUR exchange rate is disclosed on note 28. See also notes 13 and 23.

ANNUAL REPORT 252 2015 40. RELEVANT AND SUBSEQUENT EVENTS EDPR informs about wind offshore projects in the UK In July 2015, EDPR through its subsidiary EDPR UK Limited, reached agreements with Repsol Nuevas Energías S.A. (“Repsol”) by which, under the terms of the contracts, EDPR agreed to buy from Repsol 33% equity interest in Moray offshore project, and to sell to Repsol 49% equity interest in Inch Cape offshore project. With the closing of these transactions in January 2016, EDPR fully owns the Moray offshore project, while Repsol fully own the Inch Cape offshore project. Both projects are located in the UK. In January 2010, Moray Offshore Renewable Limited was awarded the right, under a farm leasing programme conducted by The Crown Estate, to develop offshore wind energy in Zone 1 of the Third Offshore Wind Licensing Round (“UK Round 3”) and in March 2014 was granted consent, by the Scottish government, for up to 1,116 MW offshore wind development. The project may be divided in several phases, to allow a proper bidding strategy in the CfD allocation rounds. EDPR informs about an agreement with CTG regarding wind offshore projects in the UK In October 2015, EDPR, through its subsidiary EDPR UK Limited, entered in an Investment Cooperation Agreement with China Three Gorges (Europe) S.A., by which CTG proposes to invest in and develop the Moray wind offshore project, located in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland (Zone 1 of the Crown Estate’s Round 3 programme), alongside with EDPR and other potential investors. Pursuant to the agreement, CTG intends to acquire up to 30% of the equity and shareholder loans directly or indirectly owned by EDPR in the Moray Offshore Renewable Limited in order to participate in the investment, development and operation of the Moray wind offshore project. The transaction is expected to occur in two phases, with CTG investing between 10% to 20% following the announcement of a new Contract for Difference (“CfD”) auction allocation round, and an additional investment of up to 10% subject to MORL be successfully award with a CfD. The transaction is subject to regulatory and third party approvals and other precedent conditions. EDPR announces the sale of minority stakes in Poland and Italy In December 2015, EDPR, through its subsidiary EDP Renewables Europe, S.L. entered into an agreement with ACE Poland S.A.R.L. and ACE Italy S.A.R.L., both of which 100% owned by ACE Investment Fund LP – an entity participated of China Three Gorges Hong Kong Ltd (“CTG HK”), a fully-owned subsidiary of China Three Gorges (“CTG”) – to sell 49% of equity shareholding and shareholder loans in a portfolio of wind assets with 598 MW of capacity in Poland and Italy, for a total consideration of €392 million. The transaction scope covers 392 MW in operation in Poland and 100 MW in Italy, with an average age of 4 years, as well as 107 MW under construction in Poland and in Italy. The transaction is subject to the customary regulatory and other approvals and is expected to be completed within the first half of 2016. The agreement reached today is made in the context of the €2bn strategic partnership established in Dec-11 between EDPR’s principal shareholder, EDP – Energias de Portugal, S.A., and CTG. EDP Renováveis signs agreement to acquire licenses for 216 MW of wind energy in Portugal On 7 October 2015, EDP Renováveis S.A. (EDPR), 77.5% controlled by EDP, informed that it has reached an agreement with Ventinveste S.A. (Ventinveste), a consortium led by Galp Energia, SGPS, S.A. and Martifer, SGPS, S.A., for the acquisition of a group of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that hold licenses and interconnection rights corresponding to a total of 216.4 MW of wind energy capacity in Portugal, for a reference price of approximaly 17 millions of Euros. This wind energy capacity was awarded with a long-term feed-in tariff in 2007, under the Phase B of a tender launched by the Portuguese Government. Following the agreement reached between the Portuguese Government and several operators in the wind energy sector in September 2012, the 216.4 MW will be remunerated according to a feed in-tariff for a 20-year period (or a maximum of 44 GWh/MW). With this transaction EDPR intends to maximize the value created from projects since the early stages of development by applying its distinctive technical and wind assessment know-how. The commissioning and beginning of operations of EDPR’s new wind farms is expected to occur until 2018. EDPR executes a new asset rotation transaction in the US During the last quarter of 2015, EDP Renovaveis S.A., reached an agreement with a consortium of investors led by Axium Infrastructure (Axium), to sell a minority cash equity interest in a US wind portfolio with a total production capacity of 1,002 MW. Axium’s interest in the portfolio will represent 340MW and is the third asset rotation transaction announced by EDPR with Axium, further strengthening the existing partnership. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 253 The portfolio is comprised of 6 operating wind farms. All of the wind farms have long-term offtake agreements in place. Based on the i) the transaction price and ii) the outstanding and expected tax equity liabilities of the projects, the total enterprise value on the 340 MW portfolio amounts to US 590 million translating to 1.7 million of US dollar/MW Fiera Axium funded $307.5 million in January 2016 after all assets involved had achieved commercial operations. EDPR informs about new institutional partnerships structures in the US In October 2015, EDPR has secured $238 million of institutional equity financing from an affiliate of Google Inc. , in exchange for an interest in the 199 MW Waverly wind project located in the State of Kansas, US. The project, currently under-construction, will sell its output through a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement. Under the agreement, Google will invest its funds close to the project's start of operations, which is scheduled to occur by the end of 2015. This institutional partnership structure is EDPR’s largest one with just one underlying project, In November 2015, EDPR has secured $116 million of institutional equity financing from MUFG Union Bank N.A. and another leading institutional investor, in exchange for an interest in the 100 MW Arbuckle wind project, located in the State of Oklahoma. The project will sell its output through a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement. The establishment of institutional partnership structures enables EDPR to efficiently utilize the tax benefits generated by the projects, improving the project's economics and maintaining its self-funding strategic pillar. EDPR secures new PPAs for 100 MW wind farm in the US In December 2015, EDPR, through its fully owned subsidiary EDP Renewable North America LLC, signed longterm Power Purchase Agreements (“PPAs”) with commercial and industrial corporations, to sell the energy produced by 100 MW from Hidalgo wind farm extension. Hidalgo wind farm project had initially secured two PPAs totalling 150 MW, as announced in Apr-2014. The project, that will now total 250 MW, is located in the State of Texas and is expected to be installed in 2016. EDPR is awarded long-term contract for 140 MW at Brazilian energy auction In November 2015, EDPR, through its subsidiary EDP Renováveis Brasil, S.A., secured a 20-year Power Purchase Agreements (“PPA”) at the Brazilian energy LER 2015 auction to sell electricity in the regulated market. The energy will be produced by a 140 MW wind farm to be installed in the Brazilian State of Bahia with operations expected for 2018. The initial price of the long term contract was set at R$199.37/MWh, indexed to the Brazilian inflation rate. With this new contract, EDPR has already secured PPAs for 377 MW of wind energy projects in Brazil (currently under construction/development) to start operations in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The successful outcome from this auction reinforces EDPR presence in a market with a low risk profile through the establishment of long term PPA, attractive wind resource and strong prospects for the wind sector in the medium and long term. EDP Renováveis awarded with 93 MW in the Spanish renewable energy auction In January 2016, EDPR was awarded with rights for the pre-registry of 93 MW of wind energy capacity in Spain. Following the outcome of the auction, the awarded capacity will be remunerated according with the Spanish wholesale market and could be installed until 2020. EDPR has already identified, within its pipeline, specific competitive projects with high load factors that could be allocated to this awarded capacity.

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS USED Standards, amendments and interpretations issued effective for the Group The new interpretation that has been issued and is already effective and that the EDPR Group has applied on its consolidated financial statements is the following: • IFRIC 21 Levies The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in May 2013, IFRIC 21 Levies, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 17 June 2014, being allowed its early adoption. This interpretation clarifies that: a levy is an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits that is imposed by governments on entities, in accordance with legislation; the recognition of the liability corresponds to the payment of a levy that results from the activity that triggers the payment of the levy, as identified by the legislation (obligating event). The adoption of this interpretation does not impact the amounts presented on the annual consolidated financial statements, but only the amounts that were presented on the condensed consolidated financial statements of 2015. The Group has performed an assessment on the impacts of the adoption of this interpretation concluding that the adoption of this Standard does not affect the figures presented in the Annual Consolidated Financial Statements, but rather, only those published on an interim basis. As a consequence, no restatement is applicable for the Annual Consolidated Statement of 2015. The new standards and interpretations that have been issued and are already effective and that the Group has applied on its consolidated financial statements with no significant impact are the following: • Annual Improvement Project (2011-2013) Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group The standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group, which impact is being evaluated, are the following: ● IFRS 9 Financial Instruments The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in November 2009, IFRS 9 Financial instruments part I: Classification and measurement, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, being allowed its early adoption. This standard, changed in July 2014, has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard is included in the IASB's comprehensive project to replace IAS 39 and relates to issues of classification and measurement of financial assets. The main issues considered are as follows: the financial assets can be classified in two categories: at amortised cost or at fair value. This decision will be made upon the initial recognition of the financial assets. Its classification depends on how the entity presents these financial assets and the contractual cash flows associated to each financial asset in the business; debt instruments can only be measured at amortised cost when the contractual cash-flows represent only principal and interest payments, which means that it contains only basic loan features, and for which an entity holds the asset to collect the contractual cash flows. All the other debt instruments are recognised at fair value; equity instruments issued by third parties are recognised at fair value with subsequent changes recognised in the profit and loss. However an entity could irrevocably select equity instruments at initial recognition for which fair value changes and the realised gain or loss are recognised in fair value reserves. Gains and losses recognised in fair value reserves cannot be recycled to profit and loss. This is a discretionary decision, and does not imply that all the equity instruments should be treated on this basis. The dividends received are recognised as income for the year; the exemption that allows unquoted equity investments and related derivatives to be measured at cost, under IAS 39, is not allowed under IFRS 9; and changes in fair value attributable to own credit risk of financial liabilities classified as fair value through profit or loss, shall be recognised in Other comprehensive income. The remaining fair value changes related to these financial liabilities shall be recognised through profit or loss. The amounts recognised in Other comprehensive income shall not be reclassified/transferred to profit and loss. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 255 ● IFRS 11 (Amended) Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2014, IFRS 11 (Amended) Accounting for acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment introduces guidance on accounting that should be made in the acquisition of participation in joint operations that qualifies as a business, by applying the principles of IFRS 3 Business Combinations. ● IFRS 15 Revenue from the Contracts with Customers The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in May 2014, IFRS 15 Revenue from the Contracts with Customers, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, being allowed its early adoption. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This new standard presents the principles that shall be applied by an entity in order to provide more useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, term and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from a contract with a client. The core principle of IFRS 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, as provided in the 5 steps methodology. The 5 steps methodology consists in the following steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations; and (v) recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ● IFRS 16 – Leases The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in January 2016, IFRS 16 Leases, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted for entities that have also adopted IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard has not yet been adopted by the European Union. This standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases, and supersedes IAS 17 Leases and its associated interpretative guidance. The objective is to ensure that lessees and lessors provide relevant information to the users of financial statements, namely about the effect that leases have on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity. The main issues considered are as follows: inclusion of some considerations in order to distinguish leases from service contracts, based on the existence of control of the underlying asset at the time that it is available for use by the lessee; and introduction of a single lessee accounting model that requires a lessee to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value. A lessee is required to recognise a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying leased asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. As a consequence, a lessee recognises depreciation costs and interest costs separately. ● IAS 1 (Amended) Disclosure Initiative Amendments to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), issued in December 2014, IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, being allowed its early adoption. This amendment has not yet been adopted by the European Union. The following narrow scope amendments have been made to IAS1: Materiality and aggregation: clarifies that an entity should not obscure useful information by aggregating our disaggregating information; and that materiality considerations apply to the primary statements, notes and any specific disclosure requirements in IFRSs, i.e. disclosures specifically required by IFRSs need to be provided only if the information is material; Statement of Financial Position and Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income: clarifies that the list of line items specified by IAS 1 for these statements can be disaggregated as relevant. Additional guidance has been on the presentation of subtotals in these statements; Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 256 2015 Presentation of items of Other Comprehensive Income ( OCI ): clarifies that an entity's share of OCI of equity-accounted a in associates and joint ventures should be presented in aggregate as single line items based on whether or not it will subsequently be reclassified to profit or loss; Notes: clarifies that entities have the flexibility when designing the structure of the notes and provides guidance on how to determine a systematic order of the notes. • IAS 7 (Amended) Disclosure Initiative The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued, in January 2016, amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows, with effective date of mandatory application for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, being allowed its early adoption. These amendments require an entity to provide disclosures that enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from financing activities, including both changes arising from cash flows and noncash changes, such as: Changes from financing cash flows; Changes arising from obtaining or losing control of subsidiaries or other businesses; The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates; or Changes in fair values. These disclosures may be presented by providing a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the statement of financial position for liabilities arising from financing activities. The standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective for the Group with no significant impact are the following: ● IFRS 10 (Amended) and IAS 28 (Amended) Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture ● IFRS 10 (Amended), IFRS 12 (Amended) and IAS 28 (Amended) Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception ● IFRS 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts ● IAS 16 (Amended) and IAS 38 (Amended) Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation ● Annual Improvement Project (2010-2012) ● Annual Improvement Project (2012-2014) 42. ENVIRONMENT ISSUES Expenses of environmental nature are the expenses that were identified and incurred to avoid, reduce or repair damages of an environmental nature that result from the Group's normal activity. These expenses are booked in the income statement of the year, except if they qualify to be recognised as an asset, according to IAS 16. During the year, the environmental expenses recognised in the income statement in the amount of 3,467 thousands of Euros (31 December 2014: 2,849 thousands of Euros) refer to costs with the environmental management plan. As referred in accounting policy 2o), the Group has established provisions for dismantling and decommissioning of property, plant and equipment when a legal or contractual obligation exists to dismantle and decommission those assets at the end of their useful lives. Consequently, the Group has booked provisions for property, plant and equipment related to electricity wind generation for the responsibilities of restoring sites and land to its original condition, in the amount of 117,228 thousands of Euros as at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: 96,676 thousands of Euros) (see note 31). Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 257 43. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS Asset Split ENEOP In 2006, EDPR Group (through its subsidiary EDP Renováveis Portugal) entered into a joint business with Generg, Finerge (together with EDPR the Wind Promoters ) and Enercom to develop 1,200 Mw of renewable energy in Portugal. At that moment it was agreed that at the time that all the assets would be in production, the Consortium (ENEOP) would be splited once the pertinent authorities would authorize it. The consortium (ENEOP), through two different subsidiaries fully held by ENEOP, carried the following two activities connected with the industrial and wind farm project: ENEOP 2: construction, maintenance and exploitation of the wind farms; ENEOP 3: construction and exploitation of the industrial part of the project. It was agreed that the split will be performed on three steps: ● Merger of Eneop 2 and Eneop; ● Demerger of ENEOP, with its dissolution, and incorporation of 4 NewCos (that issue shares to all the shareholders of ENEOP on a proportional basis), to which each one of the respective portfolios of wind farm SPVs and ENEOP 3 are transferred; and ● Cross-sell disposal of the investment in the NewCos between the wind promoters and Enercon, such that each owns 100% of the respective portfolio of wind farm SPVs (in respect to the WPs) and ENEOP 3 (regarding Enercon). On September 19th, even though the above transactions were not yet been legally performed, all the conditions needed for the asset split to be performed were obtained, namely, the approval and authorisation of the competition authority (AdC), Direção Geral de Energia e Geologia (DGEG) and banks (BEI and commercial banks). This, together with the shareholders agreement signed between the wind promoters and the change of the corporate bodies of the SPVs, gave EDPR the effective control over the agreed EDPR portfolio, as the pending issues to be closed for the legal Asset Split to take place were not relevant in terms of control assesment. For simplification purposes, and considering this does not have a material effect, the Group used the financial statements as at 31st of August, 2015, of the twelve companies, to determine pre-acquisition results and, consequently, these companies have been fully consolidated from the 1st of September, 2015. As of 31st December 2015 all the transactions have been legally closed so that the Asset Split process is legally finished. Since the date of acquisition of full control over this portfolio, it has contributed to the consolidated financial statements with Revenues from energy sales in the amount of 33,917 thousands of Euros and with a Net profit for the period (attributable to Equity holders of EDPR) in the amount of 4,148 thousands of Euros. If this acquisition had occurred in the beginning of the exercise, it would have contributed to the consolidated financial statements with Revenues from energy sales in the amount of 102,698 thousands of Euros and with a Net profit for the period (attributable to Equity holders of EDPR) in the amount of 11,777 thousands of Euros, referring to the twelve-month period ended at 31 December 2015. Until the date in which the control was obtained, the shareholding previously held was being included in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method, therefore the result was incorporated under this method until this date in the amount of 5,986 thousands of Euros. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 258 2015 At the acquisition date, EDPR Group has determined the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on a valuation performed by an independent third party. This valuation, which was based on the discounted cashflow method, came to an equity fair value of the portfolio in which EDPR takes control in the amount of 230,791 thousands of Euros . Fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date is presented as follows: THOUSANDS OF EUROS BOOK VALUE AT FAIR VALUE FAIR VALUE AT ACQUISITION DATE ADJUSTMENT ACQUISITION DATE Assets Property, plant and equipment 594,492 249,671 844,163 Intangible assets 22,436 22,436 Deferred Tax assets 2,621 2,621 Inventories 299 299 Other debtors and other assets 31,608 31,608 Cash and cash equivalents 99,147 99,147 Total Assets 750,603 249,671 1,000,274 Liabilities Financial Debt 250,805 250,805 Provisions 7,361 7,361 Other liabilities and other payables 455,798 55,519 511,317 Total Liabilities 713,964 55,519 769,483 Net assets 36,639 194,152 230,791 Gain with the remeasurement to fair value of the previously held investment in Eneop (netted of the cash-compensation) 124,750 Control acquisition gain at EDPR level 124,750 Acquisition cashflow: Cash and cash equivalents of Eneop 99,147 Acquisition payment -50,497 Net cash outflow 48,650 The cash compensation was paid at the legal asset split transaction. The above mentioned Eneop's valuation has determined a fair value for Property, plant and equipment in the amount of 844,163 thousand Euros, based on discounted cash-flows method, generating a fair value adjustment of 249,671 thousand Euros and a corresponding deferred tax liability in the amount of 55,519 thousand Euros (see note 15 and 19). As EDPR Group had already a 35,95% stake in Eneop, this transaction was treated as a step acquisition under IFRS 3. Consequently, the previously held investment in Eneop was remeasured to fair value, and the corresponding difference for its book value, was recorded under Other income (see note 8). The total impact of the transaction gain also include the transfer to results of cash flow hedge reserves previously recognised under Other comprehensive income at EDPR level, in the amount of 11,955 thousand Euros. Acquisition-related costs were expensed and are recognised under Supplies and services, in the amount of 837 thousands of Euros. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ENERGY WITH INTELLIGENCE 259 Other information for business combinations included in 2015 During 2015 the EDPR Group has paid an amount of 159,318 thousands of Euros (31 December 2014: 19,790 thousands of Euros) with the following breakdown: Acquisition of the ENEOP portfolio (see note 43): 50,497 thousands of Euros Acquisition of non-controlling interests: 71,416 thousands of Euros which includes 45,781 thousands of Euros corresponding to the acquisition of the non-controlling interests in EDPR Brazil (see note 5). Advanced payments on acquisitions: 22,467 thousands of Euros for the acquisition of the Italian project Banzi by EDP Renewables Italia SRL and 1,500 thousands of Euros for the acquisition of the Portuguese project Ventinveste by EDP Renewables SGPS, S.A.

OPERATING SEGMENTS REPORT The Group generates energy from renewable resources and has three reportable segments which are the Group’s business platforms, Europe, North America and Brazil. The strategic business units have operations in different geographic zones and are managed separately because their characteristics are quite different. For each of the strategic business units, the Group’s CEO reviews internal management reports on at least a quarterly basis. Notes to the Consolidated Annual Accounts for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014. ANNUAL REPORT 260 2015 The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as described in note 3. Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is included in Annex 2. Performance is based on segment operating profit measures, as included in the internal management reports that are reviewed by the Management. Segment operating profit is used to measure performance as management believes that such information is the most relevant in evaluating the results of certain segments relative to other entities that operate within these industries. Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arm’s length basis. A business segment is an identifiable component of the Group, aimed at providing a single product or service, or a group of related products or services, and it is subject to risks and returns that can be distinguished from those of other business segments. The Group generates energy from renewable sources in several locations and its activity is managed based on the following business segments: ● Europe: refers to EDPR EU Group companies operating in Spain, Portugal, Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Romania and United Kingdom; ● North America: refers to EDPR NA and EDPR Canada Group companies that operate in United States of America and Canada, respectively; ● Brazil: refers to EDPR Brasil Group companies that operate in this country. Segment definition The amounts reported in each business segment result from the aggregation of the subsidiaries and business units defined in each segment perimeter, including the intra-segment eliminations, without any inter-segment allocation adjustment. The financial information disclosed by each business segment is determined based on the amounts booked directly in the subsidiaries that compose the segment, including the intra-segment eliminations, without any inter-segment allocation adjustment. 45.
