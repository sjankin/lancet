Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements issued in French and it is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Group’s management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2015, on: c the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Faurecia; c the justification of our assessments; c the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I – Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group at December 31, 2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. II – Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of Article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: c Note 1.B.2 to the consolidated financial statements describes the criteria applied to classify and recognize discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. Our work consisted in verifying the correct application of this accounting principle and ensuring that the appropriate information is provided in Note 1.B.2 and Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements, “Net assets held for sale and discontinued activities”; c your group performs impairment tests on goodwill at each reporting date and also assesses whether fixed assets show any indication of impairment, based on the methods described in notes 10 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements. We have reviewed the methods used to carry out these impairment tests as well as the corresponding assumptions applied by your group; c Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements concerning deferred taxes specifies that deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be utilized. Our work consisted in verifying that this method has been correctly applied and in reviewing the assumptions supporting the probability of recovery of these deferred income tax assets; Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 225 9 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements Statutory Auditors’ report on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements c as part of our assessment of the accounting principles used by your group, we verified the methods used to capitalize and amortize development costs. We also verified the recoverable amount of these assets and the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III – Specific verification As required by law and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

Say on Pay (5th and 6th resolutions) The elements of compensation due or granted to Mr. Yann Delabrière for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and that are put to shareholders for their opinion are set out in the table below: Amounts or Components of compensation due accounting or granted for the ﬁscal year ended valuation put December 31, 2015 to the vote Presentation Fixed compensation €800,000.04 Mr. Delabrière’s ﬁxed compensation was increased to €800,000 as from the (amount paid) 2015 ﬁscal year by decision of the Board of Directors taken on February 11, 2015. Previously, it had been set at €700,000 as from the 2011 ﬁscal year by decision of the Board of Directors taken on February 7, 2011 and had not changed until that time. The Board of Directors decided to increase his compensation based on the following: c a review of the situation of a representative sample of listed manufacturers comparable to Faurecia revealed a signiﬁcant discrepancy (more than 10%) compared to the ﬁxed compensation paid to Mr. Delabrière; c Mr. Delabrière’s ﬁxed compensation had remained the same since 2011; and c the financial results for the 2014 fiscal year provided proof of the implementation of a mediumand long-term strategy for Faurecia and an organizational structure adapted to this strategy. 278 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Explanatory notes to the resolutions 11 Amounts or Components of compensation due accounting or granted for the ﬁscal year ended valuation put December 31, 2015 to the vote Presentation Annual variable compensation €1,380,000 At its meeting of February 11, 2015, the Board set the procedure for determining (amount paid in Mr. Delabrière’s variable compensation for 2015. respect of 2015) His variable compensation is determined depending on whether he reaches quantitative targets, in which case he is entitled to variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of his ﬁxed compensation. Qualitative targets have also been set in addition to quantitative targets. If some or all of these quantitative targets are met, the qualitative targets met are used to determine a potential multiplier of the quantitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. As a result, if a quantitative target is 0, no qualitative target multiplier will apply. Mr. Delabrière’s total variable compensation can range from 0 to 180% of his annual ﬁxed compensation. This variable component is paid to Mr. Delabrière once the Board of Directors has conﬁrmed that the relevant results have been achieved. The quantitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 11, 2015 are linked to the operating margin and free cash ﬂow: c Mr. Delabrière is entitled to variable compensation of between 0 and 150% (maximum percentage) of his ﬁxed compensation, depending on the operating margin set with reference to the 2015 budget. Forty per cent of his variable compensation is based on the operating margin; c Mr. Delabrière is entitled to variable compensation of between 0 and 150% (maximum percentage) of his ﬁxed compensation, depending on the free cash ﬂow set with reference to the 2015 budget. Sixty per cent of his variable compensation is based on free cash ﬂow. The expected levels of achievement of these targets were set by the Board of Directors with reference to the 2015 budget but are not made public for conﬁdentiality reasons. The qualitative targets set by the Board of Directors concern the following: c effective management of the switch to the new senior management structure (criterion with a weighting of 25%); c definition of the phases of completion of Faurecia’s strategy (criterion with a weighting of 25%); c completion of cross-functional strategic projects: Being Faurecia; digital company; factory of the future; strategic innovation (criterion with a weighting of 25%); and c the strategy in Asia with the expansion of business and strengthening of relationships with Asian manufacturers (criterion with a weighting of 25%). Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 279 11 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Explanatory notes to the resolutions Amounts or Components of compensation due accounting or granted for the ﬁscal year ended valuation put December 31, 2015 to the vote Presentation Annual variable compensation On a recommendation made by the Appointments and Compensation Committee on February 4, 2016, at its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors reviewed the extent to which the quantitative criteria had been met: c as regards the criterion linked to the operating margin, the Board of Directors formally noted that 150% of this initial quantitative objective had been reached; and c as regards the criterion linked to free cash ﬂow, the Board of Directors formally noted that 150% of this second quantitative objective had been reached. As a result of these two achievements, 150% of targets according to the scale adopted by the Board of Directors were reached: Mr. Delabrière is therefore entitled to quantitative variable compensation of €1,200,000 before the achievement of qualitative targets is reviewed. The Board of Directors then reviewed the achievement of each of the four qualitative targets described above: c as regards the effective management of the switch to the new senior management structure, based on the decisions made in terms of governance, rotation, implementation of the rotation and management of the changeover plan, the Board of Directors estimated that 120% of this criterion had been met; c as regards the deﬁnition of the phases of completion of Faurecia’s strategy, based notably on the strategic presentation given by management to the Board in October 2015 and the importance of the proposed sale of the business of the Business Group Faurecia Automotive Exteriors, the Board of Directors estimated that 120% of this criterion had been met; c as regards the completion of cross-functional strategic projects (Being Faurecia; digital company; factory of the future; and strategic innovation), based on the presentations given by management at the Board meetings held in October and December 2015, the Board of Directors estimated that 100% of this criterion had been met; and c as regards the strategy in Asia with the expansion of business and strengthening of relationships with Asian manufacturers, based on the presentation given by management at the Board meeting held in December 2015 concerning implementation of the partnership with Dongfeng in particular, the Board of Directors estimated that 120% of this criterion had been met. As a result, the Board of Directors felt that the standard achieved in relation to these four qualitative targets was such that a multiplier of 1.15 should apply to the two quantitative targets. On this basis, at its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors decided that for 2015, Mr. Delabrière’s variable compensation should equate to 150% x 1.15, i.e. 172.5%, of his ﬁxed compensation for 2015, i.e., the sum of €1,380,000.

These 55,798 shares correspond to 0.04% of the capital as of December 31, 2015. The Board of Directors made the deﬁnitive acquisition of these shares contingent on the following: c the acquisition of 60% of the shares was made contingent on an internal performance objective linked to the Group’s net pre-tax income as of December 31, 2017, before taking into account any capital gains on sales of assets and changes in scope, as set by the Board of Directors compared to the same income for the same ﬁscal year according to the Group’s medium-term plan examined by the Board of Directors on the share allotment date; and c the acquisition of 40% of the shares was made contingent on an external objective based on an increase in net income per Faurecia share assessed between 2014 and 2017 and compared to the average growth of a reference global group of car manufacturers in the same period. If these performance requirements laid down in plan number 7 have been met in full at the end of the 2017 ﬁscal year, Mr. Delabrière will be allotted the maximum 55,798 shares.

The elements of compensation due or granted to Mr. Patrick Koller, Deputy Chief Executive Officer since February 2, 2015, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and that are put to shareholders for their opinion are set out in the table below: Amounts or Components of compensation due accounting or granted for the ﬁscal year ended valuation put December 31, 2015 to the vote Presentation Fixed compensation €568,333.37 Mr. Koller’s annual ﬁxed compensation was set at €620,000 by the Board (amount paid to of Directors at its meetings of December 9, 2014 and February 11, 2015. Mr. Koller in This compensation was set based on an examination of the situation of connection with a representative sample of listed manufacturers comparable to Faurecia. his corporate office as from February 2, 2015) 282 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Explanatory notes to the resolutions 11 Amounts or Components of compensation due accounting or granted for the ﬁscal year ended valuation put December 31, 2015 to the vote Presentation Annual variable compensation €784,290 At its meetings of December 9, 2014 and February 11, 2015, the Board of (amount paid in Directors set the terms and conditions for determining Mr. Patrick Koller’s respect of 2015) variable compensation for 2015. His variable compensation is determined depending on whether he reaches quantitative targets, in which case he is entitled to variable compensation ranging from 0 to 150% of 80% of his ﬁxed compensation. The Board of Directors has also set qualitative targets in addition to quantitative targets. If some or all of these quantitative targets are met, the qualitative targets met are used to determine a potential multiplier of the quantitative targets of between 0.70 and 1.20. As a result, if a quantitative target is 0, no qualitative target multiplier will apply. Mr. Koller’s total variable compensation can range from 0 to 144% of his annual ﬁxed compensation. This variable component is paid to Mr. Koller once the Board of Directors has conﬁrmed that the relevant results have been achieved. The quantitative targets set by the Board of Directors on February 11, 2015 are identical to those set for Mr. Delabrière and are linked to operating margin and free cash ﬂow: c Mr. Koller is entitled to variable compensation of between 0 and 150% (maximum percentage) of 80% of his ﬁxed compensation, depending on the operating margin set with reference to the 2015 budget. Forty per cent of his variable compensation is based on the operating margin; c Mr. Koller is entitled to variable compensation of between 0 and 150% (maximum percentage) of 80% of his ﬁxed compensation, depending on the free cash ﬂow set with reference to the 2015 budget. Sixty per cent of his variable compensation is based on free cash ﬂow. The expected levels of achievement of these targets were set by the Board of Directors with reference to the 2015 budget but are not made public for conﬁdentiality reasons. The qualitative targets set by the Board of Directors concern the following: c effective management of the switch to the new senior management structure (criterion with a weighting of 25%); c deﬁnition of the phases of completion of Faurecia’s strategy (criterion with a weighting of 25%); c completion of cross-functional strategic projects: Being Faurecia; digital company; factory of the future; strategic innovation (criterion with a weighting of 25%); and Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 283 11 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Explanatory notes to the resolutions Amounts or Components of compensation due accounting or granted for the ﬁscal year ended valuation put December 31, 2015 to the vote Presentation Annual variable compensation c the reorganization of business in North America (criterion with a weighting of 25%). On a recommendation made by the Appointments and Compensation Committee on February 4, 2016, at its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors reviewed the extent to which the quantitative criteria had been met: c as regards the criterion linked to the operating margin, the Board of Directors formally noted that 150% of this initial quantitative objective had been reached; and c as regards the criterion linked to free cash flow, the Board of Directors formally noted that 150% of this second quantitative objective had been reached. As a result of these two achievements, 150% of targets according to the scale adopted by the Board of Directors were reached: Mr. Koller is therefore entitled to quantitative variable compensation of €852,489 before the achievement of qualitative targets is reviewed. The Board of Directors then reviewed the achievement of each of the four qualitative targets described above: c as regards the effective management of the switch to the new senior management structure, based on the decisions made in terms of governance, rotation, implementation of the rotation and management of the changeover plan, the Board of Directors estimated that 120% of this criterion had been met; c as regards the deﬁnition of the phases of completion of Faurecia’s strategy, based notably on the strategic presentation given by management to the Board in October 2015 and the importance of the proposed sale of the business of the Business Group Faurecia Automotive Exteriors, the Board of Directors estimated that 120% of this criterion had been met; c as regards the completion of cross-functional strategic projects (Being Faurecia; digital company; factory of the future; and strategic innovation), based on the presentations given by management at the Board meetings held in October and December 2015, the Board of Directors estimated that 100% of this criterion had been met; and c as regards the reorganization of business in North America, based on the excellent results obtained in this region in 2015 as well as the structural changes implemented in 2015, the Board of Directors estimated that 120% of this criterion had been met. As a result, the Board of Directors felt that the standard achieved in relation to these four qualitative targets was such that a multiplier of 1.15 should apply to the two quantitative targets. On this basis, at its meeting of February 10, 2016, the Board of Directors decided that for 2015, Mr. Koller’s variable compensation should equate to 80% x 150% x 1.15, i.e. 138%, of his ﬁxed compensation for 2015, i.e., the sum of €784,290.

These 26,383 shares correspond to 0.01% of the capital as of December 31, 2015. The Board of Directors made the deﬁnitive acquisition of these shares contingent on the following: c the acquisition of 60% of the shares was made contingent on an internal performance objective linked to the Group’s net pre-tax income as of December 31, 2017, before taking into account any capital gains on sales of assets and changes in scope, as set by the Board of Directors compared to the same income for the same ﬁscal year according to the Group’s medium-term plan examined by the Board of Directors on the share allotment date; and c the acquisition of 40% of the shares was made contingent on an external objective based on an increase in net income per Faurecia share assessed between 2014 and 2017 and compared to the average growth of a reference global group of car manufacturers in the same period. If these performance requirements laid down in plan number 7 have been met in full at the end of the 2017 ﬁscal year, Mr. Koller will be allotted the maximum 26,383 shares.

These two plans are always open to all Group executives who, upon their retirement, have at least 5 years’ seniority (deﬁned-beneﬁt plan) or at least 1 year’s seniority (deﬁned-contribution plan). The above plan, of which Mr. Koller is a beneﬁciary, was authorized by the Board of Directors on April 13, 2016 and will be put to shareholders for approval at their General Meeting to be held in 2017. 286 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Explanatory notes to the resolutions 11 Components of compensation due or granted for the ﬁscal year ended December 31, 2015 voted by shareholders at a General Meeting in connection with the procedure applicable to regulated agreements Amounts put and undertakings to the vote Presentation Additional deﬁned-beneﬁt No payment This plan, which was implemented by decision of the Board of Directors pension plan made during taken on February 11, 2015, is for the beneﬁt of Executive Committee the ﬁscal year members who have an employment contract in progress or that has been suspended and who have sat on the Executive Committee for a minimum term of three consecutive calendar years from the date the plan was implemented or from the date they joined the Executive Committee. Beneﬁciaries are also required to pursue the rest of their career within the Faurecia group. Faurecia guarantees beneficiaries an annual pension determined according to the Company’s operating income and budget approved by the Board of Directors according to the following formula: ∑ Xi * R R = annual reference compensation Xi = entitlement for each year of seniority (i) equal to: c 3% if the operating income for the year is strictly more than 105% of the budgeted operating income c 2% if the operating income for the year is between 95% and 105% of the budgeted operating income c 1% if the operating income for the year is strictly less than 95% of the budgeted operating income The operating income for year N is defined based on the income statement as of 12/31/N approved by the Board of Directors in year N+1 and the initial budget for year N approved by the Board of Directors in year N-1. Each year, the Board of Directors therefore decides how much should be granted, following approval of the ﬁnancial statements. In any event, on retirement, the annual pension paid under this plan plus any rights granted by other supplementary plans implemented by the Faurecia group are subject to two limits: c the sums paid by the Faurecia group must not exceed 25% of the reference compensation; and c the sums paid by the Faurecia group will be capped at 8 times the annual social security limit (€304,320 in 2015). Should either of these limits be exceeded, the relevant pension will be reduced accordingly.

INDEPENDENT VERIFIER’S REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT This is a free translation into English of the original report issued in the French language and it is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders, In our quality as an independent verifier accredited by the COFRAC (1), under the number n° 3-1050, and as a member of the network of one of the Statutory Auditors of the Company Faurecia, we present our report on the consolidated social, environmental and societal information established for the year ended on the December 31, 2015, presented in the management report, hereafter referred to as the “CSR Information,” pursuant to the provisions of the Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Responsibility of the Company It is the responsibility of the Board of Directors to establish a management report including CSR Information referred to in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), in accordance with the protocols used by the Company (hereafter referred to as the “Criteria”), and available on request at the company’s headquarters. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory requirements, the Code of Ethics of our profession as well as the provisions in the Article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). In addition, we have implemented a quality control system, including documented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with ethical standards, professional standards and applicable laws and regulations. Responsibility of the independent verifier It is our role, based on our work: c to attest whether the required CSR Information is present in the management report or, in the case of its omission, that an appropriate explanation has been provided, in accordance with the third paragraph of R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) (Attestation of presence of CSR Information); c to express a limited assurance conclusion, that the CSR Information, overall, is fairly presented, in all material aspects, in according with the Criteria. Our verification work was undertaken by a team of 6 people between September 28, 2015 and our report’s signature date, for an estimated duration of 6 weeks. We conducted the work described below in accordance with the professional standards applicable in France and the Order of May 13, 2013 determining the conditions under which an independent third-party verifier conducts its mission, and in relation to the opinion of fairness and the reasonable assurance report, in accordance with the international standard ISAE 3000 (2). 1. ATTESTATION OF PRESENCE OF CSR INFORMATION Interviews with the management of relevant departments allowed us to obtain an understanding of the Company’s strategy on sustainable development based on the social and environmental consequences linked to the Company’s activities and related to its societal commitments, as well as, where appropriate, resulting actions or programmes. We have compared the information presented in the management report with the list as provided for in the Article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). (1) Scope available at www.cofrac.fr. (2) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements “other than audits or reviews of historical information”. Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 301 11 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Reports In the absence of certain consolidated information, we have verified that the explanations were provided in accordance with the provisions in Article R. 225-105-1, paragraph 3, of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). We verified that the CSR Information covers the consolidated perimeter, namely the entity and its subsidiaries, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the entities which it controls, as aligned with the meaning of the Article L. 233-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) with the limitations specified in the management report. Based on this work, and given the limitations mentioned above we confirm the presence in the management report of the required CSR Information. 2. LIMITED ASSURANCE ON CSR INFORMATION Nature and scope of the work We undertook around 10 interviews with the people responsible for the preparation of the CSR Information in the different departments in charge of the data collection process – Human resources, Committee on legal affairs, Quality, Health, Safety & Environment department (HSE) – in order to: c assess the suitability of the Criteria for reporting, in relation to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality, and understandability, taking into consideration, if relevant, industry standards; c verify the implementation of the process for the collection, compilation, processing and control for completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and identify the procedures for internal control and risk management related to the preparation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of our tests and inspections based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information, in relation to the characteristics of the Company, its social and environmental issues, its strategy in relation to sustainable development and industry best practices. For the CSR Information which we considered the most important (1): c at the level of the parent company, we consulted documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions, etc.), we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, on a test basis, the calculations and the compilation of the information, and also verified their coherence and consistency with the other information presented in the management report; c at the level of the representative selection of entities that we selected (2), based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we undertook interviews to verify the correct application of the procedures and undertook detailed tests on the basis of samples, consisting in verifying the calculations made and linking them with supporting documentation. The sample selected therefore represented on average 15% of the total workforce and between 15 and 23% of the quantitative environmental information. For the other consolidated CSR Information, we assessed their consistency in relation to our knowledge of the Company. Eventually, we assessed the relevance of the explanations provided, if appropriate, in the partial or total absence of certain information. We consider that the sample methods and sizes of the samples that we considered by exercising our professional judgement allow us to express a limited assurance conclusion; an assurance of a higher level would have required more extensive verification work. Due (1) Environmental and societal information: general environmental policy and organization, approaches to evaluation and certification (environmental certification rate), waste generation prevention, waste recycling and disposal (quantity of wastes produced and their distribution by disposal type), measures undertaken to improve energy efficiency (energy consumption, use of renewable energy), GHG emissions, measures undertaken to prevent, reduce or remediate air emissions (emissions of volatile organic compounds), raw materials consumption and measures undertaken to enhance resource efficiency (consumption of recycled plastic), importance of subcontracting and the consideration of environmental and social issues in the purchasing policies and the relations with suppliers and subcontractors. Social information: employment (total headcount and breakdown by contract, gender and geography, hiring and terminations), absenteeism (absenteeism rate), labour relations, health and safety, work accidents (frequency and gravity), total number of trainings, measures undertaken to improve gender equality. (2) BG FAS: Regional Business Unit Mexico for environmental information, Division North America for social indicators, including the sites of Puebla Covers, Puebla JIT (Mexico), and, for the indicators consumption of raw materials and energy consumption, the site of San Luis Potosi (Mexico); BG FIS: Division North America, including the sites of Saline and Fraser (United States of America); BG FAE: site of Marines (France); BG FECT: site of Gladstone (United States of America). 302 Faurecia REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting of May 27, 2016 Reports 11 to the necessary use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent in the functioning of any information and internal control system, the risk of non-detection of a significant anomaly in the CSR Information cannot be entirely eliminated. Conclusion Concerning the indicator “Total number of training hours”, various discrepancies have been identified and can lead to a risk for the consolidated indicator. Concerning the indicator “Metallic raw material consumption,” various discrepancies have been identified for the data collected by one of the Business Groups contributing 63% of the consolidated value.
