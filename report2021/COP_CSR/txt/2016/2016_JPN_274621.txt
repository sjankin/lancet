We will establish a business structure that enables us to fully leverage our strengths in our fields of business, extending from the departures of visitors to Japan, to their stays in Japan, and through their returns home. These initiatives will include the development and sales of tours and travel packages in Travel Services and the promotion of duty-free sales and cross-border e-commerce in Trade and Retail.

Our Management Vision is to be the world’s leading airline group in customer satisfaction and value creation. As such, we are advancing growth strategies, mainly in the Air Transportation business. In the International Passenger Business, we will approach the expansion of slots at Tokyo metropolitan area airports as a business opportunity and expand resort demand. Over five years, we plan to expand capacity to about 1.5 times the level in the fiscal year ended March 2016. We will strengthen overseas sales to capture trilateral demand in the Asia–Pacific region and firm inbound demand. In addition, we will aggressively introduce the Boeing 787, which has exceptional comfort and fuel efficiency; provide a variety of seat classes; and set fares flexibly. In these ways, we will work to foster demand from the perspectives of both products and services. In the Domestic Passenger Business, we will continue the policy of controlling capacity. Our plan is to achieve a small increase in Revenue Passenger-Kilometers (RPKs) by flexibly allocating aircraft, with attention to passenger demand on each route, while directing the substantial inbound demand into domestic services. In the Cargo Business, accompanying the expansion of our international network, over five Osamu Shinobe years we plan to increase capacity to about 1.4 times, mainly through the use of belly space on Member of the Board of Directors, passenger aircraft. We will also move forward with joint ventures with Lufthansa Cargo AG. and ANA HOLDINGS INC. President & Chief Executive Officer, United Airlines and with initiatives to capture trilateral demand. ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. Through these initiatives, we plan to increase operating revenues in the Air Transportation business to ¥1,870.0 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2021, approximately 1.2 times. On the other hand, our policy will be to work to increase profitability through continued cost reduction initiatives. As an indicator to monitor our progress, we will utilize unit cost (operating cost per ASK) in the ANA brand passenger business, which we will aim to reduce by ¥0.2 by the fiscal year ending March 2021. We are forecasting operating income of ¥180.0 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2021, about 1.3 times the level in the fiscal year ended March 2016. We will steadily link growth in our operational scale to profits, while implementing appropriate responses to changes in economic and market conditions. Even as we increase the scale of our operations, I believe it will be important to maintain and improve service quality. Our group is dedicated to increasing the quality of service provided to customers by its staff members in a wide range of scenarios, and continues to implement improvement initiatives that reflect consideration for diversifying needs. As an airline in Japan, we are rigorously focusing on customer needs, enhancing boarding procedures and lounge services, and increasing the multi-lingual skills of staff members in order to implement heartfelt hospitality. Through improvements in quality, we will further establish the ANA brand and differentiate the group from its competitors. Moving forward, we will continue to provide safe, comfortable air transportation while maintaining the world’s highest rating for service. 38 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C .

A N N UA L R E PO RT 2016 111 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements ANA HOLDINGS INC. and its consolidated subsidiaries 1. Basis of presenting consolidated financial statements The accompanying consolidated financial statements of ANA HOLDINGS INC. (hereinafter referred to as “the company”) and its consolidated subsidiaries are prepared on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, which are different in certain respects as to the application and disclosure requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and are compiled from the consolidated financial statements prepared by the company as required by the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan. In preparing the accompanying financial statements, certain reclassifications have been made to the financial statements issued domestically in order to present them in a form which is more familiar to readers outside Japan. In addition, the notes to consolidated financial statements include information which is not required under accounting principles and practices generally accepted in Japan but are presented herein as additional information. 2. Summary of significant accounting policies (a) Principles of consolidation and accounting for investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and all of its significant subsidiaries (62 subsidiaries for 2016 and 64 subsidiaries for 2015). All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in certain subsidiaries and significant affiliates (18 companies for 2016 and for 2015) are accounted for by the equity method. The difference between the cost and the underlying net equity in the net assets at dates of acquisition of consolidated subsidiaries and companies accounted for by the equity method is amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 5 to 15 years. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates which are not consolidated or accounted for by the equity method (82 companies for 2016 and 79 companies for 2015) are stated at cost. The equity in undistributed earnings of these companies was not significant. Certain subsidiaries have fiscal years ending on December 31 and February 29, and necessary adjustments for significant transactions, if any, are made on consolidation. (b) Foreign currency translation Receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except payables and receivables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts, and differences arising from the translation are included in the consolidated statement of income. The balance sheet accounts of foreign consolidated subsidiaries are translated into yen at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, except for the components of net assets excluding non-controlling interests which are translated at their historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange in effect during the year. Differences arising from the translation are presented as translation adjustments and non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. (c) Marketable securities and investment securities The accounting standard for financial instruments requires that securities be classified into three categories: trading, held-to-maturity or other securities. Under the standard, trading securities are carried at fair value and held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost. Marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized holding gain or loss, net of the applicable income taxes, included directly in net assets. Non-marketable securities classified as other securities are carried at cost. Cost of securities sold is determined by the moving average method. See Note 4. (d) Allowance for doubtful receivables Allowance for doubtful accounts is provided based on past experience for normal receivables and on an estimate of the collectability of receivables from companies in financial difficulty. (e) Inventories Inventories include aircraft spare parts, supplies and stock in trade of consolidated subsidiaries. These are stated at cost principally based on the moving average method. Net book value of inventories in the consolidated balance sheet is written down when its net realizable value declines. 112 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . (f) Property and equipment and depreciation (excluding leased assets) Property and equipment excluding leased assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Ground property and equipment includes ¥49,612 million ($440,291 thousand) and ¥51,813 million of land at March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Depreciation of property and equipment is computed based on estimated useful lives by the following methods: Aircraft ................................................... Straight-line method Buildings ................................................ Straight-line method Other ground property and equipment ..... Straight-line method The company and certain subsidiaries employ principally the following useful lives, based upon the company’s estimated durability: Aircraft ................................................... 9 – 20 years Buildings ................................................ 3 – 50 years Major additions and improvements are capitalized at cost. Maintenance and repairs, including minor renewals and improvements, are charged to income as incurred. The company records impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The assets of the company and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries are grouped by individual property in the case of rental real estate, assets expected to be sold and idle assets, and by management accounting categories in the case of business assets. An impairment loss is required to be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets significantly exceeds their recoverable amount. See Note 19. (g) Intangible assets and amortization (excluding leased assets) Intangible assets included in other assets are amortized principally by the straight-line method. Cost of software purchased for internal use is amortized by the straight-line method over five years, the estimated useful life of purchased software. (h) Stock issuance costs New stock issuance costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over a period of three years. (i) Bond issuance costs Bond issuance costs are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over the period of redemption of bonds. (j) Business commencement expenses Business commencement expenses are capitalized and amortized by the straight-line method over a period of five years. (k) Retirement benefits The retirement benefit plans of the company and certain subsidiaries covers substantially all employees other than directors, officers and corporate auditors. Under the terms of this plan, eligible employees are entitled, upon mandatory retirement or earlier voluntary severance, to lump-sum payments or annuity payments based on their compensation at the time of leaving and years of service with the company and subsidiaries. The company and certain significant domestic subsidiaries have trustee employee pension funds to provide coverage for part of the lump-sum benefits or annuity payments. The company and certain consolidated subsidiaries adopt defined contribution pension plans as well as defined benefit pension plans. For defined benefit pension plans, accrued retirement benefits for employees at the balance sheet date are provided mainly at an amount calculated based on the retirement benefit obligation and the fair market value of the pension plan assets as of the balance sheet date, as adjusted for unrecognized net retirement benefit obligation at transition, unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and unrecognized prior service cost. The retirement benefit obligation is attributed to each period by the benefit formula method over the estimated service years of eligible employees. The net retirement benefit obligation at transition is being amortized by the straight-line Financial / Data Section method. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized in the year following the year in which the gain or loss is recognized primarily by the straight-line method over periods which are shorter than the average remaining service years of employees. Prior service cost is amortized as incurred by the straight-line method over periods which are shorter than the average remaining service years of employees. See Note 7. A N N UA L R E PO RT 2016 113 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (l) Income taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements with respect to the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the assets and liabilities, and were measured using the enacted tax rates and laws which will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. See Note 9. (m) Leased assets and amortization Leased assets arising from transactions under finance lease contracts which do not transfer ownership to lessees are amortized to a residual value of zero by the straight-line method using the term of contract as the useful life. (n) Derivatives The company and its subsidiaries use derivatives, such as forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps, commodity options and swaps, to limit their exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. The company and its subsidiaries do not use derivatives for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value with changes in unrealized gain or loss charged or credited to operations, except for those which meet the criteria for deferral hedge accounting under which an unrealized gain or loss is deferred as an asset or a liability. Receivables and payables hedged by qualified forward exchange contracts are translated at the corresponding foreign exchange contract rates. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses or income. (o) Appropriation of retained earnings Under the Corporation Law of Japan (the “Law”), the appropriation of unappropriated retained earnings of the company with respect to a financial period is made by resolution of the company’s shareholders at a general meeting to be held subsequent to the close of the financial period and the accounts for that period do not therefore reflect such appropriation. See Note 12. (p) Revenue recognition Passenger revenues, cargo and other operating revenues are recorded when services are rendered. (q) Cash equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are treated as cash equivalents. See Note 18. (r) Reclassification Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial information in the accompanying financial statements to conform with the 2016 presentation. (s) Frequent flyer program The company accrues a frequent flyer liability for the mileage credits that are earned and to be used based on assumptions including analyses of previous experience under the program, anticipated behavior of customers, expectations of future awards to be issued, and analysis of current accumulated mileage balances. (t) Transactions of delivering the company’s own stock to employees, etc., through trusts The company has been conducting transactions of delivering its own stock to the Employee Stock Ownership Group through trusts for the welfare of its employees. (1) Transaction Outline The company introduced a “Trust Type Employee Stock Ownership Plan” (the “Plan”) on July 12, 2013 as an incentive for the group employees to work in unison to overcome the current harsh business environment and achieve further growth, and as a measure to advance their welfare. The aim of the Plan is to promote the employees’ asset building by encouraging their stock acquisition and holding through the expansion of the “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association,” “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Association” and “ALL NIPPON AIRWAYS TRADING CO., LTD. Employee Stock Ownership Association” (the “Stock Ownership Association”). 114 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . The Plan is an incentive plan for all employees who participate in the Stock Ownership Association. Under the Plan, the “ANA Group Employee Stock Ownership Trust” (the “ESOT”), which was established to transfer the company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association, will acquire the company’s shares all at once in advance to the extent that the Stock Ownership Association will acquire them over a certain period of time. If a gain on sale of shares is then accumulated within the ESOT through the sale of the company’s shares to the Stock Ownership Association by the termination of the trust, it will be distributed to the group employees who meet the beneficiary requirements (all individuals who have participated in the Stock Ownership Association during the trust period, including retirees) as residual assets. The company guarantees the borrowings for the ESOT’s acquisition of the company’s shares, and repays any borrowings outstanding at the termination of the trust pursuant to the guarantee agreement. (2) Accounting Method for Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock through Trusts Although the company applies the “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the company’s Own Stock to Employees, etc., through Trusts” (Practical Issues Task Force (PITF) No. 30 of March 26, 2015), the company continues to apply the accounting method that was applied previously. (3) Matters Concerning the Company’s Own Stock Held by Trusts The book value of the company’s own stock held by trusts was ¥2,433 million ($21,592 thousand) as of March 31, 2016 and ¥3,346 million as of March 31, 2015, and is recorded as treasury stock in the shareholders’ equity. The number of shares held by the trust as of March 31, 2016 was 11,531 thousand shares, the average number of shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 was 13,352 thousand shares, the number of shares as of March 31, 2015 was 15,859 thousand shares, and the average number of shares during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, was 17,914 thousand shares. For the purpose of calculating per share information, the number of shares at the end of the fiscal year and the average number of shares during the fiscal year are included in the treasury stock that are deducted. (u) Accounting for the Board Benefit Trust From the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the company has been delivering its own stock through a Board Benefit Trust (BBT) to pay remuneration to the board of directors (the “Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors”) as a share remuneration plan, in order to boost performance, increase corporate value and raise the awareness of shareholder-oriented management The Trust for Delivery of Shares to Directors acquires the company’s own stock using money contributed by the company as the source of the Board of Directors’ remuneration, etc., and the company’s own stock will be delivered to the Board of Directors according to the degree of achievement of the earnings target, among other things. As for the accounting for the trust, the “gross method” is applied pursuant to the PITF No. 30 of March 26, 2015. The company’s own stock held by the trust as of March 31, 2016 was recorded as treasury stock in “Net assets” of the consolidated balance sheet, and the book value was ¥429 million ($3,807 thousand), and the number of shares was 1,357 thousand shares. (v) Accounting standards issued but not yet effective Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets On March 28, 2016, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan (ASBJ) issued “Revised Implementation Guidance on Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets” (ASBJ Guidance No. 26). (1) Overview Regarding the treatment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, a review was conducted following the framework of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit Committee Report No. 66 “Audit Treatment on Determining the Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets,” whereby companies are categorized into five categories and deferred tax assets are calculated based on each of these categories. Financial / Data Section (2) Scheduled date of adoption The company expects to adopt the revised implementation guidance from the beginning of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017. (3) Impact of adopting revised implementation guidance The company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting this revised implementation guidance on its consolidated financial statements. A N N UA L R E PO RT 2016 115 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (w) Changes in accounting policies Application of accounting standards for business combinations, etc. Effective from the beginning of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the company has adopted the “Revised Accounting Standard for Business Combinations” ASBJ Statement No.21 of September 13, 2013; the “Business Combinations Standard”), the “Revised Accounting Standard for Consolidated Financial Statements” (ASBJ Statement No.22 of September 13, 2013; the “Consolidated Accounting Standards”) and the “Revised Accounting Standard for Business Divestitures” (ASBJ Statement No. 7 of September 13, 2013; the “Business Divestiture Standard”), etc. In applying these revised accounting standards, any change in ownership interest in a subsidiary when the company retains control is recorded as capital surplus and the acquisition-related costs are recognized as expenses in the fiscal year in which the costs are incurred. In addition, for business combinations that take place from April 1, 2015, any adjustment to the provisional amounts arising from the finalization of provisional accounting treatment relating to the allocation of acquisition costs is presented separately, and the presentation method is changed to present the opening balance as amount after such adjustment. Furthermore, the method of presentation of net income was amended and the reference to “minority interests” was changed to “non-controlling interests.” The Business Combinations Standard and others were applied in accordance with the transitional treatments stipulated in Paragraph No. 58-2(4) of the Business Combinations Standard, Paragraph No. 44-5(4) of the Consolidated Financial Statement Standard, and Paragraph 57-4(4) of the Business Divestiture Standard, and the accounting standards, etc., have been applied from April 1, 2015. These accounting changes did not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2016. Application of Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the Company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts The company applies “Practical Solution on Transactions of Delivering the company’s Own Stock to Employees etc. through Trusts” (PITF No.30 of March 26, 2015) as of April 1, 2014. For accounting treatment of trust contracts concluded before April 1, 2014, the company does not apply the revised Practical Solution but continues to apply the accounting treatment that was applied previously Changes in the presentation method (Consolidated Statement of Income) “Gain on donation of non-current assets,” which was included in “Other” under Non-operating income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, was presented separately for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 due to its increased significance. The change is applied retroactively, and the consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 was retroactively reclassified. As a result, the amount of ¥6,297 million recorded as “Other” under Non-operating income was reclassified as “Gain on donation of non-current assets” in the amount of ¥936 million and the “Other” in the amount of ¥5,361 million in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended March 31, 2015. 3. Financial statements translation The consolidated financial statements presented herein are expressed in yen and, solely for the convenience of the reader, have been translated into United States dollars at the rate of ¥112.68 = US$1, the approximate exchange rate prevailing on the Tokyo Foreign Exchange Market on March 31, 2016.

Asset retirement obligations 1. Asset retirement obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (a) Overview of asset retirement obligations The company and its subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts for the Head Office, sales branches, airport branches and some other offices. As the company and its subsidiaries have restoration obligations for such properties at the end of each lease period, related legal obligations required by law and the contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as asset retirement obligations. (b) Calculation of asset retirement obligations The company and its subsidiaries estimate the expected period of use as 1 to 30 years and calculate the amount of asset retirement obligations with a discount rate of 0% to 2.27%. The following table indicates the changes in asset retirement obligations for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2016 2015 2016 Balance at the beginning of the fiscal year ¥825 ¥1,492 $7,321 Liabilities incurred due to the acquisition of property and equipment 4 – 35 Accretion expense 14 25 124 Liabilities settled (83) (721) (736) Other 189 29 1,677 Balance at the end of the fiscal year ¥949 ¥ 825 $8,422 2. Asset retirement obligations not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet The company and its subsidiaries enter into agreements with national government entities that allow for the use of Japanese government property and have entered into real estate lease contracts for land and office at airport facilities including Tokyo International Airport, Narita International Airport, New Chitose Airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, Osaka International Airport, Kansai International Airport, Fukuoka Airport and Naha Airport. The company and its subsidiaries have restoration obligations when they vacate and clear such facilities. However, as the roles of the above airports are especially important in public transportation, it is beyond the control of the company alone to determine when to vacate and clear such facilities, and it is also impossible to make reasonable estimates as there are currently no relocation plans for the above properties. Therefore, the company and its subsidiaries do not record asset retirement obligations for the related liabilities.

The tax effect of temporary differences that give rise to a significant portion of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: U.S. dollars Yen (Millions) (Thousands) 2016 2015 2016 Deferred tax assets: Net defined benefit liabilities ¥ 50,209 ¥ 51,842 $ 445,589 Deferred loss on hedging instruments 23,583 13,107 209,291 Accrued bonuses to employees 12,786 10,070 113,471 Unrealized gain on inventories and property and equipment 11,304 11,563 100,319 Long-term unearned revenue 7,409 2,595 65,752 Tax loss carry-forward 6,817 7,539 60,498 Accrued enterprise tax and business office tax 3,230 1,704 28,665 Impairment loss 2,043 778 18,130 Other 11,591 12,602 102,866 Total gross deferred tax assets 128,972 111,800 1,144,586 Less valuation allowance (10,899) (12,221) (96,725) Total net deferred tax assets 118,073 99,579 1,047,861 Deferred tax liabilities: Net unrealized holding gain on securities (8,637) (14,478) (76,650) Deferred gain on hedging instruments (1,384) (15,794) (12,282) Special taxation measures law reserve (553) (1,009) (4,907) Other (2,102) (3,026) (18,654) Total gross deferred tax liabilities (12,676) (34,307) (112,495) Net deferred tax assets ¥105,397 ¥ 65,272 $ 935,365 “Impairment loss,” included in “Other” under deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2015, is reported separately as of March 31, 2016 due to an increase in materiality. To reflect this change in presentation, the amount as of March 31, 2015 was reclassified. As a result, ¥778 million ($6,904 thousand) in “Other” under deferred tax assets as of March 31, 2015 is presented as “Impairment loss.” “Valuation loss on investments in securities” and “Depreciation of property and equipment,” reported separately as of March 31, 2015, are included in “Other” as of March 31, 2016 due to a decrease in materiality. To reflect this change in presentation, the amount as of March 31, 2015 was reclassified. As a result, ¥1,900 million ($16,861 thousand) in “Valuation loss on investments in securities” and ¥1,874 million ($16,631 thousand) in “Depreciation of property and equipment” as of March 31, 2015 are included in “Other.” A reconciliation of the difference between the statutory tax rate and the effective income tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 2016 2015 Statutory tax rate 33.06% 35.64% Reconciliation: Decrease in deferred tax assets due to tax rate change 2.44 7.11 Amortization of goodwill 2.57 0.41 Entertainment expenses not qualifying for deduction 0.95 0.99 Exclusion of dividend income from gross revenue 0.27 0.44 Inhabitants tax per capita levy 0.15 0.24 Changes in valuation allowance (0.26) 2.13 Adjustment for foreign income – 0.60 Other 0.86 1.11 Effective income tax rate 40.04% 48.67% 122 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . The “Act for Partial Amendment of the Income Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 15 of 2016) and the “Act for Partial Amendment of the Local Tax Act, etc.” (Act No. 13 of 2016) were enacted in the Japanese Diet session on March 29, 2016. As a result, the effective statutory tax rate used to measure the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities was lowered from 32.34% to 30.86% and 30.62% for the temporary differences expected to be realized or settled in the years beginning April 1, 2016 and 2017, and for the temporary differences expected to be realized or settled from April 1, 2018, respectively. The effect of the announced reduction of the effective statutory tax rate was to decrease deferred tax assets, after offsetting deferred tax liabilities, by ¥4,362 million ($38,711 thousand) and increase deferred income tax expense by ¥3,216 million ($28,541 thousand), net unrealized holding gain on securities by ¥480 million ($4,259 thousand), deferred gain on hedging instruments by ¥(959) million ($(8,510) thousand) and remeasurements of defined benefit plans by ¥(667) million ($(5,919) thousand) as of and for the year ended March 31, 2016. 10.

The Law provides that an amount equal to at least 10% of the amounts to be disbursed as distributions of earnings be appropriated to the legal retained earnings until the total of the legal retained earnings and the capital reserve equals 25% of the capital stock. The Law provides that neither the capital reserve nor the legal retained earnings is available for the payment of dividends, but both may be used to reduce or eliminate a deficit by resolution of the shareholders or may be transferred to common stock by resolution of the Board of Directors. The Law also provides that, if the total amount of the capital reserve and the legal retained earnings exceeds 25% of the capital stock, the excess may be distributed to the shareholders either as a return of capital or as dividends subject to the approval of the shareholders. Under the Law, however, such distributions can be made at anytime by resolution of the shareholders or by the Board of Directors if certain conditions are met. 13.

Financial / Data Section A N N UA L R E PO RT 2016 125 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 14. Financial instruments Overview (a) Policy for financial instruments The company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “group”) limit their fund management to short-term time deposits and raise funds through borrowings from financial institutions including banks. The company and its subsidiaries use derivatives for the purpose of reducing risk described below and do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. (b) Types of financial instruments, related risk and risk management Trade receivables (accounts receivable) are exposed to credit risk in relation to customers. In accordance with the internal policies of the group for managing credit risk arising from receivables, the group monitors the credit worthiness of their main customers periodically and monitors due dates and outstanding balances by individual customer, thereby making efforts to identify and mitigate risks of bad debts from customers who are having financial difficulties. Marketable securities and investments in securities are exposed to risk of market price fluctuations. Those securities are composed of mainly the shares of other companies with which the group has business relationships. The group periodically reviews the fair values of such financial instruments and the financial position of the issuers, thereby making efforts to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. Substantially all trade payables (accounts and notes payable) have payment due dates within one year. Borrowings are taken out principally for the purpose of making capital investments, and certain long-term debt with variable interest rates is exposed to interest rate fluctuation risk. However, to reduce such risk for long-term interest-bearing debt at variable rates, the group utilizes interest rate swap transactions as a hedging instrument. Interest rate swaps that qualify for hedge accounting are not measured at fair value, but the differential paid or received under the swap agreements is recognized and included in interest expenses or income. For derivatives, in order to reduce the foreign currency exchange risk arising from the receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, the group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts for specific receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, mainly for aircraft purchase commitments. In addition, the group enters into commodity derivative transactions such as swaps and options to mitigate fluctuation risk of the commodity prices of fuel and stabilize operating profit. 1) Management of Credit Risks (risks such as breach of contract by customers) The group, with respect to trade receivables, exercises the due date management and the outstanding balance management in accordance with internal policies. The group makes best efforts to identify and mitigate risks of bad debts from major customers with financial difficulties by periodically monitoring their creditworthiness. As for derivatives, the group believes that the credit risks are extremely low, as it enters into derivative transactions only with reputable financial institutions with a sound credit profile. 2) Management of Market Risks (fluctuation risks such as exchange rate and interest rate) In order to reduce the foreign currency exchange risks, the group, in principle, utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts for receivables and payables in foreign currencies. In order to mitigate the interest rate fluctuation risks of the debts, the group utilizes interest rate swap transactions. As for marketable securities and investment securities, the group periodically reviews the fair values and the financial conditions of the issuers to identify and mitigate risks of impairment. There are internal policies for derivative transactions which set forth authorization levels and a maximum upper limit on transaction volumes and the group enters into the derivative transactions in accordance with such policies. Moreover, the group reports plans and results of methods and ratios for offsetting risks at quarterly board meeting. 3) Management of Liquidity Risks Related to Financing (risks that the group cannot meet the due date of payables) The group manages the liquidity risks by setting a financial plan in order to procure and invest funds, which are necessary for the operation of the group for a certain period of time, in accordance with the business operating plan and the budget. (c) Supplementary explanation of the estimated fair value of financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments is based on their quoted market price, if available. When there is no quoted market price available, fair value is reasonably estimated. Since various assumptions and factors are reflected in estimating the fair value, different assumptions and factors could result in different fair value. In addition, the notional amounts of derivatives in Note 15 are not necessarily indicative of the actual market risk involved in derivative transactions. 126 A N A HOLD I N G S IN C . Estimated fair value of financial instruments Carrying value of financial instruments on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 and 2015 and estimated fair value are shown in the following tables.

Methods to determine the estimated fair value of financial instruments and other matters related to securities and derivative transactions Assets 1) Cash on hand and in banks and 2) accounts receivable Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value. 3) Marketable securities and investments in securities The fair value of stocks is based on quoted market prices. The fair value of debt securities is based on either quoted market prices or prices provided by the financial institutions making markets in these securities. For information on securities classified by holding purpose, refer to Note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Liabilities 1) Trade notes and accounts payable and 2) short-term bank loans Since these items are settled in a short period of time, their carrying value approximates fair value. 3) Bonds and notes The fair value of bonds issued by the company is the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by an interest rate determined taking into account the remaining period of each bond and current credit risk. 4) Long-term loans The fair value of long-term loans is based on the present value of the total of principal and interest discounted by the interest rate to be applied if similar new borrowings were entered into. 2.

Derivatives and hedging activities The group operates internationally and is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices of fuel. In order to manage these risks, the group and its subsidiaries utilize forward exchange contracts to hedge certain foreign currency transactions related to purchase commitments, principally of flight equipment, and foreign currency receivables and payables. Also, the group utilizes interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations related to their outstanding debt. In addition, the group also enters into a variety of swaps and options in its management of risk exposure related to the commodity prices of fuel. The group and its subsidiaries do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The group has developed internal hedging guidelines to control various aspects of derivative transactions, including authorization levels and transaction volumes. The group enters into derivative transactions in accordance with these internal guidelines. Derivative and hedging transactions initiated by respective operational departments have been examined by the accounting department and these transactions, including their measures and ratios, have been monitored by management generally on a monthly basis. Assessment of hedge effectiveness is examined at inception and, on an ongoing basis, periodically. The consolidated subsidiaries have adopted the same procedures for hedging activities as the group. The group is also exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but it is not expected that any counterparties will fail to meet their obligations, because the majority of the counterparties are internationally recognized financial institutions.
