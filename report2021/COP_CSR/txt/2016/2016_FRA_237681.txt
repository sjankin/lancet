Since employees share in Group proﬁts in the same way as shareholders, value distribution is a cornerstone of Essilor International’s governance. This stake in the results of business operations goes hand in hand with a presence on the Board of Directors of the Company. The Valoptec Association, which represents the employee-shareholder base, is Essilor’s largest shareholder. This encourages dialog and ensures employee participation in the Group’s major decisions. The presence on the Board of a large proportion of Independent Directors, and of three representatives of the Valoptec Association and a Director representing employees, ensures that a balance of power in relations with the Senior Management is guaranteed. Under the authority of the Senior Management, the Executive Committee oversees the Group’s activities and implements its policies.
