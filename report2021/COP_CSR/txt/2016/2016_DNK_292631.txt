To maintain and develop this position, we are convinced it is a prerequisite to conduct our business in a responsible manner – “Doing Business the Right Way”. However, we must admit our principles are under pressure from competitors NOT doing business the right way. ScanCom’s approach to doing business the right way was recognized in 2014 when we secured the “CSR Abroad Prize”, Stig Maasbøl Group CEO an award established by Denmark’s Ministry of Foreign ScanCom International A/S Affairs, and this provided great encouragement to continue our CSR strategy. Sustainability for materials, products, and operations To create and offer sustainable products, ScanCom controls all materials and products in order to meet all relevant regulations in our markets. For the wood used in our products, ScanCom was a pioneer in using FSC certified hardwood, and today we use 100% FSC hardwood with an objective to increase the level of FSC teak year by year. At the same time we continuously optimize our operating activities to reduce consumption of energy and resources, increase recycling, and reduce emissions. Our main operation site in Vietnam is operated under ISO 14001 certificate. Social accountability It is important for ScanCom to assure respect for human and labor rights. Key features of this are: BSCI monitoring of all operations in Vietnam since 2008, SA 8000 certificates for the operations in Brazil (2012) and Indonesia (2001), and having our own Code of Conduct. OHSAS 18001 certification for health and safety management was obtained for the Vietnamese operation in 2014. Being signatory to the UN Global Compact, in addition to BSCI monitoring and certifications, sends a clear signal to all our stakeholders that we are committed to doing business the right way and also supports our activities in terms of meeting the CSR requirements of our global customers. Requirements for contract manufacturers and key suppliers Built into the BSCI CoC, SA 8000, and UN Global Compact are requirements for the improvement of CSR level in the supply chain. ScanCom actively practises this by performing CSR audits at key suppliers and contract manufacturers and requesting them to sign our Code of Conduct, and targets are set for continuous improvement in terms of that policy. UN Global Compact commitment I am very pleased that ScanCom, even under the difficult conditions of recent years, has been able to remain true to its basic CSR values and to make progress, or at least maintain the same high level, in all 10 of the UN Global Compact principles. For the following seasons ScanCom will continue to further develop commitment to the UN Global Compact – “Doing Business the Right Way” will remain part of our DNA. 5 ScanCom International A/S Legal Structure Finance figures The finance figures for ScanCom International A/S are presented below: Key figures (DDK million): 2015/16 2014/15 2013/14 2012/13 2011/12 Income Statement: Revenue 898.1 880.8 672.2 710.6 752.7 EBITDA 43.7 32.6 21.2 39.7 44.5 Profit/loss on ordinary operating activities 22.8 10.3 6.7 16.7 23.3 Financial income and expenses, net -9.0 5.1 -12.6 -13.7 15.8 Profit/loss on ordinary activities before tax 13.8 15.4 -5.9 3.0 39.1 Tax on profit/loss -7.3 -5.2 0.1 -0.4 -8.3 Net Profit/loss for the year 6.5 10.1 -5.8 2.6 30.8 Balance: Balance sheet total 565.9 593.8 506.1 431.6 479.3 Purchases of property, plant, 31.2 35.0 20.2 12.4 33.2 and equipment, gross Current Assets 393.5 427.3 357.9 280.3 305.2 Equity 157.1 152.7 150.3 160.1 166.0 Short-term debt 401.3 432.8 301.3 210.4 244.6 Employees: Average number of emloyees 3.459 3.932 4.415 4.284 4.541 6 ScanCom International A/S Performance indicators and objectives For season 15/16 ScanCom selected the performance indicators given below and set related objectives.

The WCA addresses the areas of Labor, Wages and Hours, Health and Safety, Management Systems, and Environment with respect to widely-held industry standards and best practices. ScanCom received the Intertek “Achievement Award” in 2015. Supplier of the year ScanCom International received a “Supplier of the Year” award from one of our biggest customers, Jysk The reasons cited for the nomination were: ScanCom’s continued and significant improvements in the area of CSR and our commitment to the use of FSC certified wood. Human rights ScanCom International is committed to influencing our employees and business partners to respect the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. For several years ScanCom has had its own, annually updated Code of Conduct for employees and business partners. It can be seen in full on our website: http://www.scancom.net 9 ScanCom International A/S BSCI monitoring of Contract Manufacturers SCVN uses the BSCI monitoring system to ensure that its contract manufacturers, as a minimum, comply with basic human rights and local regulations pertaining to labor conditions. For season 15/16 ScanCom used a total of 30 contract manufacturers, all of which were registered on the BSCI platform.

As with years past, ScanCom supported our supply chain to follow up on non-conformance found by 3rd parties or customers in order to, as a minimum, meet the new rating C (Acceptable). The new ratings in the BSCI system are A, B, C, D, E: A and B correspond to the previous rating “Good” . C corresponds to previous rating “Improvement Needed”. D is equivalent to previous rating “Non-Compliant”. E is “Zero Tolerance” where business must stop immediately. Supplier audits ScanCom is continually developing higher CSR levels at our suppliers. All suppliers signed ScanCom’s Code of Conduct. 100% of new suppliers, where relevant, were subject to an onsite CSR audit conducted by ScanCom. In general, the top level management of suppliers is integral to developments in this area, as the awareness and commitment of suppliers is improved due to the allocation of resources and time in order to make improvements. Child labor and forced labor During the past season, as with those previous, ScanCom maintained regular audits of contract manufacturers together with customer audits, BSCI and SMETA audits. Again for this season we can report that no cases of child labor or forced labor were recorded. Labor ScanCom is committed to the support and protection of labor rights including: abolition of child labor, elimination of forced labor, freedom of association, and eradication of any kind of discrimination. 10 ScanCom International A/S Workforce, employment, and labor turnover.

Female ratio of SCVN in season 2015/26 (27%), higher than 1% season 14/15 (26%) SCVN’s activities are situated in an area with a traditionally very high labor turnover in the furniture industry. ScanCom was affected by this for several years and actively addressed the problem by creating incentives for employees to stay. These have taken the form of an improvement in working conditions and the provision of a range of benefits: supporting the children of employees, providing a transportation allowance, and assistance with house rental. Specifically to meet legal requirements, in the previous year we installed an air cooling system to reduce temperatures at most production areas which had a high temperature. The focus on making it attractive to stay with ScanCom was continued throughout season 15/16 and seems to have had a positive impact. The employee turnover rate for SCVN was reduced from 57% in season 14/15 to 51% in season 15/16, and although this figure may still be considered high, it meets the objective for this parameter. Related to this area, it is worth noting that the headcount was significantly reduced in 15/16 due to advanced robotics technology and the installation of CNC machinery at production areas. The aim of this shift was to increase capacity and reduce the amount of manual labor as well. The employee turnover rate for SCIN decreased from 14% in season 14/15 to 13% in season 15/16. The employee turnover rate for SCBR in season 15/16 was unchanged compared to season 14/15, which meets the objective for this parameter. ScanCom is working together with local authorities in the area to teach workers coming from agricultural jobs what is required in an industrial workplace. Headcount Turnover by Category.

In season 15/16 the lowest wage level for ScanCom workers was around 24 % higher than the legal minimum. Furthermore, ScanCom continued the policy of an extra 2.5 % health and social and unemployment insurance for workers compared to the legal requirement. SCIN pays contract workers at the minimum wage level and all permanent employees are paid at a somewhat higher (minimum 15%) level than the minimum wage, depending on position and responsibility. SCBR pays wages based on an agreement with the Union and the wage pattern of the local area. For the latter period 15/16, SCBR salaries were at least 28% above the national regulation, which is a positive factor in terms of the retention of staff. Discrimination ScanCom continuously enforces its policy of not accepting any kind of employment discrimination of the workforce due to gender, age, or origin. Age distribution of employees.

Differences in the above figures are related to different kinds of jobs. It should be noted that the level of salary paid to female management at SCVN in season 15/16 is lower than the previous year due to the resignation of some female managers who were not subsequently replaced. 16 ScanCom International A/S Health and safety OHSAS 18001 During season 15/16 SCVN received its second surveillance audit OHSAS 18001 for the occupational health and safety management system – the result was a very positive pass. In relation to the OHSAS 18001 regulations, SCVN has now fully implemented standards associated with fire fighting.

Therefore, significant improvements will need to be made relating to the implementation of a safety training programme to enhance awareness within the workplace and an associated action plan. There were two incidences of small fires due to equipment. As a result, a schedule has been devised to follow a maintenance procedure for relevant equipment along with regular testing in order to prevent fire. Additionally, a fire prevention and firefighting course is held for all workers every year with the aim of raising awareness and giving employees relevant, useful knowledge and skills. SCBR During season 15/16 the Minas do Leão Unit/ RS, saw absences of longer periods at intervals, caused by particular types of accident. Lost days of all types (including those for maternity leave) doubled on the previous season, but was due to the types of absences and also the turnover. The total amount of hours given over to general labor safety training has remained stable for both units meeting the requirements for compulsory training in addition to the general raising of awarenness amongst staff. The minor variation was due to adjustments in the Minas do Leão/RS, Unit 17 ScanCom International A/S Environment SCVN’s environmental management system, with reference to the requirements of ISO 14001, was maintained and improved over the period. The certification was renewed with a good result. Materials used, recycling, and waste Data Over the preceding years ScanCom has worked towards an improvement in the collection of reliable data and this has now reached a satisfactory level.

SCVN The increase in the volume of recycled aluminium waste is due to market prices. If the price offered for the waste by our aluminium supplier is low, the waste is instead sold in the local market and is not then used in future products. Significantly though, regardless of the buyer, the waste is recycled. For the activities in Song Than Industrial Park waste water volume is calculated as 80% of water consumption and is not measured as it is on the small sites in other areas. Waste water volume therefore is reduced in line with the reduction of water consumption. In future, we will review and install water meters for every site in order to monitor the situation more effectively. We continually try to increase the recycling of materials – mainly in SCVN. New methods for recycling in wood and plastic composite furniture have resulted in increased recycling figures. 18 ScanCom International A/S Development activities in recycling are on-going and this should lead to a continued increase in the amount of internal waste being recycled. Total electrical energy increased because more production machines were installed. We continue to look for alternative solutions that will result in a more positive impact on the environment. SCBR The increase in the amount of electrical energy consumed was due to the installation of a new drying system (greenhouses and boiler) in the Minas do Leão unit. The enormous improvement in terms of industrial waste and residue during the last season was a surprising and welcome result. In the current format, we are able to provide 100% of everything that is being generated as a residue, regardless of its classification. We are seeking to make even further improvements going forward with awareness raising activities and increased employee engagement with this matter. SCIN All water consumption is due to employee toilet facilities, so all water consumption will be waste water. For season 15/16 SCVN further improved its waste handling to meet ISO 14001 related objectives and legal requirements. Also, in SCIN and SCBR, waste handling is under control and the data now presented are reliable and traceable. Waste volumes (Metric Tons) SCVN SCIN SCBR Disposal Waste type (MT) SS SS SS SS SS SS method 14/15 15/16 14/15 15/16 14/15 15/16 Domestic waste 124 128.6 17 12.4 8.7 0.51 Authorized contractor Authorized Hazardous waste 458 394 0 0 1.4 0.1 contractor Sold to Recyclable waste 3,414 3,025 8.5 2.4 3.6 0.29 contractors SCVN The amount of recycled waste sold to contractors has fallen since there is more internal reuse in terms of boilers used for wood drying. Domestic waste handling is now fully under control and volumes are at the same level as last season, with hazardous waste also being reduced. SCBR In recent years there has been a conscious decision to improve the control of emissions. A big improvement has been seen in the recent past, mainly due to tighter controls and improvements in processes that minimize the generation of waste. For the forthcoming period, we expect to reduce the volume of generated waste in addition to making better use of it, in an attempt to avoid larger scale disposal, even if it is undertaken by a specialized company. CO2 emission Since 2012 ScanCom has continuously monitored CO2 generating consumptions with the aim of a stepwise reduction in CO2 emissions. 19 ScanCom International A/S CO2 emission data CO2 emission CO2 emission Quantity Quantity Site Source (MT) (MT) SS 14/15 SS 15/16 SS 14/15 SS 15/16 Gas (MT) 575 1,546 705 2,109 Diesel Oil (MT) 135 430 120.3 322 SCVN Wood (MT) 4,301 7,527 4,294 7,515 Electricity (GWh) 22.6 7,932 24.3 8,529 Total CO2, SCVN 17,435 18,475 Electricity 0.215 GWh 75 0.239 GWh 84 SCIN Total CO2, SCIN 75 84 Wood 13,440 MT 23,520 13,599 MT 23,799 SCBR Electricity 3.84 GWh 376 0.270GWh 157 Total CO2, SCBR 23,896 23,956 TOTAL CO2 41,505 42,515 For data relating to electricity, the local conversion factors according to “IEA Energy Statistics 2015” are used.

In season 15/16 ScanCom updated its List of Restricted Substances in order to continue to meet relevant legal requirements (ECHA) and those of customers. We experienced a continued increase in customer focus on restricted substances, and our system was in all cases able to provide the requested information for materials used in our products. Legality of wood The European Union Timber Regulation is increasingly being enforced now, and ScanCom experienced this in season 15/16 in terms of customers requesting additional documentation about the entire supply chain. Although ScanCom’s Due Diligence System (DDS) was, in all cases, able to provide the requested documentation for our customers, we experienced a need to try to simplify the documentation process. Besides FSC certification ScanCom therefore now has its DDS certified, requiring annual renewal by an independent 3rd party, approved by the EU as a control organization. The certificate covers all wood used by ScanCom. Anti-corruption ScanCom maintains its own Code of Conduct with annual updates. The Code of Conduct is communicated to all employees and all new employees receive training in the 20 ScanCom International A/S content. Furthermore, the Code of Conduct is communicated to all subcontractors, contract manufacturers, and suppliers – and they are requested to sign the code. All subcontractors’ employees working on ScanCom’s premises during season 15/16 have received the training in ScanCom’s Code of Conduct and were monitored in terms of workplace safety. Training activities In season 15/16 ScanCom continued systematic training of employees to support the understanding and practice of social compliance and good environmental behaviour.
