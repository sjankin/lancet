Developments in the financial markets have a great Castellum’s finance strategy can be summarized impact on Castellum. For finance operation purposes, in five cornerstones: diversification, liquidity, it is therefore important to reflect and support the strength, transparency and flexibility. goals and requirements of the business operations. With the support of the finance policy, the Group CASTELLUM’S FIVE CORNERSTONES ABOUT FUNDING DIVERSIFICATION Castellum will oversee a diversified loan portfolio and avoid dependence on both individual counterparty and source of financing. In addition, the maturity of various kinds of funding sources and individual loans will be distributed over time. Castellum will monitor and follow developments on the financial markets, enabling us to act quickly and match business requirements. At year-end, Castellum’s interest-bearing financing amounted to SEK 20.4 billion, of which SEK 9.7 billion came from capital market financing (an MTN-program totalling SEK 6.5 billion and a commercial paper program totalling SEK 3.2 billion) corresponding to 47%. Remaining financing came from bank financing from most major Nordic banks. At year-end, the average maturity of credit agreements amounted to 3.1 years and ranged from 0.2 to 8 years. LIQUIDITY Castellum will have available unutilized credit facilities in order to respond rapidly to business needs and opportunities that arise. Moreover, there will be undrawn facilities for the purpose of reducing the need to invest the surplus – thus reducing the risk between deposits and loans. At year-end, Castellum had SEK 30.3 billion in credit agreements, of which SEK 9.9 billion were unutilized. STRENGTH The Group’s financial key ratios will be strong, with a loan-to-value ratio not exceeding 55% and an interest coverage ratio of at least 200%. The strength of our real estate portfolio is enhanced by the quality of our cash flow as well as by the composition of our debt and interest rate portfolio. Castellum is to reduce the risk of sudden negative impact on net financial items – resulting from interest rate changes and/or the assessment of Castellum as borrower – that cannot be adjusted by opposing effects on income related to business operations. The loan-to-value ratio was 49% at year-end, while the interest coverage ratio for 2015 was 351%. TRANSPARENCY Castellum will encourage long-term relationships with both banks and other lenders/investors and aim to be transparent in order to increase stakeholder understanding of the Group’s operations and, consequently, credit exposure. FLEXIBILITY Castellum is to have flexible financing for the purpose of supporting business developments regarding acquisitions, sales and project development. Our credit facilities will provide us with high flexibility to withdraw and repay with short notice and at no extra cost. Furthermore, Castellum is to have access to flexibility, both in terms of pricing (fixed and floating) and maturities. At year-end, Castellum had SEK 20.7 billion in bank agreements, of which SEK 17.0 billion consisted of revolving credit facilities.

The average valuation yield for Castellum’s real estate portfolio, excluding development projects, undeveloped land and building rights can be calculated to 6.5%. The valuation was carried out in a uniform manner using internal valuation based on a 10-year cash flow model with individual assessments for each property. This was to reflect both future earnings capacity and required market yield. In order to provide further assurance and validation of the valuation, 161 properties – representing 56% of the value of the portfolio – have been valued externally. 64 10 CASTELLUM CASTELLUM ÅRSREDOVISNING ANNUAL REPORT2014 2015 DIRECTORS’ REPORT PROPERTY VALUATION Property valuation Internal valuation Assumptions in Castellum’s internal valuations Castellum records the investment properties at Office/retail Warehouse/industrial fair value and has made an internal valuation of Cash flow year 1 all properties as of December 31, 2015.
