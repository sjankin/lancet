In the longer term, this could give Orkla a competitive edge over international competitors with a significantly higher share of costs in foreign currencies. OPERATING REVENUES BY BUSINESS AREA The results of foreign entities are translated into Norwegian krone on the basis of average monthly exchange rates. In 2015, due to currency market fluctuations, the Group benefited from positive currency translation effects of NOK 1,368 million on operating revenues and NOK 152 million on EBIT (adj.)1. The comprehensive restructuring process continued in 2015, and the Group’s other income and expenses totalled NOK -502 million (NOK -100 million)2. These consisted mainly of acquisition and integration costs resulting from numerous structural measures, as well as several restructuring processes in the Group, particularly related to factory closures and changes in Orkla’s manufacturing footprint. The change compared with 2014 reflects a one-off contractual termination fee from Unilever (NOK 279 million)2. Orkla Foods 13,250 40% Orkla Confectionery & Snacks 5,813 17% After other income and expenses, the Group’s operating Orkla Care 5,534 17% profit amounted to NOK 3,107 million in 2015, compared Orkla Food Ingredients 7,598 23% with NOK 3,114 million in 2014.

Jotun delivered a record-high contribution in 2015, which totalled NOK 569 million (NOK 384 million)2. Profit from Sapa amounted to NOK 123 million (NOK -313 million)2. The improvement in Sapa’s performance is largely ascribable to the positive effects of restructuring and improvement programmes, stronger results from the North American operations and the fact that fixed assets in China were written down by around NOK 0.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014. The sell-off of Orkla’s shares in Gränges, reducing its interest from 31% to 16%, resulted in a gain of NOK 425 million. Net interest expenses totalled NOK 192 million (NOK 363 million)2. Other net financial items amounted to NOK 64 million (NOK 0 million)2, including net profit (including dividends) from shares and financial assets totalling NOK 135 million (NOK 93 million)2.

Orkla considers it important to make it easy for customers and consumers to find information on what our products contain. This is a prerequisite for being able to make healthy, informed choices in stores. In 2015, our companies continued to implement Orkla’s internal guidelines for good, uniform nutrition labelling, which apply to all product categories. The Group’s nutrition labelling strategy was drawn up in 2013, and will be fully implemented in 2016. Consumers can also find information on nutrition and health and the nutritional content of specific products on the companies’ websites. The Orkla companies have dedicated consumer service departments that can be contacted through a variety of channels. Avoiding marketing RESULTS IN 2015: to children In 2015, Orkla companies reported three compliance matters related to the use of claims in marketing, a matter As a major advertiser, Orkla is committed to related to the voluntary guidelines for acting responsibly and protecting children marketing food and drink to children and adolescents from marketing that may be and adolescents, and a matter related misleading or put undue pressure on them to to product labelling rules. None of the buy products. matters resulted in a fine. Orkla considers it crucial that the food industry is part of the solution, and believes industry-governed self-regulation to be the best solution. In 2013, therefore, Orkla helped to initiate the establishment of the Food and Drink Industry Professional Practices Committee (MFU), which is tasked with ensuring that the industry does not market food and drink products to children and adolescents. In 2015, Orkla took part in a meeting with the EU Commission in Brussels, along with eight multinational companies and the World Federation of Advertising. The Commission wished to learn more about the voluntary system that has been established in Norway, and invited Orkla to give a detailed presentation of the MFU and Orkla’s involvement in efforts to ensure responsible advertising to children and adolescents. 46 Annual Report 2015 FOOD AND PRODUCT SAFETY Jeanette and Zaida – part of the Orkla family 03 A question of trust FOOD AND Orkla aims to be on a par with the best companies in the world when PRODUCT it comes to food safety.

All internal matters have been eliminated. The income statement distinguishes between what is deemed to be the Group’s operations and what is deemed to be of a more financial nature. Special matters related to operating activities are presented on a separate line as “Other income and expenses”. The notes explain the contents of the different lines of the statement. Earnings per Share are calculated on the basis of profit/loss for the year attributable to owners of the parent. The Statement of Comprehensive Income shows the result of all income and expenses that are credited/charged to equity, but are not included in profit/loss for the year and are not transactions with owners.

All internal matters between companies in the Group have been eliminated. IFRS-based financial statements are oriented towards the statement of financial position and only items that satisfy the criteria for definition as assets and liabilities may be recognised in the statement of financial position. Equity is a residual. The different standards determine how the items in the statement of financial position are to be treated. The statement of financial position items are explained in the notes to the financial statements.

Thus, a presentation of the gross increase in and repayment of loans is not a reliable indicator as such cash flows take place frequently within the bilateral borrowing facilities. In practice, day-to-day changes in cash flow in the Group will generate increases in/repayments of loans under the long-term facilities, resulting in correspondingly high gross figures. 76 Annual Report 2015 STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY Equity changes from one period to the next in accordance with the Group’s comprehensive income. Furthermore, transactions with owners will be presented as separate items.

NOTE 2 BASIS FOR PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS It is crucial to understanding these financial statements that the user is informed of the fundamental principles for both the recognition of items and the consolidation of the Group. Similarly, the use of parentheses and the currency in which the financial statements are presented will be significant. The financial statements are essentially based on the historical cost justify their value are written down to the recoverable amount, which is principle. However, this does not apply to the treatment of financial the higher of value in use and fair value minus selling costs. assets, which are mainly reported at fair value as available for sale in the statement of comprehensive income or with changes in value reported The financial statements are prepared on the basis of the underlying in the income statement.

NOTE 3 PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS Key accounting principles elaborate on the basic principles and describe how individual items in the financial statements are treated. All the principles are consistent with current IFRS, but choices, interpretations and adaptations must nonetheless be made which affect the preparation and presentation of financial statements to varying degrees. Accounting is constantly evolving and changes in rules can give rise to significant changes in accounting practices. As stated by way of introduction, as from 2015 the disclosure of accounting The statement of comprehensive income presents items that are principles has been incorporated into the relevant notes.

This may apply to estimates and assumptions relating to financial statement items or other matters that may also have a material influence on the valuation of the company. It is important that the financial statement user is aware of these different items and the valuation techniques used to determine the values in the financial statements. Any material change in value up until the time the Board of Directors presents its report must be reflected in either the financial statements or in the notes. Areas of greatest estimate uncertainty The areas where there is the greatest risk of material changes are capitalised The management has made use of estimates and assumptions in goodwill and trademarks with an indefinite useful life.

Acquired companies are presented in the financial statements from the date on which control transfers to the Group. Sold companies, which are not covered by the rules regarding “Discontinued operations” cease to be included in the financial statements from the date the Group no longer has control. P PRINCIPLE Sale of companies Business combinations When a business is divested, the gain is measured as the difference Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition between the selling price and book equity, minus any remaining method.

The same procedure will (see Note 38). in principle be carried out in connection with the establishment of a joint venture and with the acquisition of an associate.

In the defined contribution pension plans, the company pays an agreed annual contribution to the employee’s pension plan, but any risk related to the future pension is borne by the employee. The future pension will be determined by the amount of the regular contributions and the return on the pension savings. In a defined benefit plan, the company is responsible for paying an agreed pension to the employee based on his or her final pay. The cost for the accounting period shows the employees’ pension entitlement of the agreed future pension in the financial year. The majority of Orkla’s pension plans are defined contribution plans. P PRINCIPLE In a defined contribution pension plan, the company is responsible The accrued liability is calculated on a straight-line accruals basis, for making an agreed contribution to the employee’s pension assets. and is measured as the present value of the estimated future pension The future pension will be determined by the amount of the contri­butions payments that are vested on the statement of financial position date. and the return on the pension savings.

It is important that the financial statement users are familiar with the assumptions that apply to the valuation of these assets and the way the Group assesses future earnings. There will be particular focus on assets that are not initially depreciated or amortised.

NOTE 19 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets and goodwill are non-physical assets that have largely been capitalised in connection with the acquisition of a company. Intangible assets classified as non-amortisable have an indefinite useful life and it is impossible on the balance sheet date to foresee when the asset will cease to have value. Goodwill is not regularly amortised either. Intangible assets and goodwill will be subject to considerable estimate uncertainty.

Unless there are significant changes in operating parameters, these assets will largely necessitate corresponding reinvestment over time. They consist of items such as land, buildings, plants, machinery, fixtures and fittings, IT equipment and vehicles. Annual ordinary depreciation is an indication of the extent of the need for corresponding reinvestment.

Tangible assets (property, plant and equipand write-downs.

Account is taken of their residual value. Useful life ments or improvements are added to the cost price of the assets. and residual value are based on estimates of future performance Property, plant and equipment with an indefinite useful life (property, (see Note 18). etc.) are not depreciated, while other property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful life. Residual Uncertainty will be particularly high for a period of time to come value is taken into account (especially in connection with properties), during which Orkla plans to reorganise its manufacturing structure and the depreciation plan is reviewed annually. If there is any indication (see Note 4). that the value of an asset may be impaired, the asset will be written down to the recoverable amount if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. When carrying out a purchase price allocation in connection with an acquisition, excess or deficit values are allocated to the assets concerned, so that these are capitalised at the Group’s acquisition cost.

Income statement items related to shares and financial assets are presented in Note 15. The difference between the fair value and acquisition cost of the security is included in the unrealised gain until the security is either sold or written down.

The value of the derivatives fluctuates in line with the prices of the underlying items, and the note shows the fair value of open derivative contracts as of the statement of financial position date. The derivatives in the table are classified by type of accounting hedge, the purpose of the derivatives, assets or liabilities according to how they are classified in the statement of financial position. P PRINCIPLE Derivatives are valued at fair value at the statement of financial position date and reported as receivables or liabilities. Gains and losses due to realisation or changes in fair value are reported in the income statement in cases where the derivative is not part of a hedging relationship that meets the criteria for hedge accounting. Embedded derivatives in contracts are identified and valued separately. Orkla currently has no embedded derivatives. Purchases and sales of derivatives are recognised at trade date. Gains and losses on currency forward contracts that hedge currency risk in shares and financial assets are reported as “Gains, losses and write-downs shares and financial assets”. Derivatives are classified in the statement of financial position as “non-interest-bearing” receivables or liabilities as the main rule. Classification as interest-­bearing is used where the hedged object itself is classified as an interest-bearing item, as well as for net investment hedges. Hedging. The Group uses the following criteria when classifying a derivative or another financial instrument as a hedging instrument: (1) The hedging instrument is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flow of an identified object – the hedging effectiveness is expected to be between 80-125%, (2) the hedging effectiveness can be measured reliably, (3) satisfactory documentation is established before entering into the hedging instrument, proving among other things that the hedging relationship is effective, (4) in the case of a cash flow hedge, that the future transaction is considered to be highly probable, and (5) the hedging relationship is evaluated regularly and has proved to be effective. Fair value hedges Cash flow hedges Net investment hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives Foreign currency gains or losses on hedging The effective part of changes in the fair value designated as hedging instruments are instruments that can be allocated to the of a hedging instrument is recognised in immediately recognised in the income effective part of the hedging relationship the comprehensive income and reclassified statement. are reported in the comprehensive income, to the income statement when the hedged Changes in the fair value of the hedged item while foreign currency gains or losses in the transaction is carried out, and presented on are recognised in the income statement ineffective part of the hedge are reported in the same line as the hedged transaction.

Measurement of financial instruments. The Group uses the following hierarchy when determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments: Level 1: Quoted, unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs with significant effect on the recorded fair value, are observable, either directly or indirectly Level 3: Other techniques based on inputs with significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data Note 31 cont. 121 Annual Report 2015 Notes Group The Group seeks as far as possible to apply the IFRS rules for hedge accounting.

P PRINCIPLE Leases are classified according to the extent to which the risks and rewards associated with ownership of a leased asset lie with the lessor or the lessee. A lease is classified as a finance lease if it substantially transfers all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. Finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over the lease period. Other leases are operating leases. Expenses related to such leases are reported as current operating expenses (see Note 13). Reported costs related to operating leases reflect the minimum leasing cost during the period of notice.

Claims that have priority by law (taxes and charges, wages etc.) must also be taken into account. The table shows that the book value of pledged assets is considerably higher than outstanding liabilities secured by pledges. Moreover, the Group’s most important loan agreements are based on a negative pledge and therefore the Group can only to a limited extent pledge its assets to secure its liabilities. Guarantee commitments are undertaken as part of the Group’s day-to-day operations and in connection with participation in general and limited partnerships. Guarantee commitments cover a variety of guarantees such as surety, rent guarantees and guarantees for other payments, but do not cover product or service liability in connection with ordinary sales.

In connection with major acquisitions, pro forma figures will normally be prepared for the new business combination, while major divestments will be presented as “Discontinued operations”, extracted from both the figures for the period and comparative figures, and presented on one line in the income statement.

For instance, there may be matters relating to time-limited agreements that could have an impact on future earnings. There may be unresolved legal disputes that could have significant effects if the judgment passed is not as expected. The information below is intended to shed light on such matters and, in combination with the financial statements and other notes, to provide a correct overall picture of the Group’s total earnings and financial position.

At Group level, the bottom line of the Orkla-format cash flow statement is net interest-bearing liabilities, an important key figure for the Group. The statement is used directly in management of the business areas and is part of the presentation of segment information. For further information, see Note 3. The statement shows the Group’s overall financial capacity, generated by operations, to cover the Group’s financial items, taxes and items more subject to Group control such as dividends and treasury share transactions. Cash flow from operations is broken down into “Cash flow from operations” and “Cash flow from operations, Financial Investments”. The last part of the cash flow statement shows the expansion measures that have been carried out in the form of direct expansion investments, acquisition of companies, disposal of companies/ parts of companies and changes in the level of investments in shares and financial assets. The cash flow statement is presented on the basis of an average monthly exchange rate, while the change in net interest-bearing liabilities is an absolute figure measured at the closing rate. The difference is explained by the currency translation effect related to net interest-bearing liabilities. Orkla Eiendom has had and will have significant fluctuations in cash flow from operations. These are related to the development and sale of real estate projects. Cash flow from operations related to real estate and financial assets is therefore presented on a separate line, independently of cash flow from operations related to industrial activities.

Subsequent accounting restatements (due to changes in accounting principles, items presented as “Discontinued operations”, etc.) are therefore not reflected in the set of figures presented. This is because Orkla wishes to present the Group as reported for the years in question, so as to illustrate the actual level of activity in each year. The key figures presented for this year in the table are identical to the figures reported in 2014, while comparative figures in the actual financial statements have been restated insofar as this is required under IFRS rules.
