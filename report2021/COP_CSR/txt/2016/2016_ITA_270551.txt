It is certainly a moment of discontinuity in our history, but it is not an interruption of that thread which has run through almost two centuries now of our active and vital presence in the areas and local economic and social communities in which we operate. The ownership structure has changed due to the different way in which shareholders express their will in meetings as a result of the change in our legal form, but our value framework has not changed and neither has our corporate culture which is embodied in our people. Our mission remains unchanged and our creed “Fare banca per bene” (to bank fairly and well) also remains firm, to generate economic and social value by considering the interests of all our stakeholders and the needs expressed by the communities in which we operate. In a world which is afflicted by a period of economic, social and environmental crisis, triggered and fuelled also by the huge inequalities in the distribution of wealth and in access to natural resources, we identify with the United Nations appeal of the Global Compact made to all public and private organisations and we maintain our commitment to apply its principles in our sphere of responsibility, an account of which is given in this document. In 2015, we conducted a detailed analysis of the meaning which we must give to the social responsibility of our Bank as a key factor of our own sustainability and that of the economic and social system in which we live. We updated the map of our stakeholders and we identified key aspects of operations around this on which to work with consistent policies, objectives and actions and for which the results achieved from time to time are to be monitored. It is an open project through which we intend to manage competition on the market making full use of both our traditional identity and our propensity to change in order to grasp all potential improvements through open and constructive dialogue with all our stakeholders. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board Andrea Moltrasio 1 2015 Sustainability Report Strategy and Analysis G4-2 Key impacts, risks and opportunities The international scenario in 2015 was one of slow economic recovery, unevenly spread across different geographical areas, and of considerable volatility on financial markets. The European environment experienced a recovery which turned out to be fragile especially in Italy. This fragility has continued to affect the banking sector, in which the trend for funding remains negative, due amongst other things to the weakness of lending, which was weaker during the year, compared with a slight improvement in credit quality. This still evolving context, which in Italy also includes the well known cases of banking crises, now also comprises the new harmonised European Union framework regarding recovery and resolution for credit institutions and investment firms, “bail ins” and the focus areas identified by the new priorities for 2016 published by the ECB Banking Supervision Function: business model and profitability risk, credit risk, capital adequacy and risk governance and data quality. The areas identified by the ECB relate primarily to risk governance for banking activities due to the impacts that a failure to comply with the principles of sound and prudent management can have in terms of social impact, due to the extent and seriousness of the potential consequences for customers and society in general. These risks have their effect on the banking sector itself, both because it is called upon to contribute financially to the resolution of crises and because of the inevitable repercussions on its reputation. UBI Banca has always placed a high level of attention on risk management, putting the pursuit of sound liquidity and capital adequacy before short-term profits and today it now benefits from a position of the highest level of reliability on the market. The analysis conducted to draw up a “Materiality Matrix”, as part of the project for transition to the new GRI-G4 reporting model, confirmed this orientation and identified among the matters related to the single material aspects reported on in this document, those areas that carry the greatest risks to be managed and the opportunities to be grasped from an economic, social and environmental viewpoint. In consideration of the nature and location of the activities carried out by the UBI Banca Group – primarily credit intermediation and transaction banking services within Italy – environmental risks appear less important both in terms of the impact they may have on the bank’s activities and the impact that banking activity may have on those risks. Nevertheless, opportunities exist that the bank intends to grasp from the viewpoint of the contribution that it can make on its value chain to the development of economic activities that are more eco-compatible and also internally by reducing direct impacts connected with its premises and its operations. The opportunities for making an impact on society through the Bank’s commercial action are considered significant as this action not only has a high ethical profile but also has a particular orientation to the presence of its business in local communities in terms above all of the ability to interpret and satisfy the needs of all groups in society and all its components. From this viewpoint, the experience of UBI Comunità – a brand specially for business with nonprofit institutions and organisations operating in the social economy – represents an important factor for the strategic positioning of UBI Banca as the goto bank for local communities, in which to make further investments. In fact in 2015, UBI Comunità acted as an experimental workshop for financial innovation with a social impact, which not only brought the Bank recognition that enhanced its reputation, but also had positive side-effects not limited to its specific market segment. At the same time work must continue on innovation to bring organisational models, processes, distribution channels, products and services into line with the evolving digital world which is having a rapidly accelerating effect on the banking and financial market.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 194-198 2 2015 Sustainability Report Strategy and Analysis Group profile G4-3 Name of the organisation Unione di Banche Italiane S.p.A.

As a result of its transformation into an ordinary joint-stock company the distinction between a “registered shareholder” and an ordinary “shareholder” no longer applies there being only persons (pursuant to the new Articles Association termed simply “shareholders”) who are automatically holders of corporate and financial rights with no need for approval procedures by the management body. The principle of per capita voting (one vote for each shareholder independently of the number of shares possessed) also disappeared to be replaced by the normal principle for joint stock companies which confers one vote for each share possessed. The Articles of Association also place a transitional limit on voting rights equal to 5% of the share capital th until 26 March 2017 (24 months following the entry into force of the law).

G4-12 Description of the supply chain G4-EC9 Local suppliers The Group’s Code of Ethics has a specific section on relations with suppliers which must be oriented towards mutual satisfaction and be based on the observance of the principles of transparency, fairness, loyalty, integrity and competition.  Code of Ethics p. 15-16 The Group’s environmental policy orients purchasing management towards the use of products and services which have a low environmental impact throughout their life-cycle and to procure supplies locally, where possible, also in order to reduce harmful emissions generated by transport.  Environmental policy  Reduction in direct environmental impacts 10 2015 Sustainability Report Group Profile The Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi manages the purchasing cycle for Group companies in compliance with the provisions of the Group Spending Regulations. These regulations, which apply to all Group companies, govern roles and responsibilities of those involved in managing budgets and incurring expenses with the separation of roles between those requesting supplies and authorising payments, those that sign contracts and handle negotiations with suppliers and those keeping the accounts and paying the invoices. Selection of suppliers Suppliers are selected with care on the basis of cost, service quality and technical, commercial and financial reliability. The Code of Ethics states that where requirements are the same, preference is given to those suppliers who demonstrate the implementation of good practices of responsibility and/or possession of social or environmental certifications. To ensure the independence of suppliers, we seek to avoid the establishment of exclusive business relationships, or those characterised by excessive financial dependence on the Group (the total amount paid to each Group supplier must not exceed 25% of the supplier’s total turnover). Contractual conditions and terms of payment Contractual conditions and terms of payment are constantly updated to comply with the legislation in force and with market conditions on the basis of periodical monitoring. Supplies which are not regular or for small amounts, and considered not strategic and which do not carry a high operational risk are regulated by the general conditions of a standard contract, while specific contracts are drawn up for recurring, strategic supplies, which carry high operational risk or which are for large amounts. In 2014 the Group adhered to the “Italian Responsible Payments Code” organised by Assolombarda (Lombard employers’ association). Companies which adhere to the code are committed to compliance with terms and conditions contractually agreed for the payment of suppliers and, more generally, to spread a culture of efficient, prompt and rapid payment practices. At present Group suppliers have signed contracts which involve payment terms ranging from a minimum of on-receipt-of-invoice up to a maximum of 120 days from the date of invoice (a very marginal proportion accounting for 0.039% of the total). The average supplier payment time in 2015 was approximately 33 days. All suppliers are required to fully comply with legislation and regulations to protect the rights of workers, which in particular means observation of national trade union agreements for the sector to which they belong and of pension, accident prevention and insurance legislation along with specific legislation on health and safety. Additionally, when an order is placed or a contract is signed, all suppliers are required to comply with the principles of the Group’s Code of Ethics. Standard contract clauses provide for the power of UBI Sistemi e Servizi to verify or have verified by it agents – at any time and using the inspection procedures considered most appropriate – that the supply of goods or the provision of services is carried out and that this complies with the applicable legislation and regulations. They also provide for a commitment by the supplier to facilitate the exercise of these verification powers, by providing UBI Sistemi e Servizi with all the information required, including the documentation, written communications and/or documents needed to carry out appropriate controls. Supply chain The Group operates almost exclusively in Italy and 96% of purchases are from local suppliers, defined as suppliers resident in Italy. Where possible and appropriate, depending on the type of products or services, use is made of suppliers who operate in the vicinity of our single operating premises. Suppliers who provide goods and services to the Group on a regular basis or occasional suppliers who supply goods and services for amounts greater than €30,000 are registered on a List of Approved Suppliers managed by the Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi. The approved list contains preferred suppliers for each type of good and service, listed on the basis of quality (50% weighting), competitiveness 11 2015 Sustainability Report Group Profile (25% weighting) and financial and capital Geographical distribution of soundness (25%) and we periodically assess them suppliers and purchases with the involvement of the offices requesting the 90% supplies (budget managers), the Purchasing 77.9% 80% 61.8% Department and an outside database. Suppliers of 70% 60% utility services (local water companies, gas 50% companies), landlords of rented properties and 40% 30% institutional suppliers (e.g. Italian Banking 20% 16.0% 13.6% 20.7% 4.5% 4.0% Association and CONSOB Italian securities market 10% 1.5% 0% authority) are excluded from management on the North Center South and Abroad list of approved suppliers. At the end of 2015 islands suppliers on the list numbered 874 (+56 compared No. suppliers Purchases with 2014, as a result of 65 new suppliers and 9 removed from the list). Management of the supplier list and the vendor rating system is supported by dedicated software that interfaces with the SAP accounting system. All buyers in the Purchasing Department can use the corporate intranet to consult a supplier’s vendor rating, the class of goods sold, figures on invoicing over the last three years, the amount of orders in progress and an indicator of dependence on the Group.

The rationalisation involved the closure of 116 branches and the transformation of 57 branches into mini branches and two mini branches into branches; • the opening of a UBI Banca representative office in Dubai [ G4-6].  Enhancement and well-being of personnel 12 2015 Sustainability Report Group Profile G4-14 Risk management approach UBI Banca adopts a prudential approach, with a view to preventing and mitigating the various types of risk.  Governance and risk management G4-15 Adherence to external codes and principles UBI Banca is maintaining its commitment, first made in 2003 by the then BPU Banca, to apply the ten universal principles of the Global Compact (www.unglobalcompact.org) in favour of human rights, the protection of labour, the environment and the fight against corruption, for the construction of a global economy that is more inclusive and sustainable.

The independent auditors Deloitte & Touche S.p.A., also engaged for the audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements of UBI Banca, were appointed for the period 2012-2020. The auditor also verifies the option declared by the bank for the application of the GRI model. 19 2015 Sustainability Report Report Parameters 20 2015 Sustainability Report Report Parameters Material topics G4-17 Boundary of the report Unless specified otherwise, the boundary of the report is that of the Consolidated Financial Statements and it is consistent with the guidelines for GRI-G4 sustainability reporting. The boundary for the data and information on the direct environmental impacts of the Group comprises the following companies: UBI Banca, UBI Sistemi e Servizi, UBI Academy, Banca Popolare di Bergamo, Banco di Brescia, Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria, Banca Regionale Europea, Banca Popolare di Ancona, Banca Carime, Banca di Valle Camonica, IWBank, BPB Immobiliare, Prestitalia, UBI Factor, UBI Fiduciaria, UBI Leasing and UBI Pramerica. In terms of scale, the boundary comprises 17,664 employees and associate workers, accounting for 95.5% of the Group work force, and 982,431 sq m of net indoor floor space. G4-18 Process for the identification of material topics The Sustainability Report is aimed at those who wish to know and study the Group’s approach to social responsibility and sustainability, to verify the consistency of its operations with its declared system of values and to assess the results achieved. The contents of the document – primarily of a non-accounting nature – have been defined by means of an analytical and structured process (analysis of the materiality) which led to the identification of sustainability-related topics that are material for UBI Banca and its stakeholders. The materiality analysis was conducted by UBI Banca in compliance with the recommendations furnished in the GRI-G4 Guidelines and it consisted of a number of steps that can be summarised as follows: 1. identification of sustainability-related topics by considering a variety of sources e.g. the GRI-G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, Financial Services Sector Disclosures, other banking Group benchmarks, an analysis of topics assessed by SRI analysts and rating agencies; 2. assessment of the materiality of each topic for the bank, on the basis of stakeholder priorities and business strategies, carried out (above all in a forward-looking manner) by the senior management of UBI Banca and by the CSR liaison officer network [ Governance e risk management]; 3. estimation of the materiality of each topic for stakeholders, weighted with the materiality attributed to them, on the basis of the results of customer satisfaction surveys and other stakeholder engagement activities carried out and SRI analyst and rating agency assessments (including the annual report of the Carbon Disclosure Project on environmental matters); 4. identification of the materiality threshold (the average of the materiality assessments described in the two previous items) and therefore of the material sustainability-related topics. A section of the Sustainability Report is devoted to each material topic identified in the “Materiality Matrix”. A series of material aspects are identified and addressed for each material topic, each of which is introduced by a description of the management approach (DMA Disclosure on Management Approach to use the GRI terminology) divided into two parts: • policies, commitments, resources and responsibilities; • goals, actions and results. 21 2015 Sustainability Report Material topics G4-19 Materiality Matrix Integrity in corporate conduct High Governance and risk management Creation of value Communication and dialogue Involvement in local communities Quality and customer satisfaction Operations rooted in local Importance for Stakeholder communities Enhancement and wellReduction in direct environmental impacts being of personnel Business lines with environmental and social aims Legend Economic and governance area Business Relations with human resources Low Other material topic Low Importance for UBI High G4-20 G4-21 Boundary of the impact of material topics ASPECT B O UN DAR Y R EL EVAN T TO PICS IN TER N AL EXTER N AL Integrity in corporate conduct Group Customers, Shareholders, Public authorities, Financial market, Community, Opinion leaders, Suppliers Governance and risk management Group Customers, Shareholders, Public authorities, Financial markets, Community Creation of value Group Shareholders, Public authorities, Community Quality and customer satisfaction UBI Banca,Network bank, Shareholders, Community Product companies Operations rooted in local communities Network banks Customers, Community Involvement local communities Network banks Community Enhancement and well-being of Group Shareholders, Customers, personnel Community Communication and dialogue Group Customers, Shareholders, Public authorities, Financial market, Community, Opinion leaders, Suppliers Business lines with environmental and UBI Banca,Network bank, Customers, Community social aims Product companies Riduction in direct environmental Group 1 Community impact 1 See G4-17. 22 2015 Sustainability Report Material topics G4-22 Restatements of data furnished in previous reports Any changes made to information contained in previous reports are reported in footnotes to tables, charts and texts. G4-23 Significant changes in the scope and topic boundaries No changes occurred during the reporting year in the Group’s structure and activities which might affect the general comparability of the information content of the 2015 Sustainability Report with that of previous years. Any reasons which might make the historical data series for single indicators non-comparable are given in the respective tables and charts. 23 2015 Sustainability Report Material topics Integrity in corporate conduct For UBI Banca “Fare Banca Per Bene” (to bank fairly and well) means creating a vision of a sound and trustworthy bank, recognised on the market for its way of management based on a constant sense of ethics, transparency and integrity in business and on results that are sustainable in the long-term. It means believing in strong and shared values and putting them into practice in observance of principles and rules of conduct which are not seen as limitations, but as the way to establish our identity on the market. The Group’s mission, values and principles are formally set out in its Charter of Values and Code of Ethics [ G4-56], which are based, amongst other things, on the principles of the UN Global Compact. They are set out in greater detail in the general rules contained in the Code of Conduct for Group staff and in the specific regulations for different areas of activity, consisting of policies, circulars and rulebooks. Compliance Policies, The “New Regulations for the Prudential Supervision of Banks” issued by the Bank of commitments, Italy (Circular No. 263 of 27th December 2006 – 15th update of 2nd July 2013) and the resources and Bank of Italy and Consob (Italian securities market authority) “Joint Regulations”, by responsibilities emphasising the key importance of an adequate Internal Control System for the purposes of sound and prudent corporate management, containing risks and capital stability, have established that Italian banks must have a “Compliance Function” with the sole and exclusive duty of managing compliance risk with regard to all corporate activities. This risk is defined as “the risk of incurring legal or administrative penalties, or substantial financial losses or reputational damages as a consequence of violations of compulsory rules or internal regulations”. Compliance risk management policies follow along the lines of the growing attention paid in Group regulations to organisational and internal control matters, on the assumption that effective organisational and governance structures constitute an essential condition for the prevention and mitigation of corporate risk factors.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 51** The Compliance Function plays a proactive and preventative role, which takes the following concrete form: • an “ex-ante assessment” of compliance with applicable regulations and of all innovative projects (including business with new products or services) that the Bank intends to undertake; • the prevention and management of conflicts of interest both between the different activities carried out by the Bank and with reference to the Bank’s employees and senior officers; • ex post assessment of the effectiveness of the processes adopted; • appropriate interaction and collaboration with the competent organisational units of the Bank in order to ensure that developments in the organisation chart, the IT system, in processes and procedures and in staff training move forward in compliance with the relevant regulations for the matters in question. The Compliance Function is therefore one of analysis, stimulation and co-ordination, for the matters for which it is responsible, that concern units in different areas with management and operational functions .  Reports and Accounts 2015 p.53**-55** 24 Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2015 Integrità nella condotta aziendale From an organisational viewpoint, the Compliance Area reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer, who has also been assigned a role, exclusively in support of the Management Board, with organisational, proposal-making and reporting functions on internal control matters, in accordance with Art. 35 of the Articles of Association. At present the Area is composed (since 1st February 2016) of four services: Compliance Operations, Banking Services Compliance, Investment Services Compliance, Coordination of Group Companies.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p.54**-55** Compliance activities involve not only external regulations but also internal regulations and the Group Code of Ethics in particular, and instances of noncompliance are seen as a means of improving internal procedures and processes. Goals, actions At the end of 2015, the Supervisory Board of the Parent also approved a Group Policy and results on internal systems for reporting violations or “whistleblowing”, which constitutes a reserved and protected channel for Group staff to report actions and facts which may constitute a violation of the regulations governing banking and financial activities during the course of carrying out their duties at work. In the first months of 2016 a complete revision of the UBI and Group compliance model was implemented as a consequence of amendments to “Compliance risk management policies” approved by the governing bodies following the publication of a “clarification note” by the Bank of Italy.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p.56** Indicators G4-57, G4-58, G4-PR4, G4-PR7, G4-PR9, G4-SO8, G4-EN29 Anti-corruption and anti money-laundering activities Policies and UBI Banca co-operates fully with the authorities in their fight against all crimes commitment, relating to its sphere of activities with particular reference to corruption, moneyresources and laundering and the finance of terrorism. responsabilities The crime of corruption, which UBI Banca is also committed to fighting as part of its adherence to the UN Global Compact, is included in Italy among the “predicate offences” falling within the sphere of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 on the administrative liability of businesses. In order to implement the provisions of Legislative Decree No. 231/2001, UBI Banca has adopted a special model of organisation, management and control (the 231/2001 Model). The model lays down rules and procedures designed to prevent the crimes covered by the decree from being committed and for the creation of a Supervisory Body and reporting and penalty systems. The Internal Control Committee of the bank was identified to play the role of the Supervisory Body, formed as an internal committee of the Supervisory Board, in order to ensure the proper functioning and constant update of the model itself and of the relative reporting and penalty systems. Furthermore, in its capacity as the Parent of the Group, UBI Banca informs subsidiaries of the policies it has set on the matter and recommends general criteria which they may follow. Each subsidiary adopts and updates its own Model with support from the Parent’s Compliance Function for those companies that have granted a specific mandate for this. Oversight of anti-money-laundering activities, inclusive of the compliance function, is performed centrally in the Group by the Anti-Money Laundering and Claims Area, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The management model, which is organised centrally for the Network Banks and its subsidiaries UBI Leasing, UBI Factor and Prestitalia, is based on the following: 25 Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2015 Integrità nella condotta aziendale • effective IT system support to manage customer risk profiles and to monitor all transactions (according to the amount limits set by the relative legislation) by using various software applications including Gianos ; • clear, exhaustive and easy-to-use internal regulations, systematically aligned with legislative regulations and procedural and self-regulatory innovations adopted; • procedural regulations which govern the acquisition and storage of documents to identify customers and record their financial profiles and to perform accounting and all other operations required – in full compliance with civil law regulations and anti money-laundering legislation – and also accurate oversight and monitoring of data acquisition and storage. The Bank takes various types of action to ensure the effectiveness of the controls it has adopted. It maintains terrorist lists and lists of persons politically exposed, acquired from reliable and independent sources, constantly up-to-date and the relative company regulations are constantly updated too. All employees receive specific training on the basis of three-year programming, designed to increase staff culture and awareness on the matter and to provide critical knowledge of new developments introduced by Bank of Italy provisions. The Internal Audit Function carries out audits of UBI Banca and of subsidiaries who have delegated internal audit function activities to the Parent and more generally, as part of the management and control duties of the Parent, of all Group companies. With regard to that auditing perimeter, in compliance with international professional standards, the Internal Audit function also carries out on-site inspections of the operation and the appropriateness of the internal control and risk management system by means of an annual plan of activities submitted to the management and supervisory bodies of the above-mentioned subsidiaries and cumulatively to the management and supervisory bodies of the Parent.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p.57** Goals, actions In 2015, the 231/2001 Model was updated for compliance with the new provisions of and results.

New control activities have been implemented concerning anti money-laundering with particular regard to the quality of the adequate verification of customers that are not natural persons. These take account of the guidelines contained in the “Analysis of anti money-laundering and the finance of terrorism”, carried out in 2014 by the Financial Security Committee of the Ministry of the Economy and Finance. Improvements to controls continued with the study of irregularity indicators able to detect matters for submission to the attention of line and control units and with their first application on the integrated “Anti money-laundering Portal” IT platform. Updates were carried out on both corporate regulations (with dedicated circulars, which were subsequently inserted in a new edition of the Anti Money-Laundering Rulebook) and on management processes, already updated in 2014 as a result of Bank of Italy provisions dated 3rd April 2013 on the subject of “Adequate Verification” and “Keeping a Single IT Archive”. Priority was given in training programmes forming part of the 2013-2015 three-year training programme to staff in the Network Banks and the other Group companies who constitute the first point of contact with customers and also to entering data into the “Single IT Archive”. [ G4-LA9] Indicators G4-SO3, G4-SO4, G4-SO5 26 Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2015 Integrità nella condotta aziendale Conduct in employment relationships Observance of the Code of Ethics commits the Bank above all to integrity in relations with its own staff. In this respect, special importance is placed on the manner in which employment relationships are managed with particular reference to trade union protection, non-discrimination and equal opportunities, and especially in respect of gender differences. Management of trade union relations Policies and The scenario in Italy is one of a high level of worker protection which UBI Banca commitment, considers its duty to maintain both on a daily basis and with regard to the resources and management of large organisational changes; it is a duty which goes beyond mere responsabilities compliance with regulations. National collective bargaining, [ G4-11] which sets not only minimum wage levels, but also specific negotiation procedures to protect workers in the implementation of substantial organisational changes. UBI Banca has always approached these negotiations with a view to seeking shared solutions, wherever possible, through transparent, concrete and continuous dialogue even beyond the minimum required by institutional procedures. There is no restriction on the freedom of association and membership of trade unions and all trade union organisations operate freely without restrictions. The Group makes adequate operational means available to them to conduct their activities.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p.46-47, 80 As concerns the management of disciplinary proceedings, UBI Banca has adopted specific guidelines, valid throughout the Group, designed to ensure they are managed properly and transparently through the formalisation of investigation, decision-making and judgement processes and through periodic reporting on the measures taken. Goals, actions The year 2015 was one of intense negotiations with trade unions, with 70 meetings for and results a total of 500 hours in which important agreements were signed to protect staff involved in the streamlining of the Group organisational structure. In addition to an approach which gives increasingly greater importance to policies to reconcile work and family demands, these agreements involve use on a voluntary basis of part-time contracts, the reduction or suspension of working hours, hour banks, smart working and working near home (using opportunities for intra group mobility where possible). Change of role and retraining processes, such as those for example made necessary by the optimisation of the Group’s distribution network, were managed with priority given to enhancing human and professional resources, pursued also by proposing training programmes, while plans to reduce staff numbers were implemented, as always, through voluntary early retirement incentive schemes. Intra group mobility is also managed, insofar as it is possible, as an opportunity for the occupational growth and enhancement of individuals, by assigning employees to new duties consistent with their qualifications, experience, potential and aptitudes. The quality of trade union relations enabled adequate solutions to be found to requirements to optimise work and render it flexible which have been, and will be in the near future, fundamental tools for achieving objectives to improve efficiency and profitability which the whole banking sector is addressing.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p.46-47 Indicators G4-LA4, G4-LA16, G4-HR3, G4-HR4 27 Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2015 Integrità nella condotta aziendale Non-discrimination Policies and All personnel management processes, starting with selection and appointment and commitment, throughout the course of an employment relationship, are based on observance of the resources and principles of non-discrimination and equal opportunities. responsabilities Particular attention is paid to the management of diversity – especially from the viewpoint of disabilities and gender equality – and to the management of disciplinary proceedings, two areas in which the risk of running into cases of discrimination are greatest. The first aspect is managed as part of human resource management and development policies and remuneration policies, while details of disciplinary proceedings are provided in the section on the management of trade union relations. Goals, actions Again in 2015, as in previous years, no reports of violation of the Code of Ethics were and results received for cases of discrimination. The Group complies with compulsory legislation and regulations on the subject of the employment of disabled persons. Positive results were recorded for gender diversity with further increases in the female component of personnel even for managerial positions, in retention levels in the management of parental leave [G4-LA3] and in the alignment of salaries at executive level, while a difference remains for the remaining staff due to the greater percentage of part-time contracts for female personnel (approximately 29% compared with 1% for male personnel). Indicators G4-LA12, G4-LA13, G4-LA14, G4-LA16 Commercial practices Policies and It is UBI Banca’s intention to develop long term economic relations with its customers commitment, based on trust and mutual satisfaction. resources and To achieve this, commercial activities are based on rigorous professional and ethical responsabilities standards aimed at substantial integrity in relationships (this includes accurate identification and management of possible conflicts of interest, with the provision in this respect of adequate information) and abstention from any improper commercial practice, from any form of advertising that is deceptive or which in any case does not fully reflect the quality of the products and services advertised and from any behaviour or agreement designed to impair market competition. UBI Banca is also committed to ensuring maximum transparency for customers with regard to its range of products and services, in compliance with the Bank’s ethical standards [ Code of Ethics p. 22] and the provisions of the relative regulations, with particular attention paid to the sale of complex financial products. On the question of complex financial products, the Consob (Italian securities market authority) has published communication No. 0097996/14 in which it recommends that intermediaries adopt special rules of conduct for the distribution of products to retail customers (“retail” for MiFID purposes), which, in the classification adopted by the UBI Banca Group, includes all customers, with the exception of professional or qualified counterparties. The Consob Communication follows on in line with recommendations on the matter issued at European level by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in the context of the two “opinions” issued in 2014. On the basis of the analysis of the contents of the Consob Communication, the Group drew up a policy on its “Range of complex financial products” in a document entitled “Risk Appetite Framework Policy for the trading, placement and subscription of financial products” approved by the Management Board and the Supervisory Board in 28 Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2015 Integrità nella condotta aziendale meetings held on 9th and 11th June 2015 respectively. This policy sets rules for the transparency, integrity and quality of products and for customer protection in the range of financial instruments supplied to customers. Goals, actions All advertising initiatives are screened by the competent units to ensure compliance and results with legislation and regulations concerning commercial practices, with particular attention paid to privacy, transparency and protection of the consumer. The Bank takes care – exploiting synergies between the different units involved – to verify compliance with the provisions of the Voluntary Code on Advertising when advertising messages are formulated, even when outside advertising agencies are brought in. “Creative” demands are always subject to compliance with the provisions of the regulations in force in terms of the clarity of the messages and the visibility and the completeness of the legal notices. The same lines of conduct are also followed for advertising at points of sale and for “digital” initiatives which make use of the worldwide web to deliver messages rapidly and to a wide audience. On the basis of the Policy for the trading, placement and subscription of financial products and in compliance with the recommendations of the supervisory authorities, UBI Banca has decided not to place any of the products identifiable as those belonging to the Consob “black list” on the primary market, because it considers that these are not appropriate to retail customers. According to Consob recommendations, these are products which could only be advised for and distributed to retail customers by adopting special precautions and following an assessment of whether they are in the interests of customers and on whether sufficient information is available to assess their characteristics and the principal risks. The necessary measures have also been adopted with regard to IW Bank’s online trading platform to prevent customers from trading in complex products on the blacklist.  Quality and customer satisfaction As part of auditing activity conducted by the various functions which contribute to the implementation of the system of internal controls, the Auditing Function also considers the effective implementation of the principles and commitments set out in the social and environmental policies which regard the Group’s commercial activities. Indicators G4-SO7, G4-PR4, G4-PR7 Relations with market regulatory authorities Policies and UBI Banca is aware of the need to maintain a banking system and financial and commitment, insurance markets that are sound and efficient, as a necessary basis for the sustainable resources and creation of value over time and its activities are therefore based on principles of coresponsabilities operation and transparency, professionalism and independence. Relations with market regulatory authorities are managed by a special unit entitled “Co-ordination with relations with authorities” in the “General affairs and equity investments area”. Goals, actions UBI Banca ensures the following with regard to all authorities: and results • prompt compliance with periodic disclosure and reporting obligations, by ensuring the completeness, integrity and truthfulness of information and data and the objectivity of assessments; • active co-operation with investigations by providing the information, documents and figures requested without reticence, omissions or delays; • support for the identification of solutions and the implementation of initiatives to improve regulation of the sector and markets, with particular reference to the prevention of fraud and the fight against criminal activities. 29 Bilancio di Sostenibilità 2015 Integrità nella condotta aziendale Indicators G4-56 Values principles and norms of behaviour The Charter of Values, Code of Ethics and policies are documents adopted by UBI Banca by means of a resolution passed by the Supervisory Board and subsequently sent to all subsidiary banks and companies for formal adoption also by their respective management bodies. The Code of Ethics in particular, due to its key role in the application of Group values and principles, is also brought to the attention of other equity investees so that they may commit to maintaining conduct consistent with the principles contained in it. It is communicated to staff through the app for the consultation of internal regulations on the corporate intranet and in hardcopy form for companies who have no access to that portal. It is delivered to members of governing bodies and to newly recruited personnel. It is published on the Group website and it is delivered to all those who work with the Group under contract or who represent the Bank without being subordinate to it, when a relationship is established. Major suppliers are required to sign a declaration of acceptance as part of the respective contract documents. G4-57 Advice on ethical and lawful behaviour The Group CSR Manager provides support and advice for training and communication activities and for the interpretation and implementation of the principles of the Code of Ethics. G4-58 Violations of the Code of Ethics Procedures for reporting suspected violations of the Code of Ethics and the relative processes for managing these are defined in the Code of Ethics itself and they are co-ordinated with other channels for reporting unethical and non-legal behaviours provided for in the 231/2001 model and in the Whistleblowing Policy.

Failings were also found in the organisation of the internal control system. Action was taken on these matters, managed directly by the Company and the Parent, and a programme of refunds for the customers concerned was implemented.

Corporate governance and organisational structure Policies, In order to support the commitments of our business mission in a consistent manner, commitments, organisational and corporate governance solutions have been adopted which make a resources and clear distinction between roles and responsibilities with a balanced composition of responsibilities bodies, effective controls, management of all corporate risks and adequate reporting. Goals, actions The organisation of UBI Banca and the Group is subject to constant review, to take and results account of changes in the environment and requirements from time to time to achieve the best configuration in terms of streamlining and operational efficiency and adequate management of all components of risk and market opportunities. Indicators G4-34, G4-35, G4-36, G4-37, G4-38, G4-39, G4-40, G4-41, G4-42 Risk management Policies, UBI Banca has adopted an Internal Control System that aims not only to ensure the commitments, compliance of operations with the law and supervisory regulations and with internal resources and policies, regulations and procedures. responsibilities The structure of the system is also designed, in compliance with the principles of sound and prudent management: to constantly check that corporate policies and strategies are implemented and that corporate processes are effective and efficient; to safeguard the value of assets and protect them from losses; to ensure that corporate information and IT procedures are reliable and secure; to maintain the current types of risk below set limits; and to prevent the risk that the Group may be involved, even involuntarily, in illicit activities (including money-laundering, usury and the financing of terrorism). Risk management policies also include reputational risk, defined as the present or future risk of incurring loss of profits or capital resulting from a negative perception of the image of the Bank by customers, counterparties, the Bank’s shareholders, investors or supervisory authorities. The management of reputational risk involves, amongst other things, social responsibility and sustainability issues and it is performed by issuing internal regulations required by a Reputational Risk Management Policy set at Group level, which outlines priority areas in which events with tangible repercussions on the Bank’s reputation might manifest. An update of that policy is programmed for 2016. Goals, actions As part of auditing activity conducted by the various functions which contribute to the and results implementation of the system of internal controls – compliance, auditing, risk management, line units – consideration is also given to the concrete implementation of the principles and commitments set out in the Group Code of Ethics and the policies and procedures adopted with regard to social and environmental aspects of operations. Furthermore, the Internal Audit Function monitors compliance with Code of Conduct rules by Group staff both through its ordinary planned audit activities and also through specific investigations were necessary. 35 2015 Sustainability Report Governance and risk management  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 194, 38**-40**, 51**-56** Indicators G4-45, G4-46, G4-47 Remuneration and fees for board members and senior managers Policies, The Group has set Remuneration and Incentive Policies designed to support medium to commitments, long-term strategies for the sustainable creation of value for shareholders and for all resources and stakeholders. responsibilities Goals, actions Total fees for the financial year 2015 paid to members of the governing bodies of the and results Group came to approximately €13.5 million (compared with €14 million in 2014) accounting for approximately 1% of staff costs.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 118** Indicators G4-51, G4-52, G4-53, G4-54, G4-55 Governance of sustainability Policies, UBI Banca promotes a sustainable business model and identifies itself as a socially commitments, responsible enterprise defined as an enterprise which gives consideration, in the resources and definition of its strategy, the formulation of its policies and in its operations, to the responsibilities interests of all its stakeholders and to the impact that its operations on the economy, society and the environment .

Again with this new legal form, UBI Banca has maintained its two tier governance system which involves the division of functions between a Supervisory Board and a Management Board considered better suited to the governance requirements of the Parent and more appropriate for the protection of its shareholders. In applying this system UBI Banca takes account of the provisions and principles governing listed issuers and banking activities contained in the Consolidated Finance Act and the relative regulations to implement it adopted by the Consob (Italian securities market authority), in the Consolidated Banking Act and in the Borsa Italiana Spa Corporate Governance Code for Listed Companies. Particular attention is paid to the management of conflicts of interest, which are regulated in compliance with the applicable legislation and regulations. The governance system adopted involves separation of the roles of the Chair of the highest governing body – the Supervisory Board – and of the Chief Executive Officer.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 7**,13**-25**, 42**-49** Committees have been created within the Supervisory Board which oversee specific issues. These include an Appointments Committee, which oversees the update of corporate governance rules and principles of conduct which may be adopted by the Parent and its subsidiaries, also with regard to developments on the matter at national and transnational level, and it assesses the adequacy of the commitment made to corporate social responsibility issues.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 26**-28** Ethical, social and environmental aspects of operations are co-ordinated by the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Manager, a direct report to the Chief Financial Officer (on the staff of the Chief Executive Officer), who co-ordinates matters of an ethical nature, consistent with the strategic vision of the Bank and in implementation of the Group’s social responsibility model. Specific responsibilities are delegated in the General Regulations of the Bank as follows: • the Welfare and Mobility Manager, in the Human Resources Area under the Chief Operating Officer, who is responsible for optimising systematic travel by employees [ EN19] and for the conception and co-ordination of action to improve the quality of life of persons inside and outside the Bank, from the viewpoint of both organisational well-being and personal well-being, offering concrete opportunities in terms of services and benefits [ LA2]; 37 2015 Sustainability Report Governance and risk management • the Health and Safety Manager, head of the Prevention and Protection at the Workplace Unit, who reports to the Chief Operating Officer, responsible for the management of all aspects relating to the health and safety of workers, by means of occupational risk assessment, prevention and monitoring action and the appropriate corrective and training action [ LA5]; the Energy Manager, head of the Energy Management Operational Unit in the Real Estate Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi, who is responsible for analysing the energy requirement and for taking action to optimise consumption and improve the energy efficiency of buildings and services [ EN3].

Updating of the expertise of the members of the management and supervisory bodies is nevertheless to be broadened to also include environmental and social aspects that may constitute risks and opportunities for banking activities. Environmental and social aspects of operations – and the related risks and opportunities – fall specifically within the responsibilities assigned to the Appointments Committee [ G4-35, G4-36] and at the level of the entire Supervisory Board as part of the Reputational Risk Policy and the process for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, with regard in particular to agreement on the Stakeholder Map and the Materiality Matrix [ G4-18]. 38 2015 Sustainability Report Governance and risk management  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 17**-19**, 45**-47** G4-49 Process for communicating critical concerns to the highest governing body Nature, number and management of critical concerns communicated to the highest G4-50 governing body The only official process for communication between stakeholders and the highest governing body consists of ordinary and extraordinary Shareholders’ Meetings. These may be convened by shareholders themselves in compliance with the provisions of the Articles of Association. Shareholders may also ask for matters to be added to the agendas of Shareholders’ Meetings as well as to submit motions for approval on matters already on the agenda. If they are shareholders of the Bank, employees may take part in Shareholders’ Meetings and speak following the same procedures that apply to all shareholders. Critical concerns, remarks and proposals may also be put forward by trade union representatives of companies and the Group in periodic meetings required under the various trade union agreement procedures and in other opportunities for meetings, such as equal partnership commissions and bi-lateral observatories on corporate social responsibility, corporate climate, training and equal opportunities matters [G4-LA8].  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 80, 63**-64** G4-51 Remuneration policies for the highest governing body and senior management Remuneration for members of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board does not include variable forms of pay. The only exceptions to this are the remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer and members of the Management Board classified as senior management of UBI Banca, who may receive performancebased forms of pay. The principles and procedures for management remuneration are regulated as part of Group Remuneration and Incentive Policies, which provide for remuneration packages differentiated in terms of the fixed, variable and benefit components for the category to which staff belong. The variable component of remuneration is mainly based on performance measurement, on both an annual and long-term basis with the objective of involving and orienting staff towards medium to long-term strategies, by recognising the value of individual and team contributions. To ensure a more direct correlation between results and rewards a bonus pool has been set, to which access is gradual on the basis of the satisfaction of preliminary trigger conditions by the Group and the achievement of risk-adjusted profit targets set at the level of both the Group and the individual business entity. The measurement is related to income statement and balance sheet indicators corrected for risk, internal and external customer satisfaction levels, strategic projects and assessments of the effectiveness of their behaviour. Performance-based variable remuneration consists of: • short-term incentive schemes (annual); • long-term incentive schemes (three-yearly); • the company productivity bonus (or a result bonus, as defined by the current national trade union agreement; • commercial “contests”. To complete the variable component of remuneration, it is possible to pay one-off bonuses, for outstanding performance and with a view to motivation and retention. Once the access trigger conditions have been verified together with the main Group and company performance indicators, these are defined in a Merit Plan in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Parent, the costs set in the budget and criteria of selectivity and merit. Again in relation to the variable performance-based component, provision has also been made for the repayment of bonuses that have already been disbursed, using clawback mechanisms that take individual behaviours into account, as set out in the regulatory framework, whether or not there are compensation or disciplinary issues. These mechanisms were not applied to any member of staff during the course of 2015. 39 2015 Sustainability Report Governance and risk management Total expenses incurred at consolidated level in 2015 for the remuneration of board members and statutory auditors of the UBI Group amounted to approximately €13.5 million, (down on €14 million in the previous year) accounting indicatively for 1% of staff costs.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 119**, 153**, 159**-161**, G4-52 Process for determining remuneration G4-53 Stakeholders and remuneration The main parties involved in the process to determine remuneration are as follows: • a UBI Banca Shareholders’ Meeting; • the Supervisory Board; • the Remuneration Committee; • the Risk Committee; • the Management Board; • Shareholders’ Meetings of the Italian subsidiary banks; • the Boards of Directors and Boards of Statutory Auditors of banks and companies; • the Strategic Planning and Capital Management Functions; • Human Resources, Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit, as corporate control functions. A UBI Shareholders’ Meeting not only determines the total remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board, it also approves the remuneration policies of the Supervisory Board and Management Board, the incentive component based on financial instruments, and the criteria and limits for determining remuneration in the event of the early termination of employment relationships or of offices held. The Supervisory Board, on the basis of a proposal from the Management Board within the scope of its 1 responsibilities , and after prior consultation with the Remuneration Committee, which involves the competent corporate functions, and with the Risk Committee for verification of compliance with the “Risk Appetite Framework” sets and reviews the remuneration and incentive policies of the Group on at least an annual basis and approves the Report on Remuneration, Section I of which is subject to a non-binding vote by a UBI Shareholders’ Meeting. The policies are then submitted for approval by the Shareholders’ Meetings of the Italian banks and the Boards of Directors of foreign banks and companies, except for the incentive component based on financial instruments, which is subject to approval by a UBI Shareholders’ Meeting. Information is also provided to the above bodies by means of the Annual Report on Remuneration within the Group. The Management Board, having incorporated any general recommendations made by the Remuneration Committee, formulates – with support from the competent functions – a proposal, within the scope of its responsibilities, for Remuneration and incentive policies and the relative tools to implement them which is submitted to the Supervisory Board for its approval after prior consultation with the Remuneration Committee. That same Management Board and the Boards of Directors of the banks and subsidiaries, in accordance with the policies set, approve, within the scope of their responsibilities, the relative means to implement them and, with the support of Human Resources and the other competent functions, direct choices concerning the management and remuneration of staff. The Management Board, having taken account of any proposals from the Remuneration Committee in those cases where it is required by the regulations in force, also determines the remuneration of the Senior Management of UBI Banca and all personnel belonging to the “Material Risk Taker” perimeter and indicates the amount of the remuneration for Senior Management and Personnel belonging to the Material Risk Taker perimeter of subsidiary companies to be submitted to the Boards of Directors of those companies. The foregoing is submitted to the Supervisory Board for verification of compliance, after prior consultation with the Remuneration Committee. With the exception of matters reserved to a Shareholders’ Meeting, the Management Board submits any exceptions to the policies for an opinion from the Remuneration Committee and for the consequent resolutions of the Supervisory Board. 1 Policies for the remuneration of Governing Bodies do not fall within the remit of the Management Board. 40 2015 Sustainability Report Governance and risk management The corporate control functions are involved ex ante, working together to ensure the adequacy and regulatory compliance of the policies and practices adopted, and carry out ex post monitoring of their proper functioning and application. The Remuneration Committee makes use of outside advisors in its advisory and supervisory activities and carries out benchmarking activity with respect to the external wage market.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 28** Remuneration and incentives policies [G4-52] are designed with the objective of creating value over time and pursuing sustainable growth for shareholders, employees and customers. The approval procedure for them ensures the participation of shareholders in decision-making on remuneration to be implemented to support the Group’s medium and long-term strategies In addition to determining the total remuneration for the members of the Supervisory Board and acknowledging the Annual Report on Group Remuneration, UBI Banca shareholders also approve the following: • remuneration policies for the Supervisory Board and the Management Board; • the incentive component based on financial instruments; • the criteria and limits for determining remuneration in the event of the early termination of an employment relationship or of an office held; • an increase in the ratio between variable and fixed components of remuneration up to a maximum of 2:1. Shareholders’ Meetings of the Italian subsidiary banks are responsible for approving their remuneration policies and setting remuneration for their governing bodies, on the basis of proposals made by their boards of directors, in accordance with the instructions of the competent bodies of the Parent. They are also responsible for approving remuneration and/or incentive schemes based on financial instruments relating to their business, for increasing the ratio of variable to fixed remuneration above the limit of 1:1 and for the criteria and limits set for determining remuneration to be agreed in the event of the early termination of an employment relationship or of an office held, subject to the approval of a UBI Shareholders’ Meeting. The Shareholders’ meetings also adopt the Annual Report on Remuneration submitted by the competent bodies of the Parent. With regard to the previous year, all the resolutions submitted to the UBI Shareholders’ Meeting were passed with a very large majority in favour. G4-54 Ratio between remuneration received The member of staff with the highest remuneration in the Group earned €1,579,774 in 2015, 33 times the median amount of remuneration for all employees, with the exclusion of the member of staff with the highest remuneration. These calculations included both full and part-time employees (using a “full time equivalent pay rate”) and fixed and variable remuneration as well as non-monetary benefits were considered inclusive of incentive schemes (figures estimated on the 2015 cash quota), one-off bonuses, company bonuses and commercial contests. G4-55 Ratio of increases in remuneration The highest remuneration paid in the Group increased by 2.3% compared with the previous year, while the median increase in remuneration for all employees, with the exclusion of the highest-paid member of staff and personnel with foreign contracts, was 0.5%. These calculations included both full and part-time employees (using a “full time equivalent pay rate”) and fixed and variable remuneration as well as nonmonetary benefits were considered inclusive of incentive schemes (figures estimated on the 2015 cash quota), one-off bonuses, company bonuses and commercial contests. 41 2015 Sustainability Report Governance and risk management Creation of value UBI Banca considers that the Group’s capital strength is both a value for customers and for the stability of the banking system and that the creation of economic value (profitability) should be an advantage not only for shareholders, but also for employees and the communities in which it operates and for society in general. The creation of value is intended in the broad sense and not only in the technical sense relating solely to quantitative metrics, except for calculation of the economic value generated and distributed to stakeholders according to the framework set out by the Italian Banking Association (ABI) in compliance with the GRI methodology. Profitability Policies, The creation of sustainable value in the long-term for shareholders and for all the commitments, Group’s stakeholders is a priority objective for UBI Banca. It is pursued by means of resources and projects to rationalise the Group, its distribution network and its workforce in order to responsibilities improve efficiency and contain costs and by means of projects to innovate processes, products and services in order to increase the Group’s competitiveness on the market in terms of quality and value for money. Goals, actions Growth in the ordinary profitability of the Group was confirmed at the end of 2015 and results with consolidated profit net of non-recurring items of €195.1 million (+33.2% compared with 2014 and +95% compared with 2013). The profit actually recognised was €116.8 million, compared with a loss of €725.8 million in 2014, following the recognition of impairment losses on intangible assets. This also made it possible to propose the distribution of a dividend to shareholders of 11 eurocents per share (+37.5% compared with 2014). The operating results for the Group in 2015 confirmed the following:  good progress by net fee and commission income which accounted for approximately 39% of operating income (+6% compared with 2014), driven by investment products;  consolidation of the improvement in credit quality with less need for provisions (-13.6%). These improvements more than compensated for performance by net interest income (-10.3%), affected mainly by a smaller contribution from the securities portfolio – progressively reducing in size with a change in the mix – but also for strong competition on markets for new lending and a smaller contribution from the loan portfolios that are being run off. As concerns operating expenses, towards the end of the year the Group, together with two other major Italian banks, contributed to the rescue of four banks in difficulty, by making loans to the Resolution Fund, in addition to paying extraordinary contributions, required of all banks in the country. Constant control over costs succeeded in absorbing the entire impact of the ordinary annual contributions to the Resolution Fund and to the Deposit Guarantee Scheme, leaving recurring operating expenses largely unchanged compared with 2014. The extraordinary contributions to the Resolution Fund and expenses relating to the integration of IW Bank temporarily raised costs for the year by 3.7% compared with 2014.  G4-13, Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 37, 45, 97, 104-105 Indicators G4-EC1, G4-EC2, G4-EC4, G4-EC8 42 2015 Sustainability Report Creation of value Capital strength Policies, In consideration of the particularly volatile conditions on financial markets, which have commitments, now been affecting the economic situation for some time, the Bank’s stock market resources and capitalisation is now substantially different from its book value. responsibilities Since it is the various components of the latter and the various ratios by which it is measured that the supervisory authorities refer to in order to monitor the state of health of banks and to determine sustainable levels of lending, the quality, maintenance and growth over time of this value are priority objectives for UBI Banca together with the quality of credit for the sustainability of its business model. Goals, actions The Group’s capital strength is confirmed by a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (an indicator and results of its highest quality capital) as at 31.12.2015 of 12.08% (inclusive of the impact of the right of withdrawal held by shareholders in relation to the Bank’s transformation into an ordinary joint-stock company) and a Total Capital Ratio of 13.93%.

Financial implications and other risks and opportunities for the organisation’s activities G4-EC2 due to climate change In consideration of the activities it performs, the Group has no significant direct exposure to risks connected with climate change. Minor impacts may occur in relation to supply processes, especially with regard to fuel and electricity costs and commercial and lending processes relating to the occurrence of extreme climatic events which could affect the operating capacities and solvency prospects of corporate clients (a risk which is, however, mitigated by the high sector diversification of the Group’s lending). On the other hand, business opportunities may be created as a result of investments by individuals and businesses in energy savings and in the use of alternative energies and investments by businesses to comply with evolving regulations and the efficiency standards for products and production processes.  DMA Policies, products and services with environmental aims, G4-FS8 G4-EC4 Financial assistance received from government UBI Banca has never received any form of government assistance. UBI Banca has carried out operations with central banks for financial stability purposes and to facilitate the transmission of monetary policy. G4-EC8 Significant indirect economic impacts Given its nature and its distribution network in the community, the UBI Banca Group generates significant indirect impacts on the economy, that are very difficult to quantify. They mainly regard the following:  the competitiveness of the economy, as a result of support to small and medium-sized enterprises to promote growth and technological innovation and to overcome the crisis [ DMA Support for household and businesses in difficulty, UBI-3, G4-FS7];  the development of depressed economic areas, through geographical choices for the location of branches and the allocation of economic resources [ G4-6, G4-FS13];  the development of the green economy and the reduction of environmentamyl costs through support for investments for energy savings and the development and use of renewable energies [ DMA Policies, products and services with environmental aims, G4-FS8];  the reduction of risks and the maximisation of the social benefits of development through attention to issues such as financial inclusion and education, growth of a financial civil economy (the third sector) [DMA Policies, products and services with social aims, G4-FS7, DMA Access to financial services by disadvantaged persons, G4-FS14, DMA Financial education, UBI-4], protection of health and safety at the workplace lavoro [ DMA Health and Safety, G4-LA5-LA8], non-discrimination and equal opportunities [ DMA Conduct in employment relationship, G4-LA12]. On a national scale, UBI Banca can help reduce the social costs of economic inequalities, increase the efficiency and stability of the financial system and act to fight against illegal conduct. 45 2015 Sustainability Report Creation of value Communication and dialogue The UBI Banca Group recognises the value of communication and dialogue with stakeholders to seek, where possible, shared solutions for the economic, social and environmental problems that affect the communities in which it operates and society in general. The Group’s objective is to increase its capacity to generate new ideas through listening to all its partners with a view to constantly improving decision-making processes, products and service efficiency, and to base its activities on a constant sense of business ethics, transparency and integrity, in pursuit of a relationship of trust with all its stakeholders. Stakeholder engagement activities are structured with consideration given to the intensity of the relationship and the breadth and urgency of the interests held by different stakeholders, in addition to the procedures laid down by specific legislation and regulations (e.g. Shareholders' Meetings, negotiations with trade unions) and established practice (e.g. investor relations). Communication and Marketing Policies, Dialogue with the community, especially at local level is based on the intense personal commitments, interaction, not only of a commercial nature, which characterises UBI Banca’s resources and presence on its markets. Direct communication is a determining factor in the responsibilities establishment of clear and transparent relationships with customers. News about the services provided is communicated to customers by using websites and social media, telephone campaigns (outbound campaigns), specialist newsletters, SMSs, ATMs and avatars in the reserved area of the banking website. Communication activities are supported by organisational and IT procedures to meet customers' requirements for transparency, a key factor in all long-term relationships based on mutual respect. Goals, actions In 2015 it was considered whether to broaden dialogue to include venues outside and results institutional and operational premises in order to find agreement on sustainability practices and acquire proposals for possible future lines of action. Two initiatives were taken in Bergamo and Brescia to launch a new programme of multi-stakeholder involvement in important issues for local communities and in interpretation of what the Bank might do through its activities and initiatives. In addition to inviting representatives of important institutions, bodies and organisations present in local communities, an attempt was made to attract the interest and involvement of a broader stakeholder base with a campaign of communication and interaction on Twitter and Facebook. Indicators G4-24, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27, G4-PR3 Internal communications Policies, The Group is committed to ensuring adequate circulation of information by means of commitments, internal communication based on principles of completeness, promptness, clarity and resources and transparency in order to share the Bank’s patrimony of values, knowledge and responsibilities experience and for each worker to knowledgeably participate in the implementation and achievement of corporate policies and objectives.  Code of ethics p.14 Goals, actions Internal communication activity continued in 2015 designed, amongst other things, to and results further develop motivational engagement and a sense of identity by using the Group’s corporate internet entitled UBILife to publish news and video messages to conduct 46 2015 Sustainability Report Communication and dialogue surveys and to offer spaces where personnel can share information and chat with each other. Employees were also involved in the now firmly established internal customer satisfaction surveys and also in a new organisational climate survey.  Reports and accounts 2015 p. 66-68, 82-83, 200 Indicators G4-24, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27 Relations with opinion leaders Policies, Relations with opinion leaders are mainly developed through the media. These are commitments, carried out solely by the competent organisational units and they are designed to resources and provide relevant and reliable information on the structure, activity, and financial responsibilities position of the Bank, its policies and strategies, including social and environmental policies, and the impacts of action taken. Relations are conducted according to the principles of integrity, transparency, independence and equal treatment for each newspaper and journalist. Mirroring the communication strategy of UBI Banca, the Network Banks themselves work to obtain adequate coverage in the press (the local press especially), for their activities and initiatives. Goals, actions A more proactive approach was taken to both conventional and digital media in 2015 and results in order to project a positioning that is consistent with: the importance, solidity and reliability of the Group in the processes in which the Italian banking system is evolving; with the quality of its commercial activities according to the “Fare banca per bene” (to bank fairly and well) principle; and with its capacity to innovate especially in view of the mass digitisation processes in progress. The result is an increase of 11% in 1 relevant articles in print editions and an even greater increase in online editions. Online articles have more than doubled over the last two years (+88% in 2015 with virality that has more than tripled). Activity on social media intensified during the year with the Group’s launch on Instagram exactly one year after its debut on Facebook and the development of positioning on LinkedIn by identifying the first employer branding activities and the creation of a dedicated campaign to tell people of the Group’s values in a clear and appealing fashion. The Group received 53,000 likes on its Facebook page (+53% compared with 2014) and almost 500 for posts published, to reach a total of 67 million views for channels and contents carrying the UBI Banca logo. The Group reached first place on the Instagram channel in the banking sector for number of followers and interactions in just two weeks. Good results were also achieved on the YouTube channel with 1,700,000 minutes of videos viewed during the year.

Indicators G4-24, G4-25, G4-26, G4-27 Indicators G4-24 Stakeholder groups engaged G4-25 Procedures for selection of stakeholders for engagement The UBI Banca Code of Ethics defines Group stakeholders by dividing them into three classes: • entities and parties which have essential or significant interests with respect to carrying on business, due to the direct and specific nature of the relationships established or of the investments made (e.g. customers, personnel, suppliers, investors); • entities and parties which have significant interests, not based on direct business relationships, that are affected by the external impacts of the Group’s activities or by which UBI’s activity is directly influenced or conditioned (the community, with particular reference to local communities); • organisations and institutions which represent widespread interests or interests specific to different categories of stakeholder which are able to exert influence over UBI (e.g. public sector authorities, operators on financial markets, the media and opinion leaders, stakeholder organisations).  Code of Ethics p.5-6 The stakeholder map contained in the Code of Ethics was drawn up as part of the project for the transition to the new G4 guidelines on the basis of six characteristics (direct influence, responsibility, dependence, closeness, political and strategic intention, representativity) and with account taken of the Bank’s existing activities and objectives on the question of sustainability.

These set minimum and general standards for the preparation of the documentation used to provide customers with information (structure of the documents, essential information, choice of terminology, standardisation of some common types of contract) and they also introduce obligations for banking and financial intermediaries as well as for the marketing of traditional banking services of an organisational or control nature for compliance with regulations governing transparency and integrity in relations with customers. The transparency provisions apply to the purchase of traditional banking and financial products (e.g. current accounts and other forms of deposit, financing, payment instruments) and to each stage of relationships between intermediaries and customers: the precontract stage, before the contract is signed (document on customer rights and information sheet, distribution of summary cost indicators, prevention of disputes through organisational controls), the stage at which the contract is signed (summary documents, form of the contracts) and the post-contract stage involving relations between intermediaries and customers (periodic documentation, dispute management). These rules sit alongside other sets of regulations governing transparency and integrity in relations with customers such as for example those that govern the provision of investment services, regulated by the Consolidated Finance Act, or of insurance products as well as the regulations contained in the “Consumer Code”. Compliance with these is subject to particular attention within the Group, which has also introduced a commitment in its Code of Ethics to always provide customers with full, clear and easy to understand information at every stage of customer relationships. 49 2015 Sustainability Report Communication and dialogue Quality and customer satisfaction Historically, Group banks have a strong direct relationship with customers which, together with the high quality of the products and services offered, has always been a distinctive feature of UBI Banca and it is an important factor for customer fidelity and its competitiveness on the market. Even with the transfer of a large part of current business onto remote channels, the quality of relationships remains of key importance in making commercial propositions and in delivering advisory and value added services. With “digital bank” services, the protection of customers’ privacy and their data has become a key factor in the integrity of relationships. The quality and adequacy of products and services Policies, The Group has set a specific Policy for the development of products in order to define commitments, explicit and rigorous measures for the development and distribution of new products resources and and to maintain those for existing products, with the exception of those for which responsibilities specific regulations apply, or are currently being issued (e.g. subsidised loans). This process is designed to help achieve objectives of quality, technological innovation, competitiveness and compliance with regulations, consistent with our mission, strategy, business goals and the overall corporate architecture of the Group. The process is designed to ensure that products and services are consistent with customers’ needs and that response times to market demands (time to market) are reduced, and it requires the involvement of different organisational units. Some organisational units (at the Parent) must always be involved: Communication and Marketing, Legal Affairs and Litigation, Risk Management, Administration and Tax, Compliance. The characteristics (e.g. age, occupation, investment plans) and needs of customers (e.g. financial, protection) are surveyed through special consultation and interview procedures (e.g. focus groups with customers and potential customers and with commercial distribution network staff) or systematic procedures (e.g. the customer satisfaction survey project or complaints management) and through the analysis of competitor’s products and services. Active participation in observatories and working groups (e.g. through the Italian Banking Association) or research centre initiatives are also the source of valuable information, for example in relation to the possibilities offered by new technologies. Competitiveness is based on a pricing policy oriented towards transparency and fairness to customers and it involves analysis and constant monitoring of the relationships between the risk taken (if present), the return, the costs incurred and the market context, with account taken of the need to provide financial support to local communities and businesses. Goals, actions Our products and services are constantly updated, with advantage taken of and results opportunities offered by technological progress to improve them and broaden the range. Activities continued in 2015 with the Digital Innovation Project – launched in 2014 – to develop and reinforce the range of services available using a multi-channel approach. The objective of the project, managed by a dedicated team, is to monitor, study and implement best services using technology to generate a better user experience that is both simple and transparent. Those same guidelines also apply to communication, which follows evolving digital technology to provide customer 50 2015 Sustainability Report Quality and customer satisfaction contact channels that are clearer, faster and more interactive. A multi-year study is also underway to define and renew the interior layout of branches, where the goal is to make them more comfortable and attractive with a strong emotional content and digital innovation.  Reports and Accounts 2015, p. 61-62 Indicators UBI-1 The quality of customer relationships Policies, The quality of customer relationships and customer satisfaction are monitored by commitments, means of fidelity indicators such as the life of the relationship, customer satisfaction resources and surveys (the “Consultation Project”) and the analysis of complaints. More specifically, responsibilities the level of satisfaction is measured through the UBIndex (a summary index which measures the quality perceived, calculated monthly by bank, market, segment, local management area and branch) and it is also one of the determining criteria for the Group staff incentive scheme. The UBI Banca Customer Care Service, which reports directly to the General Manager, oversees the quality of the services provided by the Group to its customers and it supports Senior Management in the formulation of corporate policies designed to foster a culture of internal and external customer care and satisfaction. In detail:  it designs the structure of internal and external customer satisfaction surveys, which are always conducted by an outside independent party;  it monitors the quality expected and the quality perceived by external customers in order to improve the service model;  it makes periodic reports on the results of the surveys conducted, providing support to the Network Banks in the distribution of the data and, in agreement with the functions involved, it proposes the most appropriate corrective action. The UBI Claims Function, located within the Anti-Money Laundering & Claims Area:  manages complaints made by customers of the Parent and the relative “alternative dispute resolution” (ADR) procedures and, in co-operation with the Legal Affairs and Litigation Area and the Global Transaction and Operations Area, carries out activities relating to applications for mediation;  it monitors the progress and content of complaints made by the Network Bank and Group Company customers and the relative ADR procedures and it also furnishes information on the proper management of the different types of dispute;  it supports the Compliance Area with work to analyse claims designed to identify possible improvement action from an organisational and procedural viewpoint. Goals, actions The Customer Care Unit uses internal (mainly commercial distribution network staff) and results and external customer satisfaction surveys to monitor and study two quality dimensions: the quality perceived by external customers in their relationships with the bank and the quality delivered and that is the service provided by the bank through its various products, software applications and processes. With the new Quality Project, the quality expected by Group customers is now also measured. In 2015, customer satisfaction surveys involved over 120 thousand customers (including individuals and businesses) of the Group. The comparison benchmark was constructed by interviewing approximately 11 thousand customers of competitor banks using the same methodology as that used for UBI Banca customers. The year 2015 saw a significant increase in customer satisfaction on all markets: +8 51 2015 Sustainability Report Quality and customer satisfaction points for the “Unity” market (corporate and private banking) and +4 points for the retail market. The increases in Group customer satisfaction broadened the gap between UBI and the benchmark: +8 points for the retail market, +5 points for the private banking market and +3 points for the corporate market .  Reports and Accounts 2015, p. 66-67 The Consultation Project focused on specific aspects which included UBI Banca’s image and its social responsibility and customer knowledge of the brand. The survey of UBI Banca’s image found strengths such as the trust that the Bank conveys and its efficiency (aspects recognised by 86% of the customers interviewed and which position the Group well above the entire banking sector). The Group was well-positioned compared with the banking sector as a whole also with regard to institutional aspects such as solidity and future prospects. With regard to social responsibility, which is perceived as having improved compared with 2014, the level of satisfaction is high with regard to the following: the commitment shown by the bank to clear and full information on the management of personal data and customer rights with regard to privacy; integrity in its commercial approach; support to families and businesses (also with regard to natural disasters); and loans for the environment (e.g. to improve energy efficiency in homes). The UBI Banca brand was known to over 60% of those interviewed. The survey of complaints and claims is also an important tool for identifying potential problem areas in the product range, in the delivery of services and in the overall quality of customer relationships and it constitutes an opportunity to restore or improve a constructive and satisfactory customer relationship. In line with directives on transparency and the guiding principles adopted by the Group, various channels have been made available to the public to submit complaints and claims: local branches, conventional mail and fax channels, ordinary and certified electronic mail, the websites of Group companies and the Customer Telephone Service. All the channels are advertised on information pamphlets pinned up in branches and in dedicated sections of the Group’s websites. First-time complaints received in 2015 by the Group numbered 19,520 of which: 5,353 by UBI Banca, 6,944 by the Network Banks and 7,223 by the product companies.  Reports and Accounts 2015, p. 69-72 Indicators G4-PR5 Protection of privacy Policies, Increasingly greater recourse to new technologies, not only to manage information but commitments, also for payment services and for the purchase of banking and financial products resources and brings with it greater importance to the protection of customer data as part of the responsibilities protection of privacy. Goals, actions In order to achieve this, the Group employs a “Protection of privacy” handbook and a and results series of organisational and technical measures, with locks and other protective instruments on IT systems, designed to ensure not only the necessary compliance with security and data protection requirements, but also observance of the consents granted by customers regarding the processing of their personal data for commercial and marketing purposes. Customer protection is also implemented by keeping customers constantly up-to-date with information on the most appropriate anti-fraud procedures and measures for the secure use of Internet and mobile banking services and with a business continuity plan, 52 2015 Sustainability Report Quality and customer satisfaction which involves both a series of technical and organisational measures designed to ensure that the most critical processes will be operational even in emergency situations and also a series of periodic disaster recovery controls and tests. As concerns the acquisition and processing of personal data for commercial purposes, the fundamental rights and freedoms and the dignity of those concerned are always th guaranteed in compliance with Legislative Decree No. 196 of 30 June 2003 (Privacy Code) on the protection of personal data.

Its bricks and mortar presence, integrated by its digital bank services with a multichannel approach, therefore remains essential for maintaining its local roots and but it is above all through the quality of its commercial activities and its activities to support economic and social development in local communities that it adds value to society, as expressed also in the Group’s Charter of Values. Funding and loans in local communities Policies, UBI Banca pursues a path towards growth which in parallel with that of local commitments, economies. Its mission is to use the savings of families to finance the life projects of resources and families themselves and the business projects of firms. It is a virtuous circle between responsibilities saving, consumption and investment which generates growth and well-being in local communities and sees the bank committed to seeking to maintain its financial support even at the most difficult times. Great attention is placed in all assessments of credit authorisations and loans to prevent the risk of over-indebtedness on the part of customers which would compromise their ability to meet their commitments with repercussions both on their ability to gain access to new loans and on the quality of the Bank’s credit quality, which is one of the main indicators monitored by supervisory authorities and market regulators. Proposals made to businesses consider the dynamics of the various economic sectors with the objective of creating solutions that will best support those with the best prospects for growth and the greatest ability to innovate. Co-operation with local, national and EU authorities and institutions is also important in providing support for the financial requirements of businesses. These include trade associations and the associated guarantee bodies, the Guarantee Fund for SMEs pursuant to Law No. 662/1996, the European Investment Bank (EIB) – with which substantial loan pool agreements have been stipulated – and the European Central Bank (ECB) through participation in the TLTRO long-term financing programme. The Group’s business roots in local communities also include its ability to support the production of goods and services and of welfare services in particular, which are provided increasingly by the civil society economy of the “Third Sector”. The UBI Comunità range is dedicated to this sector, managed by a specialist organisational unit in the Retail Commercial Area.

In order to receive finance, projects must have passed the authorisation procedures set under current Italian law (environmental impact assessment, declaration of the start of activity, single authorisations, building permit, etc.) and the technical, legal, administrative and insurance assessments performed on behalf of the Bank by major independent advisors of international standing. 59 2015 Sustainability Report Operations rooted in local communities Involvement in local communities As a driver of development in local communities, it is essential for the Bank to consider social aspects which, together with economic aspects, impact on the quality of people’s lives. On this basis, it has relations with a wide variety of authorities, institutions and organisations with whom it helps to identify important needs in the community and whose actions it supports both through its banking operations and through its policy of making key philanthropic interventions for social initiatives. While the banking activities are managed as part of its commercial units and policies, its philanthropic activities fall mainly under the responsibility of the governing bodies and they are also financed with resources allocated according to articles of association related-provisions when profits for the year are distributed. Dialogue with and Support for Local Institutions Policies, The Group is aware of the key role it plays promoting innovation and encouraging the commitments, acquisition and spread of expertise and it therefore maintains and develops constant resources and co-operation with academic institutions and centres of knowledge. It’s active presence responsibilities and support for schools, universities, local institutions and research centres are important for guaranteeing the economic citizenship of the population and the competitiveness of the business and economic environments in the local areas in which it operates as well as favouring the progress and spread of knowledge. Goals, actions The Group has well-established relations with numerous schools and universities (the and results Bocconi, Cattolica and Bicocca universities of Milan, the universities of Bergamo, Brescia, Pavia, Turin, Genoa and Bari, the Insubria University of Varese, the Carlo Cattaneo University of Castellanza, the Polytechnic University of the Marches, the University of Camerino and the Universities of Basilicata, Campania, Apulia and Calabria, the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, the University of Padua and Verona, the Federico II University of Naples), with which it co-operates to finance scholarships and for which it offers services for students and internship opportunities for newly graduated high school or university students. Again to support educational activities, co-operation with the Polytechnic University of the Marches has been renewed for the “World Campus” project established to support and spread technological and training innovation among university students through participation in internships abroad. The university masters courses for Group talents continued in 2015 with two university masters courses in particular in cooperation with the University of Bergamo and with the Polytechnic of Milan School of Management. Also the Masters in “Corporate Finance and the Creation of Wealth” in co-operation with Turin University was concluded.  DMA Attraction and management of talent Research projects at the Pope John XXIII Hospital were supported in the field of tumours and at the Aiuti per la Ricerca sulle Malattie A.R.M.R.

In the commercial area, with its treasury and cashier services, the Group supports over 1,800 public institutions and authorities in their receipt, reporting and reconciliation activities for their tax revenues and capital income and it makes substantial contributions to support their social and institutional aims.  Reports and accounts 2015 p.191-192 Indicators G4-EC1 60 2015 Sustainability Report Involvement in local communities Measures taken for social initiatives Policies, Mainly through the action of the Parent, the Network Banks and its foundations commitments, formed over the course years, the Group uses donations and sponsorships to support resources and the activities and projects to protect our historical, cultural and natural heritage, to responsibilities educate and train young people, to conduct scientific, academic and humanitarian research and to provide assistance with health and welfare, the arts, sports and recreation. This activity is conducted following a solidarity and subsidiarity approach and it involves a huge number of nonprofit organisations, both church and non-church, of local, national and international importance. These donations, which are both of an occasional nature and within the framework of key partnerships lasting several years, are designed to promote and enhance the identity of the Group and individual network banks, with no direct correlation with the achievement of commercial objectives, except for those of social marketing initiatives. 1 With sponsorships , Group Banks benefit from associating their brands with organisations and initiatives able to generate a positive return in terms of image, that is often an expression of their history and tradition in their respective local communities. The decisions are taken at local level with the support of UBI Banca for the more far reaching initiatives, based not on rigid and predetermined policies and guidelines, but on assessments based on criteria of the consistency, efficiency and effectiveness of the initiatives and projects found in the community. At UBI Banca, the allocation of budgets to the various sectors of intervention is made on the basis of an “Annual intervention plan” approved by the Supervisory Board on the basis of proposals formulated by the Chairman, subject to consultation with the Senior Deputy Chairman. The proposals and projects are drawn up in consultation also with the Chairman and the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board and taking account of their recommendations. The foundations, which have been formed over the years to promote social and cultural development in their local communities, are totally independent in their decision-making, although this must be in compliance with the areas of intervention defined in their respective constitutions, and they are not subject to powers of management, co-ordination and control by UBI Banca. Financial resources to support philanthropic activities come from the special budgets allocated from year-to-year and also from reserves available to the management bodies for social purposes (the “Board’s Fund”) of UBI Banca and the various Group banks, funded from portions of their distributable profits according to maximum percentages set by their respective Articles of Association. Goals, actions At the beginning of 2015, the network of Group foundations gained a new institution, and results the Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria Onlus Foundation, promoted by the bank of the same name, to pursue aims of social solidarity and institutional objects of health and social welfare assistance and the protection, promotion and enhancement of matters of artistic and historical interest in the Region of Lombardy and in the provinces of Milan and Pavia in particular. This new foundation is in addition to the UBI Banca per Varese Onlus Foundation, the Banca Popolare di Bergamo Onlus Foundation, the CAB-Istituto di Cultura Giovanni Folonari Foundation, the Banca San Paolo di Brescia Foundation and the Banca 1 Sponsorships of professional sports clubs are only included in the report if they are directed to activities to promote the moral education of young people through sport. 61 2015 Sustainability Report Involvement in local communities Popolare di Vigevano Foundation. New important agreements and partnerships have been reached during the year with major nonprofit organisations as part of a distinctive strategy for positioning in this sector. The relationship with the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC – Italian Association for research into cancer) is of particular importance, where UBI Banca also plays the role of an institutional partner in the fundraising campaign entitled “The Research Days” until 2018. The 2015 campaign enabled the AIRC to raise over €6.2 million of which approximately €640 thousand attributable to various initiatives (including the “Chocolates for Research” campaign) undertaken by the Group, which brought UBI Banca’s contribution to research in the field of oncology up to over €2 million over three years. Other important partnerships regarded Dynamo Camp, AISM-Associazione Italiana Sclerosi Multiple, the Progetto ARCA Foundation and Unicef for which the Group has used fundraising tools and channels and the education of Group customers and employees to support their respective campaigns: the Outreach Project, the Mambretti Accommodation Centre, rehabilitation and support for persons suffering from multiple sclerosis, “Youth&Innovation Lebanon”. 2 In 2015 the Group made total donations for social initiatives of €14.9 million (recovering for the first time since the crisis, up 35.6% compared with 2014), of which: • €5.7 million drawn from articles of association-related retained earnings available to management bodies for social purposes of UBI Banca and the Network Banks, net of sums paid to Group Foundations (€646.5 thousand); • €6.4 million as operating expenses of UBI Banca, the network banks and other Group companies, including charitable donations resulting from the placement of UBI Community Social Bonds; • €2.8 million by the Foundations. An important role is played by UBI Communità social bonds in the generation of funds for donation to welfare activities and by contributions made to local authorities as part of treasury and collection services. Since their launch in 2012, the Group has supported 72 important social projects in the community with the issue of an equal number of social bonds to make total charitable donations of €3.6 million. In 2015 14 social bonds were issued (of which four by the Parent) with donations of €531.5 thousand. Almost €3 million of contributions were made as part of treasury and collection services, of which €679.2 thousand not included in the total donations because not classifiable by area of intervention. Again in 2015 UBI Sistemi e Servizi – the Group’s service consortium company – donated retired electronic equipment, which nevertheless still functions well, to 30 schools and nonprofit operations with an estimated value of over €10,700 (120 notebooks and desktops). Group employees were again involved in charitable initiatives through participation in the following voluntary schemes: • Pro Solidar, a national fund in the credit sector for solidarity and charitable initiatives consisting of a bilateral entity managed by the Italian Banking Association and the national secretariats of the banking trade unions. It is the first body in the world formed by a national trade union agreement and it is funded on an equal basis by workers and companies. Each employee may 2 This includes cash donations and the estimated monetary value of donations in kind (IT equipment donated by UBI Sistemi e Servizi), while it does not include the operating expenses of payment activities and the cost of the time for paid work provided by employees to community organisations and activities. 62 2015 Sustainability Report Involvement in local communities contribute a sum of €6 per year deducted directly from salary, against which the company pays in an equal amount (for a total of €189 thousand in 2015); • Enjoy Special Edition, a current account card specially for employees, with customised graphics and the possibility to support social projects simply by using the card. The Group banks that issue the cards waive their interbank commissions on the POS terminal transactions to donate them to the social project chosen each year by employees themselves (in 2015 over €33 thousand was donated to the charity project Orti di Strada run by AMREF Italia Onlus, classified first among the four projects selected as part of the Sodalitas Social Innovation 2015 [ and voted by employees on UBILife, the corporate intranet portal); • Donate one day, the voluntary project by which employees pass one day of their holidays doing voluntary work in a non-profit organisation which they have chosen from among those selected by UBI Banca in co-operation with the Foundation Sodalitas [ G4-16] and the Group makes a donation of €100 to the organisation (in 2015 approximately 1,350 employees participated in 226 voluntary activities distributed in 30 towns and cities across the country in 78 nonprofit organisations). Reports and Accounts 2015 p.82-83 Indicators G4-EC1, G4-SO6 Financial education Policies, Financial education is an effective instrument of protection, because it gives a better commitments, understanding of the workings of financial markets and of the characteristics of resources and different financial instruments and allows knowledgeable investment decisions to be responsibilities taken that are consistent with an investor’s risk profile. More generally, widespread possession of proficient economic and financial expertise helps to create citizens knowledgeable in their choice of banking financial products and services and growth in economic democracy and legality and makes the business environment and local economies more competitive. UBI Banca is aware of this and in playing its role as a bank in local communities, it has built relationships over the years and forms of co-operation with various realities that work in this field. Goals, actions UBI Banca takes an active part in the initiatives of the Foundation for Financial and results Education and Savings (FEDUF) created by the Italian Banking Association and it works with private sector organisations and institutions that the spread financial education initiatives even outside schools and in different groups in society. In addition to this it organises and/or takes part in events, conventions and seminars to educate and discuss on economic and financial issues, such as the cycle of meetings on the Italian economy held in co-operation with the Studi Einaudi Centre, and to support the Italian business community both at home and abroad. The Group’s contribution – which represents almost a third of the total activity carried out by banks adhering to FEDUF – is focused on three educational programmes that are now well established and constantly updated and enhanced, partly as a result of the support from academics and communication experts, differentiated by age Group as follows: • Kids, for primary school children, to stimulate initial thinking about the value of money and the need to manage it responsibly, for themselves and for the community, with a view to knowledgeable citizenship; • Junior, to introduce secondary school pupils to economic and financial subjects and to stimulate them to reflect on the principal functions of finance, by illustrating their impact on people’s everyday lives; 63 2015 Sustainability Report Involvement in local communities • Teens, to teach economics and financial subjects, by introducing upper secondary school children to the social, professional and economic reality that surrounds them. At the end of the course in the classroom, the participants may take part in a national competition entitled “Mamma che impresa” and “Che Impresa, Ragazzi”, the first of which involves the publication of stories written by students in a book of winning business stories, while the second awards a prize to the class that draws up the best business plan for the start-up of a socially useful enterprise in the community (in 2015 schools supported by Banco di Brescia and by Banca Popolare di Bergamo took first and third places in the competition “Che Impresa, Ragazzi”). Group banks, again in co-operation with FEDUF, contributed to the organisation of further events destined not only to pupils in schools, including “Economic Citizenship” which involved around 700 students throughout the country. Banca Regionale Europea organised the competition AAA Economania in Turin and in Genoa the third edition of a literary competition for pupils in the first year of secondary schools in Liguria who were invited to write stories taken from ideas received on the knowledgeable use of money while participating in the Junior financial education programme. The best stories were read out during an event organised at the Youth Theatre and the best three also won the recognition of being published in full in an important daily national newspaper. Over the Christmas period this bank together with the municipalities of Turin and Cuneo put up Christmas lights with entertainment and communication activities for children, with games on the subject of savings, pocket money and waste. Important activities were also carried out by Banca di Valle Camonica with the organisation of educational events for around 500 students on the subjects of financial markets and how they function, usury and innovative payment systems.

This professional assessment applies to all employees with the exception of “Key Personnel”, for whom specific performance assessment tools are used, and of some smaller companies in the Group. 67 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Professional assessment is an important part of the Human Resources Quality Project, designed to further reinforce a culture of assessment, professional growth and recognition of merit. Indicators G4-LA10, G4-LA11 Training and education Policies, All training activities are managed by UBI Academy, the Group’s corporate university, commitments, whose mission is the study, planning, consultancy and the provision of services for the resources and training and the professional and managerial development of staff belonging to Group responsibilities companies to support the achievement of business results. Appropriately structured and integrated with other systems for the development of human resources and accompanied by intense internal communication activity, training proposals are designed to be effective tools for organising, developing and enhancing technical and professional know-how, managerial experiences and skills and the ethical and cultural conduct of the personnel in companies belonging to the UBI Banca Group and for encouraging the development of a unified corporate identity. The instructors involved in training activity consist of both colleagues from Group banks and companies and also outside professionals. Training and refresher courses for the instructor corps are organised on training and qualification programmes and on the best techniques for teaching, classroom management and diffusion of virtuous conduct. Instructors are responsible not only for imparting knowledge but also for facilitating the sharing of experiences, positive examples and distinguished conduct in order to diffuse a common language, values and corporate culture and a sense of belonging to the Group. A compliance opinion by the Compliance Area of the Parent is required on the technical teaching material on banking, commercial and financial subjects. Consistent with the Group’s social responsibility policies and its roots in local communities, UBI Academy carries out its activities also by means of important partnerships with national and local academic centres (universities and business schools). University masters courses for training young Group talents are particularly important in this respect: the masters in “Corporate Finance and the creation of Value” in co-operation with the University of Turin and masters courses in collaboration with the University of Bergamo and the Polytechnic of Milan School of Management. In order to finance training activities, Group companies contribute to joint interprofessional funds for FONDIR continuous professional development (a fund for senior management training in the services sector) and to the FBA (a banking and insurance fund for training employees working in the banking and insurance sectors Fondo Banche Assicurazioni). These are private sector funds to which the Group contributes financially, together with other Italian banks. In compliance with the contents and parameters contained in relative notices, the training programmes submitted are always agreed with the trade union organisations (on the basis of a Group framework agreement for the FBA). Goals, actions The ascertainment of requirements and the formulation of training programmes is and results performed on a periodic basis using a variety of complementary tools: annual meetings with the Human Resources Departments of Group banks and companies, focus groups on specific career families, indications from the Group Commercial Plan and training needs detected from the skills survey, in which all Group employees are involved. Training activity in 2015 totalled approximately 87,000 training days delivered to UBI 68 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Group staff in line with the objectives set, with an average of approximately five training days per person. Classroom training and/or internships accounted for around 57% of training activity, while the remaining part consisted of remote online training. The in-house instructor corps delivered approximately 17 thousand training days (approximately 57% of total classroom training delivered net of insurance training). All the different types of training activities involve compilation of a questionnaire on the perceived quality and – mainly for technical and occupational courses – a learning questionnaire, by which an assessment can be made of the acquisition of the training contents and therefore the effectiveness of the course. On the basis of requirements surveyed, a total investment of approximately 80 million training days is planned for 2016 (50% conventional classroom, 35% remote training, 15% other methods: internships, on-thejob training, etc.).  Reports and accounts p. 2015 p.81-82 Indicators G4-LA9, G4-LA10, G4-LA11 Remuneration policies and incentive schemes Policies, Remuneration policies and incentive schemes are key tools to support the Group’s commitments, medium to long term strategies. They also work to attract, motivate and retain talents, resources and creating a sense of identity and developing a culture linked to performance and merit responsibilities in compliance with the following criteria:  fairness understood as the principle of consistency in the remuneration of comparable roles and responsibilities, offering the same career opportunities to all, without distinction in terms of gender or other social discriminants;  attention to risk and compliance, for sustainable growth over time;  prudence as a basic criteria for banking activities;  competitiveness, interpreted as a continuous comparison with best practices;  rewarding merit as recognition of the results, expertise, behaviours, and values in the actions of each individual. The policies are designed to recognise individual merit, but at the same time consolidate team spirit and a sense of belonging, relating the objectives and results of each employee to their own business unit, bank or company and to the Group.  Reports and accounts 2015 p.119**-124** Goals, actions Compliance with this principle of fairness is guaranteed by using tools to analyse and and results assess the positions in the organisation which enable the regular evaluation of internal remuneration levels and their consistency on the basis of the complexity and strategic function of the role within the Group. At the same time the performance level of the functions of each role are continuously monitored, using tools for the assessment of performance, skills and potential to ensure that the most deserving staff are assigned to the highest remuneration bands. Merit is measured on several levels using structured processes of analysis and assessment. Among these, incentive schemes are a key lever for recognising merit and continuing the commitment to bring variable remuneration into line with the results that have actually been achieved.  Reports and accounts 2015 p. 118**, G4-LA13 Indicators G4-EC5 69 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Corporate Welfare Policies, All Group employees, whether full-time or part-time, benefit, depending on the commitments, company to which they belong, from a substantial corporate welfare package. These resources and consist of: supplementary forms of pension and health care; insurance policies responsibilities covering death or permanent disablement (whether work-related or not) and the risk of death from disease; gifts on important occasions such as marriages, births and adoptions, scholarship grants for children; paid leave – even above the legal minimum – to care for disabled family members, the emergency hospitalisation of family members, the birth or adoption of children and when they start nursery schooling; financial contributions to support single income families or families with disabled persons. All Group employees have the possibility to participate in supplementary pension schemes through either internal or external pension funds, benefiting from a defined contribution by the employer as part of supplementary company labour agreements. Employees may also allocate a part of their salaries to supplementary pension schemes. On the question of leave for the birth or adoption of children, the Group complies with Italian law on parental leave which provides for a compulsory period of leave for women employees, normally during the two weeks prior to the presumed date of 1 childbirth and three months after childbirth, and leave from work is optional . Welfare services include company crèches, eight company cultural and recreational clubs, holiday accommodation facilities at tourist locations at attractive prices and eight shuttle bus services provided for travel to-and-from work at work places with large concentrations of personnel. Favourable terms and conditions are granted on charges and commissions for banking services, on loans for the purchase of homes and on credit lines, in line with the best market conditions. UBI Banca has also developed policies to reconcile work and family demands with the use of flexible forms of working such as part-time, the reduction or suspension of working hours, hour banks and smart working. Priority is given in allowing part-time work contracts to applicants with good grounds and in particular to those justified by the need to care for children, whether biological or fostered (below maximum junior school age) or by serious family reasons and/or because of the health of the applicant, a spouse, first degree relatives and person’s under the legal guardianship of the applicant. As a sign of solidarity, the bank is attentive to the needs of families hit by particular tragedies or in emergency situations. Since 2002 the families of employees both in service and retired, with disabled children who are not self-sufficient, have been able to count on the support of the Clematis Onlus Association (www.clematisonlus.org), created on the initiative of a group of employees and supported financially by the Group. The association has signed an insurance agreement to provide the disabled children with an annual supplementary, revaluable, income of €12,000 payable on the death of both parents and it also pays grants toward the costs of “rehabilitation training” and for the purchase of facilities. Sixty-nine families have taken advantage of the insurance agreement – of which 34 are families of retired employees – for 74 disabled children. Indicators G4-EC3, G4-LA2, G4-LA3 1 Natural parents have the right to optional leave (if the employment relationship is continuous) up to the first 12 years of the life of a child, for a period of between two and not more than 10 months that can be increased to 11 if the working father takes leave from work for either a continuous or staggered period of not less than three months. That total period can be taken by the parents even simultaneously. 70 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Health and safety Policies, According to the definition of the World Health Organisation (WHO) “Health is a state commitments, of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of resources and disease or infirmity” and Italian legislation is also based on that same concept responsibilities (Legislative Decree No. 81/08 Art. 2 paragraph 0) and UBI Banca adopts it too. Therefore “organisational well-being” is the objective that the Group pursues on health and safety matters with policies and processes oriented towards the substantial and not merely formal application of regulations on health and safety at the workplace. This is also pursued in the knowledge of achieving both a greater competitive advantage as a result of higher productivity and improved performance by workers (less absenteeism and staff turnover and greater customer satisfaction) and savings for society in general in terms of both tangible and intangible social costs generated for example by accidents, operating areas, legal disputes, insurance claims, litigation and care expenses. The scientific literature has shown that organisational well-being is strongly associated with factors such as the corporate climate, the commitment of employees, work satisfaction and the work-life balance. These are aspects taken into account by the health and safety at the workplace management system (HSMS), which also constitutes the concrete implementation of the guidelines contained in the Model of Management and Organisation provided for by Legislative Decree No. 231/2001 and in the UNI-INAIL (Italian standards authority and Italian national accident insurance institute) guidelines. The main regulatory reference is Legislative Decree No. 81/2008 and subsequent amendments, the provisions of which are applied in all Group companies operating within Italy. Responsibilities on this matter are centralised in the Health & Safety Manager Function on the staff of the Chief Operating Officer and they are exercised by means of a regulation to implement corporate policies on the matter which lay down the following:  the duties and responsibilities of the various persons directly involved (the Official Employer, Senior Management, Management of the Prevention and Protection Service; Corporate Physician) and the company and Group units involved (the Human Resources and Organisation Departments of the various companies, Real Estate Department, Security and Business Continuity Department, UBIS Purchasing Department and UBI Academy);  processes for the active and knowledgeable involvement of personnel;  lines of reporting between the various units and mechanisms for the integration of the HSMS in corporate processes;  processes for the planning, monitoring and periodic review of the effectiveness of the system itself, explicitly recommended in UNI-INAIL guidelines.  Reports and accounts 2015 p. 199 Goals, actions All actions undertaken have the dual objective of regulatory compliance and risk and results reduction, also in relation to savings on costs connected with accident reduction and the lower insurance premiums that INAIl charges companies that can demonstrate that they have adopted virtuous practices on prevention and protection from occupational risks. Prevention relies primarily on constant monitoring of the adequacy of workplaces and equipment [ Reports and accounts 2015 p.199]. In this respect, technical specifications have been refined for external suppliers, who are required both to 71 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel document the conformity of their activities in greater detail and to update IT procedures already available to Group staff for reporting the emergence of new risks and/or malfunctions. Projects to build new premises or to refurbish existing premises involve prior examination of documents by the Prevention and Protection Service, which programmes on-site conformity inspections on completion of the works and the entry into service of the premises. From the more specific viewpoint of health, the activities of corporate physicians provide continuous monitoring of the state of health of personnel and the healthiness of working environments both by means of the annual plan of periodic checkups for staff (compulsory health screening by law) and by on-site inspections of working environments. Staff may also report specific problems to the corporate physician by means of a dedicated and confidential email address. Other important aspects include work-related stress assessment, conducted, amongst other things, through the acquisition of the subjective perceptions of employees by means of a special questionnaire and the management of the impacts of criminal incidents to which distribution network staff in particular are exposed. The progressive emergence of a new type of aggression, mainly verbal, but also physical perpetrated by customers as a consequence of a deterioration in their socio-economic conditions and connected with more rigid rules for granting credit has resulted in the extension of psychological assistance to include these situations as well. Fortunately, yet again in 2015 the cases that actually occurred were both extremely limited in number and in the seriousness of the events. Training (18,500 hours in the 2015) is the second cornerstone of prevention designed to achieve maximum diffusion of the concept of “participated safety”. The training programmes are prepared in co-operation with UBI Academy and the corporate physicians with account taken of the different levels of risk to which employees are exposed as a function of their individual roles. The degree to which these are completed by each employee is monitored by means of an integrated IT system which is used to programme training activity and report on it at individual company level. A special section on health and safety is maintained and kept up-to-date on the UBI Life intranet portal on which the following can be easily found: references to laws and corporate regulations; news on safety organisation in the Group (e.g. emergency plans and exit routes to follow in different premises illustrated by actual photographs); material used in classroom training initiatives; and also useful advice and information on correct life-styles to remain in good physical and mental condition. As occurs every year, as required by the Management System procedures, again in 2015 monitoring was carried out in all units concerned by an outside independent auditor from a leading consulting firm. All activities to implement the Health and Safety at the Workplace Management System are accounted for and reported and specific meetings are held with Senior Management to review them in order to verify that goals have been achieved and to set future goals.  Reports and accounts 2015 p.199-201 Indicators G4-LA5, G4-LA6, G4-LA7, G4-LA8 72 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Indicators G4-LA1 Employment and personnel turnover The average length of service is 20.41 years for men and 19.73 for women, while the overall average length of service is 19.76 years. 2015 2014 2013 STAF F L EAVIN G TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN Business Plan reductions 523 156 203 35 742 213 of which: “solidarity fund” 445 124 187 28 677 192 incentivised redundancies 78 32 16 7 65 21 Voluntary resignations 122 31 111 28 93 23 End of contract 108 68 143 90 157 105 Retirement 1 0 12 4 5 1 Dismissal 11 4 16 2 18 3 Other 42 17 24 6 25 11 TO TAL 807 276 509 165 1 ,0 4 0 356 CO N VERSIO N F RO M TEMPO RARY 2015 2014 2013 CO N TRACTS TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN From apprentices 39 20 0 0 8 0 Other 200 119 90 46 63 31 TO TAL 239 139 90 46 71 31 2015 2014 2013 APPO IN TMEN TS TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN TO TAL W O MEN On temporary contracts 239 158 255 148 315 181 of which from: personnel leasing 0 0 0 0 0 0 apprentices 0 0 4 1 42 22 internship 0 0 0 0 0 0 Permanent 161 85 48 14 39 18 of which from: personnel leasing 0 0 0 0 0 0 internship 0 0 0 0 0 0 TO TAL 400 243 303 162 354 199 2015 2014 2013 RATE N EW EMPL O Y EE HIRES RATE AN D TURN O VER N EW TURN O VER 2 N EW TURN O VER 2 N EW TURN O VER 2 EMPL O Y EE EMPL O Y EE EMPL O Y EE B y p o sitio n HIRES 1 HIRES 1 HIRES 1 Senior managers 2.1% 10.7% 1.7% 4.2% 0.0% 17.3% Middle managers 0.2% 4.7% 0.1% 2.5% 0.0% 6.5% Other personnel 3.8% 4.2% 2.8% 3.0% 3.3% 4.7% B y g en d er Men 1.4% 4.9% 1.2% 3.0% 1.3% 6.0% Women 3.6% 4.0% 2.4% 2.4% 2.9% 5.2% B y ag e Under 30 41.4% 11.1% 31.9% 16.2% 33.4% 14.3% 30 to 50 0.8% 1.4% 0.7% 1.2% 0.6% 1.1% 50 to 60 0.3% 5.9% 0.2% 2.3% 0.2% 8.8% over 60 0.2% 27.1% 0.1% 17.5% 0.2% 57.4% B y g eo g rap h ical area North 2.8% 4.5% 1.9% 3.2% 2.0% 5.2% Central 0.5% 3.1% 1.1% 1.5% 2.2% 5.9% South and Islands 0.6% 5.5% 0.5% 1.2% 0.9% 7.9% Abroad 3.7% 11.9% 6.2% 6.9% 6.8% 9.5% TO TAL 2 .3 % 4 .6 % 1 .7 % 2 .8 % 1 .9 % 5 .7 % 1 Ratio appointments by category on total employees by category at the end of the year 2 Ratio staff leaving by category on total employees by category at the end of the year. 73 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Appointments and staff leaving Appointments and staff leaving by by age position 347 350 416 450 298 376 300 400 240 355 350 250 300 200 250 140 150 200 100 80 84 150 100 50 36 17 16 2 50 7 0 0 Under 30 years From 30 to 50 From 50 to 60 Over 60 years Senior managers Middle managers Office workers in years years professional areas Appointments Staff leaving Appointments Staff leaving Lenght of service Geographical distribution of 16.0% appointments and staff leaving Over 30 years 20.0% 700 18.5% 600 600 26.2% 21 to 30 years 28.3% 500 373 27.5% 400 30.4% 300 11 to 20 years 28.0% 28.9% 200 138 100 53 27.4% 0 to 10 years 23.7% 8 14 5 16 0 25.1% North Center South and Abroad 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% Islands Women Men Total Appointments Staff leaving INTRAGRO UP MO BIL ITY 2015 2014 2013 (Displacements with contract detachment or of wh ich of wh ich of wh ich transfer) TO TAL con tract tran sfers TO TAL con tract tran sfers TO TAL con tract tran sfers Men 397 5 246 2 236 16 Women 259 2 101 1 141 11 TO TAL 656 7 347 3 377 27 G4-LA2 Benefits and other supplementary contributions 2015 2014 2013 EMPL O Y EES W HO B EN EF ITED F R O M L EAVE TO TAL MEN W O MEN TO TAL MEN W O MEN TO TAL MEN W O MEN Maternity and childcare 1,920 401 1,519 1,649 563 1,086 2,884 750 2,134 Study 220 119 101 153 93 60 238 136 102 Other personal needs 5,924 2,891 3,033 5,373 2,789 2,584 5,841 2,981 2,860 TO TAL 8 ,0 6 4 3 ,4 1 1 4 ,6 5 3 7 ,1 7 5 3 ,4 4 5 3 ,7 3 0 8 ,9 6 3 3 ,8 6 7 5 ,0 9 6 2015 2014 2013 L EAVE DAY S TO TAL MEN W O MEN TO TAL MEN W O MEN TO TAL MEN W O MEN Maternity and childcare 54,510 2,263 52,247 70,843 4,026 66,817 66,093 4,439 61,654 Study 858 481 377 912 552 360 820 460 360 Other personal needs 8,790 4,625 4,165 14,995 7,008 7,987 9,078 4,818 4,260 TO TAL 6 4 ,1 5 8 7 ,3 6 9 5 6 ,7 8 9 8 6 ,7 5 0 1 1 ,5 8 6 7 5 ,1 6 4 7 5 ,9 9 1 9 ,7 1 7 6 6 ,2 7 4 74 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel 2015 2014 2013 CO STS IN CURRED CO STS IN CURRED CO STS IN CURRED L EVEL O F USE SERVICES AN D CO N CESSIO N S F O R N O .

Again in 2015 the highest percentage of accidents recorded continues to be that relating to events occurring to employees in travelling to and from work [ G4-LA6], a risk to which all employees are exposed without 2 distinction . The number of accidents occurring while travelling on business is very small notwithstanding the significant number of personnel who use company cars on a daily basis to carry out their working activities and the total number of kilometres travelled. As concerns the risk of suffering physical harm during the course of robberies or being involved in aggression by customers, a total of five events occurred accounting for 16% of injuries occurring at the workplace and 4.23% of total injuries recorded.

It involved 92.6% of personnel and in addition to an overall assessment and detailed assessments for individually assessed items, it included an indication of management and development components in order to encourage customised career growth based on improvement areas, career ambitions and the potential of each person. The assessment is based on role profiles that define both expected technical and specialist knowledge divided by area and across-the-board abilities with the relative expected score. Knowledge measurement initiatives were undertaken in 2015 for some account manager roles in the commercial distribution network. They were designed to detect gaps on which to design targeted training measures in order to fill them. Refresher and change management courses were delivered consistent with the results of the assessment process, designed to support people in maintaining their professionalism constantly in line with the new expertise that is increasingly required in a constantly evolving environment, providing support to staff especially during the delicate times of role change. Additionally, mentoring initiatives were undertaken to facilitate the transfer of knowledge and experience from senior to junior staff in order to create a generation bridge that prevents the loss of human capital present in the Group, by making it available to new staff. As part of differentiated human resource management, activities focusing on key resources also continued (this included ability assessment initiatives, in order to verify coverage of managerial roles, with feedback given to those concerned and the identification of specific development goals) as did the Talents Project started in 2014 with an intense job rotation and training programme (Group talents took part in training days on technical knowledge, they challenged each other in business cases and were involved in university masters courses co-designed in partnership with the MIP – Milan Polytechnic Business School).

Seven new senior managers were recruited in 2015 on the outside market. 81 2015 Sustainability Report Enhancement and well-being of personnel Business lines with social and environmental aims In order to achieve its business mission as a commercial bank at the service of local communities, it is essential for UBI Banca to consider the impacts of its activities on the social and environmental problems of the economic and social life of those communities. For the Bank this means that it must contribute, within the sphere of its responsibilities, to reduce unjustified inequalities, to develop cohesion and social capital and to prevent and reduce the negative environmental impacts of material and economic growth. Policies, products and services with social benefits Policies, UBI Banca has identified a series of important social causes and specific expectations commitments, of stakeholder groups, especially with regard to access to financial services by resources and disadvantaged groups, to support for high social impact activities by nonprofit responsibilities organisations (known as the “third sector”) and to caution towards sectors that are ethically controversial because of the potential negative social impact. To provide adequate answers is a commitment that the Bank implements in practice mainly through its commercial and credit policies and through its range of commercial retail products and services. In consideration of the importance acquired by the third sector in meeting the needs of communities, especially for the delivery of welfare services to the disadvantaged, in 2011 UBI Banca created a special service model and range of services with its UBI Comunità brand. Specific guidelines have been adopted to manage business in two particularly critical 1 sectors from an ethical viewpoint: those of armaments and gambling . 2 An armaments policy has been in force since 2007 which forbids all Group companies from holding relationships with companies involved in arms of mass destruction and other arms banned by movements or international treaties (termed “controversial” arms such as mines and cluster bombs) and it involves authorisation procedures for international arms trade transactions on the basis of the countries of origin or final destination. All countries, except those belonging to the European Union, NATO or the OECD, are periodically assessed on the basis of criteria which, in addition to EU sanctions and international embargoes on arms, consider involvement in armed conflicts and/or threats to safety, peace and international security, the violation of human rights perpetrated or tolerated by government authorities and the level of human development. The policy applies to all the Group’s activities, with the sole exception of asset management, where the investment decisions are made with reference to market benchmarks and therefore cannot be based on screening of specific issues. With regard to business in the gambling sector, the Parent has given instructions to the distribution network to limit this business to a totally marginal level and to employ an extremely rigorous conduct in assessing loan applications: parties 1 The organisation of gaming and betting in those European countries which allow it is managed by central governments which subcontract operations to private sector companies in return for the payment of license fees. In Italy, laws allow gaming and betting activities to be run by companies authorised by government, which intends in this manner to exercise stringent control over a highly profitable sector with a high risk of illegality. 2 The policy has been approved by UBI Banca’s Management Board and Supervisory Board and it is available in the Corporate Social Responsibility Section of the Group’s corporate website www.ubibanca.it. 82 2015 Sustainability Report Environmental and social policies applied to business lines operating in this sector must not only meet appropriate credit rating criteria, but must also be already known to and approved of by the Bank and satisfy criteria of absolute integrity, seriousness and reliability. Goals, actions UBI Banca has developed a specific range of products and services to respond to and results widespread social needs or to those that are particularly significant for some groups in society. Products and services for the disadvantaged In order to facilitate access to financial services by the economically disadvantaged as a necessary condition for their social inclusion, UBI Banca has adhered to initiatives originating from co-operation between the Ministry of the Economy and Finance (MEF), the Bank of Italy, the Italian Post Office and payment services associations for the provision of low-cost basic services: “Ordinary Basic Account”, free of charge/socially disadvantaged “Basic Account” and “Pensioners Basic Account”. In addition, in order to support access to credit, especially for home purchases, the Bank has created two products: the “Flexible Mortgage”, which allows repayment instalments to be deferred or repayments to be scheduled when determined extraordinary events occur, and “Home Mortgages for Young Couples”, designed also for those who do not have a permanent employment contract. Pawn credit is available for persons in the greatest difficulty. It is one of the most ancient forms of lending practiced by the “Monti di Pietà” banks created in the 15th Century by the Franciscans to combat usury, still today the last real resort in access to credit. This business is carried out in nine branches in the towns and cities of Milan, Pavia, Bergamo, Varese, Monza, Como, Brescia, Crema and Rome. Particular attention is paid to the young, with special current accounts for different age groups (“Clubino”, for children up to 12 with over 132 thousand accounts opened, 17 thousand of which in 2015; “I WANT TUBI” for children aged 13 to 18 with around 20 thousand accounts opened of which over 6,200 during the year, the new “QUBI <30” for the under 30s, launched in December 2015) and subsidised loans for studies or for fostering new projects (“Let’s given them a future”, unsecured loans in co-operation with the Italian Banking Association and the Youth Department at the President of the Council of Ministers Office, and the personal loans entitled “Small Expenses and Large Projects”). In order to encourage saving among the less affluent in society above all, the Bank has created fund-based savings plans, with which even small sums can be put aside (almost 92,000 of these plans were opened during the year, up 13.4% on 2014). UBI Comunità for the nonprofit sector UBI Comunità Social Bonds are of particular importance in the Bank’s support for the Third Sector. They are bonds issued by UBI Banca Group banks which provide subscribers with a market yield, but where the issuing bank donates part of the funding acquired to support projects with substantial social value organised by nonprofit organisations [ EC1], or diverts the funding into a loan pool used to finance nonprofit organisations. Social bonds have received important acknowledgements including the National Prize for Innovation in 2013 awarded by the President of the Italian Republic. Since 2015 the structuring of social bonds by the Parent also involves measurement of the social impact of the projects supported by using social return on investment (SROI) methods. This tool, which constitutes innovation at sector level, is of great value in terms of accountability to the customers who subscribe them and to the Group’s stakeholders in general and in the future it will allow the Group to direct its intervention to initiatives that have a greater impact on change. 83 2015 Sustainability Report Environmental and social policies applied to business lines  www.ubibanca.com/Social_bond Another new idea introduced in 2015 was the first Social Impact Project Finance initiative, which involves donation of part of the fees for structuring the operation to social initiatives promoted by the sponsors and also part of the spread on the achievement of predetermined social objectives. The first operation for over €8 million involved the refurbishment of a residential facility for the elderly, the “Istituto Buon Riposo in Turin and the connected start-up Alice Project to increase assistance to the elderly in that facility or in their own homes. UBI Banca received the prize MF – Innovation Award 2015 for that operation.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 56 Involvement in controversial sectors Again in 2015 lending to companies operating in controversial sectors (€139.7 million) remained totally marginal compared with the total volume of lending to businesses (0.24%). As has always occurred, all bank transactions for international trade in arms were performed in compliance with Group policy with no exception made3. We report the following for 2015:  123 transactions for exports of armaments materials in accordance with Law No. 185/1990, amounting to €55.4 million (86.7% to EU, Nato or OECD countries); two transactions for €3.1 million not accepted because destined to India, a country not admitted by the policy;  85 transactions for exports of light arms, amounting to €4.2 million (97.5% to EU, Nato or OECD countries); two transactions for almost €66 thousand not accepted because destined to countries not admitted by the policy (Peru and Brazil). A more detailed report on the business in question is published in the Social Responsibility Section of the Group’s corporate website. Indicators UBI-5, G4-HR1, G4-FS7 Policies, products and services with environmental aims Policies, As part of its Environmental Policy the Group is also committed to the provision of commitments, banking, financial and risk management products and services designed to support resources and customers to manage their activities in a sustainable manner (e.g. by using renewable responsibilities energies, improving the energy efficiency of their homes, increasing the efficiency of production processes). The role of the Project and Real Estate Finance Unit introduced as part of Private and Corporate Banking Units in the commercial area is of particular importance in this respect. Goals, actions For some years now the Group has provided a series of specific financing products for and results household and business investments for the use of renewable energies and energy savings as follows:  for individuals, the “Forza Sole” (Sun Strength) products to finance domestic photovoltaic systems and the “Creditopplà Home Refurbishment” products to refurbish buildings and for energy savings upgrades, making use also of tax incentives; 3 In 2015 a transaction for €105 thousand was ratified relating to the export of light arms mistakenly accepted to Brazil. 84 2015 Sustainability Report Environmental and social policies applied to business lines  for businesses, New Energy Photovoltaic products, for the installation of photovoltaic panels, Renewable Energies products for wind, biogas and biomass powered plants to generate electricity and/or heat and “Full Power” leasing for investments in renewable energies. In recent years recourse to project finance as a means of financing investments has increased. Again in 2015 the process to restructure the renewable energy sector has continued, with the unification of many projects under national and international investors and with the consequent optimisation of the financial structures. At the end of the year, UBI Banca had a portfolio of renewable energy operations amounting to over €2 billion, accounting for 3.3% of total financing disbursed (36 operations concluded during the year for a total amount disbursed of €163.8 million). It is estimated that the power output financed by UBI Banca amounts to over 1 million MWh of electricity per year, equal to the electricity requirement for over 380 thousand households (almost as big as the city Turin) with savings on emissions of almost 352 thousand tons of CO2 and over 353 thousand tons of CO2 equivalents. Important operations were carried out in 2015 in the sphere of high socialenvironmental value infrastructure financing with companies that provide a series of water services (e.g. aqueducts, sewers, purification) as follows:  the refinancing of the investments (with an increase in the credit lines and lengthening of their life) of Acqua Novara VCO SpA which provides water services for 139 municipalities to satisfy the requirements of approximately 450 thousand inhabitants;  a loan, as part of a club deal, to Acquedotto del Fiora SpA which provides integrated water services for 56 municipalities in the provinces of Siena and Grosseto for a total of approximately 380 thousand inhabitants. Designed to also promote eco-compatible innovation in production processes in the food and agricultural sector, in 2015 UBI Banca launched the competition “Cultivate the right idea” in co-operation with Make a Change and with the backing of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies, Confcooperative, Touring Club Italiano, AcliTerra, ManagerItalia and CGM. The competition aroused great interest with almost 180 projects entered.  Reports and Accounts 2015 p. 57 Indicators G4-FS8, G4-SO1 Access to financial services by disadvantaged persons Policies, The Group is committed to promoting access to financial services by disadvantaged commitments, persons on the basis of their requirements, both with regard to physical disabilities – resources and and therefore the ability to access branches and offices autonomously – and also with responsibilities respect to sensorial disabilities and that is the use of telephone and digital banking services. Goals, actions With account taken also of existing regulations on the elimination of architectural and results. barriers, each year action is taken to upgrade and improve facilities in Group buildings and branches. Some of the main instruments and apps on direct channels are adapted for use by partially and/or non-sighted persons. Indicators G4-FS14 85 2015 Sustainability Report Environmental and social policies applied to business lines Socially responsible investments Policies, Asset management business is managed entirely by UBI Pramerica, with a range of commitments, products which, with a variety of solutions and diversification of risk, is designed to resources and satisfy all savings and investment requirements. responsibilities UBI Pramerica has created a range of funds for clients who are sensitive to sustainability and social responsibility issues. These funds invest in companies chosen from an investable universe selected by E-Capital Partners, (a leading independent, ethical finance consulting firm) on the basis of the following criteria:  companies involved in the following are excluded: the production and/or trade in arms, pornographic material, contraceptives, alcohol, tobacco and other products harmful to health; the promotion and practice of gambling; the construction of plants for the production of nuclear energy; research, development or production of GMOs;  the inclusion of companies that achieve important social and environmental performance, that demonstrate attention to sustainable development and respect for human rights and that adopt clear and transparent governance. Should circumstances change or news be received that leads to a change in the rating of an issuer made by the advisor E. Capital Partners, UBI Pramerica shall take steps to dispose of the relative financial instruments as quickly as possible, with account taken of the interests of the participants. Goals, actions In the 2015 UBI Pramerica broadened its range of funds managed according to ethical, and results. social and environmental criteria by adding a new fund entitled UBI Pramerica Obbligazionario Euro Corporate Etico (launched in March 2015) and the Sicav Social 4 Future (launched in December 2015). The Social 4 Future Sicav invests its bond component in financial instruments issued by companies that stand out for their important social and environmental performance and its equity component in the 100 top companies in the world that, again in observance of the criteria of high ethical and social responsibility standards, play a key role in managing the global challenges of emerging markets, population trends, scarce resources and climate change. As with social bonds, the issue is linked to a specific social project of a nonprofit organisation. In this case 4% of the entrance and management commissions for this Sicav are donated to UNICEF for the project Youth & Innovation Lebanon. The goal of the project is to provide, by the end of 2016, hundreds of highly vulnerable Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese adolescents present in Lebanon with an alternative and innovative learning programme to give them a better chance to integrate into society and find a job. The ethical funds also donate 5% of the management fees and commissions to institutions or associations that pursue beneficial initiatives...

The Group has a commercial offer for the sale of diamonds as an investment instrument for customers. In this context, as with business in the armaments sector, it is important to consider the potential for being involved in activities which could present a risk for the violation of human rights. Action was therefore 4 taken to ascertain that all the diamonds, sourced through the company Diamond Love Bond , are certified “conflict-free” (they do not come from conflict zones or from transactions for the finance of armed groups and conflicts) and they are guaranteed “child labour free” (they are not the result of mining and processing that uses child labour). In 2015 1,888 diamonds were sold for a value of approximately €17.6 million. 4 Diamond Love Bond is a diamond company located in Antwerp and authorised by the Belgian Ministry of the Economy, Commerce and Energy. It has an international organisational network and it is present on all world diamond exchanges. The company adopts rigorous ethical principles. It follows and supports the UN Global Compact principles and adheres to the rules of conduct for Diamond companies (best practices recommended by the World Diamond Council System of Warranties and the Diamond Trading Company) and it adheres to and complies with the Kimberley Protocol designed to break the link between illegal diamond transactions and armed conflicts. 87 2015 Sustainability Report Environmental and social policies applied to business lines G4-FS7 Products and services with social benefits 2015 2014 O p eration s of th e year Total ou tstan d in g O p eration s of th e year L O AN S TO HO USEHO L DS Remain in g Disb u rsed Disb u rsed N u mb er N u mb er d eb t N u mb er (millions of euro) (millions of euro) (millions of euro) Home mortgages 18,507 1,950.1 231,316 18,897.9 14,487 1,512.4 Ordinary mortgages 17,011 1,786.3 228,209 18,543.4 13,237 1,359.4 1 1,496 163.8 3,107 354.5 1,250 153.0 Mortgages for young couples and atypical workers Solidarity credit 53 4.3 74 6.3 108 2.6 ABI/CEI loan of hope for needy households 2 82 0.5 Loans for natural disasters (real estate/unsecured) 53 4.3 74 6.3 26 2.1 Support for studies 98 0.5 232 1.6 98 0.5 ABI/PCDM Give them a future 98 0.5 232 1.6 98 0.5 Anti-usury 16,592 18.8 31,213 32.4 33,753 31.9 Pawn credit 16,592 18.8 31,213 32.4 33,753 31.9 TO TAL 3 5 ,2 5 0 1 ,9 7 3 .7 2 6 2 ,8 3 5 1 8 ,9 3 8 .2 4 8 ,4 4 6 1 ,5 4 7 .4 1 Advertising campaigns Love is a wounderful home and Flexible mortgage: the mortgage you can put on pause . 2 Initiative inactive in 2015. 2015 2014 O p eratio n s o f th e year To tal o u tstan d in g O p eratio n s o f th e year L O AN S TO SMAL L MEDIUM EN TERPRISES N u mb er Disb u rsed N u mb er Remain in g N u mb er Disb u rsed o f lo an s (millions of euro) o f lo an s d eb t o f lo an s (millions of euro) (millions of euro) 2015 Credit Accord 402 17.7 3,356 133.9 2,836 148.3 Italy Investment Projects CDP and developing businesses 395 17.2 3349 133,4 2,043 113.3 Public Administration (PA) Credit ABI and Businesses and PA 7 0.5 7 0.5 793 35.0 Subsidised public sector funding 16,936 4,849.5 28,952 6,209.9 4,598 1,610.0 European Central Bank TLTROs 15,817 4,479.0 17,604 4,635.7 3,300 1,170.0 European Investment Bank 772 340.7 1,957 1,283.8 684 378.0 Jobs for Youth EIB 11 17.3 26 29.4 16 22.0 Cassa Deposito e Prestiti 336 12.5 9,365 261.1 598 40.0 (CDP – state controlled fund and deposit institution) Guarantee bodies and guarantee funds 16,595 1,435.8 57,046 3,531.5 17,381 1,369.0 Loans backed by guarantee funds 11,047 855.3 43,061 2,328.2 12,475 771.0 SME guarantee fund Law No.662 5,278 574.6 12,650 1,178.6 4,656 592.0 Anti-usury credit lines 270 6.0 1,335 24.7 250 6.0 Group initiatives 206 5.8 1,093 25.8 571 85.7 SME development 96 3.1 469 14.7 258 12.9 Start-ups 110 2.8 624 11.1 313 8.1 Natural disasters 13 1.0 15 1,6 12 1.6 ABI/CDP reconstruction agreement 13 1.0 15 1,6 3 0.7 Female entrepreneurship 26 1.1 30 1.1 Invest in women 13 0.5 16 0.5 Women in start-ups 13 0.7 14 0.6 TO TAL 3 4 ,1 7 8 6 ,3 1 0 .9 9 0 ,4 9 2 9 ,9 0 3 .8 2 5 ,3 9 8 3 ,2 1 4 .6 The average volume of lending for pawn credit in 2015 was over €32 million, up 3% on 2014, with approximately 31,500 open policies.

For the Bank, pursuit of environmental sustainability in its activities means above all the use of products and services with a low environmental impact, the reduction of waste and the proper disposal of it, the use of renewable energy sources and/or low level emissions and containment of personal mobility. Materials used and waste products Policies, The Purchasing Department of UBI Sistemi e Servizi manages the purchasing cycle for commitments, Group companies [ G4-12] in compliance with Environmental Policy. resources and responsibilities Goals, actions The main raw materials used are paper and toner for printouts for internal use and and results also those for customers. The Group is continuing with its commitment to reduce paper and toner consumption by means of the following: • remote monitoring of printers and setting printers for “both sides” printing; • the “dematerialisation” of documents with signatures on tablets at cash desks; • the development and spread of “Digital Bank” consultation and payment services. A training course was organised in February 2015 on “green procurement” for purchasing staff (buyers) designed to reduce environmental impacts also through the procurement of materials with a more eco-compatible life cycle. It is planned to produce guidelines in 2016 to increase purchases of paper with a reduced environmental impact. A substantial reduction in paper and toner consumption is expected over the next three-year period thanks to investments made to “dematerialise” documents (with the extension of signatures on tablets for branch transactions to include contract documentation) and to develop the Digital Bank (with increasing electronic transmission of most of the QUI UBI internet services documentation, services that now have almost 1.1 million subscribers – 15.8% up on 2014 – with approximately 1.6 million accounts). Indicators G4-EN1, G4-EN2, G4-EN4, G4-EN17, G4-EN23, G4-EN25 Energy consumption and emissions Policies, UBI Banca is a multi-site concern which operates in properties generally classifiable as commitments, for service use and it is subject to specific regulations on energy and energy efficiency resources and as follows: responsibilities • Law No. 10/191 “regulations to implement the national energy plan on the rational use of energy and energy savings and the development of renewable 91 2015 Sustainability Report Reduction in direct environmental impact sources of energy” and the relative Presidential Decree No. 412/93 “Regulations containing rules for the design, installation, running and maintenance of heating systems in buildings for the purposes of reducing energy consumption in implementation of Art. 4, paragraph 4 of Law No. 10 of 9th January 1991”; • Directive No. 2002/91/EC “On the energy performance of buildings”, and the relative decree to implement it, Legislative Decree No. 192/2005 and subsequent amendments, Legislative Decree No. 311/2006; • Legislative Decree No. 102/2014 “Implementation of Directive No. 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency”. The Energy Manager and the relative operational Energy Management Unit at UBI Sistemi e Servizi, which is allocated a specific budget, is responsible for the management of energy consumption for the whole Group. The Energy Manager is responsible for analysing the energy requirement, for drawing up policies and actions to optimise consumption (including action to improve the energy efficiency of buildings and systems) and for monitoring their application and the results achieved. Monitoring of consumption takes place through the annual reporting cycles of the Sustainability Report and the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) – the data from which are subject to independent audit by the auditing firm Deloitte & Touche S.p.A. – and monthly consumption progress charts drawn up for the UBISS Real Estate Department (a summary for electricity consumption only is submitted to the UBISS Management Committee). Goals, actions In order to reduce energy consumption internally the Group has adopted a more ecoand results compatible design model for the construction and refurbishment of offices and branches. The model is constantly updated to keep abreast of technological innovation available on the market and it involves an energy section with three lines of intervention: electricity and lighting, systems and machinery and architecture and structure. During 2015: • in compliance with the energy section of the model for the eco-compatibility of buildings, 48 operations were carried out to refurbish branches; • as part of an evolved programme for the maintenance of mechanical systems, 23 central heating systems were upgraded and 71 other systems, including refrigerator units and heat pumps, were replaced; • operations were carried out identified by energy diagnoses carried out in previous years on the most energy hungry sites. More specifically work was carried out on UBI Sistemi e Servizi’s premises at Brescia to increase the efficiency of the heating and air conditioning system and of the lighting systems in offices; • a study was carried out on the 17 highest energy consuming branches in order to identify possible areas for improvement and, in order to implement Legislative Decree No. 102/2014, 11 energy diagnoses were carried out which led to the identification of a series of measures to be undertaken to reduce energy consumption, which included replacing conventional lighting systems with LED systems and installing continuous smart metering monitoring systems; • collaboration continued with the Polytechnic of Milan for the Brescia data processing centre, where a project was launched to modernise and increase the efficiency of the air conditioning and the business continuity systems. A series of initiatives have also been launched to inform and train staff on the importance of energy savings and the rational use of energy as follows: • the online course entitled Energy-Saving – Knowledgeable awareness, was followed by 12,458 employees who rated it the best remote training course in 2015 and previous years; • two videos published on the UBI Life corporate intranet as part of the internal 92 2015 Sustainability Report Reduction in direct environmental impact communication plan campaigns “Se io ci tengo…le so tutte” (“If I really want to, I’ll know it all”) and UBI Cafè; • participation in “M’illumino di meno” (I use less light), an educational campaign for the rationalisation of energy consumption, drawn up by Caterpillar (a historical radio programme broadcast by the Italian state broadcaster, RAI), with the sponsorship of the European Parliament and the Presidency of the Italian Republic and support from the Senate and Chamber of Deputies. UBI Banca participated by symbolically switching off the neon signs of the main headquarters of Group banks and companies, communicated to staff on the UBI Life intranet portal together with a dedicated news campaign linked to an Energy Vademecum, a document which illustrates 15 simple ways of saving energy and safeguarding the environment both in the office and at home. As part of the periodic renewal of IT equipment, 2,146 desktops with monitors, 385 notebooks and 628 monitors with Energy Star certification were purchased. Initiatives were undertaken with the company car fleet to reduce the number of vehicles in circulation and to renew the fleet with vehicles with lower consumption and emissions. The action undertaken had the effect of reducing consumption by around 24% over three years. Overall energy consumption within the organisation in 2015 was 559,140 GJ, down 4.4% on the previous year and 16.4% over three years. The results achieved in terms of reducing energy consumption were in line with those expected and therefore there was no need to identify and apply corrective action. The goal for the next three years is a further 5% reduction in electricity consumption by UBI Banca, UBI Sistemi e Servizi and the Network Banks. Total CO 2 equivalent emissions (scope 1 and 2) were 10,444 tons (down 9.7% on 2014 and down 51.7% over three years). Again in 2015 GO certificates (guarantee of origin for energy produced from renewable sources) were purchased to cover 99.4% of the electricity purchased. For the remaining 0.6% it was not possible to purchase GO certificates because the electricity was produced by small suppliers who do not provide this service. Indicators G4-EN3, G4-EN4, G4-EN5, G4-EN6, G4-EN15, G4-EN16, G4-EN17, G4-EN18, G4-EN19, G4-EN20, G4-EN21 Sustainable mobility Policies, The Group has a number of large business centres (the headquarters of the Parent, UBI commitments, Sistemi e Servizi, the Network Banks and the Product Companies) on which problems resources and of sustainable mobility and initiatives to solve them are concentrated. Geographical responsibilities mobility, considered as working in a different province to that in which a person is resident, affects 20% of employees. In order to manage the question of corporate mobility – to-and-from work journeys and business travel – in the direction of increasing sustainability, the role of Mobility Manager was created in the Human Resources Area of the Parent. Goals, actions On the question of to-and-from work mobility, for some years now sheltered parking and results areas have been provided for bicycles in some of the main headquarters and a coach shuttle service runs between Bergamo, Varese, Brescia and Milan (and actually within the city for the latter). The shuttle coaches transported an average of 400 passengers per day in 2015 which prevented 1,000 tons of CO2 emissions compared with the use of cars. A smart working pilot project was introduced in 2015 which, by allowing employees 93 2015 Sustainability Report Reduction in direct environmental impact to work in their own homes or at Group premises closer to their homes, facilitates not only reconciliation of private and working life, but also helps to reduce to-and-from work travel. In 2012 the Group adopted a specific policy document for business travel, which gives priority, where possible, to the use of public and/or collective means of transport. A substantial contribution is made to the reduction of business travel and the related greenhouse gas and polluting emissions caused by transport by the use of video conferences. In 2015 26,268 video conferences were held (up 10% on 2014) for a total duration of almost 45,435.
