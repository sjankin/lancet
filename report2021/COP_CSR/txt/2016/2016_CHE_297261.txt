It’s not just ensuring a problem-free water supply that is proving a huge challenge worldwide, drinking water GF Automotive is thus employing its entire development must also be clean!

As part of a new strategy cycle, ably, as casting is 40% lighter in comparison to other a new business unit has been created, named “Services”, production methods. 12 GF Sustainability Report 2015 Challenges and Strategy By using lighter components in vehicles, we are setting in motion a chain reaction of reduction, as every component that is reduced in weight results in the reduction of the weight of the whole vehicle. A lightweight vehicle uses less fuel, which means lower CO2 emissions. This has significant impacts, for example, if the parts in a VW Golf weigh 2.82 kg less per vehicle, this has a dramatic positive influence on lowering the CO2 emissions of the automobiles. GF Automotive will also push on with producing lightweight vehicles in the future, in keeping with the maxim of “Passion for your Lighter Future”. The division is thus focusing on ready-to-install solutions and becoming involved in the development of new vehicles at an earlier stage. In addition to this, alternative drives and the use of electric-powered vehicles will have a considerable impact on the sector in the coming years. For this reason, collaborations have already been established with clients to work together on developing components for electric vehicles. The challenge of energy consumption The sustainable and efficient use of energy presents a wide range of challenges. Energy savings and the targeted use of energy are two of the main factors for ensuring a sustainable energy supply in the future. The main strategic approaches in this sense are the monitoring of energy consumption, the use of energy-saving machines, products and solutions as well as the use of renewable energy. GF Machining Solutions is working on developing solutions that allow clients to continuously reduce energy consumption in machines used to manufacture parts. Standard energy management solutions that allow systems to be completely shut down during idle periods and auxiliary equipment to be switched on and used when necessary are just some of the developments made to ensure a drop in energy consumption. 13 GF Sustainability Report 2015 Challenges and Strategy Compliance and Governance As an international industrial group, GF is at home in a range of sectors and countries.

Suppliers Incorporating environmental, social, and compliance standards in its procurement processes is essential for GF. It has therefore engaged in active dialog with suppliers for years. They all have to comply with the Supplier Code, which is based on the most important international standards and conventions. In close cooperation with key logistics partners, GF has also set itself the target of reducing key data with regard to energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and packaging material. 21 GF Sustainability Report 2015 Acting sustainably together Procurement and Logistics Ethical conduct and sustainability include long-term, trusting partnerships, the legally compliant conduct of suppliers as well as environmentally friendly transport solutions. Procurement Incorporating environmental, social, and compliance standards into its procurement processes is essential for GF. It has therefore long engaged in an active dialog with suppliers. The GF Supplier Code plays a fundamental role in this context. It defines the requirements in terms of sustainable management for all companies supplying goods and services to GF and is applicable worldwide to all suppliers and their employees. GF expects the principles set out in the Code to be implemented in the respective companies. In addition, GF buyers regularly perform inspections and discuss incidents on-site to ensure compliance. The supplier audits that are conducted worldwide examine the quality of services, adherence to environmental and social conditions as well as safety and compliance requirements. Logistics Every year within the supply chain, a variety of raw materials and other goods are acquired, and products are transported to sales companies and customers around the globe. Therefore, environmentally friendly transports have a high degree of importance. In close cooperation with key logistics partners, GF has set itself the target of reducing key performance indicators with regard to energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and packaging material. In light of this, systematic reduction of air freight is an integral component of GF’s sustainability goals. For example, GF Piping Systems implemented a project to switch goods transport for sales companies and clients abroad from air transport to sea transport. Andreas Jasko Head of Global Supply Chain GF Piping Systems, Schaffhausen, Switzerland 22 GF Sustainability Report 2015 Procurement and Logistics 72% The proportion of sea transport increased from 56% to 72% “We have done a great deal to reduce the proportion of climate-damaging air transport.” Mr. Jasko, why did GF Piping Systems optimize the global goods transport? Our goal was to reduce costs, make processes more efficient and also protect the environment. We therefore implemented a range of targeted measures to reduce the proportion of climate-damaging air transport. What did you do specifically? One prerequisite for successfully switching from air to sea transport was an analysis of the regular demand from sales companies and major clients abroad. Based on the findings of this analysis, smaller deliveries that were previously sent individually by air freight are now grouped in containers and sent together. Optimal distribution is managed via new distribution centers, for example in Singapore, from where deliveries reach all locations in Asia and Australia. Are you already seeing results? The measures we have taken are already showing signs of success. Between 2011 and the end of 2015, we increased the proportion of sea transport from 56% to 72%. 23 GF Sustainability Report 2015 Procurement and Logistics Environment and Energy The largest impact on the environment in industrial manufacturing operations stems from energy consumption and air emissions. Relevant from an environmental standpoint is further the waste caused by manufacturing activities, while water consumption plays a less significant role. Foundries have the highest environmental impact due to the large quantities of coke, natural gas, and electricity needed for their energyand material-intensive smelting processes.

To this effect, GF Machining Solutions has launched a project that sets out to further improve the energy efficiency of milling and EDM machines. “We’ve optimized our machines where we saw the greatest energy-saving potential”, explains Gary Cooper, Head of Development Projects with GF Machining Solutions in Nidau, Switzerland. In collaboration with all departments – from Research & Development to Production and Commissioning – his team examined the energy-wasting components in the machines and worked on the relevant solutions. The “Blue Competence” initiative The “Blue Competence Machine Tools” initiative aims to contribute significantly to meeting the European Union’s ambitious climate and energy targets. The project is already highly successful. Over 400 companies from the European machine tool industry have joined the initiative since 2012, as well as eight national associations. Together, the member companies have committed to concrete and verifiable sustainability targets. Every member must fulfill uniform criteria. These include clearly defined sustainability requirements and measures relating to both products and staff. When developing sustainable machines, for example, the entire life cycle of the equipment has to be taken into account. In addition to resource-friendly operation, targets include concepts for clean disposal as well. Moreover, members advise their customers on how to run the machines in an energyefficient manner. An optimized jet for extracting the oil-air mixture in the tool spindle uses around 57% less compressed air than before “Sustainable imAs much as four tons less CO2 // One of these solutions is the new Econowatt module, which enables an entirely provement of our new and flexible standby mode in milling and EDM machines.

The earlier the warm-up starts, the greater the accuracy is right from the start. “This allows the customer to save energy flexibly without having to forego high precision”, says Gary Cooper proudly. 32 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Machining Solutions “We use frequency-controlled pumps to provide the “The demand for energy-efficient machines has increacooling lubricants for milling: they ensure the optimum sed significantly in the last few years,” says Benoit operating point, thereby saving energy”, Cooper further Defrasne, Head of Milling Marketing & Product Manageexplains.

All other machine series and newly developed products will likewise be fitted with the innovative solutions soon. All GF Machining Solutions products will thereby guarantee the very highest level of energy efficiency – at no extra cost to the customer: all the measures are applied on a price-neutral basis. 33 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Machining Solutions People and Safety Motivated employees are the basis of success for a company – today and in the future. The declared goal of GF is to offer employees attractive and interesting jobs. This includes a fair wage and good benefits, along with training and professional development opportunities. GF further places particular emphasis on ensuring that the approximately 14 400 employees work in safe conditions and return home healthy after a day’s work. Diversity and flexibility As a company that produces in more than 30 countries and has a presence in more than 120, GF experiences every day how valuable the various qualifications and characteristics of its global workforce are. The diversity of cultures, religions, nationalities, genders, and age groups is a valuable source of talent, creativity, and innovation. GF employed a total of 14 424 people in 2015. In addition, approximately 1 000 people worked as temporary employees or subcontractors for GF. GF assumes direct responsibility for on-the-job safety and health and also guarantees appropriate wages and benefits for these employees. In the year under review, 17.3% (2 491) of employees were women, an increase of 6% compared with 2014. The proportion of women in management at the Corporate companies was 12.4% (76 women). This is an increase of 5% compared with 2014 (74 women). Further measures to promote diversity are indispensable. Additional measures are planned, in particular, to boost the percentage of women among the workforce and in management. A good example for a young and successful female engineer at GF is Maggie Jiang, who has been serving the major client SAIC Volkswagen for “I really appreciate the wide variety more than five years as the Head of Sales of the iron of challenges that I experience in my foundry in the Chinese city of Kunshan. position at GF Automotive.

The GF Piping Systems production and sales company in Malaysia was particularly successful in 2015: they managed to stay accident-free for 1 000 days! This achievement was celebrated in a big way by the 42 staff members at the site on 29 September 2015. This success was the result of ongoing awarenessraising and regular training sessions: once a month, all employees at the site near Kuala Lumpur take part in a so-called “Toolbox” meeting on the subject of safety. Here, employees have the opportunity to contribute their ideas towards improving work safety. Training sessions on lift truck safety, first aid and firefighting exercises are also held at least twice a year. There is an Emergency Response Team consisting of 15 staff members who are trained in the areas of firefighting, handling accidents with chemicals, and first aid. The preventive work pays off: in the first half of the year, not a single accident occurred at GF Piping Systems in Malaysia! “The aim of our campaign is to ensure that the subject of safety is always present.” Tina Köhler, Head of PR and Internal Communication, GF Automotive 45 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Automotive Products and Innovations GF attaches a lot of importance to working closely with its clients.

In addition, GF Machining Solutions is expanding its position as a solution provider for clients. This includes the optimization of client response processes and the offering of clear solutions, but also the maintenance of installed machine tools by their own service organization. In the area of innovation GF Machining Solutions works together with universities and international organizations to carry out research into new technologies for use both in existing products as well as for new applications. An example of this are laser machine tools. Thanks to this unique technology, it is possible to do away with processes that damage the environment, such as the coating of pressure rollers, and replace them with more environmentally friendly processes. 47 GF Sustainability Report 2015 Products and Innovations Clean water for Sri Lanka 850 000 meters of PE pipes made by GF Piping Systems supply the town of Ampara with clean drinking water ›20 000 inhabitants are benefitting from the new water distribution 200 welders were trained by GF Piping Systems directly on site 48 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Piping Systems Shekhar Jagtap, Managing Director of GF Piping Systems in India, was personally in charge of the water distribution project for the town of Ampara. Additional infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka are already in sight. 49 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Piping Systems Many people still do not have access to clean drinking water in the rural areas of Sri Lanka. As part of a large-scale infrastructure project in the east of the island state, GF Piping Systems provided a modern, environmentally friendly piping system and contributed its expertise to ensuring that the population of the town of Ampara can now benefit from running water. Part of a big infrastructure project // For many people in the world, clean drinking water is by no means a given. In the island state of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, the inhabitants of small towns and villages usually depend on wells to obtain water for daily cooking and washing. The well water, however, is frequently contaminated with pathogens. What is more, the population suffers from frequent dry periods and droughts. One exception now is the town of Ampara, situated 360 kilometers east of Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo. Here, the population of some 20 000 inhabitants have recently gained access to fresh, clean tap water thanks to a stateof-the-art pipeline system provided by GF Piping Systems. “We supplied a total of around 850 kilometers of piping and more than 200 000 fittings and other components for the Ampara project”, explains Shekhar Jagtap, Managing Director of GF Piping Systems in India. In addition to the Indian subcontinent, his subsidiary also covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and the Maldives as well as Sri Lanka, since 2013. The drinking water pipes were laid over the past three years by Sunpower, one of the country’s largest construction companies. The pipeline network in Ampara forms part of a much bigger infrastructure project being run by Sri Lanka’s central water authority, the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. The ultimate aim is to provide drinking water for almost 650 000 people in the eponymous district of Ampara in the east of the country by 2025. The project is being funded over a 15-year period by international cooperation projects, which include the governments of Australia and Japan as well as the European Union, for example. When it came to installing the water distribution system for the town of Ampara, Sunpower opted for GF Piping 20 000 inhabitants have access to fresh, clean tap water Systems. The division is the exclusive supplier of all 50 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Piping Systems “Sustainable supply” Interview with Pietro Lori, Head of GF Piping Systems (until August 2016) Mr. Lori, how important are projects such as the one in Sri Lanka for GF Piping Systems? The sustainable supply of clean drinking water is a key issue in many countries of the world. Large-scale infrastructure projects such as the one in the town of Ampara demonstrate how the safe and secure transport of water can be ensured with efficiency and expertise. Thanks to our products and know-how we are the ideal partner when it comes to implementing this kind of elaborate project in developing and emerging countries. What challenges do water supply projects involve in terms of products, employees, and services? The challenges we are faced with are many and varied. There are difficulties in the area of logistics, for example, because the infrastructure in these countries is not very far advanced. This means our employees often have to demonstrate a high level of flexibility as well as creativity in finding solutions. We also attach great importance to training the parties involved on site so as to ensure our products are applied correctly. In the case of Ampara this meant training more than 200 welders. Several hundred kilometers of polyethylene piping were laid in Ampara. What is the advantage of this kind of material as compared with others? Our PE pipes have demonstrated a better life cycle assessment than comparable products made of other materials: they have a very long service life, are resistant to corrosion, and are very lightweight. Thanks to a longlasting system life cycle the PE pipes are very cost-efficient, too. Consequently, our solutions deliver the perfect combination of both economic and ecological factors. 51 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Piping Systems piping systems. The high quality of GF products and the division’s extensive portfolio were the decisive factors here. “We were the only competitor able to provide the customer with a complete system solution from a single source”, as Shekhar Jagtap relates. Products with good life cycle assessment // The core of the new piping system consists of some 850 kilometers of drinking water pipes made of corrosion-resistant polyethylene (PE) with diameters of between 63 and 315 mm – and that’s only the main lines. They have an expected service life of at least 100 years and a particularly positive life cycle assessment as compared to other materials. The CO2 footprint of a PE pipe made by GF Piping Systems is only half the size of a comparable metal pipe, for example. What is more, the fact that they are colored blue prevents them from being damaged during later construction work since they are readily identifiable as drinking water pipes. “ Our expertise allows us to provide perfect support for projects in developing countries.” Shekhar Jagtap, Managing Director GF Piping Systems India More than 200 000 electrofusion fittings of the ELGEF system are installed under the streets of Ampara. This patented GF Piping Systems technique ensures reliable and long-lasting pipe connections. In order to ensure correct use of the relevant electrofusion equipment, GF Piping Systems provided on-site training sessions for Sunpower employees. Three GF experts trained a total of 200 welders in the correct use of the products. One challenge that emerged as the project progressed was the town’s remote location. “As Ampara has neither More than 200 000 electrofusion fittings of the ELGEF system are installed in Ampara an airport nor a rail connection we had to transport all the material by road from distant Colombo”, explains Jagtap. In order to minimize the environmental impact and the costs, GF Piping Systems planned the truck deliveries as precisely as possible. 52 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Piping Systems GF Clean Water Foundation Commitment to clean drinking water Above and beyond its business operations, GF is closely involved with “clean water” issues. Since 2002 the company has supported drinking water projects all over the world through its Clean Water Foundation. All in all, GF has invested a total of some CHF 9 million in the foundation to date, providing around 250 000 people with a sustainably improved supply of drinking water. Between 2002 and 2015 the foundation was able to implement 130 projects involving the transport, distribution, and storage of water, for example. The main projects in 2015 were in Egypt, Ethiopia, Bolivia, El Salvador, Cambodia, and Nepal. Further information is available at www.cleanwater.ch. In order to implement projects in an especially efficient The effort was certainly worth it for the population of Amand effective manner, the Clean Water Foundation and para. Since completion of the main lines this June, every Caritas Switzerland entered into a partnership to bring household can apply to the water authority for a connecaccess to clean drinking water in 2011. At the end of tion. Poorer families are exempt from the connection fee, 2015, GF extended this collaboration by another four which costs the equivalent of 15 Swiss francs. The water years, providing another CHF 1 million to realize drinking comes from a reservoir near the town and is purified in water projects with the charity organization. As part of a treatment plant operated by Sunpower before flowing this partnership, GF is also making its know-how and into the pipelines. technical expertise available. After the great success of the Ampara project, Sunpower and GF Piping Systems aim to further expand their collaboration in Sri Lanka. “There may be a new infrastructure project in the fall which will be around twice as large in scale as the one in Ampara”, says Jagtap. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board has now approved all GF Piping Systems products for the distribution of water. As a result, even more people in Sri Lanka can hope for fresh drinking water in future – thanks to the products and experience of GF Piping Systems. 53 GF Sustainability Report 2015 GF Piping Systems About the report As a pioneer in the area of sustainability, GF has been In the year under review there were 121 companies, of systematically recording and analyzing its key environwhich 97 are either sales or production companies.
