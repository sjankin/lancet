We believe that sustainability is one of the most valuable goals we can strive to achieve. It ensures the continued viability of the environment in which we live, reflects our values, and safeguards our future. KRONES’ commitment to sustainability extends beyond our company and our employees into our interactions with customers and suppliers. Our obligation to doing business sustainably goes all the way back to the company’s earliest days. Going forward, we continue to rely on our team as they collaborate with our customers to develop sustainable solutions. The KRONES Sustainability Report provides an overview of our team’s accomplishments so far. 2 Content KRONES compact Economic Environmental Statement by the Executive Board . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 Economic performance. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36 Environmental . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 76 KRONES has whole-plant expertise ...........8 Economic responsibility: Environmental responsibility: The KRONES Group . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .10 Focus on proﬁtable growth. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38 Ecological aspects of our production. . . . . . . .78 Our attitudes and actions. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .13 Actively managing risks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44 Energy and media conservation in production operations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .80 Compliance – ethics and integrity Production – our supply chain .......... 46 in all business processes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .16 Reducing pollution and hazardous Transparent supply chain . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48 materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .86 Report from the CSR Committee . . . . . . . . . . . . .20 Regional suppliers in LCS Centres . . . . . . . 50 Optimum utilisation of production KRONES’ CSR strategy . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .23 Lean manufacturing (TPM) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 51 materials . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .92 Organisational framework for sustainability activities . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 26 Our products .................................. 54 Environmental – goals and actions . . . . . . . . . .96 Our Sustainability Report . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .28 Our product range: Contributing to resource Materiality matrix for KRONES AG . . . . . . . . . . . .30 conservation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 56 An overview of our stakeholders . . . . . . . . . . . . 32 Our products’ energy and media Company – goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 34 efficiency and environmental compatibility .............................. 59 Fast, individual service for all KRONES customers .................... 63 Lifecycle Service (LCS) – programmes to ensure long-lived machines . . . . . . . . . .70 Economic – goals and actions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74 About the KRONES Sustainability Report 3 This Sustainability Report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines.

Our unyielding dedication to three equally important factors – high customer satisfaction, innovation, and strong financial performance – has been crucial to our commercial success and sustainable business development. But our attention to the big picture and to ensuring that our actions honour our environmental, social, and civic responsibilities also plays an important role. We are once again documenting these efforts in our Sustainability Report for the year 2015. This report covers all of the key issues relating to corporate social responsibility specific to our company. Our corporate responsibility and the policies with which we meet it are guided by the ten principles of the UN Global Compact, of which we have been a member since 2012. Our Code of Conduct carries these principles into our day-to-day business practices. In 2011, we developed the Value programme in order to prepare for the challenges of the future and set clear priorities with respect to our company’s longterm strategy. The strategic goals at the programme’s heart are profitability, growth, innovation, and quality. Applied to our company’s sustainability, they make international growth and securing jobs at our international sites key pillars of our strategy in the short and medium terms. For this reason, innovative developments within our machinery portfolio and investment in training and continuing education for employees at our international sites are high priorities. All of our activities are aimed at cultivating and maintaining close, long-term Customised packages give our partnerships with our customers, the most important factor for our company’s own customers targeted support to ensure their machines’ and lines’ long-term success. Even after we have put our plants into operation, we continue to longevity. support our customers with made-to-measure packages that help ensure optimal performance across the entire value chain. That enables our customers to use our machines for a very long time and thus contribute to resource conservation. We observe our business environment very carefully and derive our strategies from current trends. What trends do we expect to influence our business model? With respect to our sustainability strategy, three are especially salient: world population growth and continued urbanisation, rising prosperity of the middle class, and changes in production resulting from digitalisation. We will take all three trends into careful account in our long-range forecasting and planning and in the development of our products. The first trend, global population growth, ensures that packaged beverages will remain a popular product for consumers worldwide and an indispensable part of urban lifestyles. For this reason, we expect demand for our machines and lines to increase steadily in the years ahead. In developing solutions for markets with KRONES COMPACT | STATEMENT BY THE EXECUTIVE BOARD 5 high population growth, we will of course take into account prevailing local factors such as family types and forms and living conditions. It helps to be able to draw on direct input from our local employees and quickly access information on the demands that will be placed on our equipment in the regions. That is one of the many reasons we are developing strong local sites and further promoting our group’s internationalisation. With it, we are securing quick access to the markets and their KRONES COMPACT requirements. The second trend, rising prosperity among the middle classes, is also driving our company’s development. These groups are especially receptive of new products and packaging types. Of course, our machines have to meet the needs of the individual markets. To this end, we are continually assessing and evolving our design and research activities to make our range of machinery more and more modular. The third key issue is digitalisation. We see enormous potential here for shaping our Digitalisation offers great potential customers’ future production processes. We will work intensively on all aspects of digfor making our customers’ production processes more sustainable. italisation with the ultimate goal of supporting our customers’ sustainable business models with new technology solutions. Sustainability is always a team effort. KRONES owes its excellent position to the hard work of our entire team – our people. And I’m not referring only to our achievement of economic targets but also to the concerted efforts to enhance efficiency, shared responsibility for conserving resources, and the excellent collaboration between our sites in Germany and around the world. When looking back over the past year, I would like to point out, as our business results demonstrate, that we are progressively nearing our Value targets. Other highlights include our decision to further develop our Taicang site, where we will continue to strengthen the high standards at our Chinese plant, and our establishment in 2015 of a CO2 reduction target for our German sites. These measures – and, of course, the myriad others reported here – will continue to demand our full attention. None of these goals can be achieved without great continued effort, which is exemplified by the continual improvement of our enviro programme. I am certain that our team is up to the challenges of the present and the future. I would like to thank all of our employees for their contributions and achievements thus far and for their ongoing commitment and great loyalty to our company. Once again in 2015, we have demonstrated what great things a competent, deeply committed team can accomplish in terms of corporate sustainability.

We are fair and forthright in our interactions. Honesty, transparency and integrity inform all of our actions. We are interested in the thoughts and opinions of our employees and partners and are willing to learn from others. KRONES COMPACT KRONES – We do more. KRONES Code of Conduct Ensuring that our employees’ actions are ethical and lawful KRONES has been a constant in the beverage and packaging machinery market for The Code of Conduct is available online at http://www.krones.com/ many years. We strive to maintain the solid reputation we have earned and further downloads/CoCo_2016_en.pdf. develop our position as market leader. To accomplish this and to transparently document our social and civic responsibility, we have developed our Code of Conduct on the basis of our mission statement. It is intended to ensure that our actions are always lawful, ethical, and responsible, both within and outside the company. The clear, unequivocal rules laid out in the Code of Conduct are binding for all KRONES employees – including the Executive Board, management, and every member of our staff worldwide. The provisions of the Code of Conduct form an integral part of every employment contract at KRONES. All employees within the KRONES Group abide by local national laws in their implementation of the Code of Conduct. In this way, we can be certain that our employees act in accordance with clear rules that are easy to understand and follow and therefore serve as a guide for one’s daily work. Compliance with laws, standards, policies, and guidelines company-wide is thus assured. All employees are expected to not only comply with the guidelines in the Code of Conduct in a formal sense but to live and breathe them. That engenders the culture of openness and compliance that informs our activities daily. To communicate this expectation credibly and reliably, both within and outside the company, we systematically investigate and take disciplinary action on violations of the Code of Conduct. KRONES COMPACT | OUR ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS 15 KRONES’ Suppliers’ Code Responsibility is also an important factor within our value chain Our high standards of ethical, sustainable action are not limited to our own workThe Suppliers’ Code can be found force. We also seek to bring these standards into our suppliers’ realm of consciousat www.krones.com/downloads/ krones-supplier-code_en.pdf ness. For that reason, we prefer to work with suppliers that are also committed to ethical, sustainable business practices. Our Suppliers’ Code is integral to our commuKRONES COMPACT nication with suppliers on this topic. It is binding for all suppliers and subcontractors. It is part of our general terms and conditions of doing business and therefore a provision of every contract. Our Suppliers’ Code covers working conditions and human rights, workers’ health and safety, environmental impact and resource conservation, and ethical practices in all business processes. Knowledge of and compliance with the Suppliers’ Code is reviewed as part of our quality assurance audits. In addition, KRONES requests documentation of third-party certifications when establishing any new supplier relationships. From this, we can see what sort of standards a potential supplier holds itself to. The request for existing certifications is part of the initial self-disclosure within the supplier registration and selection process.

KRONES COMPACT | OUR ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS 16 Compliance – ethics and integrity in all business processes Our Compliance Management System provides oversight of proper business practices within our company. It helps ensure the ethics and integrity of all of our business activities as required under our Code of Conduct. Our aim is to ensure a uniform, comprehensive, and comprehensible understanding of corporate governance and compliance at all of our group sites. Our Code of Conduct and Suppliers’ Code, together with the established body of KRONES COMPACT standards and policies, form the basis for all activities within the KRONES Group. All business processes must be conducted in accordance with the law and our own voluntary standards. First and foremost, it is crucial that our employees understand the importance of ensuring that all activities are lawful and transparent. In other words, we foster a vibrant culture of compliance. Apart from compliance with laws, regulations, and all internal and external policies and directives, the processes that make up our Compliance Management System also cover fulfilment of all contractual and voluntary commitments. Integration of all compliance activities, such as processes relating to customs and foreign trade, quality management, and the processes relating to all aspects of our procurement strategies, is established and clearly defined within our organisational structure. The compliance team and department heads develop principles and standards of conduct in accordance with specific procedures. All policies are reviewed and approved by the department heads and the Executive Board as a whole. Compliance with the policy is then monitored on a regular basis as part of day-to-day operations. In 2015, no significant fines or non-monetary sanctions were issued for non-compliance with laws and regulations. Clear structures for an effective compliance system The Compliance Management team reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer Our Compliance system is based and consists of the Compliance Officer and the Compliance Committee. By integraton a culture of trust. Employees are encouraged to discuss questions ing this comprehensive, effective, and transparent system into our group structure, relating to proper behaviour with we are establishing standards of compliance that apply uniformly across all levels their immediate superiors as the of the company and at all of the company’s sites worldwide. As is the case for other ﬁrst point of contact. areas, we foster a culture of trust with respect to compliance. That means that the first place an employee should turn with questions or concerns relating to ethical, lawful behaviour or other compliance-related matters is his or her immediate superior. As an alternative or in addition, such matters can be taken to the human resources department at our German sites or, at our international sites, to the Compliance representative or the Compliance Officer. As a further option, we launched a Compliance help desk in 2015. This central point of contact can be used to inquire about corporate governance topics and compliance as well as to report possible violations of laws or rules within the KRONES Group’s activities. The help desk, which is available in Germany and abroad, maintains absolute confidentiality. KRONES COMPACT | COMPLIANCE – ETHICS AND INTEGRITY IN ALL BUSINESS PROCESSES 17 Actions taken in 2015 The major components of the compliance system are prevention, detection, and reNo incidents of corruption are sponse. Actions derived from these components were launched at KRONES AG in 2013 known to have occurred in 2015. Employees who are at higher risk in and 2014. Under “prevention”, we conducted a comprehensive training programme on this regard because of their duties compliance and the Code of Conduct. It is designed as in-person training for manageand responsibilities are provided ment-level employees, members of our finance and accounting team, and employees with the anti-corruption policy as KRONES COMPACT who are exposed to increased risk by virtue of their responsibilities. All other employa guideline for avoiding such risk. No legal actions were initiated for ees are trained in an e-learning environment or by group leaders. At our sites outside anti-competitive behaviour, antiGermany, the managing directors and management-level employees of the offices vistrust, or monopoly practices. ited also received in-person training. E-learning was provided for all other employees. To date, 12,232 employees have received compliance training. Because employees log on to the course with their personal employee ID number, successful completion is verified. Results are linked back to the HR department. In order to pass the test that is integrated into the programme, employees must earn a score of at least 75%. Otherwise, the employee must retake the e-course. Minimum time periods for working through each topic ensure that the chapters are read thoroughly. Since the start of 2015, the international offices have also been made familiar with the requirements of the compliance system. The roll-out of the compliance system at our international sites began with an inventory of conditions on-site and applicability of the e-learning programme. In addition to the e-learning programme launch at the designated sites, on-site Compliance representatives were appointed. The compliance structures and the e-learning programme will be rolled out at all remaining sites in 2016. Fostering vigilance with respect to compliance Ongoing employee education is an important part of our compliance strategy. In 2016, we will be focusing on the anti-corruption programme that was adopted in 2015 and the new policy on situations with corruption risk. The training is mandatory for all employees who have contact with partners outside the company and will be given to around 1,500 employees in 2016. In addition to this training, further policies are available against which employees can review their own actions. A colour-coded system enables employees to quickly check whether specific actions are permissible. Certain target groups whose duties expose them to higher risk with respect to compliance receive special training. In particular, these are employees in sales, purchasing, and service. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, we will offer a refresher course for employees to renew their awareness of important compliance-related issues. Spot checks at the national and international levels enable us to verify compliance with major group policies. In order to ensure a high level of compliance among our suppliers, logistics partners, and agents, we are launching due-diligence audits on these business partners, starting with web-based research.

They are supported by the local Compliance representatives in our LCS Centres worldwide. 20 Report from the CSR Committee KRONES AG’s CSR Committee includes representatives from internal departments as well as participants from outside the company. As a result, KRONES’ activities relating to sustainability are informed by the perspectives of various stakeholder groups. The Committee serves in an advisory capacity to the Executive Board. The company’s most senior decision-making body is directly included in the CSR Committee’s activities. The CEO is a member of the Committee and participates in its KRONES COMPACT meetings, which take place on a regular basis. Sustainability topics coming from the Supervisory Board reach the company’s most senior decision-maker by way of the CEO and another member of the CSR Committee. The Executive Board team decides on the continued evolution of the CSR strategy. The Committee draws on topic-specific support from specialists in the individual departments and maintains direct dialogue with the departments. The decisions and guidance derived from these discussions are effected by the Executive Board at the recommendation of the CSR Committee. The CSR Committee met three times in 2015. In addition to these formal meetings, five workshops were held on the topics of environment, labour practices, and society. Individual members of the CSR Committee participated in these workshops. Three CSR Committee meetings are planned for the year 2016. Focal points of the CSR Committee’s work Key topics in developing sustainability performance n Customers are demanding more and more information about our sustainability The key aspects of our sustainperformance, often requesting it from the CSR Team by way of customer-specific ability performance are presented in the GRI Content Index at the surveys. In addition, KRONES continues to use various sustainability platforms end of this report. to present our activities. Our customers have access to these platforms. n We are seeing from the various sustainability channels that customers and analysts want more information about our supply chain with respect to human resources and human rights. We are taking this need into account by expanding the information we ask our suppliers to provide in their self-disclosures. n In our CSR reporting for the year 2014, we expanded our coverage of environmental topics. One example is the first-time presentation of emissions resulting from sea freight. n The Committee discussed whether to seek recertification under a SMETA Ethical Trade Audit and prepared documentation ahead of the Executive Board’s decision. n The department members responsible for CSR reviewed and discussed the key aspects of the company’s approach to sustainability in preparation for GRI G4 reporting. The CSR Committee and the Executive Board approved the new materiality matrix.

Workshop results The five CSR workshops yielded numerous ideas for developing our sustainabilityrelated activities. Key concepts included generational change and diversity, the expansion of sustainability reporting to include our international sites, and the continuation of the enviro 2.0 programme. n Generational change in the workforce: HR activities must always take into account changing motivations for employment and demands for work-life balance. n Developing diversity remains a topic that must be managed under the individual purview of our various offices so that regional conditions can be taken into account. The Committee determined the following areas of focus with respect to diversity: equal opportunity for women and men, international workforce, considering all age groups, and respecting the needs of persons with disabilities. n Expanding our reporting to international sites is a focus because it allows us to better take into account regional requirements for sustainability reporting, for example in India and the USA. n Many ideas were generated regarding the further evolution of enviro 2.0 to continuously improve our sustainable machinery portfolio. The Committee will discuss these topics in greater depth and detail with the departments in 2016 in order to derive possible actions.

KRONES COMPACT | REPORT FROM THE CSR COMMITTEE KRONES’ CSR strategy 23 KRONES is committed to sustainability in all of its business practices. This commitGrowth ment informs our activities with respect to economic, environmental, and social Profitability factors. We joined the UN Global Compact in 2012 and have made its ten principles Innovation the imperative basis for action within our company. The principles of the UN Global Compact are integrated into our Code of Conduct and our Suppliers’ Code. We stand for high transparency and are registered on various platforms that focus on measurQuality ing a diverse range of parameters relating to companies’ sustainability performance. KRONES COMPACT We provide information to CDP, ecovadis, and Sedex. These platforms are an importAll activities within our sustainant source of information for customers and investors to assess our CSR activities. ability policy are directly related to the ten principles of the UN Global Our actions are guided by the precautionary approach. We ensure this by means of Compact. We are committed to these principles, which can be detailed risk analysis, which underlies all decision-making on product development found online at www.krones.com/ and the development of our production sites. en/responsibility/global-compact. php Our overarching corporate strategy, Value, also serves as the basis for defining our CSR strategy. The four pillars of Value – quality, profitability, growth, and innovation – cover all sustainability-related tasks. Thus, our master strategy takes into account topics relating to economic, environmental, and social responsibility topics. Our employees are crucial to successful implementation of our Value strategy. With their innovative ideas, steady focus on customer needs, and high level of dedication, they enable us to strengthen and expand on our position worldwide. For this reason, we will continue to ensure that our people have a secure, suitable framework in which to operate. In the medium term, our CSR strategy with respect to labour practices and decent work is aimed at further developing the framework for our employees at our sites worldwide (see pages 100 to 127). Offering a range of products that meet the highest sustainability criteria is another key component of our strategy. With the enviro programme, we offer our customers “best-in-class” machines and lines that operate as efficiently as currently possible with respect to resource and media consumption. This programme has been implemented across our entire product development process and offers reliable guidance for building eco-efficient machines. Certification of this management system enables us to apply standardised processes to the development of environmentally friendly machines (pages 56 to 69). KRONES COMPACT | KRONES’ CSR STRATEGY 24 This environmental awareness is also alive and strong within our production sites. Conserving resources and reducing energy consumption are the main points. By defining a CO₂ reduction target, we have committed to taking responsibility for countering the possible consequences of climate change as a company. The CO₂ reduction target applies to direct and indirect energy-related emissions and aims to reduce these emissions by 30% to 40% per €1 million in revenue using 2010 as the base year. We also look at other indirect (Scope 3) emissions (pages 78 to 97). KRONES COMPACT Our society-related activities are constantly evolving. We see ourselves as a partner within our business environment and take our stakeholders’ concerns into account. We will define further actions to take in this regard to further expand our involvement in the community and increase communication with stakeholders (pages 130 to 139). Our sustainability efforts are based on the targets defined by the CSR Teams. Our annual CSR Report presents our CSR activities and the annual progress report required as part of our membership in the UN Global Compact. The CSR Teams review and, as needed, adjust the topics and aspects covered in our CSR Report on a regular basis. The CSR Report is reviewed and approved by the Executive Board prior to publication. Evolution of sustainability topics We will review the ideas generated in the newly established CSR workshops on an ongoing basis, consult on them internally and integrate them into our strategy. This process still needs some fine tuning. We were able to integrate a broad, dedicated team of experts into the first round of workshops. That enables us to cast the CSR Teams’ net even more broadly and integrate technical departments and their suggestions in a purposeful manner. In 2016, in accordance with an Executive Board decision, we will prepare for expanding our CSR activities to our international sites and introduce the sustainability reporting guidelines there. Additional actions taken as part of our CSR efforts are described in the “Goals and actions” section of each chapter of this report.

This standard prompted production sites in Germany and thus around 75% of our employees. us to reframe the questions of materiality, report boundaries, and data measurement Some individual portions of this techniques for the various topics. report include expanded report boundaries – the “Products” section As a result, we have adjusted some of the report content in several stages.

From this, we estabfor each of the individual charts lished a direct link between the aspects in the GRI Guidelines and the issues that are and tables. material to our company, thus defining the indicators on which we would report. Report content and boundaries Another step was the expansion of reporting to include data from sites abroad – as far as possible given the existing methods for data measurement. In particular, in the area of labour practices and decent work, we are already in full compliance with many of the new standard’s indicators. In certain cases, we do not go into great detail. That is in part an effort to maintain a good overview of the information and in part because we view some issues as not relevant. For example, we do not deem it relevant to show a breakdown of employee turnover by age group at the international sites or of accident rates by gender. Measurement of the accident rate relates more to job description at KRONES than gender. We have defined our significant locations of operation on the basis of regional definitions that are known worldwide. Consequently, our reporting on sites in Germany now summarises all sites – much like in our financial reporting. We provide information specific to the different plants in only a few individual cases. One such example is our reporting of contaminant loads in waste water from installations subject to licensing since the individual plants are subject to different specific limits. In our presentation of human resources figures, we no longer report the subsidiaries KOSME, KONPLAN, and MAINTEC separately. Instead, we have integrated their figures into the total number of employees at our European sites. KRONES COMPACT | OUR SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 29 Basis for measurement and intensity data Another factor that prompted changes to the presentation compared with the previous year is a change in the measurement base. For example, we have until now presented all fathers on parental leave within the data for fathers taking parental leave. Now and going forward, only the share of fathers taking more than 30 days parental leave will be presented. That has resulted in a significant change from the KRONES COMPACT previously reported figure. For the presentation of accident statistics, we have decided to continue to use the data collected in accordance with OHSAS instead of the measurement method recommended in the GRI Guidelines because the OHSAS figures are also part of our IMS certification and are used internationally. The data on indirect CO₂ emissions arising from business travel are collected from the CO₂ emissions data provided by airlines and vehicle manufacturers as a factor of kilometres travelled. For our data on freight forwarding logistics, we use the basis defined in the previous year by Hapag Lloyd’s EcoCalc CO₂ calculator and plug in the data from 2015. That enables us to deliver an estimate of our CO₂ emissions from freight forwarding. We do not cover data on road-only forwarding – for instance in regions without sea access. That applies to around 25% of our load volume. For intensity data, which is increasingly demanded, we use revenue as the reference metric – that is, per €1 million in revenue – since it best enables us to show the intensities relative to increased production volume and their impact. In certain cases, we use production area as the reference metric because it is relevant for presenting energy consumption. Scope of the report: Fulﬁllment of the “Core” option For the general standard disclosure of our CSR activities, we have opted to use the more compact, bullet-point-style “Core” option. In addition, we have used the new guidelines to begin presenting the activities of our most senior decision-making body and highest governance body in expanded form. Here, we refer to our Annual Report for certain details. This is indicated in the GRI Content Index. We are submitting this year’s CSR Report under the “Core” option because we cannot yet fulfil all of the indicators required for the “Comprehensive” option. As in years past, we will have the report audited by a third-party organisation as part of the annual monitoring audit on our Integrated Management System. The Executive Board has supported this measure. Information about the auditing organisation can be found in the GRI Content Index and on the inside back cover of this report.

This was done as part of the kick-off of our CSR reporting. We reviewed the current matrix in a two-stage process and asked about additional aspects. That was followed by a candid discussion of the proposals in the kickoff meeting and a vote on their inclusion. As a result, some points were reshuffled, others were consolidated, and new aspects were added such as “clear contract terms”, “transparent supply chain”, and “improved stakeholder dialogue”. In addition, an opinion poll was taken on whether the impact of these aspects is within the company, outside the company, or both. The results indicated that most of the aspects have an impact both within and outside the company. In addition to this content work, we reorganised the materiality matrix and arranged the numbering of the aspects thematically.

We aim to be a one-stop shop for our customers, covering everything from beverage production to filling to distribution. Demand for packaged beverages will continue to increase, driven by megatrends like rising standards of living in the emerging markets, urbanisation, and increasing diversity of packaging. Thus, the market in which KRONES operates is growing at a relatively stable rate of between 4% and 5% each year. Systematically implementing Value In 2011, we launched our Value strategy programme, whose four pillars are innovation, growth, profitability, and quality, in an effort to seize the opportunities our market offers. We made further considerable progress with Value in 2015. The excellent development of our core segment, machines and lines for product filling and decoration, and the turnaround at KOSME in Italy following the site’s restructuring in 2014 were positive forces here. Conversely, we are less satisfied with the development of our second-largest segment, machines and lines for beverage production/ ECONOMIC process technology. At the end of 2015, we defined an action plan for strengthening the segment’s profitability for the long term. Responding ﬂexibly to market demands Despite the achievements made under our Value strategy programme, we still have a lot of work to do. Just as we see many opportunities, we also have many challenges to overcome. The volatile global economy and crises in individual countries and regions continue to shape the world in which we operate. The number of competitors in our attractive market is not shrinking but our customer base is – as individual customers (beverage producers) become larger by way of mergers and acquisitions. For this reason, we do not expect prices to improve in the short term. Moreover, the increasing digitalisation and integration of production will forever change our market and its business models. As a result, we must become more flexible, faster, and more regionally focussed. The Value strategy programme and our new corporate structure, which was rolled out in early 2015, will support this effort.

Overall, KRONES’ revenue is well balanced. We generated 53.2% of consolidated revenue in the emerging markets in the reporting period (previous year: 60.4%). The mature markets (Germany, Western and Central Europe, and North and Central America) contributed 46.8% to consolidated revenue in 2015 (previous year: 39.6%). Revenue in North and Central America, Western Europe, and China increased more than overall revenue. Business in Russia and South America declined as expected due to the regions’ very weak economies. The company was able to take advantage of the positive market environment and considerably expand its business in 2015 thanks to its broad range of products and services and strong international presence. Revenue increased 7.5% year-on-year from €2,953.4 million to €3,173.5 million. ECONOMIC £ With that, we exceeded our growth target of 4% for 2015. Revenue from both individual machines and complete filling and packaging lines improved year-on-year in 2015. KRONES’ services business continued to grow steadily, fuelled in part by the progressive expansion of our LCS business worldwide in the reporting period. Proﬁtability up as forecast KRONES improved profitability as forecast thanks to good capacity utilisation and increased efficiency overall as a result of the Value strategy programme. As expected, prices yielded no positive effects on highly competitive markets. £ At €223.3 million, earnings before taxes (EBT) were up 16.4% on the year-earlier period. The EBT margin, the ratio of earnings before taxes to revenue, advanced from 6.5% in the previous year to 7.0%. Thus, KRONES has met its EBT margin target for 2015. The company also achieved the medium-term EBT margin target set under the Value strategy programme. £ After taxes, consolidated net income was up 15.2% to €156.3 million in the reporting period. Earnings per share rose from €4.30 in the previous year to €4.98. 7/7/20 remains our goal. The KRONES team accepts the challenges and intends to seize the opportunities the market presents. Thus, we are standing by our medium-term target of 7/7/20: n 5% to 7% revenue growth per year on average n 7% EBT margin (pre-tax return on sales) n 20% ROCE (return on capital employed) £ We achieved our EBT margin target of 7.0% in 2015. At 7.5%, revenue growth surpassed our target range of 5% to 7% percent on average. At 17.7%, ROCE exceeded our forecast for 2015. In order to achieve our 20% target and continue to grow profitably in the medium term, we have to work hard on increasing earnings and revenue and further implementing actions under the Value programme in all three segments. ECONOMIC | ECONOMIC RESPONSIBILITY: FOCUS ON PROFITABLE GROWTH 41 £ In process technology, we are introducing a raft of measures that was developed in late 2015 to significantly strengthen profitability. Our goal is to offer regionallyspecific products at competitive prices. To achieve this, we are improving important processes such as quote preparation, order processing, and project management. KRONES is also considerably reducing its depth of value creation, relying instead on an international supplier network. We also intend to establish international hubs that will allow us to respond to customer needs more quickly and cost-effectively. They can also serve as bases from which to expand our after-sales business and implement smaller-scale projects such as expanding or upgrading existing lines. The measures will be completed by 2017. Value creation increased further The value added calculation presented here shows the KRONES Group’s contributions In 2015, KRONES received around to the economy and society. It shows the value created by the company and how that €51,000 in government subsidies. ECONOMIC value is distributed. A company’s value added is calculated by deducting the expenses for production – that is, cost of goods and services purchased, depreciation and amortisation on non-current assets, and other operating expenses – from total operating performance (including other income and own work capitalised). KRONES generated €1,136 million in value added in 2015 (previous year: €1,038 million). £ The lion’s share of value added at KRONES (80.9% or €919 million) went towards our employees. Besides wages and salaries (€767 million), KRONES spent €152 million on social security contributions, pension plans, and employee benefits. Another €67.1 million or 5.9% of value added went to the state in the form of tax payments. The company distributed €39.5 million in dividends to its shareholders. In the year under review, €110.4 million in value added remained within the company and is available for investment in future growth. Leading technology and services are essential to achieving sustainable value added. That is why the company invests in new plant and equipment and in the development of new products and services. £ The company invested €102.6 million in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets last year (previous year: €94.6 million). We increased investment in both intangible assets (€43.0 million) and property, plant and equipment (€59.6 million) year-on-year in 2015 as forecast. In 2015, KRONES invested heavily in information technology and new production facilities. In order to share the company’s success with shareholders, KRONES’ policy is to pay out 25% to 30% of consolidated profit in the form of dividends. £ In June 2015, KRONES paid its shareholders a dividend of €1.25 per share for the financial year 2014. The payout corresponds to 29% of consolidated net income for 2014. The total payout to shareholders for the reporting period was €39.5 million.

KRONES’ risk management system consists of an internal control system with which we record, analyse, and assess all relevant risks. We monitor all material risks and any countermeasures already taken in a detailed, ongoing process that entails planning, information, and control. We assess risks on the basis of the likelihood of an event and its potential financial impact and categorise them as low, medium, or high. We are continually expanding and improving our multi-stage risk management system, which consists of the following modules: risk analysis, risk monitoring, and risk planning and control. Details on risk management and the risk categories can be found in the risk and ECONOMIC opportunity report in our 2015 Annual Report (pages 116 to 127).

The subsidiary KOSME produces in Austria and Italy. KRONES manufactures spare parts at its Lifecycle Service (LCS) Centres in Franklin (USA), Taicang (China), and São Paulo (Brazil). In addition to the seven strategically located LCS Centres, the company also has a global network of service and sales offices. We manufacture precision, high-performance machines. Consistently high quality in our raw materials and third-party components is very important to us. Flexible, on-time delivery of materials is also important for the reputation of KRONES machines on the market. Of course, comparing prices is also an essential part of our procurement policy. Orderly, well-managed processes across the entire supply chain are an essential part of how we operate at KRONES. For this reason, we focus on close, long-standing relationships with our suppliers, to ensure that we can count on the materials being of high quality. ECONOMIC To ensure the stability of processes in this regard, we have incorporated the individual order processes into dedicated policies and codes which apply internally and externally. These policies and codes are: the Code of Conduct, the Suppliers’ Code, our audit policy, and our procurement policy, to which we are in the process of adding a policy on supplier management in 2016. Process maps within our process model and the codes and policies listed above include specific provisions for auditing our suppliers and supply channels. In this way, KRONES ensures a verified procurement process. Suppliers thoroughly audited Our supplier selection process uses a self-assessment form to gain an initial overview of suppliers’ capabilities, with questions on all relevant aspects of their product range, technical qualifications, and current certifications. This self-assessment form also requests that prospective suppliers confirm that they meet the requirements laid out in our Suppliers’ Code. It also collects information on whether a prospective supplier has an environmental management system, environmental guidelines, and an occupational health and safety management system. We also ask whether suppliers audit their own suppliers with respect to certifications and compliance with specific standards. In this way, our procurement decisions also take into consideration issues further up the supply chain.

KRONES Group. Our procurement policy, which describes all process flows and accountability, applies to 100% of our purchasing. Our purchasing activities take into account all legal requirements and standards that are relevant with respect to our suppliers. The self-declarations we require from suppliers and service providers enable us to ensure compliance with all laws and standards, including the core labour standards of the ILO (International Labour Organisation), as explicitly specified in our Suppliers’ Code. System audits: key aspect in the vetting of suppliers We conduct on-site system audits on all potential new suppliers before establishing a supplier relationship. The procedure for system audits is laid out in our audit policy and is carried out in close collaboration between our purchasing department and our quality management team. For the selection, qualification, and development ECONOMIC of suppliers, risk analysis on their environmental impact is done on the basis of the self-disclosure form and in the subsequent stages of qualification as part of the system audit. We also conduct renewal audits, particularly on strategically important suppliers. We perform construction site inspections to evaluate the situation at construction sites worldwide and the subcontractors working there. ECONOMIC | PRODUCTION: OUR SUPPLY CHAIN 48 Transparent supply chain Our supply chain includes nearly 1,700 suppliers from whom we place orders in excess of €50,000. Each day, we send out around 2,500 orders, which added up to around 611,000 orders in 2015. We characterise our supply chain by our suppliers’ locations and the volume of purchasing through local suppliers. The four most important raw materials we use are stainless steel, steel, aluminium, and plastic. Potential new suppliers must complete a self-assessment form before they are added to our supplier database, giving us a strong base of information for our selection process. £ Assessment of the self-disclosure forms is currently done using a spreadsheet According to information from programme. Selection criteria include company size, product range, manufacturing one of our suppliers, the share of recycled material in stainless steel technologies used, certifications, and licensing.

Of these, 13 suppliers were added to our supplier pool or invited to send us samples. £ We expect the introduction of the SLC (Supplier Lifecycle Collaboration) tool to simplify administration, analysis, and usability of supplier information. The software programme stores all supplier information centrally so that it is available to everyone involved, at every stage of the business relationship. Alongside other advantages relating to supplier management, this ensures that suppliers must read and confirm their understanding of the content of the Suppliers’ Code before we place our first order with them. £ We expect the SLC tool to provide up-to-date information about all certifications our suppliers have obtained, in particular ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certifications.

We also performed 14 weld audits on suppliers. £ Service provider (subcontractor) audits relate to the activities of suppliers and service providers at construction sites worldwide. We conducted 29 such audits in ECONOMIC 2015. Our quality management team evaluates the quality of suppliers and service providers at construction sites. The inspectors communicate obvious occupational safety issues to the foremen responsible, who then ensure that appropriate actions are taken. In the event of violations of occupational safety and health principles, the quality assurance inspectors address the situation immediately, directly with the person(s) involved. In some cases, the inspector will prohibit continued work until the matter is resolved with the construction site manager. £ We conducted 39 product audits relating to third-party machines. We launched a systematic risk analysis process for procurement activities in collaboration with our Compliance Officer. In this way, we are ensuring that our suppliers offer a high level of security with respect to country risk, cultural aspects, and currency risk. £ Since the end of 2015, new suppliers are subject to a risk analysis on these aspects. £ Focused risk assessment with respect to environmental performance is currently not done.

Our strategy is to expand our activities from Germany to our international sites, focusing on a local approach that utilises local suppliers in the respective economic regions. We plan to increase this local sourcing in the future. £ Our intention going forward is to establish local engineering capacities at our LCS Centres for parts and assemblies that are currently designed and built in Germany. The parts needed for this will also be purchased locally. Implementing this plan will take until 2020. ECONOMIC ECONOMIC | REGIONAL SUPPLIERS AT OUR LCS CENTRES Lean manufacturing (TPM) 51 Besides sustainability, lean manufacturing (TPM) is, of course, also a significant aspect of KRONES’ business strategy. It forms an integral part of the “Profitability” pillar of the Value strategy programme. TPM covers everything from continuous evaluation of our materials consumption and potential for optimisation to possible improvements in production methods resulting from the use of new laser-based manufacturing processes to continuous consumables monitoring. Improved manufacturing processes and optimisation of the commissioning process also allows us to increase efficiency. All manufacturing sites seek to identify potential for improvement on a regular basis in order to achieve a high level of cost-effectiveness. As users of large machining centres, we are in regular communication with suppliers about optimising their machines. £ All new investments are reviewed for possible energy savings and efficiency improvements. ECONOMIC £ Close cooperation with suppliers and tool tests in operation enable us to make ongoing improvements and keep pace with the state of the art. The interaction between people and machines and optimal use of materials and energy are ongoing considerations when structuring assembly capacities. All efforts are aimed at supporting employees with improved processes so that they can fully devote their work to the product. £ Module manufacturing at our Rosenheim site enables just-in-time and just-insequence production, so that materials are available at workstations right when they are needed. It also helps streamline processes. That enables us to significantly reduce manufacturing planning times. £ Incorporating a high-bay warehouse system at our Rosenheim site has revolutionised the order-picking process for parts within our own manufacturing process. Fast, simple workflows are also the subject of improvement suggestions submitted by our employees. Our “Brainpool” is the portal through which we collect ideas and suggestions. In all, we received 2,885 suggestions for improvements within the company through the Brainpool. £ In 2015, our employees submitted 1,680 ideas that are relevant to CSR.

Producers of beverages and food products worldwide use our machines and lines. For this reason, we have to take a vast array of different conditions, circumstances, and technical standards into account when we develop our machines. Local infrastructures also vary widely from one region to the next, as does the availability of resources. The individual needs of our customers must also be taken into account. They want increased machine efficiency and, depending on the local environment, also the lowest possible resource consumption. In some regions, a machine’s water consumption is a critical criterion while in others energy consumption is given more weight. In others still, both might be given equal importance. Not only our customers but we, too, want our machines to be as resource-efficient as possible. That is our contribution in the bigger economic picture, reducing resource consumption and the use of substances that harm the environment. This ECONOMIC approach secures the basis of our business and our market shares for the long term. However, we also have to conclude that this strategy sometimes requires components or assemblies whose price can impact the overall price of the machine. enviro 2.0 management approach certiﬁed Our enviro 2.0 management approach to designing resource-friendly machines is the body of rules and standards that governs our entire product development process. This management approach is certified by TÜV SÜD and audited on a regular basis. In addition, a voluntary commitment to offer energy and media-efficient products on the market is an integral part of the “Innovation” component of the Value strategy programme and therefore defined as a strategic target by our company’s leadership. In addition, our efforts are guided by the provisions of the law in the target markets and our own commitment to delivering machines that meet the highest safety standards. We incorporate the safety codes of nations worldwide into our development processes. When building our machines, we continually look for ways to achieve a high level of resource efficiency. These efforts are based on the laws and regulations applicable to each production site. Another guideline for our German production sites is the CO₂ reduction target that we set in 2015. Our employees play a crucial role in improving our processes with respect to conserving media and materials. They contribute wellfounded improvement suggestions from their own day-to-day experience through our “Brainpool” portal.

Products for optimising and extending the useful lives of KRONES machines and lines are offered under the KRONES LCS (Lifecycle Service) brand. These offerings are part of our International Operations and Services division and monitored there. Resource-conservation efforts within our production flows are planned and impleECONOMIC mented by the relevant plant managers. The processes defined in our enviro manual ensure compliance with all requirements. In addition, status reports within the strategic monitoring system show what progress has been made in assessing enviro process models. In every product area, an enviro point person supports the design teams in applying the guidelines and reviews the solutions. In the future, our sales team will be able to analyse enviro criteria within our quotation tool. That will enable us to review how well these machines do on the market.

It specifies targets and guidelines for assessing energy and media efficiency and environmental compatibility. The steps defined within the enviro manual underlie all work on developing new products and continually improving existing products. The process ensures that every design step is in full compliance with legal requirements and that the materials used are reviewed for environmental compatibility and occupational safety. To facilitate consistent review of KRONES machines according to enviro criteria, we have implemented enviro 2.0 process model assessments as a management process. These processes are compiled in the enviro manual. The manual is updated and amended continually so that it always reflects current requirements for an envirocompliant design process. £ In May 2015, we obtained certification from TÜV SÜD and can now extend the pilot programme to all product groups. £ The enviro manual governs the entire product development process and lays out ECONOMIC all work flows for developing resource-friendly processes. £ The enviro standard also includes a review of the supplies that may be used in enviro machines. The permissible products are compiled in a “whitelist” which our product developers can access through KRONES inside. Continued assessment of our product range under enviro The assessment of KRONES products in accordance with enviro criteria continued in 2015. Because of the transition from enviro 1.0 to enviro 2.0, we have reassessed 36% of the machine series that had already been assessed under enviro 1.0. £ At the end of 2015, we had not yet assessed 16% of our machines. Another 14% of machines will not be part of the enviro process because they are special-order, laboratory, or third-party machines. The enviro management system also includes a training programme that assists employees in their work within the enviro process. £ A multi-stage training programme on enviro 2.0 was also conducted in 2015 and provided KRONES employees with a high level of information about designing sustainable machines and lines in accordance with our enviro criteria. £ The training courses are offered through the KRONES training portal and are recommended to employees as purposeful, goal-oriented continuing education within the scope of our competence management (career development) reviews.

ECONOMIC | ENERGY AND MEDIA EFFICIENCY AND ENVIRONMENTAL COMPATIBILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS Fast, individual service for all KRONES customers 63 Sales activities for energy-efficient machines Reducing resource and media consumption has increasingly gained a foothold in the consciousness of our customers in recent years. When we first launched our enviro machines in 2008, only a few customers were able to appreciate the potential benefits of these machines and their impact on energy consumption in production. Since 2012, we have seen sharp growth in interest in these solutions. We provide amortisation calculations for these energy and resource-efficient machines to our customers so that they are fully informed of the potential. The calculations enable users to see how long it will take for the resource-saving equipment to pay for the added cost. £ Target amortisation periods for enviro options are figured on a customer-specific basis depending on consumption data and the cost of media employed. As a rule, we try to have the equipment amortise in periods ranging from less than four years to ECONOMIC five years in order to make it easier for customers to choose the enviro option. To simplify the process of preparing quotations for enviro machines and therefore make it easier for our sales team to utilise the enviro machinery programme, we have integrated the characteristics of enviro machines into our bid configuration system. £ In 2015, we stored the enviro characteristics for seven process models in our bid preparation system. Product specialists can now directly incorporate the enviro characteristics as part of the standardised bid preparation process. £ We expect the number of bids prepared for enviro machines with these process models to increase this year and in subsequent years. In the environment-related CSR workshops held in 2015, it was apparent that we need to more effectively showcase enviro machines and their benefits on various platforms. £ We have launched initial efforts to improve communication with stakeholders. We plan to publish regular reports on our resource-friendly enviro machines in our customer and employee magazines.

All of these machines were developed in accordance with enviro criteria. Individual solutions such as the LinaFlex Pro tunnel pasteuriser with an internal cleaning process were assessed under enviro 1.0 while the majority of the machines already have a process model assessed under enviro 2.0. In the case of the modular compact brewery One2Brew, we hope to be able to do a system assessment, which we are currently coordinating with TÜV SÜD. On the other hand, the LavaClassic Plus bottle washer was designed for markets where energy consumption is not a priority because energy costs are so low. DosaFlex DosaFlex revolutionises aseptic dosing. This innovation from our process technology segment doses solid components such as fruit bits, fibres, or grains into liquid beverages in a process that is gentle, precise, and affordable. Until now, these sensitive parECONOMIC ticles have been heated in the UHT unit along with the liquid part of the beverage. DosaFlex adds the solids, which have been produced under aseptic conditions, to the juice flow just before filling, thus sparing them thermal stress. That reduces damage to the particles and increases product quality. The system’s highly accurate dosing also reduces costs. Until now, it was customary to overdose the expensive solids to ensure desired concentrations in the bottled product. DosaFlex eliminates the need for overdosing. Craftmate We developed the Craftmate as an inexpensive can filler for low output applications. It is specifically designed to meet the needs and expectations of smaller breweries and is therefore also ideally suited for the booming craft beer market. The machine handles between 6,000 and 18,000 cans per hour depending on container size and beverage. The Craftmate has 24 filling valves and is intentionally designed to be simpler in certain points than KRONES’ high-speed can fillers. The Craftmate is highly versatile. Not only does it fill cans of different sizes and shapes, it can also fill both beer and carbonated drinks. ECONOMIC | FAST, INDIVIDUAL SERVICE FOR ALL KRONES CUSTOMERS ECONOMIC 68 69 Contiform 3 Pro KRONES has further improved its stretch blow-moulder, which produces plastic (PET) bottles by inflating PET blanks. To reflect the changes, we have added “Pro” to the Contiform 3 name, making it Contiform 3 Pro. “Pro” stands for “progress”, as in energy cost savings of up to 8%. With the Contiform 3 Pro, the base reflectors in the heating unit can be adjusted to match the length of the preforms, thus reducing the space to be heated and lowering energy consumption. The machine’s automated blowing process assistant ensures that the blowing module uses only as much compressed air as is absolutely necessary. That cuts compressed air consumption by as much as 30%. The machine’s output has increased to as many as 2,300 containers per hour per blowing station. Other benefits that the Contiform 3 Pro offers customers include faster blow-mould changeovers, easier operation, and simplified cleaning. One2Brew One2Brew is a turnkey compact brewery with which customers can make their first brew just eleven months after the kick-off meeting. A comparable project with a stanECONOMIC dard project plan would take 18 months to implement. The brewery’s process areas are divided into functional units, which are delivered pre-assembled and connected to build a complete plant on-site in a “plug-and-play” process. All systems and components as well as the brewery layout are standardised, considerably reducing the costly, time-consuming processes of engineering, manufacturing, and assembly. In addition, the compact brewery, which can produce 300,000 hectolitres per year, has a small footprint. The real kicker: Plug-and-play operation means that the entire brewery can easily be dismantled, shipped, and reassembled at a different location. LavaClassic Plus The LavaClassic Plus bottle washer removes coarser dirt and impurities from heavily soiled bottles at an early stage. This is particularly useful in the emerging markets, where returnable containers often come back to the plant very heavily soiled. The “Plus” version of the LavaClassic has an additional, powerful pretreatment zone to handle every type of soiling. Light dirt particles are removed by way of a belt while heavier particles that sink to the bottom of the machine are removed by way of a “dirt lock”. Sand is separated from the liquids and removed in a separate module. The benefits for customers: The main section of the bottle washer is protected, prolonging its useful life, and manual cleaning requirements are reduced. LinaFlex Pro We developed the LinaFlex Pro CLEAR (cleaning, long-life, efficient, automated, and regenerative) system to enable fully automatic cleaning of our LinaFlex tunnel pasteuriser while the machine is in operation. The system saves customers downtimes as well as resources and energy. No biocides are used and recirculation reduces water consumption. Similarly, the energy-intensive process of boiling out the machine, standard procedure until now, can be dispensed with. Because the system removes foreign particles and glass fragments from the process water, wear parts last longer. The LinaFlex Pro CLEAR system reduces ongoing operating costs while ensuring the highest quality pasteurisation.

In 2015, KRONES developed the “Partner for Performance” Partner for service concept, which we presented for the first time at the BrauBeviale trade fair in November. Partner for Performance stands for KRONES’ intention to help each of LCS Performance our customers achieve their goals. The concept includes five product groups that address our customers’ different needs: Profitable Performance, Tailor-made Performance, Efficient Performance, Cost-saving Performance, and Secure Performance.

Our LCS portfolio already offers products that offer deep data integration their machines in every stage of and generate significant advantages in day-to-day operation. their machine’s lifecycle. Digitalisation: New ideas for extending machines’ useful lives Maintenance strategy has a major influence on the cost of operating a KRONES line. ECONOMIC Condition-based maintenance (CBM) achieves the best balance between system availability and cost. With OSAT (On Site Assessment Tool), KRONES offers a tool for a high-quality technical inspection and subsequent overhaul as well as documentation of any work done. £ This tool is a mobile application technicians on site can use to plug inspection and overhaul results into the KRONES system online for immediate further processing. The result is faster processes, improved inspection and overhaul quality, and thus better machine performance. KRONES supports customers with maintenance planning. In addition to maintenance planning software, KRONES delivers machine-specific data that enable our customers to plan ahead to replace the right part at the right time. £ Continuous collection of machine data on site and analysis of the data will enable us to detect and resolve many issues before they cause unscheduled downtimes. Such predictive maintenance significantly reduces downtimes between scheduled maintenance work. When KRONES delivers new machines, they are at the highest level of technology. However, over these systems’ lifetimes, technology continues to advance and new solutions are developed. Many of these innovations can be integrated into existing lines as upgrades. In this way, improved energy and media efficiency or reduced employee workloads can be achieved even on older machines. £ Around 270 upgrades are currently available for our products. As data integration increases, KRONES will be able to take an even more targeted approach to informing customers about possible upgrades. We will then automatically offer technical innovations when we do scheduled overhauls. That puts the machines at the latest state of the art once the overhaul is complete. We will also make customers aware of suitable upgrades through our online shop.

Low resource consumption and environmentally friendly production are a high priority within our sustainability policy. The careful use of materials and raw materials is part of that. KRONES takes its role as a responsible partner to industry and society seriously and actively strives to reduce consumption of raw materials and energy. One key reason these aspects are important is that they enable us to reduce costs. Thus, the environment benefits and the company benefits. We earmark an annual budget for capital expenditure related to energy efficiency. Our Code of Conduct clearly prescribes responsible use of materials and resources in our activities worldwide. This self-imposed obligation is in addition to the legal framework in Germany and at our international locations. Our Value programme provides further underpinnings for our treatment of environmental topics. It establishes that our company’s forward-thinking model is also based on high profitability. That makes conserving resources imperative. We added to these general guidelines when, in 2015, we made a voluntary commitment to reduce our CO₂ emissions from energy consumption. Under it, we aim to permanently reduce our CO₂ emissions per €1 million in revenue by 30% to 40% compared with a 2010 baseline by 2020.

In addition, tal laws or regulations. environmental protection officers for topics such as water conservancy, pollution control, and waste and the central point person for matters relating to energy supply are also part of the process. Our specialist team for distribution logistics handles environmental issues relating to travel management and freight forwarding. In 2015, we conducted two workshops on environmental topics for the first time, in which we collected new ideas for developing our environment-related initiatives. Our employees are also called upon to contribute improvement suggestions of all kinds by way of the Brainpool portal.

The absolute figure is up slightly but relative to revenue, consumption is actually down, which translates to an increase in efficiency. Thus, we achieved our aim of continuous improvement. Because the company expanded the total physical space of some sites in Germany through the leasing, new construction, or expansion of additional office and production space, warehouses, and social areas, there are limits to how well consumption figures from the previous year can be compared with figures for the reporting period. £ To show the impact of this expansion on our energy consumption figures, we use an additional indicator that relates heating energy consumption to total area in our production facilities. £ Because of the expansion, we cannot put a specific number on the reductions in electricity consumption. Nevertheless, the fact that electricity consumption is flat despite a 3.2% increase in area at some sites can be viewed as a relative reduction in consumption. £ Newly added areas – such as the new dining hall – will be equipped with stateof-the-art LED lighting, which will help keep electricity consumption steady. Energy-saving building improvements and new investments ENVIRONMENTAL The increase in natural gas consumption can be attributed to the addition of a fourth module to our cogeneration plants, which we also use as backup power supply for our sprinkler system. £ Operating the cogeneration (combined heat and power, CHP) plants requires 25% Key ﬁgures on our cogeneration more primary energy. The systems have an efficiency of 75%. plants for 2015: 33% electricity production £ The CHP plants are an important building block for our electrical power supply. 42% heat production In 2015, we generated 26% of our power supply with CHP at our Neutraubling site. 25% efficiency losses Replacing the skylights in some of our production areas at our Neutraubling site resulted in heating energy savings of around 13%. £ For 2016, we plan to replace more roofing (approx. 1,400 m²) in other production areas. ENVIRONMENTAL | ENERGY AND MEDIA CONSERVATION IN PRODUCTION OPERATIONS 81 We take energy conservation into account when evaluating all new investments in our machining centres in production. It is an important criterion guiding our decision-making alongside increasing efficiency. We invested in state-of-the-art machining technology at our Rosenheim plant in 2015. £ The new laser machining centre uses 35% less electrical power despite a 20% increase in output. £ The higher efficiency of new milling equipment is evident in the 55% reduction in input power and improved flexibility. Energy consumption and energy intensity nearly unchanged Total energy consumption in Germany in 2015 came to 116,644 MWh. That is a yearHeating our Rosenheim plant is on-year increase of 2%.

In all, our use of primary energy sources with respect to the energy ENVIRONMENTAL we draw from external sources is largely unchanged. The figure for electricity consumption includes power supplied by the local utilities as well as power generated in the company’s own CHP plant in Neutraubling. £ We generated 10,321 MWh of electrical power on site in 2015, a share of 16% of the total electrical power consumed (previous year: 13%). The share of externally generated electrical power was reduced by 2.9% to 52,547 MWh (previous year: 54,099 MWh).

We withdrew 1,048,391 m³ of groundwater for the water cycle we use for cooling buildings at our Neutraubling plant (previous year: 1,275,380 m³). That volume was returned in its entirety. The volume discharged into the public network largely equals the volume withdrawn, less any losses due to diversion, disposal, or evaporation. Compared with the previous year, production volume was higher, especially in filling technology, the construction of water treatment systems at our Neutraubling plant, and production at our Freising plant. £ We note an increase in water consumption at both our Neutraubling and Freising plants for 2015, which relates to the large-volume tanks produced there. £ Multiple ongoing tests and filling tests are also factors contributing to higher water consumption. A damaged pipe in the Neutraubling plant is another factor that caused an increase in water consumption. ENVIRONMENTAL £ Water consumption in this production area is expected to return to a lower level in 2016. The volume of waste water from installations that are subject to licensing came to 4,071 m³, an increase of 5.9%. This waste water is treated, either in internal physical/ chemical processes or in neutralisation systems. The discharge of waste water from installations that are subject to licensing is tested under the German Self-Monitoring Ordinance [Eigenüberwachungsverordnung] and subjected to external monitoring. £ Contaminant loads remain far below the defined limits.

With respect to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, we accomplish that by conserving energy and seeking ways to improve our production. CO2 reduction target: Action plan adopted Our reduction target for greenhouse gases by 2020 uses 2010 as a baseline. We chose this base year because we can ensure a sufficiently reliable data set for all of the company’s sites for 2010. Our reduction target relates to direct and indirect energy-related CO2 emissions and does not include other greenhouse gases. £ An action plan for achieving this emissions target has been presented in the CSR Committee and adopted by the company’s management. This action plan includes the installation of energy-efficient production hall lighting, savings in compressed air supply, pump systems, and ventilation. It also includes optimisation of our cold and cooling water systems, building improvements, and heating improvements. £ Based on 2010, we reduced our direct and indirect energy-related greenhouse gas Other signiﬁcant air emissions emissions per €1 million in revenue by 28.7%.

In our Rosenheim plant, improved dosing and application methods in place since December 2015 have enabled us to reduce the amount of paint applied. £ We expect them to also reduce our emissions of VOCs. If this project is successful, we will expand the technology to the paint shops in the remaining KRONES plants. ENVIRONMENTAL | REDUCING POLLUTION AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 87 Other indirect emissions Work-related travel by our employees and freight forwarding of our machines and lines are currently the biggest sources of upstream and downstream emissions. That is due to our export-focused business model. A large share of sales and project planning activity is done from Germany for target regions. For these activities, our employees travel by air, rail, and car. We determine the CO2 emissions from travel on the basis of data provided by the respective carriers or vehicle manufacturers, with the exception of rail travel because Germany’s rail provider’s passenger travel is carbon neutral. Most of our machines and lines are produced in Germany and 74% are forwarded by rail and sea freight. Emissions from work-related travel further reduced With respect to work-related travel, we aimed to further reduce employee travel and pass some tasks on to employees at our international sites. As a result, we were able to reduce our CO2 emissions resulting from work-related travel. £ By reducing the number of miles flown by employees by 1.6% year-on-year, we also reduced CO₂ emissions by 1.4%. £ CO₂ emissions from our fleet of company cars and pool vehicles as well as vehicles ENVIRONMENTAL belonging to our mobility services providers came in 4.1% lower than in 2014. Continuously reducing CO2 emissions from our vehicle fleet was also a topic of negotiation with our mobility services provider. £ At the start of 2016, we set a cap for CO₂ emissions from our pool vehicles, which is binding for all vehicles used and therefore also influences our service provider’s choice of vehicle models. Reducing truck traffic with rail connection For 2015 we had announced that we would further improve rail access for loads leaving our Neutraubling plant by building our own rail connection, eliminating the need for most of the truck transports to the container terminal in Regensburg. £ The new rail connection was completed in March 2016. Thus, a reduction in the number of road-to-rail transports from our Neutraubling plant will become apparent in the figures for road freight in 2016. £ Based on initial calculations, we expect truck traffic at our Neutraubling site to be reduced by around 1,600 truckloads in 2016. Avoiding air freight as much as possible is a key factor in our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. £ In 2015, we were able to keep the volume of outgoing air freight low, with 227 truckloads bound for the air cargo terminal (previous year: 206).

Our global presence necessitates a high volume of employee travel. The size of projects alone and the requisite contact with customers makes employee travel by air or car an inevitable part of our business model. So, we started looking for ways to mitigate our environmental impact despite this volume of travel. And we came up with the idea of establishing an upper limit for CO2 emissions from our vehicle fleet. We had also received some suggestions along these lines from employees. That shows that our employees are thinking about the impact of their travel. ENVIRONMENTAL How was the idea developed with How did you determine these upper Caroline Stuhldreher, Central Production and Logistics, Forwarding Department, the mobility service provider? limits for fuel consumption and CO2 Travel Projects emissions?

In addition to efficiency gains with respect to processing times, our new investments in laser machining centres have yielded benefits in terms of material efficiency and a reduction in waste that must be disposed of. £ At the end of 2015, a new laser machining centre went into operation at the Rosenheim plant. The potential for material savings at the Rosenheim plant is estimated to be around 5%. Improvements to production facilities usually also involve the use of materials and supplies. £ The newly installed cleaning system for semi-finished products at the Rosenheim plant will reduce consumption of phosphate for conversion coating by more than 50%. We will continue to reduce the cycles for wash water exchange by a factor of four. Our people are important sources of inspiration for improving our use of resources. The Brainpool portal is used on an ongoing basis to propose ways to simplify and imENVIRONMENTAL prove our manufacturing processes. Usually, employees submitting suggestions have their own workflows in mind but the changes they propose often result in significant material savings. £ In 2015, for example, innovative ideas enabled us to achieve considerable material savings on one of our inspection models. A new collection station for waste and recyclables has been in operation at our Neutraubling plant since mid-2015. There, the different types of waste can be temporarily stored, properly and securely, until a suitable volume of the individual materials is reached for cost-effective disposal. £ The collection station, with an area of around 360 m², also offers facilities for storing environmentally harmful materials in accordance with current regulations.

Close, long-term relationships with customers in the beverage industry worldwide have been another important aspect in our company’s development since its founding. Here, too, our people are the key to our success. For this reason, aspects relating to strong, forward-thinking workforce development hold spots very high up on our materiality matrix. Especially important factors include balanced workforce structure (diversity), attractive working conditions at our German sites and worldwide, and ongoing professional development for employees in Germany and in the regions. High safety standards worldwide and increased efforts to keep our employees healthy also rank high on the list. Fundamental principles of our human resources strategy Our growth targets are laid out in our Value strategy and also serve as the basis for all of our human resources objectives. In addition, we view our relationship with all employees as a partnership and are guided by the principles of the UN Global Compact and International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards. Of course, compliance with the law and internationally recognised minimum standards of decent work is imperative in all of our actions in Germany and at our international sites. Works agreements and dedicated internal programmes relating to specific topics complement this framework. Close cooperation between Germany and our international sites All employee-related activities for KRONES AG are managed by our central Human Resources and Social Affairs team, who also support our regional organisations with local human resources development. The local management teams conduct workforce development largely independently on the basis of agreed planning objectives. LABOUR PRACTICES We are currently developing an integration cluster for the group’s German subsidiaries that will define and structure individual HR duties and responsibilities for any companies that are established in the future. We develop the key topics for our company’s forward-looking model in close collaboration with our employee representatives. Third-party review of our working The goals established under Value serve as our guide as we continually review our conditions and labour practices by way of a SMETA audit has conﬁrmed management activities in terms of HR and social policy.

Workforce growth at our offices worldwide is the responsibility of the local management. If needed, we may send in an HR expert from Germany to support the process and develop our brand as an employer locally. We have work to do in developing a framework for replacing the growing number of employees age 55 and older who will be retiring in the years ahead. £ We have launched a talent pool programme for this purpose. A comprehensive plan is in the works for to ensure replacements for retiring employees at the management level and in our commercial departments. In addition to this plan, we will step up outside recruiting of new talent and, as appropriate, permanently hire trainees and apprentices upon their completion of their programmes. We now view the reduction in temporary workers that was planned in 2013 as overly ambitious. The reason we did not achieve the target defined in a works agreement was the extremely good development of our business. The ability to quickly integrate temporary workers into our processes to handle the increased volume instead of outsourcing work is an important aspect of our flexibility. £ In 2015, we fulfilled our promise to permanently hire 100 of our temporary workers. Another 41 temporary workers were hired into permanent positions after responding to internal job postings within KRONES AG. £ Because the pay structure for our temporary workers is analogous to the general pay structure for KRONES employees, we are certain that we offer our temporary workforce good terms. LABOUR PRACTICES £ Because many employees will be retiring in the years ahead, temporary workers are an important factor allowing us to respond flexibly to market demands. We always welcome applications from temporary workers in response to internal job postings. We invest considerable energy into recruiting female employees. These efforts are successful across all non-technical fields. However, because a large portion of our activities is technical, our workforce is still unbalanced with respect to the share of women. £ Our hiring practices continue to be guided by the expectation that equally qualified female employees be given preference over male applicants. We are also continuing our efforts to recruit female apprentices and trainees.

We have also established a pay policy at our offices abroad that is appropriate to the relevant markets. Long-term partnership with our employees KRONES is committed to long-term partnership with its employees and has made this commitment binding in an agreement with employee representatives. £ The current works agreement, which is effective through 2018, prohibits lay-offs. £ In order to foster a high level of staff loyalty and qualifications as we develop our international sites, we have launched a second project for professional training and education besides our existing programme in China. Since October 2015, we have operated a new training centre at our East Africa LCS Centre near Nairobi, Kenya, under a public-private partnership. The training offered there follows a dual training and education model, combining practical vocational training with academic study, and is an important milestone for the development of specialist expertise. £ We have found that the dual training model – which includes an apprenticeship allowance throughout the training – requires some explanation on the international market as opposed to the “fast cash” to be earned at unskilled jobs.

Our Code of Conduct stipulates that LABOUR PRACTICES There, we have stipulated fair and appropriate working conditions for employees at we do not tolerate any form of discrimination and that applicants all of our sites. and employees must be hired and £ KRONES AG employees are paid on the basis of a recognition agreement with promoted solely on the basis of their qualiﬁcations.

The Works Council Constitution Act (BetrVG) stipulates that employees be informed. It states that company management must provide information in a timely manner, as soon as changes are decided that are relevant to employees. At KRONES, communication between management and employee representatives is very cooperative and so we are generally already part of the decisionmaking process. That means that we are able to bring the concerns and interests of employees to the table long in advance of strategic decisions.

Apart from training our own apprentices, we are also able to provide technical training for customers and continuing education for our own service technicians. High level of employee loyalty worldwide 113 Taking our employees’ different lifestyles into account is a key component of our human resources policy. KRONES AG employees have long-term flextime accounts in addition to their standard working time accounts and the opportunity to take a sabbatical, both of which allow them a variety of means for adapting their working time to their individual life circumstances. These options are complemented by a host of employee benefits that go above and beyond those required by law. These opportunities were launched many years ago and serve to enhance employee satisfaction. We see the consistently low rate of employee turnover at our German sites as proof that we are considering the needs of our employees in terms of structuring their work time and employee benefits. £ Employee turnover at our international sites has also improved over the previous year. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that higher turnover is characteristic of the labour markets there. Flexible working Flexible organisation of working time remains an important aspect within our human resources policy. £ Of course, our HR policy includes compliance with legal provisions on granting parental leave. In addition, long-term flextime accounts give our employees the freedom to adapt their working hours and schedules to meet their other personal needs. £ We offer employees the option of partial retirement to gradually reduce their time spent at work before they reach retirement age. In 2015, 282 employees – or 3.6% of our workforce – were in partial retirement (previous year: 3.7%). LABOUR PRACTICES New job postings within the company are also available for temporary workers to see. That gives temporary workers employed under the German Labour Leasing Act (Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz) the opportunity to apply for permanent positions within KRONES AG. £ The number of new hires includes 141 temporary workers who were taken into permanent employment in accordance with a works agreement.

Our first major focus will be on our research and development team. £ Our training portal, which all employees can access through the KRONES Intranet, currently contains around 700 training and continuing education courses. In addition, we also offer e-learning opportunities, in which we had around 12,000 participants in 2015. Of those, around 50% were at our international sites. £ Around 60 management-level employees from our sites in Germany (previous year: 105) and around 60 attendees from our offices worldwide (previous year: 50) received further training under our management development programme. Current topics such as “managing in the matrix” and “diversity” were covered to complement the leadership workshop. Feedback tracking was stepped up further following LABOUR PRACTICES reorganisation. The programme started with 80 senior managers. Safeguarding our future with in-house training and education Training young talent in our own vocational training centre is an important part of our forward-looking human resources strategy. We view this in-house vocational training programme as a key to safeguarding our future and as a contribution to our company’s social responsibility. £ Apprentices in their third year of vocational training and participants in our dual course of vocational training and university study have the opportunity to work in one of our offices abroad for a time. Seven young people took this opportunity in 2015. LABOUR PRACTICES AND DECENT WORK | TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 117 The vocational training programmes cover the skills needed within our company. One focus will be on developing our training programmes internationally. £ A new addition to our vocational training programme is a trainee programme for employees at our Taicang, China, site. The programme is geared towards university graduates and provides for them to remain employed at our Chinese site after completing the programme. The first group of applicants started the 15-month programme in April 2016. We permanently hired 127 trainees and apprentices upon completion of their vocational training in 2015 (previous year: 119). £ Given the large and growing share of older employees at KRONES AG, we view the young people being trained and educated in our own shop as an important factor for sustainable human resources management as they ensure a supply of young talent to replace retirees. £ KRONES seeks to provide a high standard of training at our international sites. A programme operated in collaboration with the University in Wuhan, China, has been running for several years. KRONES has now launched an apprenticeship programme in Kenya as well. The first nine trainees are going through the programme, which follows the dual model of vocational training and university study that is used in Germany. At the end of the programme, these skilled workers will then work as mechatronics technicians at the East Africa LCS Centre.

Our activities are based on the provisions of laws governing occupational safety. At the international level, they are based on ILO standards. At the national level, they take into account laws and rules set forth by the carriers of statutory accident insurance (workman’s compensation). In addition to these rules, we have made voluntary commitments within our Code of Conduct and have in place procedures that are certified in accordance with the OHSAS standard. Works agreements and cooperative consultation with employee representatives guide our daily actions in the interest of ensuring a high level of safety in the workplace and promoting the good health of our employees. Staying healthy at work We support our employees in their day-to-day work and analyse their needs through several different channels: Occupational safety is evaluated through workplace inspections, analysis of possible hazards, and incident analyses. These tasks are executed by the occupational safety team within human resources in collaboration with the relevant managers. Another pillar of our precautionary measures is offering comprehensive care to our employees through our in-house medical service, social counselling service, and our own company health insurance fund. Monitoring of our occupational safety activities is done as prescribed in the OHSAS process, thus ensuring standardised procedures. We conduct regular occupational safety reviews and determine occupational hazard problem areas in the individual plants with the help of the occupational safety team. We then take targeted meaLABOUR PRACTICES sures to remedy the situation. Our in-house medical service employs two doctors and six assistants at our Neutraubling site. In addition, each plant has a doctor who is on duty part-time and a full-time medical assistant. The LCS Centres also draw on support from the medical service in Neutraubling in their work to promote the good health of their employees. LABOUR PRACTICES AND DECENT WORK | OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 121 Effective health management Developing a health management system remains an objective to which we will be Educating our young employees dedicating considerable attention in the short and medium terms.

Around 60 We are continually developing and introducing concrete measures for protecting apprentices took part in the event employee health. in 2015. £ We launched smoking rules in specific areas of our production facilities in Neutraubling under a pilot programme in 2015. Beginning in the second quarter of 2016, across-the-board rules for protecting non-smokers will be implemented at all of our German sites. £ A new dialogue format at our Nittenau site is helping to increase employee involvement in developing health programmes. We plan to establish a health panel there, which will enable employees to generate themes relating to all aspects of workplace health. Workplace rehabilitation management (WRM) is a continuous process by which long-term sick employees are reintegrated into the workplace in accordance with the requirements of the German Social Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch). £ Improved processes tailored to the individual cases helped even more employees return to work after long-term sickness once again in 2015. Under this programme, we established suitable opportunities that are adapted to the needs of 27 employees (previous year: 24). £ On average, long-term sick employees rehabilitated under the WRM programme LABOUR PRACTICES were unable to work for 209.9 days in 2015. Once the process improvements were completed, the average number of lost days was reduced to 16.62 days. The average age of employees in the WRM programme is 44 years.

LABOUR PRACTICES AND DECENT WORK | OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 124 Effective occupational safety management A high level of occupational safety is crucial in our daily practices. In each plant, we involve a group of experts who handle all topics relating to occupational safety and provide intensive employee education. The responsibilities are defined in our BS OHSAS 18001 documentation. Evaluating the rules for occupational safety is the purview of the occupational safety committees, which integrate the Works Council and therefore represent the entire workforce. The concerns of the occupational safety committees are handled at the level of division managers and managers of our business lines. Employee participation in regular training and education sessions is scheduled by the respective managers on their own responsibility. Occupational safety rules also apply to our IMS-certified sites abroad. Thus, 10,503 of our employees are covered by certified occupational safety rules. That is around 79% of our total workforce. We increased the involvement of employees, experts, and company doctors in assessing workplace hazards in 2015. £ The new system this group has developed for hazard assessment will give us a better way of evaluating workplaces and their potential hazards. Workplace conditions and our production employees’ personal equipment are reviewed in close collaboration with the Works Council. £ That also includes ensuring that employees have the proper safety gear. The provision and design of protective equipment is governed by law in Germany. A strong network of first responders supports our occupational safety efforts. £ Around 995 first responders at our German sites stand ready to provide rapid LABOUR PRACTICES response and assistance at work. They make up around 10% of our workforce. Another 300 employees are currently on the waiting list for first responder training. These figures put KRONES well above the level required by Germany’s employers’ liability insurance association. In all, we have recorded 23 different types of injuries in our statistics on work-related accidents. There were no work-related fatalities in 2015. £ Because our production processes involve numerous manual and machineassisted process steps, injuries to fingers and arms are the most common. The three most frequently reported injury types relate to fingers, arms, and feet.

A consensus-oriented approach to issues is a natural part of our company policy. With it, we develop trust and understanding. It also allows us to benefit from stakeholders’ suggestions and incorporate stakeholders’ concerns into our decision-making at an early stage. This cooperative approach is also part of our Code of Conduct and therefore an integral part of our daily work. We rely on our KRONES CSR teams having direct contact with the relevant stakeholder groups. We also involve representatives of certain stakeholder groups in our CSR Committee, who are then able to efficiently share their ideas with us. In this way, we receive important ideas and suggestions on a regular basis that we are able to use in our CSR activities and in our boards’ work. In addition, we also share information as required by law, for instance as part of our financial reporting and in planning and implementing construction projects. Besides these mandatory disclosures, we also maintain open communications through other channels, thereby establishing a high level of transparency about our company’s strategy and direction. We have a budget available for executing our social responsibilities that is managed by our charitable giving committee in accordance with our charitable giving and sponsorship policy. An important point here is that we do not contribute to any political parties. Our tools and channels for dialogue with stakeholders are as follows: n Open days n Participation in university job fairs n Visits from political decision-makers n Memberships in associations n Communication through social media n Participation in conferences n Dialogue with investors n Internal information platforms SOCIETY We attribute our success to mindful communication with our stakeholders. At the same time, we are aware that we could go even deeper. Our CSR Workshop on Society aspects made us aware that we need to even better address ideas brought to us by stakeholders. As a result of the workshop, we will be developing strategies in the medium-term to further improve our integration of societal aspects.

We attach great importance to communicating with the individual stakeholder groups as directly as possible with customised communication frameworks. Thus, our individual departments define appropriate platforms and time frames for exchange with stakeholder groups themselves. Keeping employees informed: key to trust-based collaboration Keeping our employees in the loop has long been standard practice at KRONES. One way that we keep our employees informed is the employee magazine, KRONES world, which is published three times a year and provides a broad overview of happenings KRONES. Regular plant tours are an important part of our communication efforts. The tours are aimed primarily at our employees and their families but are also used to familiarise other groups with KRONES’ production facilities. £ We will continue to offer these tours in 2016. £ To mark the 60th anniversary of our Rosenheim site, the local plant management organised a Family Day, in which employees led their families through the plant, showing them the production facilities and their own workstations. Fast, comprehensive information is the purpose of KRONES inside. Our internal platform for communication and information was completely revamped in 2015 nd now also incorporates the LCS Centres worldwide. £ KRONES’ increasing internationalisation prompted us to redesign the information platform. Now, all of the LCS Centres have Intranet specialists whose job it is to ensure that KRONES inside covers topics of relevance to employees at our international sites. In all, eleven site coordinators are responsible for the Intranet’s regional content worldwide. Exchange with policy-makers and associations Policy-makers also need a good base of information for their work. KRONES fosters communication with policy-makers and offers plant tours and background talks to give them a look into the needs of business. SOCIETY £ In 2015, Bavarian State Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, Emilia Müller, visited KRONES to learn about our sustainability policy, Bavarian Finance Minister Dr. Markus Söder visited our Taicang plant to learn about our production facility in China, and Albert Füracker, State Secretary of Bavaria’s Department of Finance, visited our subsidiary KONPLAN in Pilsen to learn about cooperation between the Czech Republic and Bavaria. SOCIETY | IMPROVED STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE 133 Independent of our communication with policy-makers, we also contribute to opinion-making on industry-specific topics through memberships in associations. £ The most important membership for us is our engagement in the German Engineering Federation (VDMA). We participate in exchange across industries through our involvement in the Federation’s trade association for food processing and packaging machinery. Depending on the topics at hand, our Executive Board will also sometimes make a public statement to contribute to opinion-making. £ Chairman of the Executive Board Volker Kronseder served as the Deputy Chairman of the trade association in 2015 and supported its work with his expertise on the development of the packaging machinery market worldwide for VDMA members. £ Our presence within the German Brewers Federation (DBB) and the German Brewer and Malting Association are similarly important factors determining perceptions of our company within the industry. £ We do not have representatives in governmental organisations and are not involved in lobbying activities. We also do not make donations to any political parties or organisations related to political parties. Informing customers and shareholders We keep our customers informed by way of direct contact and a comprehensive presentation of our products and services on the KRONES website. We also use our website to keep our shareholders informed. The Investor Relations section of the site provides shareholders with all relevant information, up-to-date and in accordance with the provisions of the laws applicable to stock corporations. Sustainability information is published on our website under “Sustainability” and therefore also available to customers and shareholders. £ Communication with analysts regarding our sustainability rating gives us an independent assessment of our sustainability activities, which helps us review our own actions and options. External review of our performance is always helpful. It enables us to identify potential for improvement and compare our performance with that of other companies. Our website has also undergone a similar comparison. SOCIETY £ In a study conducted by the analysis and consulting firm ServiceValue on “customer-oriented websites”, KRONES’ ranked 24th among the websites of 253 listed companies. For the ranking, analysts reviewed the websites’ customer and userfriendliness. The rating is based on academic research conducted on the topic of customer value at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland.

SOCIETY SOCIETY | SUSTAINABLE CHARITABLE GIVING AND SPONSORING ACTIVITIES 137 Fast, unbureaucratic assistance Ms. Resch, you are a member of the charitable giving committee. What are your responsibilities there? Our monthly meetings give me a detailed overview of the requests KRONES receives for assistance. As the link to the Executive Board and representative of the CEO, I am able to pass that information on. That is important because it enables us to give the Executive Board a picture of how we are perceived and integrated within society. On the other hand, it is also important to the charitable giving committee team to be able to make decisions quickly when things come up that would exceed our usual volume of giving.

SOCIETY SOCIETY | SUSTAINABLE CHARITABLE GIVING AND SPONSORING ACTIVITIES 138 Use of industry knowledge and research ﬁndings Our membership in professional and career-related associations and collaboration with universities give our employees access to the latest knowledge and findings. This cooperation includes internship opportunities for students and collaboration with graduates on their theses. £ In 2015, we provided 269 thesis-writing opportunities and 634 internships. Forward-thinking projects often arise from collaborations with universities and research institutions. One such example is our cooperation with the Technical University of Munich. £ Through our participation in the packaging technology department’s Robofill 4.0 project, KRONES is also supporting activities associated with the technological changes arising from Industry 4.0 (the Internet of Things). Close contact with students and professors Our membership in the initiatives of various universities and universities of applied sciences enables us to forge close relationships with students and faculty, which in turn help us integrate the latest findings into our own developments. £ In 2015, we were involved with 19 different initiatives of universities and industrial research groups. Our regular participation in job fairs at universities and elsewhere gives us a constant presence among young talent and helps us recruit graduates and thus bring the latest knowledge into the company. £ In 2015, we took part in 72 recruiting events, which included job fairs and field trips.
