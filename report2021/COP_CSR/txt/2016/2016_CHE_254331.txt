Global Compact Communication on Progress and GRI Content Index referencing sustainability report 2015 Message from the CEO Long-term values 100 years of innovation for the benefit of our customers, employees, shareholders and the community – that is the hallmark of Datwyler companies. Building on our strong roots, we have developed our own style with high standards and unique values: We are entrepreneurs. We bring value to our customers. We excel in what we do. We have respect for others. These values guide the way we run our business over the long term. We used our 100th anniversary in 2015 as an opportunity to consolidate awareness amongst our employees worldwide of our values and how they have evolved over time. We strive to deliver sustainable profitable growth for the benefit of our stakeholders as the foundation for adding long-term value and preserving the corporate independence of Datwyler Cabling Solutions. Since end of 2012, Datwyler Cabling Solutions belongs to the Pema Holding Inc. with its headquarters in Altdorf, Switzerland. Pema Holding has been the majority shareholder of the stock quoted Dätwyler Holding Inc. for many years. We voluntarily adopted the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)* for the sustainability section of our 2008 Annual Report (as part of the Datwyler Group), and in 2009 we joined the UN Global Compact (as part of the Datwyler Group). This is an initiative launched by the United Nations which espouses ten principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and combating corruption. In 2013, Datwyler Cabling Solutions joined the UN Global Compact as an indendent company and obligated itself to follow the ten principles and to accept its responsibility within society. In the 2015 reporting year, the second independent progress report on the ten UN Global Compact principles will be published. This endeavour is based on the values and the Code of Conduct that lay down globally binding rules for all Datwyler Cabling Solutions employees. As far as our suppliers are concerned, we have set out our requirements in a dedicated code of conduct since the beginning of 2014. The systematic customer satisfaction surveys were continued in 2015. The next employee satisfaction survey will be conducted in autumn of 2016. In this way we live up to our social responsibility every day as a reliable partner to our stakeholders.

Together with the information compiled in this detailed GRI Content Index, the sustainability report meets the requirements for Application Level C.

By adopting these Guidelines, Datwyler is seeking to provide its stakeholders with comprehensive and transparent information on the company’s sustainability focus. The GRI Content Index below shows where to locate specific information in the sustainability report. GRI requires a number of organisational profile disclosures (see sections 1 to 4 of the table). Core GRI performance indicators are shown in black type, while additional indicators that GRI has identified as possibly being relevant to an organisation’s reporting are shown in grey type.
