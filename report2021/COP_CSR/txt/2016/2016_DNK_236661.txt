Moranti Group has a clear Corporate Governance model where all employees, customers and suppliers are encouraged to follow the Ten principles of Global Compact. Within our own operation we have education schemes, self-assessments as well as audits to ensure that we constantly meet the requirements. Our suppliers have to sign a document confirming that they meet the requirements. It is our firm belief, that the Ten principles within Global Compact make a difference within trusted corporations and provide sustainable Governance to a better world. Martin Rahbek President and CEO Moranti Group May 2016
