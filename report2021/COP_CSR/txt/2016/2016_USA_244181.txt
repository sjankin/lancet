MORRISON Dear Campbell Stakeholders, At Campbell, our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — has fundamentally altered how we think, talk and act about our food, from farm to table: from how our food is grown and the ingredients we select, to how we prepare our foods and the types of brands in our portfolio. For nearly 150 years, Campbell has made real food and real experiences that connect our consumers to each other and to the world around them. People trust us to provide foods and drinks that are good, honest, authentic and flavorful — made from ingredients that are grown, prepared and cooked or baked with care. And, now more than ever, consumers expect brands to be That’s also what led to the creation of www. socially responsible, serve a purpose in their lives, reflect whatsinmyfood.com, where we provide detailed their values and beliefs, and make a difference in the information for top products, such as our iconic world. Moreover, they want companies like ours to be Campbell’s Condensed Tomato and Chicken Noodle authentic and open, particularly about how and where soups. It is a big step toward being even more open their food is made, why certain ingredients are used and and honest with our consumers — about what goes how those ingredients are produced and sourced. into our food, about how we make our food and about the choices behind the ingredients we use.

I truly believe it is the right thing to do for consumers and for our business. STRATEGY | 8 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Strategy “In January 2016, we became the first major food company to call for a mandatory national labeling standard for products that may contain genetically modified organisms (GMO).” We depend on sustainable agriculture, clean water and a resilient supply chain to produce the crops and ingredients needed to make our food. Indeed, our commitment to sustainable agriculture is literally part of our roots. We are the largest carrot grower in North America, and many of our tomatoes come from generations of American family farmers who have been in our network for more than 100 years. We strive to support those farms and farming families, and they in turn, year after year, continue to help us serve our consumers who rely on our products for their own moments that matter. I thank you for your interest in our company, and our commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. When you read through this report, I hope that you are as inspired as I am by what our employees are doing to ensure that we strive unerringly for sustainable, responsible operations every day, and I invite you to let us know what you think at csr_feedback@campbellsoup.com. As the leader of Campbell Soup Company, I know we can make a profit and make a difference, and we are doing both through our business and by living our Purpose in a way that’s authentic, that’s transparent and that truly matters.

PRODUCTS | 23 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue HEALTH, NUTRITION & AWARENESS Why It Matters Our Purpose — Real food that matters for life’s moments — guides how we think about nutrition and health. It is our North Star amidst today’s dramatically shifting food landscape. As a key voice in the food industry, we must ensure that our products are relevant and meet the expectations of our nutrition-savvy consumers, who are increasingly demanding healthier and fresher food with minimal artificial ingredients and processing. It is imperative for Campbell to stay abreast of changes in food and nutrition to better understand how we can provide our customers with the healthy food they desire and thus identify the opportunities we have for growth. In 2015, the food world continued to shift in unprecedented ways. These changes are reshaping the way food is grown, made, marketed, sold and consumed. In turn, an evolving food and nutrition landscape is fundamentally altering the way we think, talk and act about our products. We know that if we don’t evolve with these trends, we will not be able to thrive as a food company. Some of the trends influencing our food and nutrition strategy are: Rise in Chronic Diseases According to the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, rates of chronic diseases related to poor-quality diet and physical inactivity have increased, with half of all U.S. adults having one or more preventable, diet-related chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overweight and obesity. Heightened Consumer Interest in Fresh and Healthy Foods Consumer interest in health and wellness is growing as they recognize the role diet plays in health and well-being. They are demanding healthier, more “real foods,” which we define as foods with fewer artificial ingredients and minimal processing. Consumers are increasingly seeking fresh, natural, organic products and those made with ingredients they recognize. They are telling us to avoid artificial preservatives, colors and flavors and are seeking products with vegetables, whole grains and other components associated with good health. Intersection of Health and Technology We refer to the increased fusion of health and technology as society becoming “wired for well-being,” and it will have a profound impact on consumers’ food choices. People will soon make decisions about what to eat or what PRODUCTS | 24 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products not to eat based on individual needs. Consumers are already leading “quantified lives” — tracking their activities and fitness through “wearables” that measure aspects of their overall health. The emerging trend in this area is biomonitoring. We’re seeing it in health care and medicine, and it is only a matter of time before it impacts the food industry. In the future, consumers will no longer wonder about the “right food” for them because bio-sensors will scan their metabolism and recommend the “right” diets. Our consumers are also increasingly using digital tools to shop and share their opinions about food. People love to socialize about the food they cook, shop for and eat. They take photos of their food and share, like and comment on their friends’ experiences through social media. This creates interesting opportunities for Campbell that we’re actively exploring. Consumer Demand for Greater Transparency Consumers today are savvy and have greater expectations of food companies to disclose how and where their food is made, which ingredients are used and how those ingredients are produced and sourced. In its 2015 Global Annual Review, PWC cited food integrity and transparency as one of four colliding megatrends, noting: “High profile contamination, adulteration and fraud incidents in the US, Europe and Asia have eroded public trust in the food industry, raising consumer awareness of food quality and ensuing safety risks. There is growing demand for higher quality food and transparency of food ingredients, origins and production processes, especially among the world’s growing urban middle class.” How We Manage Consumer demand and these evolving food trends, along with an industry call for greater transparency, were key drivers behind our decision to take a step back and give our nutrition strategy a refresh. In FY2015, we outlined our new corporate Strategic Imperatives, which included expanding our business in the areas of fresh and well-being. To help meet our new Strategic Imperatives, we implemented a major restructuring of the company. By reorganizing our business to prioritize food categories rather than regions, health and wellbeing became even more embedded into our products and overall corporate responsibility strategy. We will continue to accelerate growth in our Campbell Fresh division and expand into new categories in the packaged fresh category, as evidenced by our recent acquisition of Garden Fresh Gourmet. We aspire, with this new approach, to make Campbell even more synonymous with real and better-for-you foods in the future. Moving forward, Campbell will continue to evolve its health and wellness strategies and policies to reflect these consumer demands. Currently, we are doing this by: • measuring our progress; • expanding our healthy product portfolio; and • engaging and educating our consumers. PRODUCTS | 25 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Our Progress In order to ensure that our products reflect the latest Measuring Progress nutrition findings and consumer demands, we lean on We know that this is a journey, and we must set goals the expertise of our nutrition and health stakeholders and make progress against them each year.

At the same time, we pursue positive nutrition by increasing vegetables, whole grains, and other food components or nutrients underconsumed in the diet.

PRODUCTS | 28 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Engaging and Educating Our Consumers We believe we have a responsibility to engage and inform our consumers about health and nutrition as it relates to our products so they can make food decisions that are good for their health and the well-being of their families. To help them make informed decisions, we present our consumers with a variety of tools and resources — on-package, online and through other communication channels. IMPLEMENTING HEALTH RATINGS Most importantly, when a product is in hand, we ensure that DOWN UNDER the item contains simple language or obvious markers to help As part of our global commitment to health and consumers identify health criteria. Consumers can also feel wellness and a long-standing history of providing confident that any health claim made on the label is backed by our consumers with clear nutrition information to stringent criteria developed by third-party experts. For instance, help inform choices, our Arnott’s brand, one of all of our products claiming to be “healthy” are required to meet Australia’s largest biscuit and snack producers, the FDA nutritional criteria. has begun progressively implementing a voluntary Health Star Rating (HSR) that was approved by In 2015, we continued to engage with consumers in a number the Australian Federal Government in June 2014. of ways to empower them with nutritional know-how and meal We are currently determining the best way to planning, including: integrate the HSR system with existing on-pack • A weekly Meal-Mail newsletter electronically delivers meal ideas information across the entire Arnott’s range, but and recipes to more than 650,000 busy U.S. customers. products displaying the HSR are already starting to appear on shelf. • Campbell’s Kitchen website (www.campbellskitchen.com) offers consumers quick, easy, delicious recipes along with timesaving tips and coupon savings. • Cook with Campbell’s website (www.cookwithcampbells.ca) connects on-the-go Canadian consumers with simple meal planning and preparation ideas.

By understanding and immersing themselves into these consumers’ lives, CCID can identify meaningful and lasting ways to connect them with Campbell’s brands, and those insights can help fuel innovation. In order to make products that continue to meet changing tastes and needs around nutrition, our team is focused on knowing consumers in each part of their journey at every stage of the day — especially before they get to the last-minute question of “what do you want to eat?” PRODUCTS | 29 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Changing Recipes for the Better In FY2015, based on feedback from parents, we simplified the recipes of our existing Campbell’s Condensed kids’ soups and removed MSG, while continuing to make the soups without artificial preservatives, colors or flavors. Currently, 98 percent of our portfolio is free of artificial or added preservatives, colors and flavors. We also announced plans to remove any remaining artificial colors and flavors from all of our products in North America by the end of FY2018. Additionally, we created the NO GO list: NO artificial flavors or colors; NO added preservatives; NO MSG; NO high-fructose corn syrup. None of these ingredients will be used, moving forward, in any new product we’re creating in our Americas division. Extending Our Fresh Options We continue to grow our better-for-you portfolio through strategic acquisitions. In 2015 we acquired Garden Fresh Gourmet, another milestone in our efforts to increase our presence and sales in the packaged fresh category. Garden Fresh Gourmet makes the number-one branded refrigerated salsa in the U.S., along with hummus, dips and tortilla chips. This acquisition is another milestone in reshaping our portfolio toward fastergrowing categories. Garden Fresh Gourmet’s on-trend products will allow the Campbell Fresh division to expand in the deli section of the grocery store perimeter and will complement our strong presence in the produce section. This is the latest in a series of moves we have made in response to increased consumer interest in fresh foods and health and well-being, first with the acquisition of Bolthouse Farms followed by the acquisition of Plum. Garden Fresh Gourmet is part of the Campbell Fresh division, which leverages the Bolthouse Farms refrigerated platform. Packaged fresh foods represent a $19+ billion category that grew 4.9 percent in the past year, above the industry average. Organic Gets the Spotlight Organic eating is a priority for many Americans, and we want to make sure that those who choose to eat organic — no matter where they live — have options that are both authentic and delicious. We live in a food culture where consumers are increasingly seeking foods that are made with simple, natural and organic ingredients. According to the Organic Trade Association, 81 percent of U.S. families already choose organic foods at least some of the time, and more than half of consumers ages 18 to 29 are actively trying to include organic foods in their diet. To meet this growing demand, we increased our organic offerings with line extensions in our core portfolio. In early 2015, we launched Campbell’s Organic, a line of six premium, ready-to-eat soups, which includes vegetarian and gluten-free varieties. Building off this momentum, we also introduced three organic kids’ soups, Mega Noodle, Chicken and Stars and Disney Princess Frozen. These soups are non-GMO and use ingredients sourced from certified American Organic farms. We also expanded the Plum line of organic food for babies, tots and kids, launching 29 new organic meals and snacks in the U.S. and expanding the brand to Canada. YOU ARE WHAT YOU POST In 2015, Bolthouse Farms challenged consumers to a “Fruit and Veggie Takeover” of the Internet. This consumer engagement project resulted from a survey of what food images people share on social media. On this journey to track the health of the Internet, we found that on average, there were more than 1.7 million food hashtags used each day. Of those hashtags, only 37 percent were of fruits and veggies, with the majority composed of foods like bacon, pizza and donuts. The Takeover was intended to shift this imbalance and put fruit and veggies in the social media spotlight. By changing the foods posted online, we can inspire healthier eating habits offline. During March, Bolthouse Farms challenged consumers to participate for one week to help reach the goal of one million “healthy” images per day by posting and tagging fruit and veggies using the #urwhatupost hashtag. PRODUCTS | 30 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue TRANSPARENCY Why It Matters The food industry is in the midst of revolutionary change. Changing demographics, socioeconomic shifts and digital connectivity are forcing the industry to adapt and evolve. One of the most pervasive shifts is around transparency. Consumers are seeking transparency in all areas of their lives, driven by an inherent distrust in large institutions. This distrust has been accelerated by digital connectivity where information and debate are available in one click. For the food industry this translates into consumers’ desire to know what’s in the food they buy, where it is made and how the food is produced. A new generation of consumers is seeking food that better aligns with their values, and is authentic, natural and wholesome. And, they expect a level of transparency at each step of the supply chain — from farm to table. Campbell believes that providing easy access to this information builds consumer trust — something we have invested in doing for more than 145 years. In this new era of transparency, we are on a journey to be open and honest about our business and earn the trust of a new generation of consumers. How We Manage In this changing environment, Campbell’s Purpose — are most meaningful to them. Actions such as introducing Real food that matters for life’s moments — serves as mandatory GMO labeling on all products, removing our North Star. It is a filter we apply to strategic decisions artificial colors and flavors from our recipes, and and informs the way we engage with our consumers.

It has also inspired us to look at our recipes and imperatives that we feel are key to our success, one of use more of the ingredients people tell us they want, and which is transparency. We have made a commitment to less of those they would prefer to avoid.

GMO Labeling One of the most hotly debated topics within the issue of transparency in the U.S. is the labeling of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). An overwhelming majority of U.S. consumers today believe that they have the right to know what is in their food and want food companies to label GMOs on their products. There is currently no U.S. federal regulation requiring labeling to inform consumers about the presence of GMOs in their food. Campbell believes that consumers have a right to know what is in their food, and that is why we support mandatory national GMO labeling. However, we oppose a state-by-state “patchwork approach,” as we believe it is incomplete, impractical and costly to implement for food makers. PRODUCTS | 32 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue FOOD SAFETY & QUALITY Why It Matters Food safety is receiving unprecedented attention in the marketplace and in the public policy arena today. It is easy to see why: the Centers for Disease Control and Protection report that about 48 million people, or one in six Americans, suffer from food-borne illness every year; 128,000 people are hospitalized and 3,000 die. Yet foodborne illnesses are largely preventable. Food safety and quality are assumed requirements for any major food company in the industry today. It is a given that we will dedicate every resource to ensuring that our consumers are protected from foodborne illnesses, allergens or other health and safety concerns. We know that if we aren’t diligent in our food safety processes, there are significant financial and reputational implications that could be devastating. How We Manage We closely monitor our product safety throughout the We have a long history of regulatory compliance, as well entire value chain — from the moment ingredients are as quality standards and policies that are industry-leading harvested on the farm to the minute finished products and global in approach.

PRODUCTS | 34 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Products Material Issue RESPONSIBLE SOURCING Why It Matters As a global food company, we have the responsibility to ensure that the way in which we source our ingredients is both sustainable and ethical. We understand that our supply chain is key to delivering uncompromising value to our customers and consumers. We continuously seek to enhance the quality of our products and brands, not only by the ingredients we use, but also by working with suppliers who meet our responsible sourcing standards. Understanding and mitigating the environmental, economic and social risks within our supply chain is necessary to ensure our products are produced in a responsible manner. By incorporating responsible sourcing practices, we are able to mitigate negative impacts to the environment, realize economic savings, improve supplier relationships, reduce social, reputational, environmental and financial risks, and ensure long-term resiliency. How We Manage Last year, we developed a strategic approach to address This past year, as a result of the findings from our our evolving supply chains and focus on more ethical and materiality process, we have identified the need to further sustainable sourcing. Our Procurement Sustainability enhance this strategy and put additional resources in strategy focuses on the following key areas: place to address the increased expectations of both our internal and external stakeholders.

We’ve identified “hot spots” within our supply chain related to sustainability issues and are proactive with our suppliers to address these key issues. Our risk analysis model includes sustainability, financial and supply risks associated with our product categories. Currently, our most important risks are associated with the rising cost of raw materials, impacts to climate and deforestation, brand and reputational damage, business disruption, regulatory challenges and supply chain interruption. In 2015, we embedded value chain risk mapping as part of the overall purchasing manager’s category strategy. When a Campbell buyer develops their strategy for an ingredient or raw material, we develop tools to consider sustainability as part of the value-added opportunity. Our formal supply chain mapping system gives us a holistic view of our entire supply chain and shows areas of opportunity to collaborate with suppliers to improve functionality and sustainability, while driving cost savings. Managing Performance Engaging Our Suppliers Our Supplier Sustainability Scorecard captures One of the key elements of our strategy is to partner environmental performance metrics, as well as social and collaborate with our suppliers to better understand responsibility efforts, to better understand the policies sustainability issues in each category.

Follow-up again proved to be successful in 2015 by establishing audits and assessments are conducted based on the risk best practices in sustainability, cost savings and potential of supply interruption. responsible sourcing. Setting Expectations Because responsible sourcing is integral to delivering the company’s Purpose, we require our suppliers to follow environmental and social standards that are aligned with our expectations. Our Supply Base Requirements and Expectations Manual identifies the expectations and requirements for current and potential brokers, co-packers, re-packers, special packers, suppliers, warehouses and licensees to meet our CR and sustainability objectives. These standards cover a variety of critical subjects, including legal compliance, health and safety, human rights, quality, governance, animal welfare, environmental issues and employment standards. If a supplier is found to be out of compliance with the requirements, they are required to develop a formal corrective action plan — allowing Campbell to directly engage with the supply chain on responsible sourcing performance. In FY2016, we plan to revise the manual to reflect more rigorous expectations related to sustainability and ethical sourcing.

PLANET | 41 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet Material Issue SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL Why It Matters The rising global population and accelerated global development and resource use require that companies implement holistic approaches that achieve long-term social and environmental sustainability. Sustainable business models incorporate a triple bottom line approach and consider a wide range of stakeholder interests. They drive corporate innovation for sustainability and help embed sustainability into business purpose and processes. Companies that adopt this approach aspire to grow their businesses while also reducing their environmental footprints. As one of the world’s leading manufacturers of quality food and beverages, with growers and production facilities around the globe, we understand the necessity of being good stewards of the environment. Reducing the resources we use and having an environmental management system in place help us to mitigate the impacts of climate change, better manage compliance, reduce costs and increase efficiencies. The risks of not doing these things can be detrimental to a manufacturing business and can impact profitability and reputation. How We Manage Our commitment to the environment is manifested through We take a precautionary approach to the environment our sustainable business model strategies, which include by seeking to apply processes or practices with less understanding risks, setting goals and measuring progress environmental impact when possible.

PLANET | 46 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet Material Issue SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE Why It Matters A common bumper sticker in rural areas of the U.S. reads “No farms, no food.” Agriculture is indeed the root of our company and products. For 147 years, Campbell has worked closely with farmers to source high-quality ingredients for our nutritious and flavorful products. In recent decades, the growth of the global middle class and overall global population has translated into unprecedented demand for agricultural products, placing increased pressure on land, water and agriculture inputs. It is material to our company to invest in the efficiency of agricultural supply chains to ensure their resilience in an often volatile global economy. Agricultural science also indicates that, for most food products, the farm is where many significant environmental impacts are incurred. Often, crop irrigation is the largest contributor to a food product’s water footprint, and fertilizer production and use is the largest contributor to its GHG footprint. In 2016, a CR materiality assessment confirmed the importance of agriculture sustainability to Campbell, with a high percentage of stakeholders indicating its relevance. Large retail customers have also identified agriculture sustainability as being of critical importance to price and supply resiliency, as well as to meeting customer expectations. “I’ve spent a lot of time at different forums, and sustainable agriculture is the next big thing that food companies are working on. There’s a big shift happening. Customers and a desire for transparency are drivers, but as food companies we also realize that sustainability of supply reduces risk in today’s world. There’s a growing realization that agriculture represents the largest impact on natural systems, yet we need agriculture to survive. We’re starting to see a lot of organizations express an interest, for the first time, in improving farming practices. I see sustainability programs as a way to communicate to the world the progress that growers have made and the environmental benefits that come from efficiency.” Dr. Dan Sonke, Manager, Sustainable Agriculture PLANET | 47 2016 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT Planet How We Manage Our Sustainable Agriculture Program encourages Beverage and Agriculture Sector Working Group of The responsible and resilient agriculture systems to protect Sustainability Consortium.

The number of Campbell growers using drip irrigation has almost doubled in the last five years, with 60 percent of Campbell’s tomato acres currently using this type of irrigation. Using our 2012 baseline data, we are seeking to increase that number by identifying drip-irrigation opportunities across geographies. By showing individual growers how their water use compares to local/state averages, we ultimately want to help them move toward more efficient irrigation practices. In 2014 and 2015, some of our tomato farmers and our carrotgrowing operations at Bolthouse Farms were able to secure drought grant funding from the state of California to implement water-saving technologies, while also reducing GHG emissions.

Not only that, but it is recognized that ages 0 to 3 are the most critical years developmentally for children. Plum launched The Full Effect in 2013 — a produce-to-donate initiative dedicated to nourishing little ones in need throughout the U.S. The Full Effect name comes from the fundamental belief that when little ones are full of the right nutrients, they can live up to their full potential and have their full effect on the world. One of the signature initiatives of The Full Effect is a Super Smoothie pouch made with accessible organic superfoods, including fruits, vegetables and grains, that help fortify the diets of kids who don’t get regular healthy meals. In 2014, Plum launched the Super Smoothie as a buy-give product at retail — for every four-pack purchased, a Super Smoothie was donated to a little one in need. With the help of Plum’s supply chain and nonprofit partners, the company donated more than 700,000 Super Smoothies in FY2015.
