MANAGERIAL COMMITMENT Spectre is a medium sized Danish company with its roots going back to 1947. Particularly since the nineties when we started outsourcing our production to Eastern Europe, we have seen an increasing international approach on a wide range of activities: our export is close to 100%, raw materials for the production are sourced and purchased all over the world – in USA, Europe and Asia. We have four production facilities in Latvia and we just expanded with a new factory in Vietnam so we now have two. In 2010 we decided to sign up for a membership of the UN’s Global Compact to acknowledge our loyalty to the ten basic principles of the Global Compact and the areas; Human Rights, Labour, Environment and anti-corruption. We employ 800+ employees totally. Working in a labor intensive industry like garment production with the vast majority of our employees located in Latvia and Vietnam – and with many suppliers located in Asia – it has become increasingly important for us to find a structured and professional way of working with CSR. We have always had focus on good working conditions and tried to support the local community wherever we operate. As a company we believe in taking part in the responsibility for the local society. We believe that employees spending a large part of their life working for the company are to be treated with respect and dignity. In 2013 we received the SA8000 certificate at our four factories in Latvia, and in 2014 the SA8000 certificate was obtained at our Vietnamese factory and we are already in the progress of obtaining SA8000 certification at our new factory in Vietnam. The last few years we started to work more goal oriented towards the external environment with particular focus on solid waste and energy efficiency. Further steps are working with our suppliers and our customers to ensure the whole value chain eventually is covered by our CSR programs. A part of the operational profit will be re-invested in current CSR activities and a constant upgrade of the working environment standards because we believe CSR is not only about ethics and high moral but also good business. Jesper Klausen Director Production and Supply Chain SPECTRE A/S CSR REPORT 2015 SPECTRE A/S CSR REPORT 2015 BUSINESS MODEL Spectre’s business model is illustrated as seven steps. However, the model is a simplified guide to understaning our business and value chain. The seven steps serves as a tool for mapping issues of relevans in our CSR efforts.

During 2015 we were preparing to implement the environmental standard; bluesign®. This standard has a strong focus on chemicals in garments, which is a highly relevant area for the earlier steps in the value chain such as fabric and trims manufacturers. However, Spectre is not utilizing chemicals and our influence on the chosen fabrics and trims is limited in most cases due to the fact the our customers (who are brand owners) nominate the fabric they have carefully selected for certain styles. Considering the business model and our strategic environmental focus, we decided to merge the relevant bluesign® criterias into the ISO14001 standard and implement this instead. This work has commenced but is not finalized. The below charts show our chosen measures for environmental issues: LATVIA Fig. 1a: Energy consumption in KWh, Latvia Fig. 1b: Energy costs in EUR, Latvia Fig 2a: Pellets consumption in tons, Latvia Fig 2b: Pellets costs in EUR, Latvia S P E C T R E C S R R A P P O R T 2 0 15  3 Fig 3a: Wood consumption, Latvia Fig. 3b: Wood costs in EUR, Latvia Fig. 4a: Coal consumption in tons, Latvia Fig. 4b: Coal costs in EUR, Latvia VIETNAM Fig 5.a: Energy consumption in Kwh, Vietnam Fig. 5.b: Energy cost in VND, Vietnam S P E C T R E C S R R A P P O R T 2 0 15  4 2 PEOPLE 2.1 SOCIAL ISSUES AND LABOUR ISSUES The main risks in the garment industry are related to labour rights and social issues as illustrated in our business model. In 2012 we decided to implement the social standard SA8000. This standard is the highest level in its field and it covers relevant and important areas for our company such as; child labour, forced labour, freedom of association, discrimination, disciplinary practices, working hours and remuneration. Being SA8000 certified at all our factories we are audited each 6 months by Bureau Veritas to ensure our procedures are continually adequate. The audit reports assist us in identifying areas with need for improvements and results in a number of observations or non-conformances, which must be dealt with within a given time period. It is our goal to have 0 non-conformances overall. In 2015 we received 6 non-conformances where 2 was identified in Latvia and 4 was identified in Vietnam. Gender equality Our industry is characterized by a large number of female employees. However, we do recruit male seamstresses yet only in Vietnam we have succeeded in employment. In Latvia our male colleagues are mainly employed in other working areas such as cutting department, technical department etc. Employees % Female % Male Managers % Female % Male Factory name Total Employees Employees Total Managers Managers Spectre Latvia 290 89 % 11 % 18 83 % 17 % EK Auce Spectre Vietnam 201 76 % 24 % 13 85 % 15 % Spectre DK 21 67 % 33 % 8 25 % 75 % S P E C T R E C S R R A P P O R T 2 0 15  5 2.2 HUMAN RIGHTS In the garment industry there is a risk of not respecting a number of Human Rights. We have during 2015 commenced using the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights as our framework for working with respecting Human Rights. We have identified 7 Human Rights headings covering 12 individual Human Rights with subheadings. 2. Right to non-discrimination, 4. Right to enjoy just and favorable conditions of work, including a. Right to equal pay for equal work b. Right to a living wage c. Right to safe and healthy working conditions d. Right to equal opportunities for everyone to be promoted e. Right to rest, leisure and paid holidays 5. Right to form and join trade unions and the right to strike 7. Right to family life, including a. Right to protection of mothers before and after childbirth b. Right to children’s and young people’s protection from exploitation (no child labour) 10. Right to education 14. Right not to be subjected to slavery, servitude or forced labour 24. Right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion Having implemented the social standard SA8000 our practical work with preventing Human Rights violations is already in progress. However, we still have a lot of work ahead of us when digging deeper into the Un Guiding Principles. The due diligence process is still novel in our organization and can elaborate more on procedures in some areas. In 2016 we will continue this work. S P E C T R E C S R R A P P O R T 2 0 15  6 3 ANTI-CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY In 2014 we developed an Anti-Corruption policy stressing our zero-tolerance towards bribery and corruption. During 2014 and 2015 we have trained all relevant employees in Denmark, Latvia and Vietnam in our Anti-Corruption policy and related procedures including areas of risk, employee responsibilities and protection of employees raising bribery and/or corruption concerns. We have identified certain activities creating particular risks for our company: › Plant management › Import/export of goods including contact to customs authorities › Supplier contacts/Purchasing duties › Quality audits › Social audits › Financial audits › Payments of invoices › Payments and contacts with tax authorities › Salary payments (only bank transfer) Resulting from this list 63 employees have been trained in our Anti-Corruption policy and procedures. The training contained the overall definition of corruption and bribery and our gift registration policy. The UK Bribery Act, national legislation and the implications in terms of compliance, risks and sanctions was addressed and finally the employee responsibility and procedure in terms of suspicion about or exposure to corruption or bribery. We have had 0 cases of bribery and/or corruption. However, we operate in countries with moderate to high risk of corruption and we do not measure our success by the number of cases as much as on the number of employees being trained in our Anti-Corruption policy. 4 REPORTING We aimed at publishing our first CSR report for 2015 which we succeeded in with this report. The purpose of reporting on CSR is twofold. Firstly, we consider CSR as important as our financial milestones and measures. Secondly, we believe that data collection and reporting will shed light over the corners of our company which have not been followed as closely in the past. Once we start measuring we can start relating to the numbers we find. We have only just started this journey but we will continue on that trail for adding more value to our company.
