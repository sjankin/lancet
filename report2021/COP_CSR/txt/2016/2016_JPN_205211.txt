We have provided the world with a wide range of new products that have surpassed expectations. Our history has involved the transformation from analog to digital as well as an evolution based on the pursuit of ever smaller and lighter products. In recent years, the business environment has been changing dramatically. Smartphones and tablets are enjoying explosive popularity, and society is becoming increasingly connected via the Internet, changing people's lifestyles and preferences, along with the flow of tangible products. In order to continue growing as a company essential to society, we must accurately read the signs of the times, so that we can undergo the necessary self-transformation. Amid these far-reaching changes, my appointment as president in June 2015 has made me realize the sobering responsibility of leading an entire group of companies. Since first joining Casio, I have always felt that our corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution” is paramount. The significance of “creativity” is profound, and the word indicates so much more than merely creating something. It also means enriching the lives of people by developing and delivering products the world has never seen before, all the while inspiring new cultural phenomena and pioneering new markets. That is the kind of “contribution” that only Casio can make. This is why today it is so important for us to renew and deepen our awareness of “Creativity and Contribution.” This is how we can confirm our path to the future. Product development that merely focuses on improving specs — thinking for example that “we added this new function so this product should sell well” — will no longer meet the expectations of society. It is essential that we take a thoroughly customer-oriented perspective and stretch our imagination into the future. We need to earnestly consider the best ways to help people live enjoyable and convenient lives. In other words, we need to make a new start. We need to go from just creating tangible “things” to creating different, higher-order things that include intangible “things” — like whole new experiences for people and exciting new services. We need to also remind ourselves of the importance of our brand. Our brand is a bond that connects Casio to its customers through products and services, and is in fact a promise we make to our customers. Once they buy a Casio product and become a Casio fan, customers put their trust in our brand, which leads to a cycle of future purchases. Therefore, our brand is the most essential channel for communication for a company like Casio in the consumer products business. It is thanks to our countless fans that we have been able to be successful in business. Earning a strong position in the education market The education market is one area where Casio has left a significant footprint by securing strong customer support based on our brand. This product area includes electronic dictionaries and scientific calculators. Casio electronic dictionaries have an overwhelming share of the Japanese market, and many Japanese high school students are using Casio products. By listening to feedback from classrooms and making repeated improvements, we have developed two important assets — CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 6 rich dictionary content and a network of teachers. We have built a stable market of many high school students who purchase Casio electronic dictionaries to help them achieve their goal of passing university entrance exams every year. We are now in the stage of applying our expertise to expand into the education markets of Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, in the area of scientific calculators, we have been able to foster new markets, mainly in Europe and the United States. The market development team began by visiting classes in various countries and strengthening relationships with schools, and then proceeded with product development to better meet classroom needs. We have even supported legislation to facilitate better mathematics education. As a result, many high school students in the countries and states concerned have purchased Casio scientific calculators. With the world's first “natural textbook display,” our ClassWiz series has spawned numerous revolutions in the world of scientific calculators. The addition of high-resolution LCD technology in fiscal 2015 enabled calculators in each country to display the local language, and ClassWiz has now achieved an unrivaled status in the market. As examples of market creation that clearly goes beyond mere product manufacturing, I am proud of the way these practices demonstrate Casio uniqueness. As a result of striving steadily to achieve our mission of supporting classroom education, we have been able to create innovative products and services that have earned Casio numerous fans. In response to expanding educational needs in high-growth newly emerging countries and elsewhere, we will continue our unique business development based on our roadmap for contributing to education worldwide. Deploying market strategy based on a long-term vision In education and other existing markets, we must continue to firmly protect the Casio brand, which is our promise to customers. While maintaining our culture developed over many years and launching new products that meet not only today’s needs but the needs of the future, we will continue to provide unwavering value. It is also important for us to pioneer new markets and create new Casio fans, by taking on the challenge of creating new categories of “things”. To that end, there are also several issues that we must overcome. First, even when we are successful in establishing good communication with customers in the education and other markets, there is a company-wide tendency for us to always rely on dealers and distributors for sales. This can make it difficult for us to listen to the voices of our customers. We need to focus more clearly on customer needs, and create mechanisms that enable continuous contact with customers through our distribution network. The second issue is that we have tended to conduct product development separately for each product category, due to our organizational structure that is aligned by product categories. To address this, we need to revise our organizations so that we can operate horizontally across product boundaries and flexibly pursue the creation of those higher-order “things” I mentioned earlier, working from a broad customer perspective. It is also extremely important to pursue market strategy with a mediumand long-term view. Rather than sticking to short-term sales and profit, Casio needs to look ahead 5, 10, and 20 years and create a broad vision for the future. We must also consider what to focus on in the form of a series of corporate stories for these time frames. In June 2015, a new Corporate Governance Code was adopted in Japan, and there has been growing momentum across the entire society to measure corporate value over the medium and long term. As a listed company, Casio is expected to declare and deliver on long-term goals, i.e., its methods for contributing to the sustainable development of society. Rather than just responding in a superficial way, at Casio we intend to use this opportunity to reconsider the very essence of our company. Getting back to basics and taking “Creativity and Contribution” to an even higher level Given this situation, I hope our employees will broaden their perspectives. While it is necessary to shift from a short-term to a medium and long-term outlook, employees also need to follow company-wide developments beyond their individual departments and job areas. Rather than the optimization of individual departments, each and every Casio employee must be aware of company-wide optimization goals in order for Casio to undergo the transformation needed to ensure an even brighter future. To reflect company-wide strategy in individual businesses, I intend to provide team leadership from the top. However, individual departments — especially their leaders — must each also think earnestly about the future, and based on their unique perspectives, actively express their ideas on how things should change. Finally, as a manufacturer, technological capabilities form the foundation of everything Casio does. While remembering this starting point, CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 7 we should work to create an environment that allows the engineers of the Hamura and Hachioji R&D Centers, which form the heart of Casio, to fully realize their abilities. Furthermore, without the enthusiasm of Casio employees, the company has no future. That’s why we are working so hard to build a company where enthusiastic people can play a dynamic role. The entire company is united in the ambition to take “Creativity and Contribution” to an even higher level to achieve sustainable development together with society. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 8 What are society's expectations today concerning corporate social responsibility, and what should Casio be doing to meet them? We invited Toshihiko Goto, Chief Executive of the Sustainability Forum Japan, for a conversation with Noriaki Kimura, Section Manager of the CSR Promotion Office, General Affairs and Personnel Department. They discussed the latest CSR developments and Casio's initiatives for the future. Latest CSR developments relating to future management strategy (background remarks by Toshihiko Goto) Today, companies find themselves in an environment of major change. One of the roots of these changes relates to the fact that the system of mass production, mass consumption, and mass disposal is no longer recognized as viable, long-term. This system has been flourishing based on vigorous economic activity since the start of the Industrial Revolution, but it is now reaching its limits. Since the Industrial Revolution, the world's population has grown substantially along with the improvement in productivity. From a global population of 1.65 billion people in 1900, the number grew about four times in the 20th century, and we have already surpassed 7.3 billion people today. Meanwhile, consumption of resources and energy, especially in developed countries, continues to grow. In order to meet this growing demand, it is estimated that the resources of 1.5 planet earths are now needed. If the world's population continues to grow, and if developing and newly emerging countries were to practice “business as usual” as developed countries have done, our global human society would certainly collapse. This crisis situation is becoming vividly apparent in the areas of climate change and biodiversity reduction. People around the world are slowly coming to realize that human activity has now exceeded the environmental capacity (and population support capability) of the earth. Faced with this problem affecting the very survival of humankind, we need to transition to a sustainable global society. Accordingly, people have also been looking at the role companies need to play in order to help change society. In Europe, socially responsible investment (SRI) began to take hold around 1990. SRI evaluates companies not just on their financial data, but also on their social and environmental activities. In 2006, the United Nations proposed the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), which calls on institutional investors to make investment decisions based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors—or in other words, by considering a company’s social responsibility efforts. In 2013, the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) issued the International Integrated Reporting Framework, which encourages reporting on long-term development with integrated financial and non-financial information. Since the start of the 21st century, the CSR/ESG concept has been spreading globally. At the same time, we are transitioning from an era when companies were evaluated just based on their business performance (financial value), into one where companies are evaluated based on their contribution to sustainability (ESG or non-financial value). This is a major change. In other words, we are now entering an era in which non-financial information, such as how a company plans to create value over the long term, will be given more emphasis than financial information, which is nothing more than past results. Therefore, companies need to be deeply aware that they are doing business at the major threshold of a new era. Amid this growing global momentum, the Stewardship Code and Corporate Governance Code have been introduced in Japan by the Abe administration. The Stewardship Code encourages institutional investors to accurately ascertain ESG conditions at the companies they invest in, including their governance measures and response to social and environmental problems. On the other hand, the Corporate Governance Code encourages listed companies to actively take ESG measures. These codes therefore represent a major step forward. A major feature of these new codes is the choice for companies to comply or explain. In order for Japan and humankind to attain sustainability, companies are being asked to pursue their own growth in a way that also helps build a sustainable society. We are at the dawn of a new era. If 2003 is considered to be the first year of the CSR era in Japan, then 2015 can be called the first year of the CSR (ESG) corporate management era. Those companies that embrace the new era will enjoy a surge of development, while those that do not will gradually ebb into decline. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 9 Toshihiko Goto Chief Executive of the Sustainability Forum Japan Chief Executive Officer, Sustainability Forum Japan (Nonprofit organization) Chair, Environmental Auditing Research Group Founder, Japan Sustainable Investment Forum Co-Chair, Network for sustainability Communication (NSC) Chairman, Sustainable Management Forum of Japan Director, Environmental Partnership Council Director, Earth Watch Japan Director, Green Finance Organisation Target setting with a long-term view (the conversation) Goto: By February 2015, 184 institutional investors in Japan expressed support for the new Stewardship Code, and they have started to move quickly in order to create fund management mechanisms for incorporating non-financial information including ESG data. However, Japanese companies have had virtually no experience with evaluating their ESG factors, and many institutions are still in the stage of first learning how to handle corporate ESG information. A dialog between companies and investors is most likely also needed, so they can all learn together. Have any of Casio's investors requested a dialog based on the Stewardship Code so far? Kimura: Although the numbers are still very small, some financial institutions have requested interviews and the start of a trend can be seen. It seems that the way we handle the move towards ESG investment will have a large impact on our future success. Now that the Corporate Governance Code has also been issued, we must address it fully, as well. Goto: I think we are at the point where companies are being assessed by how seriously they will address the Corporate Governance Code. As stated in Principle 2.3.1 of the Code, if a company wants to seriously consider sustainability issues, then it has to do more than just prepare short-term sales plans. As an example of the environmental aspects, the Abe administration has decided that Japan should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% or more by 2050. Moreover, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated that in order to keep the average global temperature increase below 2°C, GHG emissions must drop to zero or below by 2100. With such a variety of prerequisites, companies need to clarify their own paths forward. Those that have undertaken initiatives based on definite policies and plans with a long-term view are on the way to sustainable growth. However, companies that have just tried to perform superficial greenwashing will certainly no longer be able to keep up with the changes. Kimura: Traditionally, Japanese companies have tended to only set targets they can confidently achieve. However, instead of setting these easily achievable targets, they should announce robust policies that indicate the methods by which they will create and promote their plans. Goto: That's right. Listed companies now must comply or explain. By December 31, 2015, the first year the Code is in effect, companies are asked to submit a Corporate Governance Report under the new system (in the case of companies whose fiscal year ends in March). However, they should avoid making any hasty policies just for the sake of meeting the tight deadline. For companies without much awareness of long-term planning until now, it will be difficult to work out a direction that can be shared by all employees within a few months. Rather than drawing up makeshift policies, it would be more substantive and important for them to explain their current situation. For example, a company could indicate an intention to spend the coming year developing a long-term plan to be achieved by 2050, and to carry it out through a series of three-year plans. It could also indicate how it has started the process. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 10 Turning increased pressure for reform from within and outside companies into opportunity Kimura: Here at Casio, we are in the middle of the development of long-term goals that will enable us to our entire group of companies forward in a single direction. For example, we are now at the stage of thinking hard about what kind of business portfolio we should be aiming for, and what kind of business domains to expand into, in order for Casio to maintain our presence as a trusted company. Our sights are set on the next ten years until 2025, and then even further out to 2050. However, the difficult thing is to predict what the future will be like in 2050, or even a decade from now in 2025. This includes climate change, population issues, as well as cultural trends. Everyone has a different view of the future. Goto: As you say, a variety of different assumptions can be made about what the world will be like in several decades. If it is known that things are progressing in a dire direction, then the actual future will always deviate from the prediction, since human beings strive to avoid bad outcomes. Once you set targets, then there will always be people who are fastidious about numbers. But the setting of numerical targets can then almost become meaningless. For example, even for the use of alternative energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an optimal power source is not something that a company can determine on its own, and it is largely influenced by the overall situation in Japan. However, even though predicting the future is difficult, it is possible to determine a broad direction, such as reducing net CO2 emissions to as close to zero as possible. On top of that, while monitoring its own environment, a company can continue to anticipate the needs of society. That is not only using ESG as a risk factor, but it will also become a source of competitiveness as a return factor. Kimura: With the recent appointment of the first new Casio president in 27 years, a new era has begun at our company. The new president is also deeply aware of the importance of long-term initiatives. Therefore, I think it is important to create a solid system, and for all employees to join forces and take on the challenge of change. Goto: The arrival of a fresh top executive is a good time for internally driven change. You could say that Casio is now at an optimal point for change thanks to the internal and external momentum. Given this situation, it is fantastic that your new president is aware of the need to buckle down and formulate plans. Specifying material issues with an awareness of future vision Kimura: Until now, Casio has pursued CSR activities based on ISO 26000, and has prepared information disclosure based on the 4th edition of the GRI Guidelines. In the future, however, we must further emphasize proactive CSR with an awareness of the need to create shared value (CSV*). If we can set up a broad direction for future strategy based on the new system, milestone goals can also be considered. As part of this, we will also work to specify the CSR issues that have the most materiality for our business. * A process by which a company makes and executes policies to increase its own competitiveness, while helping to improve the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates. Goto: The specification of issues with materiality, including measures to address social and environmental issues, is also required by the Corporate Governance Code. The larger a company becomes, the more pressure it receives from various quarters, and diverse initiatives become essential. Even so, in order to be aware of important issues from a medium and long-term perspective and prioritize them, the company will be asked about the connection to its corporate story or vision for moving forward. It is essential that vision awareness be shared throughout the company. Kimura: I think corporate storytelling is very important. To be an outstanding storyteller, the top management tells a corporate story that instills a dream in employees and gives them motivation. Goto: That's right. Investors are also looking for those kinds of inspiring stories. Companies that have a corporate story relating to ESG factors tend to be held in higher esteem, and it is essential to provide accurate information. Kimura: With the new Stewardship Code, it is clear that there will be more and more opportunities for dialog with investors, and it will probably be necessary to appoint someone responsible for engaging in this dialog. In addition, that person will need to expertly promote dialog not only with investors but also with consumers and other stakeholders such as suppliers, in order to convey the company's message. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 11 Goto: The Corporate Governance Code defines a principle for constructive dialog with shareholders. It also requires the appointment of executives or directors to ensure that the constructive dialog is realized. The nomination of persons responsible for shareholder engagement shows an intention to fully comply with this. Therefore, it is important to firmly decide a company policy that conveys the same message to various stakeholders in addition to shareholders and financial institutions. Making CSR an individual concern for employees Goto: When preparing a company-wide long-term vision, it is important to promote it horizontally across the company. When a company becomes larger, it tends to become divided into separate vertical organizations. Therefore, it is necessary to foster a shared awareness created by an organization such as a CSR committee. Kimura: For the company's long-term goals, unless the strategies of various departments such as CSR, sales, human resources and finance are organically bound together, they don't have much meaning. The importance of going horizontally across the company seems to be becoming better understood internally. Casio has a CSR Committee, and we are now also considering the selection of CSR Leaders. This involves the selection of about 100 employees from all the departments, and giving them priority CSR training. This would allow them to discuss future directions for the company, and then they would help spread CSR awareness in their own departments. Goto: When you implement that measure, be sure to sufficiently incorporate the perspectives of younger employees. At least half of the activity leaders should be under 40. This will greatly enhance the sense of ownership when thinking about the future of the company in 2050, as that generation will still be active in the company at that time. Kimura: I agree that a sense of ownership is very important. It seems that currently, many employees have trouble linking CSR issues to their own jobs, compared with more immediate profit and development targets. However, all employees have some connection to someone in the value chain, somewhere from upstream to downstream. They need to consider how they can contribute to their own stakeholders—the people they are engaged with—and incorporate CSR issues into their own operational targets. To that end, I think we need to also revise the human resources evaluation system. As long as there is no mechanism for superiors to properly evaluate their subordinates’ contributions to CSR, employees will not be able to see CSR as part of their own work. Aiming for further growth by involving the entire company Goto: As one idea, it might be good to have an internal essay contest on the topic of what kind of company Casio should be by 2050 and what should be done to achieve that goal. The contest can be held after explaining the latest trends concerning CSR and the business environment. This would provide the two benefits of getting employees to think about the future, and finding out what younger employees are thinking in particular. Kimura: That's a very interesting idea. It would be a valuable opportunity for employees to participate in management decision-making, and might also help to motivate employees. It would be great if it could further energize the company. Goto: That is a very important perspective, as activities cannot last if employees do not find them motivating. Employees do not feel any satisfaction if they are just told what and how to do something, without any reasons why. By studying on their own and learning why CSR and ESG are important to the company and their own jobs, employees can truly consider what needs to be done and how to do it. Until now many companies have not explained to outside stakeholders why they are focusing on CSR efforts, and they have tended to just list up their initiatives and implementation methods. However, that is no longer sufficient today. Casio has an advantage because you have been seriously thinking about your long-term vision for over a year prior to the enactment of the Corporate Governance Code. By involving the whole company, I hope you will sail forward and ride the large wave of change that is emerging right before our very eyes. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 12 Making life richer and more convenient by creating innovative products—this was the aspiration of Casio’s founders, and it is summed up in the corporate creed, “Creativity and Contribution.” Casio believes that part of its social responsibility is to pass down this corporate creed to all of its employees without fail. Casio is determined to ensure that its businesses, which make something from nothing, or go from “0” to “1,” continue to make a consistent contribution to a more sustainable global society. Welcoming the challenge of helping to build a more sustainable global society In recent years, there has been widespread concern over the sustainability of human civilization in its current form. While economic activity has enriched the lives of many people, it has also put great strain on the global environment and social systems. Cooperation is needed to overcome this global crisis and leave a sustainable global society to future generations. In order to achieve this, proactive initiatives need to be taken by individuals, companies, governments, and international organizations. A company has a much larger impact on society than an individual, and corporate activities are responsible for some of the current impact on the planet. This is why society now has much greater expectations for companies to actively implement their own initiatives to help resolve sustainability issues, or in other words, to fulfill their corporate social responsibility (CSR). Today, a company’s performance on social responsibility impacts its corporate value. Firms that fail to fulfill their corporate social responsibilities are no longer valued or allowed to survive by society. Casio’s corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution” contains the company’s founding idea of social contribution through the provision of innovative products that have never existed before. Everyone working at Casio fully appreciates this corporate creed, and the company is always striving to help build a more sustainable global society by pursuing business activities designed to make something from nothing, or go from “0” to “1.” This is Casio’s CSR approach. To ensure that it continues to deliver on the commitments of its corporate creed, Casio has established three key documents. The Charter of Creativity for Casio outlines the basic principles behind the mindset and conduct expected from everyone at Casio, while the Casio Common Commitment provides specific conduct guidelines for implementing the Charter. The Casio Group Code of Conduct establishes norms for ethical conduct and requires all Casio group executives and employees to comply with relevant laws and internal rules. With recent changes in the external environment, in June 2013 Casio revised the Code of Conduct to reflect the higher expectations of the international community with a focus on the areas of human rights, supply chain management, and anti-corruption measures. Casio has established four specific keywords, shown below, to guide its efforts to address social and environmental issues that relate directly and indirectly to its business operations. By addressing these issues the company aims to help build a more sustainable global society. The world today is faced with many complex economic, environmental and social problems of a very serious nature. Humanity as a whole needs to consider its own best future, and then find ways to move in that direction. If economic activities are to be maintained on this planet with limited resources, every member of society must try to help achieve sustainability. Casio is determined to do its part to find solutions for social and environmental issues while continuing to provide new value to society, based on its corporate creed of “Creativity and Contribution.” Casio will steadily pursue specific initiatives while always seeking to conceive of ideal solutions for each issue. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 13 Keywords for a sustainable world and Casio’s main initiatives ■ Resource recyclability (social and economic activities on a planet with limited resources) Reducing daytime power consumption through the use of geothermal electricity and the installation of power storage equipment, etc. ■ Biodiversity (respecting the uniqueness of all living organisms and recognizing their interdependence) Establishing an Environmental Action Plan, and evaluating the entire impact of the business, etc. ■ Fairness across generations (the current generation properly appreciating the legacy of previous generations and passing it on to future generations) Setting medium and long-term CO2 reduction targets, and promoting next-generation development and education, etc. ■ Fairness across regions (fairly distributing wealth and assets across regions) Being a member of the UN Global Compact, and conducting CSR activities globally, etc. Casio’s CSR Platform CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 14 Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment In 2003, Casio adopted the Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment, a promise from everyone working at Casio. They are designed to ensure that Casio employees will be aware of the corporate creed at all times, and act upon it. These promises cover the three key aspects of CSR—economy, environment, and society—as well as the company’s approach to compliance. Charter of Creativity for Casio First Chapter We will value creativity, and ensure that our products meet universal needs*. Second Chapter We will strive to be of service to society, providing customers with delight, happiness, and pleasure. Third Chapter We will back up our words and actions with trustworthiness and integrity, and work as professionals. * To create innovative products that everyone needs but no other company has ever produced. At Casio, this is the mission not only of product development, but of every other part of the business. Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment Engaging employees in Casio’s unique CSR approach To ensure thorough application of these principles, the directors and department heads sign the Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment every year, and together recite a pledge to abide by the Charter and Commitment and familiarize their subordinates with it. All employees also sign a card printed with these promises, to carry with them at all times. There is also a site on the company intranet entitled CASIO STYLE which includes messages about the corporate creed and the Charter and Commitment from the four brothers who founded the company, along with other simple, compelling stories presented once a month. This helps all group employees to better understand and identify with Casio’s essential character. Every other year, Casio conducts a comprehensive questionnaire survey to learn what group employees in Japan think about the Charter of Creativity for Casio and Casio Common Commitment, the Casio Group Code of Conduct, and the Whistleblower Hotline. The results are analyzed to determine how thoroughly employees have embraced the company’s approach to CSR. The next questionnaire will be conducted in fiscal 2013. The CSR Communication Book has been issued mainly for employees every year since 2012. By presenting specific cases to illustrate each chapter of the Charter of Creativity, it helps employees better understand the charter. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 15 CSR Implementation Framework Casio joined the UN Global Compact in 2010. The company upholds the ten principles of the Global Compact, which concern human rights, labour, the environment and anti-corruption, and it has also fully adopted the corporate commitments. Casio has been working to enhance its CSR programs to meet the requirements of the international community. The company draws on the ISO 26000 guidance standard on social responsibility in implementing CSR, and uses Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Guidelines to select subjects for disclosure. The company is currently working to comply with the latest G4 version of the guidelines. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 16 United Nations Global Compact Casio products are made through cooperation not just within the Casio Group, but with many other parts and consignment manufacturers. Through global distribution, over 100 million Casio products are sold each year in 140 countries around the word. In order for consumers worldwide to purchase Casio products with confidence, the company believes that it must support and adhere to common global principles for sustainable growth for the international community, beginning with Casio’s global supply chain. This is why, in December 2010, the company president signed a letter of commitment to support the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. With that step, Casio joined the compact, and it has been making employees thoroughly aware of it ever since, group-wide. While pursuing specific initiatives for the realization of the Global Compact principles, Casio is also appropriately disclosing progress. Casio is also active at the local network level of the UN Global Compact, serving as a member of the Japanese Global Compact Network Japan (GC-NJ). 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact Human Rights 1. Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and 2. make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Labor Standards 3. Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; 4. the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; 5. the effective abolition of child labor; and 6. the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Environment 7. Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; 8. undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and 9. encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Anti-Corruption 10. Businesses should work against all forms of corruption, including extortion and bribery. United Nations Global Compact CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 17 Main stakeholders of the Casio Group Casio strives to ascertain and understand how its operations impact the environment and society and what kind of contributions it can make. It then identifies stakeholder groups and strives to implement appropriate measures for each. Companies must not become complacent in their efforts to pursue social responsibility and maintain social trust. The first step in earning stakeholders’ understanding and trust for the initiatives of the company is listening to what they have to say. Good communication is a necessity, and it is not a one-way street. Companies must find solutions that benefit both their stakeholders and their business, as well as the global society as a whole. By actively disclosing information to stakeholders, and creating opportunities for dialogue with them, Casio finds out what stakeholders expect, evaluates its existing activities, and plans future initiatives.

Companies are now expected to carry out strategic initiatives to help make human societies more sustainable through their core business activities. Casio, which is expanding its business worldwide, is no exception. There is demand for Casio to make more targeted contributions through its business, built upon the long track record Casio has of creating something from nothing, or going from “0” to “1.” As part of these evolving trends, in May 2013 the fourth version of GRI’s international guidelines for sustainability reporting, GRI Guidelines (G4), were issued. The new version reflects a shift from comprehensive information disclosure to disclosure focused on materiality. In response, starting with the sustainability report to be issued in 2016, Casio plans to clearly articulate materiality and give it priority attention. Action so far and next steps Fiscal 2014 performance: reviewing the current situation • Casio held workshops with employees to identify how to keep advancing its business of going from “0” to “1” to help build a more sustainable global society. Participants shared their views of Casio’s uniqueness and their visions for the company, discussing what has to be done to close the gap between today and tomorrow. * For details, see Feature Story 1, “Creating the Future at Casio: Casio Employees’ Thoughts about Future Strategy” in the Sustainability Report 2014. • Casio solicited opinions from external experts on the topic of stakeholders’ expectations of Casio. * For details, see Feature Story 2, “Listening to the Experts: What Is Expected of Casio and What Should Casio Prioritize in the Future?” in the Sustainability Report 2014. Fiscal 2015 result: priority issues identified internally • Casio drew up a detailed list of issues according to business field and region and organized them in order of precedence for the company (horizontal axis in figure below). Fiscal 2016 agenda: prioritize issues and specify materiality from an outside perspective • Stakeholder questionnaires and interviews are conducted in order to identify issues that are important to them. (vertical axis below) • With the approval of the board of directors, the final decision on materiality for Casio is made based on the results of deliberation over the horizontal and vertical axes. • Casio plans to disclose the identified materiality in its sustainability report 2016. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 19 Casio is committed to earning the confidence of all of its stakeholders, including the broader society. In order to further enhance the effectiveness of its CSR activities, the company is engaged in various initiatives such as the improvement of corporate governance. CSR Implementation System Corporate Governance Guided by ISO 26000, Casio is responding Through various initiatives, Casio is working to today’s rapidly changing world by to strengthen the soundness and identifying the specific issues that it must transparency of its management. address to meet the expectations of society.

Whistleblower Hotline. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 20 Guided by the ISO 26000 international guidance standard on social responsibility, Casio is responding to today’s rapidly changing world by identifying the issues that it must address to meet the expectations of society and implementing management cycles designed to resolve these issues. Steps in CSR Implementation 1. Evolution from preventative CSR to proactive CSR (2004 to 2010) Since the establishment of its CSR Promotion Office in 2004, Casio has been implementing CSR activities while expanding the themes to be undertaken and the scope of their impact. In the initial stage, there was an emphasis on protecting corporate value through compliance and risk management (preventative CSR). Starting in fiscal 2011, Casio began focusing on using CSR to improve corporate value (proactive CSR). 2. Evaluation of initiative progress on core ISO 26000 subjects (2011) In fiscal 2012, Casio appointed managers and team leaders who have responsibility for implementing CSR in order to advance CSR globally at group companies around the world. At the same time, Casio evaluated and analyzed the status of initiatives at each company based on the core subjects under ISO 26000. 3. Prioritization of initiatives to promote respect for human rights (2012 to present) In fiscal 2013, Casio once again surveyed its group companies concerning CSR activities with a focus on respect for human rights, among the priority issues identified in the previous year. Based on an evaluation and analysis of the survey results, Casio has been making group-wide efforts to improve sensitivity to human rights issues, making this a priority since fiscal 2014. As part of those efforts, in June 2013 Casio implemented revisions to the Casio Group Code of Conduct reflecting the latest global standards relating to respect for human rights and fair business practices. In July 2014, it established and announced the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights (Casio Human Rights Policy), in order to show its commitment to human rights problems in and outside the company. Casio Group Policy on Human Rights （PDF / 47.1KB） 4. Implementation of measures for the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (2014 to present) Additionally, Casio made efforts to identify materiality for the group. First it held an employee workshop and a CSR Committee workshop to explore materiality in the eyes of employees in April and May of 2014. Then it held a meeting with experts in different areas to hear stakeholder perspectives on materiality in June 2014. From here on Casio will continue these kinds of initiatives in an effort to increase the precision of its output (Casio’s materiality). In May 2015, Casio started sending out questionnaires to various experts, employees, and customers, in order to gather opinions on Casio materiality from various stakeholder perspectives. The aim is to increase the precision of the output (materiality) of the efforts Casio makes. The specification of materiality will be completed by the end of 2015. It will be reflected in the Sustainability Report 2016, which will comply with the GRI G4 Guidelines. 5. Establishment of new group-wide CSR promotion system Casio is now creating a CSR Leader system, a new initiative in 2015. About 100 employees will be selected from each department to receive priority CSR training to help them become CSR Leaders. By fostering these leaders as core CSR human resources and promoting discussion among them concerning the future direction of Casio’s CSR activities, Casio expects that they will become key agents for promoting CSR awareness within their departments. In fiscal 2016, the new system will first be introduced at the head office, before it is eventually expanded to Casio group companies in and outside Japan. The aim is to improve group-wide CSR literacy, worldwide. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 21 Implementing CSR initiatives CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 22 CSR Committee Casio has established a CSR Committee headed by the director responsible for CSR under the board of directors. The committee is the central body for implementation of CSR. The CSR Committee is composed of CSR chiefs and managers from staff-related departments at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., and all Casio group companies worldwide, and is administrated by a Secretariat. At the start of the fiscal year, the Secretariat checks progress made on various CSR themes in the previous year. It then creates an overview of conditions for future progress, the expectations of society, and environmental changes. Priority themes for action are determined for each fiscal year, and a specific action plan is formulated. Under the action plan, ongoing themes are continued and new themes are introduced. New themes are established upon ascertaining the current situation and challenges, and also according to requests from CSR-related departments. The CSR-related departments then implement programs based on the established goals for the themes they are responsible for and the annual plans to achieve the goals. At the end of the fiscal year, progress made on the themes is evaluated. Based on the results, issues are identified, and then used to improve the plan for the next year. CSR Committee System In fiscal 2015, “ensure compliance with the GRI G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines” was added as a key policy initiative alongside “respect for human rights” and “fair business practices,” which are core objectives of ISO 26000 that Casio had been working on since the previous fiscal year. A total of seven themes were addressed: two compliance-related theme and five themes focusing on CSR issues. The following table outlines the progress made on these themes in fiscal 2014, along with the fiscal 2015 plan.

Not only these capacities are needed, however, strengthening of oversight to improve management soundness and transparency is equally important in ensuring that business goals are reliably achieved and corporate value continues to grow. Corporate governance framework Casio is a company with a board of statutory auditors. In addition to the management oversight function of the board of directors and board of statutory auditors, Casio is working to further strengthen its corporate governance by expanding the role of outside directors and enhancing the executive officer system. The board of directors has delegated most of its authority relating to important business execution to the executive officers to enable fast and efficient business execution. However, the supervisory function of the board of directors has been substantially secured through its retained authority to pass resolutions on matters set forth in law and in the articles of incorporation, and on particularly important business execution matters. Also, as part of efforts to strengthen the management oversight function of the board of directors, a nomination committee and compensation committee have been established with the requirement that outside directors serve among their members. To ensure the effectiveness of its management oversight function, the membership of the board of directors must include people with diverse perspectives, experiences, and abilities. In addition to directors who are thoroughly familiar with Casio's business, the board must also include outside directors with broad insight and rich experience. As of June 30, 2015, the board of directors is composed of 10 directors, two of whom are outside directors. The term of office for directors is one year so as to clearly delineate the responsibility that they have for management and to facilitate quick responses to changes in the business environment. In order to ensure the soundness and transparency of business management, the statutory auditors perform rigorous audits by attending board of directors meetings, and other important meetings and committees, as well as by interviewing directors and others and reviewing reports and important resolution documents. This is done in accordance with audit policies and allocation of responsibilities set out by the board of statutory auditors. The audit function is also being further strengthened through the provision of full-time staff to support the statutory auditors, in addition to the gathering of information from and exchange of opinions with the outside directors as necessary. More than half of the members of the board of statutory auditors are required to be outside auditors, and they must include auditors with finance and accounting knowledge to strengthen the audit function. The current board of statutory auditors is composed of three members, two of whom are outside auditors. The outside directors and outside auditors are independent officers registered with the Tokyo Stock Exchange in compliance with regulations. Accounting auditors perform external audits according to generally accepted Japanese auditing standards. The Internal Audit Department carries out audits to ensure that the organizations are appropriately operating in compliance with laws and regulations as well as group-wide standards.

Corporate Governance Reports ⌈Corporate Governance Reports⌋ (Tokyo Stock Exchange: Search for Corporate Governance Information) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 28 Casio’s effort to achieve total compliance management is based on the Casio Group Code of Conduct, a risk management system and whistleblower hotlines. Casio Group Code of Conduct Casio established the Casio Group Code of Conduct to make explicit its expectations that all executives and employees follow international norms, laws and ordinances applicable in each country and region, as well as all company rules, and also act with high ethical standards and good sense in their day-to-day work. On June 1, 2013, Casio revised the code, in order to better meet the expectations of the international community and capture trends in the social environment including the issuance of ISO 26000, the international guidance standard on social responsibility, in November 2010; Casio having joined the UN Global Compact in December 2010; and Casio having adopted the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in June 2011. Since then, Casio has been working to ensure everyone is fully aware of the revised code, group-wide. Here are the three main revisions to the Code of Conduct. 1) Points concerning issues of high concern to the international community such as human rights, supply chain management, and anti-corruption were revised 2) The respective roles of executives and employees were clearly stipulated 3) Content was improved to indicate common policies that apply to the worldwide group The revised Code of Conduct was prepared in Japanese, English, and Chinese, and is translated into other employee languages as necessary. Education on the new code is carried out across the entire group, with the aim of further deepening understanding of its content. Along with this education, a compliance questionnaire is conducted once every two years. The results and identified issues then are shared group-wide to promote continued improvement.

The education program in fiscal 2015 provided training for better understanding these areas: the corporate creed “Creativity and Contribution,” the Charter of Creativity for Casio, which is the action value criteria for implementing the creed, and the Casio Code of Conduct. Among these areas, in the area of corporate social responsibility, the training covered the importance and background of CSR, while seeking to foster better understanding of the UN Global Compact, in which the Casio Group participates, as well as ISO 26000, which is the international guidance standard on social responsibility. The e-learning program also emphasized the social topics of respect for human rights and fair business practices in areas such as compliance with anti-corruption and anti-monopoly laws. Social awareness is high in these areas, and meeting them is very important to the Casio Group. Casio will continue to improve the CSR literacy of employees while promoting the corporate creed, through group-wide education and awareness raising activities. Risk management Based on its Basic Risk Management Policies, Casio has built a system for efficient management of risks, with an emphasis on compliance risk. In the early stage of risk management, Casio identified 70 laws relating to its businesses and listed measures being taken to comply with each law. Casio determined priorities based on the possibility of a risk materializing and its potential impact on company management. Casio then planned and implemented individual measures and developed an overall management system. In the risk management process at Casio, departments responsible for certain risks develop measures in a planned way to avoid and reduce these risks. The Risk Management Secretariat performs comprehensive management through the use of plan-do-check-act (PDCA) cycles. The Internal Audit Department also audits this entire mechanism. Accordingly, as of the end of fiscal 2011, it was confirmed that the relevant departments had the necessary measures in place for management of all risks, and an overview of the entire situation was obtained. Now, however, Casio is changing its risk management promotion method. It is transitioning to a system whereby the Secretariat takes inventory of risks as necessary, checks new and revised laws, regularly monitors the risk management measures implemented so far, and confirms whether there are any deficiencies in their implementation. Risk management system CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 31 Business Continuity Plan (BCP) initiatives In order to respond to emergencies with the resources of the company organization, Casio has created a Crisis Management Manual for securing the safety of all employees, executives, and their families, preserving corporate assets. Sequential updates of the manual keep pace with changes in the business environment, and the company is taking practical initiatives at the same time. Specifically, the following measures have already been undertaken: Implementation of regular evacuation drills and general lifesaving classes for employees Distribution of emergency assistance kits to employees and additional disaster stockpiling Disaster prevention drill with the local community and provision of an open area for a temporary evacuation site However, in the Great East Japan Earthquake, which struck in March 2011, circumstances were encountered that far exceeded previous expectations. Casio used the lessons learned to identify various points for improvement. These points were reflected in a largely-revised Crisis Management Manual based on the premise of responding to a major earthquake with Tokyo at its epicenter. Casio also produced the Disaster Handbook for the families of its employees to deepen understanding of disaster countermeasures in the home and promote disaster readiness. Together with the initiatives above, Casio is working to enhance its business continuity plan (BCP). In the event of an emergency that interrupts business operations, such as a major earthquake with an epicenter in the Tokyo area, the plan outlines measures for the rapid confirmation of executive and employee whereabouts and well-being, as well as damage conditions, and the quick recovery and maintenance of operations. This mechanism is focused on Casio’s global supply chain. For example, if the headquarters suffers a disaster, an emergency headquarters is set up at the appropriate key site, based on a priority determined in advance. Under the direction of the headquarters, the aim is to minimize damage by continuing to provide products and services to customers worldwide based on limited resources. Through rapid restoration of business operation, the confidence of business partners and customers is maintained. Information system disaster response measures With the risk of power interruptions following the Great East Japan Earthquake that struck in March 2011, disaster response measures are more important than ever before. In addition to an internal data center, Casio utilizes a secure external data center that features seismic construction and self-contained power generation. As a measure to reduce disaster risk, Casio finished moving all its important servers, including those for mission-critical tasks, to external data centers and established an environment that can continue to operate even after a disaster. It also moved its e-mail system, an important means of communication, to an external provider. The company also performs disaster drills in conjunction with the group-wide business continuity plan. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 32 Information security Casio is aware of its important social responsibility to maintain the security of information that it collects from customers and other stakeholders in relation to its business activities. Casio has established Information Security Rules and implemented regular education for employees to continuously raise awareness of information security and ensure the implementation of safety measures. Regular training While information security relies on technical measures, it is also important for everyone handling information to know the required safety procedures, and to incorporate them into their work habits. At Casio, all officers and employees receive regular information security training through e-learning. The training covers general information security, as well as protection of personal information and other compliance matters, based on changes in society and in the company's business environment. Information security is being improved by providing this training content in a timely manner. Similar training is also provided for Casio Group companies. Initiatives to prevent information leakage By first establishing internal rules to prevent information leakage and then carrying out training as described above, Casio is strengthening organizational measures to prevent human error and improper information management. This is done by ensuring that safety procedures are well known and thoroughly utilized by all employees handling information. The procedures cover proper information disposal, limitations on sending emails externally, as well as preventing information or information devices from being taken off company premises. Casio is strengthening its technical measures for information system safety through the introduction of mechanisms to block cyber-attacks at the company's Internet portals. They include measures to prevent targeted attacks, as seen in recent years, and other external attacks such as those from malware. Internal measures include the installation of security software and patches on company PCs, and a multi-layered defense has been created. Information security certification and initiatives Casio has focused on established a system for prioritizing the protection of personal information, publically disclosed its Privacy Policy on its website, and remains committed to the safe and appropriate handling of personal information. In January 2006, Casio Computer Co., Ltd. obtained Privacy Mark*1 certification and has maintained it since. Casio's Information Systems Department obtained information security management system (ISO 27001)*2 certification in November 2007. The aim of applying for certification was to evaluate fulfillment of responsibility by the department, which takes care of information assets for the entire company. Since then, the department has made continual improvements using PDCA cycles. The fitness and effectiveness of Casio’s information security management system was reconfirmed with a certification renewal audit in February 2015.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 33 Whistleblower Hotline As a way to help ensure compliance, Casio set up a Whistleblower Hotline in April 2006. The hotline has been functioning with neutrality and fairness across all of its internal and external contact points. Operating on a basis of impartiality, the hotline follows up on all whistleblower reports and consultations, and takes resolute measures against any improper behavior discovered. Effort is put into preventing issues before they grow into real problems. In fiscal 2015, the hotline received six calls. The whistleblowers were interviewed, details were investigated, and corrective measures were taken. The issues were resolved with the whistleblowers’ understanding. The company will continue to watch for any latent problems and strive to improve its corporate culture. The contractor operating the external contact point of the Whistleblower Hotline was changed in April 2015. Now Casio employees can utilize online whistleblower consultation and report filing in English and Chinese, and telephone consultation and reporting is also available in English. This has given employees at group companies outside Japan better access to the hotline. To ensure even greater hotline awareness, Casio will strive to further increase group-wide understanding of the system in fiscal 2016, using a special intranet site with information on whistleblower protection in Japanese, English, and Chinese. Fiscal 2014 Report Details 5 power harassment 1 ethics issue reported Whistleblower Hotline Export control Export control, or security trade control, aims to maintain international peace and security. It involves regulations on the export of goods and technology that could be diverted for the development of weapons of mass destruction or other weaponry. The regulations are designed to prevent such goods and technology from reaching countries and regions of concern or terrorist organizations. In 1987, the Export Control Security Program of Casio Computer Co., Ltd. (a compliance program) was established in order to make sure proper measures are taken to ensure the security of exports. The program has since been continually updated along with changes in the Japanese Export Control Regulation. Casio has appointed employees responsible for export control in relevant departments as part of an internal system to ensure observance of the program. As the Exporter Compliance Standards took effect in April 2010, Casio has been striving to maintain and manage its system by conducting voluntary annual audits while ensuring through legal compliance, in response to the revision of applicable laws and regulations. Efforts include the strengthening of training activities at group companies in Japan. Casio has also established a management system for complying not only with Japanese export laws but also with US Export Administration Whistleblower Hotline As a way to help ensure compliance, Casio set up a Whistleblower Hotline in April 2006.

Efforts include the strengthening of training activities at group companies in Japan. Casio has also established a management system for complying not only with Japanese export laws but also with US Export Administration CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 34 Regulations. The company is working to improve global export management, including the implementation of export management training in fiscal 2013, at group companies in the UK and Germany, and in fiscal 2014 at a group company in the US. The Center for Information on Security Trade Controls (CISTEC) is a Tokyo-based non-profit which conducts research and analysis. Each year, it sends research delegations overseas, alternating between Europe and the United States. Casio has dispatched employees to participate in these missions since 2012. By meeting with officials at various export control organizations, government agencies, and major companies, Casio is participating in a social contribution activity that gathers useful information for export managers in Japan. Initiatives for compliance with fair trade and advertising laws In order to promote proper transactions as well as fair, transparent and free competition, it is essential for sales employees to have a proper understanding of Japan’s Act on Prohibition of Private Monopolization and Maintenance of Fair Trade and Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations. The sales offices of Casio Computer Co., Ltd., in Japan are strengthening their measures to ensure compliance with these laws. Since 2011, Casio has distributed a Sales Compliance Card to all employees involved in sales in Japan as a tool to promote appropriate and fair competition and trade. These employees are required to carry the card. When the company revised the card in September 2013, it expanded the distribution to include employees engaged in sales outside Japan in an effort to ensure understanding and familiarity with fair competition and trade. In addition to the Charter of Creativity for Casio and excerpts from the Casio Group Code of Conduct, the card contains a compliance test, as well as contact information for a consultation service, and the number for the Whistleblower Hotline. Whenever a salesperson is in doubt over a course of action during daily sales activities, he or she can quickly perform a self-assessment or consult with a knowledgeable expert. A dedicated department regularly conducts internal inspections to make sure there are no actions being taken that could conflict with Japan’s Antitrust Act or the Designation of Unfair Trade Practices published by the Fair Trade Commission, as a way of monitoring compliance with competition laws. Casio also strives to provide appropriate product information by checking product catalogues and promotional materials based on relevant laws such as Japan’s Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations and company rules, and corrects any expressions that could be misleading to customers. The timepiece division in particular has a committee on product information composed of relevant persons from within the company. The committee leads efforts that help make the wording of product information more appropriate, using tools such as a specialized glossary. After two amendments of Japan’s Act against Unjustifiable Premiums and Misleading Representations in 2014, companies in Japan are now required to maintain applicable compliance systems. A penalty regime has also been introduced to impose fines in cases of misleading representations. In an effort to comply with this law, Casio joined the Home Electric Appliances Fair Trade Conference, and set up a new internal committee with expanded functions to oversee Casio’s product and service representations. The committee is now ensuring even greater optimization of product and service claims and advertising. Additionally, the overseas sales department of Casio Computer Co., Ltd., has made it mandatory for all employees who transfer into the department to receive training on competition law overall and the prohibition on bribing foreign bureaucrats. The department has continuously implemented this training. Casio Sales Compliance Card (revised version) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 35 Corruption Prevention Initiatives Based on ISO 26000, the international guidance standard for social responsibility, from 2012 to 2013 Casio took stock of the main CSR challenges facing each group company in and outside Japan, assessing and analyzing the status of their initiatives. The issue that rose to the surface as a challenge warranting priority attention alongside respect for human rights was fair business practices–in other words, corruption prevention initiatives. The Casio Group Code of Conduct prohibits bribery. The Casio Guidance on the Prohibition of Bribery, issued in July 2015, articulates the basic philosophy for group companies, making it clear that bribery inhibits sustainable social development. In November 2015, Casio Computer Co., Ltd. issued the Manual on the Prohibition of Bribery. Additionally, Casio headquarters encourages group companies outside Japan to produce local rules and manuals in an effort to strengthen systems for the prohibition of bribery throughout the group.

Stable Supply of Products Casio is working to strengthen its global supply chain to meet rising product demand. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 42 Casio aims to develop products that meet the latent needs of customers. To do this the company is constantly improving its ability to generate new ideas. Casio’s primary objective is to make products that work reliably in any environment, and can always be used with safety. From the initial engineering phase to the release of the final product, Casio takes great pains to ensure there are no compromises on manufacturing quality. Product development incorporates insights from the classroom Nearly every year since 2007, Casio has invited teachers from outside Japan who are passionate about mathematics education and research to a Global Teachers Meeting held at its Hamura R&D Center. The purpose of these meetings is to contribute to the development of mathematics education by incorporating the perspectives of teachers with real-world insights from the classroom into Casio products. The overarching goal is to provide products that are optimally suited to the diverse educational settings worldwide. In 2014, a lively discussion took place at the meeting on the topic of “mathematics education using information and communications technology (ICT).” The participants debated Casio's role in helping to Global Teachers Meeting 2014 further improve education amid changing school environments. The discussion yielded ideas for making greater use of calculators in the classroom than ever before. This included linking calculators and ICT devices using online cloud services. Casio developers proposed utilizing QR code technology as a means to link the two types of devices. In February 2015, a new QR code feature was incorporated into the ClassWiz series of scientific calculators. Casio will continue to expand the ClassWiz series, aiming to keep contributing to the development of mathematics education worldwide. ClassWiz The inputted formula and data are made into a QR Code* matching the settings on the calculator, and then displayed on the calculator's screen. The numerical formulas and graphs can be displayed by reading the QR Code with an application on a smartphone, tablet, or other similar device. * QR Code is a registered trademark of DENSO WAVE INCORPORATED in Japan and in other countries. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 43 Going beyond universal design to human-centered design Casio works to develop products using human-centered design (HCD) in conformity with ISO 13407 processes, with the objective of improving product ease of use as part of the product’s overall quality. In the HCD process, Casio seeks optimal ease of use by determining important issues from customer feedback and observation of product use in real-world situations. Through repeated evaluation and verification, Casio works to develop highly desirable products. During the development of the IT-G500 handheld terminal, Casio focused on the basic operations of viewing, scanning, and inputting. Casio set the scanning angle at 25 degrees based on the results of user trials, and adopted a 4.3-inch WVGA transitive TFT LCD for its wide viewing angle. The display became the industry's largest in this product class, allowing the content to be checked easily, even when held at the scanning angle. Moreover, with the addition of special finger grips on the back of the unit, the IT-G500 is very easy and comfortable to hold securely even on rainy IT-G500 days or other times when the user’s grip is prone to slip. The grip design was developed based on the trail and evaluation of multiple shapes. Creating New Value to Meet the Needs of Different World Regions With varying cultures and customs around the world, it is only natural that needs will differ as well. By carefully responding to regional needs, Casio aims to provide products that will be used by even more people and to strengthen its competitiveness in global markets. Calculator with Indian digit grouping Worldwide, long numbers are usually divided into groups of three digits using commas for ease of reading. In India, however, the custom is to use a comma after the thousand position and then after every subsequent two digits (e.g., 10,00,000). Casio was the first to release a calculator that can display numbers in this way. The many shopkeepers who use calculators instead of cash registers in India appreciate the convenience of a device that displays prices in the familiar local format. MJ-120D Display with Indian digit grouping Calculators that speak aloud in Chinese In China, Casio sells speaking calculators that read aloud the calculation details in Chinese. This allows the store clerk and the customer to simultaneously check whether any calculation mistakes are being made. DY-120 CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 44 Scientific calculators with Arabic display In Arabic-speaking regions, Casio sells scientific calculators that display the Arabic language. Equipping the calculators with high-resolution LCDs enabled the sophisticated Arabic script to be shown. fx-991AR X Arabic display Oriental Keyboard Casio’s Oriental Keyboard features 54 tones and 83 rhythms that are characteristic of the major musical regions of the Middle and Near East, namely, the Arab / Maghreb (Middle East and North Africa), Oriental (Turkey, Greece, and Central Asia), Iran, and Khaleeji (Persian Gulf) regions. This enables Middle and Near Eastern musicians to enjoy the familiar traditional tones of their own AT-3 regions. PRAYER COMPASS This wristwatch, developed especially for Muslims, has the following special features: (1) it indicates daily prayer times based on the position of the sun; (2) it shows the direction of Mecca; and (3) it displays the date in the Islamic calendar. It is sold in 30 countries, including countries in Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. CPW-500H-9AV CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 45 Technology Technological expertise is needed to turn an innovative idea into a new product. Utilizing its five core technologies, Casio creates products that were not possible before. Durability Tough construction to withstand harsh environments Casio continues to focus on durability so that customers can enjoy its products for many years. As one technique for increasing shock resistance, Casio mounts a strong metal plate on the back of its display panels to increase strength and prevent warping. By also placing a shockabsorbing cushion between the display panel and its casing, any external shock is mitigated and destruction of the LCD is prevented. Tough Casio calculators also offer splash-resistant and dust-resistant performance, and are used in outdoor work such as civil engineering surveying. Digital technologies High-speed image processing delivers a wide range of expression instantly The “EXILIM Engine HS, Ver.3 ADVANCE” is a highspeed image processing engine that quickly and smoothly performs all the image processing right from digital camera startup. By simultaneously operating dual CPUs and two parallel image processors, this unique image processing engine offers high-speed operation. One feature enabled by this technology is the world’s first dual combination bracketing function.* With just one press of the shutter button, the camera shoots nine images while automatically varying a pair of parameters, such as focus and aperture, or white balance and brightness, in three stages. Setting the user free from complicated settings, this feature makes it possible to shoot stunning photos and realize new possibilities for expression not seen before. *For a bracketing function encompassing two kinds of parameters like white balance and brightness for a digital camera with a built-in lens. (As of November 14, 2013; based on a Casio survey.) Energy saving New concept for highly efficient solar cells With regular solar-powered analog watches, the solar cells are arranged linearly in six sections. This is because it is necessary to have multiple cells in a series to ensure the necessary voltage. The disadvantage of this design is that the cell providing the least power impacts the entire series. When the shadow from the watch hand falls on one cell, the upper limit of power generation for the entire series is lowered. Overcoming this, Casio developed a high-output solar cell with blocked-light distribution. By arranging the cells in a spiral and distributing the hand shadow over multiple cells, the decrease in power generation is minimized. This ensures efficient and stable power. This energy-saving technology enabled more freedom in watch designs and improved functions. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 46 Casio is actively promoting intellectual property activities in line with its management strategy through cooperation between its R&D and business divisions. Based on these activities, the company aims to protect its businesses, and contribute to corporate profitability. Policies for promotion of intellectual property activities Casio takes a mediumto long-term perspective in order to increase its technology management ability, and is systematically promoting research and development for the creation of future business. While recognizing R&D results as intellectual property, Casio is taking steps to ensure that they are properly managed and utilized in order to secure profits. Casio places importance on intellectual property as an important measure of corporate value. In order to effectively promote intellectual property activities, Casio has set the following goals for promoting intellectual property activity, and implements them group-wide for effective utilization of intellectual property. Intellectual property goals Casio is working to increase its intellectual property capacity using the following goals. ▪ Increase the intellectual property capacity of Casio ▪ Protect technology and products globally with strong intellectual property capacity ▪ Guarantee creative technology and product development through strong intellectual property capacity Role of the Intellectual Property Department Since its founding, Casio has worked to develop innovative new technologies and products that are completely original and have never existed before. The protection of these development results through the creation of intellectual property rights is vital to ensuring corporate competitiveness. At the same time, protecting Casio brands and designs from counterfeiting by securing intellectual property rights is also an important activity for the company. The Intellectual Property Department aims to secure intellectual property rights on a global level. Its role is to utilize patent, design, and trademark rights in order to help establish competitive advantage for corporate management. The center also broadly manages intellectual property (rights) such as copyrights and trade secrets as well as general intangible properties, while signing contracts with third parties and resolving disputes. Intellectual property activities Casio implements various intellectual property activities. Casio actively utilizes the intellectual property that it has accumulated over the years, and carries out activities to protect its businesses. The company conducts ongoing R&D necessary for sustained growth, and has put in place various systems for producing new intellectual property. 1. Patent application and rights acquisition activities Casio constructs patent nets based on patent application and registration in priority fields (selection and concentration), and actively promotes activities for the acquisition of effective patents based on quality improvement. The company carries out patent application and rights acquisition activities worldwide, including in the USA, China, South Korea, Taiwan, and other Asian countries. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 47 Global patent portfolio 2. Intellectual property rights utilization In addition to securing intellectual property rights for its inventions and other proprietary developments, Casio works to ensure freedom of operations by preventing legal claims from other companies and earns profits by licensing its technologies to other companies (including cross licensing). The company also uses intellectual property as a barrier to deter other companies from entering the same business, and carries out activities to establish competitive advantage for corporate management. In particular, Casio takes stringent measures to combat counterfeit products, and cooperates with government agencies to remove fakes from the marketplace. 3. Patent expert system Casio initiated a patent expert system in 1994 in order to promote the ongoing creation of outstanding intellectual property. With the aim of business strengthening through stronger intellectual property, engineers with high-level understanding of technologies and leadership skills have been assigned to each division as patent experts. While cooperating with the Intellectual Property Department from positions within their respective divisions, these patent experts work to strengthen the intellectual property abilities Meeting for patent experts of their respective organizations. Here are details of specific activities. 1. Patent activity planning based on ascertainment of technology and development trends at Casio and other companies, as well as target management 2. Discovering and updating inventions 3. Evaluation of patent applications, determination of direction for patent creation according to business strategy, as well as evaluation of patent maintenance 4. Surveys of patents at other companies, patent infringement avoidance, and patent risk management 5. Creation of new businesses centered on intellectual property CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 48 4. Techno Power Casio's in-house Techno Power technology exhibition began in 1992 and is held annually to stimulate engineers, and foster sharing and cross-fertilization of technology. By creating a place for engineers to present their results to top management, and an opportunity for outstanding engineers and designers to receive recognition (i.e., awards based on the suitability of intellectual property results), the exhibition is a source of pride and motivation for engineers and encourages them to take on the challenge of Techno Power exhibition developing new technologies. 5. Invention award system Since 1968, Casio has had an award system for those employees that contribute to inventions and designs. By increasing the incentive for inventors and designers, the system fosters the desire for in-house engineers to take on the challenge of discovering new technologies. In accordance with Article 35 (Inventions by Employees) of Japan's revised Patent Act, which took effect in April 2005, Casio has revised its environment for employee inventors. It updated its intellectual property rules and created a consultation process in which the employee inventors can voice opinions in the revision of the rules. It also implemented a system for employee inventors to file an objection to monetary reward amounts. The rules are revised as needed to respond to the expectations of employee inventors and adapt to the changing times and evolving environment. 6. Intellectual property training system In order to create a stronger awareness about the acquisition of intellectual property, Casio holds intellectual property seminars to deepen employee understanding and interest in intellectual property. The company also distributes relevant information online (through intellectual property website content), and uses outside educational organizations such as the Japan Intellectual Property Association and the Japan Institute of Invention and Innovation. In this way, the company is promoting various intellectual property education activities. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 49 7. Brand support activities Protecting rights to the Casio brand In order to promote smooth corporate operations on a global level, Casio has obtained 1,874 registered trademarks in 187 countries around the world, most of which are product trademarks, in order to protect the Casio brand. To further strengthen protection of rights to the Casio trademark, the company has been seeking official recognition of the Casio mark as a well-known trademark in various countries. This type of certification has already been obtained in several emerging countries. In recent years there have been more trademark applications by other companies—mainly in emerging economies such as China and India—which try to mimic the well-known Casio brand. As a result Casio has been strengthening its monitoring activities and its efforts to prevent the trademarking of look-alike brands. Trademarking of the Casio Brand Design rights acquisition (as of March 31, 2015) Casio has registered the Casio brand for product trademarks in the countries indicated in blue. In the countries indicated in yellow, trademark examination has been delayed in some fields, there is no trademark registration system, or applications are not being accepted due to the politician situation. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 50 Activities for minimizing risk entailed by new product naming and design, as well as rights acquisition While avoiding the risk of infringing upon the design or trademark rights of other companies, Casio is actively promoting business support activities based on the strengthening of Casio's own design and trademark rights. Design rights acquisition (as of March 31, 2015) Trademark rights acquisition (as of March 31, 2015) Counterfeit product removal and consumer protection activities The development of information and communications technology in recent years has facilitated the extensive spread of counterfeit goods on the Internet. Casio products are no exception to the damage caused by counterfeits. In order to guard consumers from the damage of fake products and to protect the Casio brand and increase its value, Casio has established a department tasked with counterfeit countermeasures and is taking action to get counterfeits off the market. Casio will continue to actively cooperate with efforts by government authorities to stamp out counterfeits by exposing factories that make counterfeit goods and stores that sell them, intercepting counterfeits at customs, and monitoring and eliminating counterfeits sold on the Internet. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 51 Casio has established an organization dedicated to customer satisfaction which reports directly to the president and is pursuing greater customer satisfaction by implementing its basic policy consisting of three major customer satisfaction initiatives.

Now the entire process has been unified and maintenance sped up by having the Japanese headquarters perform the information maintenance directly. Online support sites Online support sites CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 61 Casio's primary mission is to deliver the products desired by customers at the right time. The company is working to strengthen its global supply chain, and to continue providing cutting-edge products without interruption. Approach to stable product supply Delivering a stable supply of products to consumers is one of the most important responsibilities of a manufacturer, and is required to ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty. As part of Casio's mission to provide delight, happiness, and pleasure to customers through its innovative products, the company is promoting the following policies. Policies on Stable Product Supply 1. We strive to shorten production lead-time and improve planning and execution accuracy by using IT to optimize the supply chain (procurement-production-logistics-sales-service). 2. We build good relationships with component suppliers to ensure stable procurement. 3. We maintain the flexibility needed to address various risks involved in manufacturing by: building a production system with at least two production sites for each product; producing multiple products and improving capacity for high-mix/low-volume production at each Casio Group production site maintaining in-house production and inlining of key devices and components. Supply network is highly responsive to changes in demand Casio uses supply chain management (SCM) at production sites in response to changes in market conditions and demand for high-mix/lowvolume product offerings, seeking to speed up the planning cycle and provide a stable supply of salable products. Specific initiatives include efforts to standardize work processes such as parts delivery controls, materials warehouse management, and manufacturing process management. Casio aims to achieve integrated manufacturing (total optimization) by using the same systems and same methods at different production sites. These initiatives are necessary to increase shipment precision, shorten production lead times, and shrink unused assets, and are already becoming mission-critical systems. The timepiece business in particular, which conducts production at multiple sites, in Yamagata (Japan), China, and Thailand, must respond rapidly to the changing environment in each region. Smooth operation of SCM enables the deployment of standardized IT tools and production equipment as well as the appropriate distribution of supply capacity. Casio will move to multisite production in other product categories in the future and build an even more sophisticated SCM system. Diversifying production risk and producing core components in-house Casio maintains a stable supply of products by having each production site manufacture multiple product items, and by ensuring that two different sites can produce any given Casio product. The company is also increasing the internal production of components in order to protect newly created technologies and to reduce parts procurement risk. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 62 Production sites for individual products Highlight Casio's new plant in Nakhonratchasima, Thailand, is located on high ground, making it less susceptible to floods. Casio has added the new plant to its existing major production sites with a view to enhancing business continuity planning (BCP) and diversifying risk through global manufacturing. Casio will continue to expand the plant’s production scale and functions. In fiscal 2015, Casio started production of calculators and electronic dictionaries at a new third plant on the site, in order to provide a more stable, high-mix supply of products. Casio Thailand CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 63 Casio procures various materials from a large number of suppliers in and outside Japan. In order to develop long-term business relationships based on its Procurement Policies, Casio is working to strengthen CSR activities across its entire supply chain, while improving measures for proper transactions. Socially responsible procurement at Casio Casio has established Procurement Policies in order to execute its social responsibility to conduct fair and equitable transactions throughout the supply chain. The policies cover matters including legal compliance, respecting human rights, labor, safety, and health, as well as environmental protection such as biodiversity preservation and risk control of chemical contents and information security. Casio constantly improves its socially responsible procurement by obtaining the understanding and support of suppliers for the policies and building strong partnerships. Procurement Policies Casio aims to fulfill its social responsibilities, including compliance with relevant laws and social norms, and protection of the environment, through fair and equitable transactions throughout the supply chain by strengthening partnership with suppliers. 1. Fair and equitable transactions Casio carries out fair and equitable transactions by providing equal opportunities to all suppliers (and candidates) in and outside Japan in accordance with its internally established procedures. 2. Compliance with laws and social norms Casio's procurement activities comply with all relevant laws, social norms, standards and treaties worldwide, including the protection of human rights, the prohibition of child labor, forced labor and discrimination, and avoiding the use of conflict minerals, and respect for freedom of association, the right to associate, and the right to collective bargaining, as well as ensure that absolutely no contact is made with organized criminal elements. Therefore, Casio requires its suppliers to observe the same legal and social requirements. 3. Environmental protection Casio helps to protect the global environment through environmentally friendly procurement, which is based on the Casio Environmental Vision and Casio's Environmental Declaration, in cooperation with suppliers. 4. Strengthening partnership with suppliers Casio builds up relationship of trust with its suppliers through reciprocal efforts, such as merging and complementing mutual technological development abilities, supply chain cooperation, compliance with laws and social norms and protection of the global environment, which will benefit both parties. 5. Policies on supplier selection and transaction continuation Casio initiates and continues transactions with suppliers based on comprehensive evaluation criteria, which include compliance with laws and social norms, environmental protection, proper information security, respect for intellectual property, sound and stable corporate management, superior technological development ability, right price and quality, stable supply capabilities and electronic transaction systems. 6. Securing right price and quality Casio endeavors to secure right price and quality in order to provide its customers with stable supply of optimal products, CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 64 which ensures that Casio gains the full confidence of customers around the world. 7. Prohibition of personal-interest relationships Casio does not allow any employees to have personal-interest relationships with any suppliers. Fulfilling social responsibilities together with suppliers In order to ensure compliance with the Procurement Policies together with its suppliers, Casio has established the Supplier Guidelines (available at link below). All of Casio's suppliers in Japan and elsewhere have agreed to these guidelines to help Casio fulfill its social responsibilities. Casio is also managing its supply chain more successfully by introducing a regular monitoring system that ensures that these guidelines are properly fulfilled. Supplier Guidelines Disseminating supplier guidelines Casio carries out the majority of its production outside Japan at Casio plants and manufacturing subcontractors (electronic manufacturing services). Every year, Casio holds briefings on its Procurement Policies in Southern China. Initially, these briefings simply involved Casio explaining its business policies to suppliers and asking them to undertake initiatives. Since fiscal 2010, however, Casio has been using these briefings as an opportunity for two-way communication. Suppliers are invited to participate actively, for instance by asking those with exemplary CSR initiatives to present examples of their efforts to promote and improve CSR. This enables the sharing of useful case studies and know-how for addressing CSR. By working collaboratively with its suppliers in this way, Casio is continually improving the level of CSR performance in its supply chain. In June 2009, Casio revised the Basic Business Agreement it signs with suppliers in Japan. Clauses were added to require measures such as legal compliance, respect for human rights, and environmental protection. The new agreement is being rolled out steadily. Briefing on Procurement Policies Award ceremony at Presentation of exemplary the Procurement Policies briefing CSR implementation and improvement by a supplier Voice of a supplier who presented a case study of improvement At TechnoPLAS (HK) Ltd., we have been using CSR activities to enhance a sense of belonging among employees and to fulfill our corporate responsibilities. We have built an even stronger partnership with Casio, while supporting Casio's Procurement Policies. Our company will continue to actively engage in CSR activities. Seiji Tanigawa Techno Group Sales DIV. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 65 Comprehensive management of CSR performance In fiscal 2008, Casio started conducting a questionnaire survey* of principal suppliers in Japan on CSR performance in order to confirm the status of CSR procurement. In fiscal 2010, the survey was expanded to include suppliers in China and Thailand. Based on the fiscal 2012 survey results and changes in society’s expectations, the questionnaire for suppliers was revised in fiscal 2013. Overlapping questions were eliminated and a new theme, policies for avoiding conflict minerals, was added. The fiscal 2015 questionnaire was sent to 226 companies in Japan, and 223 responses were received, for a response rate of 99% (same as in fiscal 2014). In China and Thailand, responses were received from 283 companies, for a response rate of almost 100%. The great concern for CSR fulfillment among suppliers is clear. Casio compiles and analyses the response data, and shares the results with suppliers, along with Casio's approach to CSR procurement. Since fiscal 2011, Casio has been conducting onsite audits of major suppliers in China and Thailand with local staff members of the CSR promotion projects launched at sites in those countries. In fiscal 2012, the company started planning onsite inspections performed mainly by local Casio staff, and the number of visits is increasing. In fiscal 2015, Casio conducted onsite inspections at 9 companies in China, where it has cumulatively covered 69.4% of suppliers on a trade value basis since onsite inspections began. In Thailand, it conducted onsite inspections at 6 companies. Even with the suspension in inspections caused by the flooding, it has covered 58.6% of suppliers in Thailand on a trade value basis. Going forward, Casio will continue onsite inspections with the aim of instilling commitment to CSR throughout the supply chain. * The questionnaire was prepared in accordance with a Supplier Checklist for CSR Procurement based upon the Guidebook for Supply Chain Implementation of CSR Procurement published by the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA). It covered: (1) human rights and labor conditions; (2) health and safety; (3) the environment; (4) fair transactions and ethics; (5) quality and consumer safety; (6) information security; and (7) social contribution. Improving CSR across the supply chain Supplier message By providing outstanding semiconductor products driven by advanced technology and sincere service, the Renesas Electronics Group is helping to create a future that can fulfill the dreams of people worldwide. To help build a more sustainable society, we are complying with all relevant laws and regulations while working in good faith and with a high sense of ethics based on our CSR charter. We will continue to support the Procurement Policies of Casio, and we will work with Casio to step up CSR performance. Renesas will take more initiative while striving to be an even better partner.

They are called conflict minerals because of their potential to promote conflict, human rights violations, and environmental destruction. Wanting no part in human rights violations and environmental destruction, Casio’s stance is to completely avoid the use of conflict minerals. The group will continue its efforts to avoid the use of such minerals by working closely with suppliers. In January 2013, Casio revised its Procurement Policies and Supplier Guidelines, adding a ban on the use of conflict minerals. A question about policies to avoid the use of conflict minerals was also added to the CSR questionnaire sent to suppliers in Japan. In fiscal 2014, Casio group companies surveyed suppliers worldwide about the use of conflict minerals, using the EICC & GeSI* Conflict Minerals Reporting Template. The 255 companies that reported no use of conflict minerals (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) in fiscal 2014 were left out of the fiscal 2015 survey. As a result, 312 responses were received in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2014, the first year of the survey, many companies reported conflict mineral use as unknown. In the second year, there was a noticeable shift towards yes or no responses, rather than unknown. There are inherent difficulties in conflict mineral investigation, as strict survey implementation requires going all the way back up the supply chain to the smelters. Casio will continue to collect relevant information including customer reactions and industry trends in the US, EU and other regions. Casio's policy is to permit use of minerals legally mined in the DRC and neighboring countries, as long as they have no connection to conflict in the region. * Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI): An international strategic partnership to create and promote technologies and practices for economic, environmental and social sustainability, working with members from major information and communication technology (ICT) companies and organizations. Subcontract Act compliance initiatives Casio has established a Compliance Committee on Japan's Act against Delay in Payment of Subcontract Proceeds, Etc., to Subcontractors (Subcontract Act) which includes group companies, and is striving to ensure all transactions comply with the law. Under the annual basic plan of the Committee, each group company in Japan drafts its own action plan, and maintains proper transactions with subcontractors based on the use of PDCA cycles. In particular, employees that deal directly with suppliers and outsourcers are provided with the necessary knowledge through in-house seminars and classes sponsored by the relevant government authorities. In fiscal 2015, 3,601 Casio employees attended in-house seminars, and 52 people also participated in classes sponsored by the Japan Fair Trade Commission and by the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency. This training helped to raise compliance awareness and provided employees with the knowledge they need. Various efforts were made to encourage understanding, such as conducting training sessions with original teaching materials prepared to suit the unique transaction conditions of various group companies. The Compliance Committee also obtains the latest information from government websites and email notification services, and sends the information directly to committee members. The news is also posted on the committee's website, and shared with the entire group. In offices where subcontract transactions are handled, independent audits are carried out on an ongoing basis. Casio confirms that proper, compliant transactions are executed, by inspecting the document record of the entire series of transactions from ordering to payment. The goal is to ensure that no problems occur. In fiscal 2011, group companies drew up their own action plans under the basic plan of the Subcontract Act Compliance Committee, establishing courses of action for maintaining proper subcontracting transactions using the PDCA cycle. Casio will continue to promote understanding of the Subcontract Act among its employees, and work to strengthen its system for even better compliance. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 67 Casio discloses information promptly and fairly to shareholders and investors, and always strives to increase shareholder returns. Basic policy for shareholder returns Casio considers the maintenance and expansion of returns for all of its shareholders an important management issue, and constantly strives to improve its business performance and financial structure. The company's dividend policy calls for maintaining stable dividends, and Casio determines the allocation of profit by taking into account all factors such as profit levels, financial position, the dividend payout ratio, and future business development and forecasts. Considering this policy, Casio paid dividends of ¥ 35 per share in fiscal 2015. This was an increase of ¥ 10 over the previous fiscal year. Casio again plans to pay dividends of ¥ 35 per share in fiscal 2016. Inclusion in an SRI Index Morningstar Socially Responsible Investment Index (MS-SRI) Casio Computer Co., Ltd., is included in the Morningstar Socially Responsible Investment Index (MS-SRI). Morningstar Japan selects 150 companies from among all listed companies in Japan based on their social responsibility track records, and indexes their stock prices (January 2015). Communication with shareholders and investors IR events Every quarter, Casio holds a financial results briefing for institutional investors and securities analysts on the same day that the company announces its results. The president or the director responsible for investor relations is the main speaker at these briefings, and explains the financial results and forecasts. Casio also holds meetings with institutional investors and analysts worldwide, while occasionally providing factory tours and business briefings. Improving IR publications To provide IR information for shareholders and investors, the company issues an Annual Report, semiannual business reports (Japanese only), and quarterly Consolidated Financial Results. Casio's Investor Relations website also features these publications and other IR information. Casio also updates its Investor Relations site in a timely fashion to reflect market changes and make the information more accessible and useful. Investor Relations Reaching out to individual shareholders and investors Casio is carrying out various initiatives in order to deepen the understanding individual investors and shareholders have of its business. At its General Meeting of Shareholders, the company described its main products and key businesses. On the Japanese Investor Relations website, a section was added specifically for individual investors in an effort to make information disclosure clearer. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 68 At Casio, the human resources mission is organized around two themes: contributing to the development of the company through the growth of all employees based on their desire to always take on challenges and make improvements; and achieving both corporate development and employee growth under optimal conditions. Respect for Human Rights Global Human Resources Strategy Casio has established a basic policy on Casio has started creating a global human respect for human rights. Casio works to resources strategy as it looks to further raise awareness of human rights while expand its business outside Japan. thoroughly implementing the policy group-wide. Casio is also creating a framework for human rights due diligence. Building Workplaces for a Diverse Workforce Creating Supportive Workplaces Casio has launched a diversity project Casio develops various support systems and focused on enabling all employees to is committed to creating a culture of mutual perform at their full potential and reach even acceptance of diverse styles of working. greater heights.

The with peace of mind. company uses a merit-driven system combined with a performance-based approach to evaluate employees and determine compensation. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 69 Casio established the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights on July 1, 2014. Casio strives to raise awareness of human rights while thoroughly implementing the policy throughout the group. Casio is also creating a framework for human rights due diligence. Policy on Respect for Human Rights Casio recognizes respect for human rights as an important CSR issue as it continues to expand its business globally. Accordingly, it is stepping up its efforts in this area based on international norms relating to human rights. Since December 2010, Casio has been a signatory to and participated in the UN Global Compact, which consists of 10 principles related to human rights, labour, environment, and anti-corruption advocated by the United Nations. Moreover, Casio long ago spelled out its commitment to the prohibition of discrimination, the prohibition of child and forced labor, and the prohibition of harassment in the Casio Group Code of Conduct and put that commitment into practice. In June 2013, as part of an overall reconsideration of the content of the code, Casio revised its Code of Conduct, explicitly stating a commitment to uphold and respect international norms relating to human rights, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to respect basic labor rights. Recognizing the importance of ensuring effectively functioning global governance related to respect for human rights going forward, Casio held dialogues with group employees outside Japan and experts*1 in the process of drafting the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights. The policy specifies, among other things, the group’s commitment to supporting and respecting international codes of conduct for human rights, including the International Bill of Human Rights (Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR)), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work from the International Labour Organization (ILO). It also specifies the group’s commitment to carrying out initiatives related to respect for human rights based on the UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and to continuously performing human rights due diligence*2 after the framework for that purpose is established. From here on, Casio will thoroughly communicate this policy throughout the group and carry out initiatives in accordance with it. Casio also recognizes the importance of spreading the idea of respect for human rights outside its organization together with its entire supply chain. All suppliers have been made aware of Casio’s Supplier Guidelines, which clearly mandate respect for human rights and prohibit discrimination. In addition to requesting compliance, Casio strives to verify implementation using questionnaires and other means. *1 See the feature story, “Casio’s Commitment to Human Rights” in the 2013 Sustainability Report for details. *2 Human rights due diligence refers to the continuous process for recognizing, avoiding and mitigating any negative impacts Casio has on society using preventative means. Casio Group Code of Conduct Casio Group Policy on Human Rights Responsibilities to Suppliers Creating and using a tool for checking the status of human rights Casio has been taking stock of human rights issues since 2012, using ISO 26000 as a guide. In order to strengthen its due diligence, Casio sought the advice of experts and, in February 2014, created its own tool for checking the status of human rights, taking the Danish Institute for Human Rights’ Human Rights Compliance Assessment Quick Check as a reference. Casio will use the new tool to make effective assessments and conduct education relating to human rights. Using the tool, Casio took stock of the status of initiatives addressing human rights issues at Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and at group companies in and outside Japan in fiscal 2015. The secretariat performed issue analysis based on the gathered data, and the results were provided as feedback to the group companies. Going forward, it will analyze the issues at its head office and use the PDCA cycle to make improvements at each site based on the results in an effort to enhance human rights due diligence throughout the group. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 70 Education and awareness raising Casio provides internal education for Casio Computer Co., Ltd., and group companies in and outside Japan, in order to instill awareness of respect for human rights. A CSR learning program conducted in August 2014 focused on respect for human rights as an important topic. Participants studied documents such as the Casio Group Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights established in July 2014, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The program also evaluated the employee comprehension of the material. Meanwhile, Casio invited Keiichi Ushijima, CCaSS Leader at Ernst & Young Japan, to the CSR Committee meeting in May 2015. He gave a lecture entitled, Business and Human Rights, and discussed the background and global trends concerning the growing importance of human rights in business, as well as how Japanese companies should approach human rights issues in a global era. His lecture included human rights issues he had encountered in the past, and his experience dealing with them. The talk enabled the committee to further deepen its understanding of human rights for business. In addition, education on human rights is conducted during training sessions at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., for new hires as well as before and after promotions or appointment as a manager. Preventing sexual harassment and power harassment Casio has stipulated in the Casio Group Code of Conduct that it will not engage in any acts that ignore individuality, and will not countenance sexual harassment and power harassment. The company has issued Guidelines to Prevent Sexual Harassment and established a hotline. A full-time hotline officer is available to respond to issues raised by telephone, fax, e-mail and postal mail, demonstrating Casio’s determination to prevent harassment and quickly address any issues which arise. Moreover, in its employment regulations, Casio has specified that persons who commit sexual harassment or power harassment will be subject to discipline. Awareness of preventing harassment is especially stressed in training sessions for managers. Establishment of employee hotline Casio has established a special hotline on the company’s intranet for employee concerns and inquiries on corporate culture, human relations, pay and working conditions. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 71 Casio is reinforcing its global expansion in all business fields, including existing and new businesses. In light of its continuing business expansion outside Japan, Casio has started creating a global human resources strategy. This project includes the enhancement of human resources functions at group companies outside Japan and the establishment of a system for developing human resources who are prepared to meet global standards. Vision of global talent Casio’s employees around the world must always think from the headquarters’ perspective in order to demonstrate leadership. The human resources department uses various opportunities and tools to convey and share with employees messages on the importance of thinking of Japan as just one area in the world and of changing one’s mindset to work with a global outlook. Example: Company intranet C’s ☆ CAFÉ “Vision of Global Talent” CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 72 CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 73 Example: Message from the officer responsible for human resources in the company newsletter Establishment of standards for the roles of persons sent on assignment outside Japan It is important to increase the number of human resources with the aptitude for assignment outside Japan. At the same time, however, Casio is endeavoring to develop local employees and create more opportunities for their promotion. It does this by sending people on assignments outside Japan only to perform roles that cannot be done by local employees and by clarifying their division of roles with local employees. Casio will establish a table of standards and develop a check system to enable its employees around the world to shine by placing the right people in the right jobs. Example: Image of the use of the table of standards for the roles of persons sent on assignment outside Japan CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 74 Establishment of a structure for developing employees in Japan who can play an active role on the world stage Casio is committed to accelerating the globalization of employees in Japan in terms of recruitment, placement, and development. In 2013, Casio established the stage-based human resources development system described below. At present, Casio is enhancing the educational content at each stage and deepening coordination between stages in an effort to create systematic human resources development. Positioning of stage-based education Casio implements measures such as the following at each stage in order to achieve this kind of human resources development. Provision of local information to persons going on assignment outside Japan and development of multicultural management skills Casio systematically provides grade-based training to persons going on assignment outside Japan according to their mission at the location of assignment. In fiscal 2014, it added Training for Presidents outside Japan for top management, Site Management Skills Training for senior management, and Multicultural Management Skills Training and Assignment Location Situation for all persons going on assignment outside Japan. Additionally, in 2014 Casio stepped up safety measures, the provision of educational information for accompanying children, and other efforts to strengthen on-location living support.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 75 Training system before assignment outside Japan CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 76 In the Multicultural Management Skills Training, members of completely different ages and assignment locations engaged in heated debate, revealing their enthusiasm for going on assignment outside Japan. The educational content was made more practical by engaging participants in discussions of issues that seem likely to actually occur and by learning the specific stories of the instructors’ experiences. Training for Presidents outside Japan provided education to candidates for positions as future presidents of companies outside Japan. The training was held twice in 2014 for six persons. Nearly all the participants were extremely satisfied with the training, which included systematic lectures covering not only management but also the roles of presidents outside Japan and the thinking of business managers as well as case studies based on real-life examples. Casio will continue to enhance the education it provides to persons who will be appointed as presidents to raise their awareness as business managers and convey the importance of management. Improvement of global business skills in candidates for assignments outside Japan (registered candidates) Casio is registering candidates for assignments outside Japan more systematically than ever before and will put into effect systematic education, including global aptitude checks and acquisition of necessary skills, with a view to sending candidates on assignments a few years later. Encouraging all employees working in Japan to adopt a global mindset Casio holds seminars to help employees working in Japan to become more comfortable communicating in English with non-Japanese people. The goal is for all employees, whether in Japan or outside Japan, to conduct business with global standards in mind. In order to promote more systematic development of human resources prepared to work outside Japan, Casio will continue to implement screening and personnel development measures. This includes checking employees for global adaptability, as well as helping them to improve strengths and overcome weaknesses through training and to learn the necessary skills. Global career path In order to continuously develop global human resources, it is not enough to use a direct approach from the human resources department to employees; people who can develop global human resources must be developed and promoted as managers so that employees can grow through their work in the field. Accordingly, Casio has developed its conventional career path into a global career path. So that employees in addition to those involved in sales outside Japan will have even a broader perspective, the company has enhanced personnel placement to give employees wide-ranging experience before they become section chiefs, department managers, and division managers. This approach will be used in future human resources development and placement planning. Example: Company intranet C’s ☆ CAFÉ Global career path (sales) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 77 Strengthening human resources functions at group companies outside Japan The strengthening of human resources functions is becoming an increasingly important issue at group companies outside Japan, which are increasing in number and growing in size rapidly around the world with the continued expansion of Casio’s business outside Japan. In this environment, Casio is working at enhancing human resources functions throughout the group, ensuring that they reflect the shared Casio corporate creed, by sharing its global human resources philosophy and know-how. This effort includes restructuring human resources systems to make them suitable to each company, taking into consideration each country’s values, laws, and other characteristics. Global human resources governance system Casio actively engages in exchanges of opinions on what the Casio Group perspective should be about local problems and circumstances. The headquarters human resource division also directly dialogues with and provides advice on system design to members of human resources departments at local companies. Global human resources meeting In fiscal 2015, Casio held a global human resources meeting to foster discussion with HR managers from group companies outside Japan. The aim was to share Casio’s global HR approach, ensure further penetration of the Casio philosophy, and ascertain HR issues at sites outside Japan. The participants were very satisfied with the meeting and provided feedback such as, “I’d like to put into practice all the things I have learned here,” and “We were able to strengthen communication among HR managers, and a sense of group-wide unity has been created.” This initial meeting was held for managers from group sales companies outside Japan, and the next meeting in fiscal 2016 will be for managers from group production companies overseas. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 78 Some progress has been attained through various activities led by the Working Group for Female Employee Advancement as the first step in promoting diversity. Casio has now launched a Diversity Project that, starting in fiscal 2014, is focusing on enabling all employees—including seniors, persons with disabilities, and non-Japanese employees, not just women—to perform at their full potential and reach even greater heights. Launch of the Diversity Project Casio has launched a Diversity Project in which employees participate. The goal of the project is to create conditions where all employees can work enthusiastically and enjoy job satisfaction, regardless of gender, nationality, age, or level of ability. Working groups on women, seniors, persons with disabilities, and non-Japanese employees are promoting positive actions. Supporting advancement of female employees Casio actively and continuously carries out a variety of measures with the aim of supporting all female employees so that they can fully demonstrate their abilities. Casio actively promotes ambitious and talented employees, and the number of women in senior staff positions increased from four in fiscal 2011 to 20 in fiscal 2014. In fiscal 2015, a career forum for female employees was held as part of the Diversity Project’s focus on women. About 40 women attended the event. The forum was planned as an opportunity for female employees to meet women in management at Casio and other companies in the same industry. Since there are fewer women who can serve as manager role models within each workplace than men, the aim was to introduce female role models as a reference for possible future work styles and career development. An external instructor was invited to give the keynote speech and spoke on the topic of career design. The panel discussion that followed featured three female manager panelists including one from another company. They spoke candidly about their careers and work methods, as well as their struggles to balance work and family responsibilities, and then enthusiastically answered questions from the audience. Finally, everyone broke into smaller group discussions headed by the lecturer or a panelist. It was a valuable opportunity for some women at Casio who have few female associates in their workplace to share their questions and concerns. Additionally, Casio also adopted a mentor program with the aim of easing anxiety and supporting career development by offering advice for balancing work and family life and for career advancement. The company has heard back from female employees that these initiatives have eased the anxiety that they had few role models and that it is difficult to sketch a career plan.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 79 Hiring and encouraging non-Japanese employees to play active roles Aiming to stimulate and internationalize the company, Casio is actively hiring foreign students studying in Japan who wish to work at Casio. During the selection process, Casio makes careful efforts to prevent disadvantages at the time of selection resulting from insufficient understanding of information due to differences in language, culture, and customs. (The company has hired foreign students studying in Japan every year since 2012.) In fiscal 2014, Casio established a Diversity Project working group including non-Japanese employees who are already playing active roles and sought to improve the company’s systems from their point of view. Casio is working hard to build an environment in which non-Japanese employees can feel secure about continuing to work for a long time after joining the company. At present, Casio’s non-Japanese employees are playing active roles while displaying their individuality in many kinds of workplaces. Improved menu signage in the cafeteria Even for non-Japanese employees who are proficient in Japanese, it can be difficult to understand the names of food ingredients and cooking methods. Accordingly, Casio now displays cafeteria menus in both Japanese and English. This has also enabled employees of group companies and suppliers outside Japan who are visiting Japan on business, as well, to use the cafeteria more freely. Additionally, for the benefit of people with dietary restrictions due to religious precepts, menu displays now also include illustrations making it clear what kind of meat is used in each dish. Pork mark English menu descriptions (bottom); chicken and fish marks (upper right) New system of leave for returning to one’s home country Casio grants special leave to non-Japanese employees in Japan so that they can participate from time to time in important events in their home countries and to create opportunities for them to see their family and relatives in their home countries once every several years. Until now it was possible for non-Japanese employee to use paid vacation to return home, but establishing a system has made it easier for them to take leave by clarifying the purpose. Establishment of a prayer room Casio has prepared a room with space for Muslim employees to put down a prayer rug and pray. Description of applications to update one’s status of residence in Japan Non-Japanese employees must apply to update their status of residence in Japan every five years. Employees had to collect all the necessary documents and make a request to the company, and sometimes the procedures were difficult to understand. Accordingly, Casio has put up a description of the procedures on its company intranet. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 80 Working together with persons with disabilities Casio hires people who display creativity and have the desire to work and take on challenges, regardless of any disabilities they may have. The company is creating workplace environments that allow every individual to display their full abilities and aptitudes. Upon request, it provides hands-on training in the workplace before hiring in an effort to dispel anxiety about actually working there and to eliminate gaps between expectations and reality. Casio has also adopted and uses a follow-up system for persons with disabilities throughout the group. This system is intended to constantly aim for the most suitable environment in light of the opinions of both the workplace and persons with disabilities by conducting periodic interviews after a person with disabilities joins the company so they are not left alone to face any anxieties or problems. The interviews help to quickly resolve any problems, check aptitude for work duties based on actual performance of those duties, and facilitate the provision of care if a disability has changed with the passage of time. This also helps to relieve the anxieties of the families and former schools of employees with disabilities. These kinds of initiatives have been commended by public institutions and featured in a DVD produced by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government introducing superior companies that it endorses. The system has led to the resolution of many problems, and employees with disabilities themselves have said it is comforting to have such a system in place. Casio also invites sign language interpreters to company events to help convey information to the hearing impaired and makes active use of job-related assistive tools from public institutions. A working group in the Diversity Project is advancing community development for persons with disabilities. It is carrying out initiatives aimed at making Casio an easier place to keep working by incorporating the opinions of persons with disabilities regarding issues such as environmental retrofitting focused on ensuring safety, measures to increase awareness in workplaces where persons with disabilities work, and measures to further establish their position in the workplace. Furthermore, Casio introduced commuting support measures for employees with disabilities, thereby allowing them to work staggered hours. The aim was to reduce obstacles and secure safety during commuting, according to the nature of the employee’s disability. This move was in response to requests from employees with disabilities, and also addressed legal requirements to prevent discrimination against people with disabilities by providing reasonable accommodation of their needs. The company aims to create an environment in which all Casio employees can work enthusiastically and enjoy job satisfaction, regardless of level of ability. In this way, Casio actively hires people who display creativity and have the desire to work and take on challenges, and gives them a stage on which to play an active role. Percent of workforce with disabilities As of April 1, 2013 As of April 1, 2014 As of April 1, 2015 Average for consolidated group companies in Japan 1.84% 1.95% 1.95% Encouraging the hiring of seniors / supporting the lives and employment of seniors Casio has a Senior Employee Program to provide retirement-age employees with employment opportunities, and to effectively utilize the skills and know-how that these individuals have accumulated over the course of their careers. It revised this program following amendment of the Act for Stabilization of Employment of Older Persons in fiscal 2014. Under the post-revision program, Casio offers continued employment with reasonable treatment according to past performance and the roles and responsibilities assumed after retirement age. The system creates workplaces where seniors can continue using their career skills and expertise within the Casio group. In fiscal 2015, Casio launched the Second Career Working Group as part of its Diversity Project. Together with members of the working group, which includes senior employees, the company has been incorporating opinions from the perspective of the persons concerned into discussions. In fiscal 2015, mechanism improvements were made as part of efforts to create systems and an environment where employees can work with enthusiasm regardless of age. Clarifying roles when hiring senior employees Casio decided to clarify the procedure for re-hiring employees reaching retirement. The aim is further strengthen the potential of senior employees and to ensure job satisfaction after re-employment at a new compensation level. The company must now describe the skills and experience of each individual concerned, along with the corresponding job description, role, and expectations. These must be clearly documented and presented with the compensation conditions at time of re-employment. Raising awareness of the need for career planning when looking ahead to retirement and re-employment When employees reach mandatory retirement age and become eligible for re-employment as a senior employee, their roles and compensation levels will change. Therefore, Casio believes that it is necessary for employees to prepare in advance a forward-looking career plan, in order to continue working enthusiastically during the retirement transition from a regular position to re-employment as a CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 81 Establishment of a structure for developing employees in Japan who can play an active role on the world stage Casio is committed to accelerating the globalization of employees in Japan in terms of recruitment, placement, and development.

In fiscal 2014, it added Training for Presidents outside Japan for top management, Site Management Skills Training for senior management, and Multicultural Management Skills Training and Assignment Location Situation for all persons going on assignment outside Japan. Additionally, in 2014 Casio stepped up safety measures, the provision of educational information for accompanying children, and other efforts to strengthen on-location living support. senior employee. Senior Life Seminars are held each year for employees who have reached the ages of 53 and 58, in order to raise awareness of retirement life planning at an early stage. For employees aged 53, an external instructor provides a lecture on personal finance planning covering things such as the pension system, post-retirement living expenses, taxes, and healthcare costs. Now, information on career development planning is also provided with a view to re-employment at Casio once the mandatory retirement age is reached. The seminar has been well received by employees, one of whom indicated it helped him to clarify his goals for the coming seven years through retirement. Prioritizing local hiring and promotion at subsidiaries outside Japan Along with the globalization of its operations, Casio is actively pursuing local hiring at its sites outside Japan. The aim is to promote management that is responsive to local conditions in each country, as a truly global company. This is being done not just in manufacturing, but also in various other fields. Number of Casio Group employees * This includes only regular employees Initiatives in hiring The Casio Group Code of Conduct states that we will respect all fundamental human rights, and will not engage in any form of discrimination. Casio provides equal employment opportunities to anyone with the desire to work. Casio also endorses the Japan Business Federation’s charter of hiring ethics. The company strives to avoid early hiring of undergraduate university students to minimize any impact on their studies. It also conducts voluntary explanation meetings at universities around the country and holds hiring events at different times during the day and week, splitting up selection periods into four or five different times.

Casio values close communication between labor and management. At the core of this labor-management communication is the Group Workers' Labor-Management Conference, which is held four times a year (February, May, September, and November). At these conferences, management and labor, together representing the entire group, exchange opinions about current conditions at the company. In addition, close communication is maintained at various other levels, including the Central Labor-Management Meeting, the Division Labor-Management Meeting, and the Sales Chapter Labor-Management Meeting. Casio operates on a union-shop basis; as a rule, all employees except for managers are members of the union. In fiscal 2015, a Consolidated Employee Welfare Committee was set up with members from both labor and management. After investigating ways to create an optimal employee welfare system, a decision was made to completely rebuild Casio's entire system (to be implemented starting in fiscal 2016). Purpose To create an environment where employees can work enthusiastically, and to help employees achieve their top performance. Priority areas for strengthening Health promotion Enhancing health self-management by employees, while maintaining job performance and controlling healthcare costs Supporting employees with nursing care or childcare responsibilities Enabling employees to balance nursing care or childcare and job responsibilities, by creating an environment that lets employees focus on their work Main measures 1) Health: The mobile health check clinic is to be replaced with a new vehicle equipped with digital high-resolution X-ray equipment. Employees 35 and older will have their checkups at a hospital rather than in the mobile clinic, and the gastric examination will be improved with a choice of high-resolution X-ray or endoscope. Employees 40 and older can opt to receive a full medical checkup, partially paid by the employee. 2) Health: Introducing a health promotion incentive system 3) Nursing care: Establishing a consultation service for employees with nursing care responsibilities, holding nursing care seminars, providing financial support to employees who work while performing nursing care at home, and allowing nursing care leave and accumulated leave (for nursing care reasons) to be taken in half-day units 4) Childcare: Introducing a childcare subsidy program for when an employee's child is sick or needs a babysitter 5) Recreation/retreat: Introducing a subsidy program for travel and accommodation expenses CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 86 Casio works to maintain a healthy corporate culture where fairness and impartiality are valued in all promotion decisions. The company uses a merit-driven system combined with a performance-based approach to evaluate employees and determine compensation. Policy for fair evaluation and compensation Based firmly on a foundation of fairness, Casio aims to continuously improve its human resource system in light of changes in the social environment. Within that system, the present basic human resources policy combines a role-based system that grades individual employees based on the extent of their roles with a performance-based approach to evaluation and compensation based mainly on outcomes of job performance within their roles. Additionally, the company puts a premium on the following points of view: ▪ Respect of will: Grant significance to the individual's will and intentions ▪ Human resources development: Create opportunities for the acquisition of knowledge and skills needed in work ▪ Significance of abilities: Grant significance to abilities demonstrated through work ▪ Right person for the right job: Reflect individual wishes in job requests ▪ Priority distribution: Distribute limited management resources as efficiently as possible ▪ Stable employment: Strive to create workplaces where employees can work according to their abilities In addition to the above policy, Casio will place a premium on these points of view as it pushes ahead with innovative personnel measures. By taking this approach, Casio aims to strike the optimal balance between the growth and revitalization of society and the expansion and growth of the company. Casio’s design and application of an impartial personnel system ensures fair rating, evaluation, and compensation according to the level of duties, regardless of academic background, years of service, or gender. Casio feels that goal management is important in its evaluation system and so it has supervisors and their subordinates share goal information via the intranet. Starting in fiscal 2015, goals are also being shared among colleagues in addition superiors and subordinates, which is useful for promoting innovation and synergy. The company evaluates each employee at an interview twice a year. Casio uses evaluation sheets based on goal management to notify employees about the results of evaluations, a mechanism designed to improve transparency and ensure that evaluation of employees is highly credible. Human resources system overview CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 87 Education for fair evaluation and compensation Casio requires managers to take evaluator training in an effort to improve their evaluation, leadership, and interviewing skills, in order to operate its human resources system fairly and appropriately. Additionally, all managers are evaluated by their colleagues and subordinates about once every three years. The results are fed back to managers during training sessions to encourage continual improvement. An overview of the evaluation and compensation system is posted on the company intranet to keep all employees thoroughly informed about this system. The company not only works with evaluators, but has also cooperated with the labor union to produce a Goal Setting and Evaluation Interview Handbook to help deepen understanding between supervisors and their subordinates and ensure fairness in operations. Overview of human resource development Casio has various human resource development programs designed to develop creative employees who are eager to take on challenges and to train professionals with early tracking into specialized fields. Casio aims to develop professionals in the form of strategic generalists who pass on the company's corporate culture, and technical specialists who pass on the company's unique technology and know-how. For this purpose, based on the convictions that people grow through their work and that the source of growth is personal motivation, Casio helps employees improve their skills by providing environments that enable them to overcome challenges through personal determination and effort. Accordingly, the company emphasizes on-the-job (OJT) training to improve practical skills, complemented by off-the-job (off-JT) training to provide theoretical knowledge. In recent years, the training system has been improved to ensure even more effective, efficient skill development via a broader choice of training courses. Training System Casio conducts the necessary training for all the job grades in its in-house ranking system, and the company is working constantly to upgrade and enhance its human resource development system. As part of this system, Casio offers measures to train existing workers to make them professionals and training for specific job grades to all eligible employees. The human resource training page on the company’s intranet explains each system of training as well as showing comments from employees who have used the system. Casio endeavors to encourage utilization of the system and support employee education by presenting success stories and good news. In addition to the system above, Casio holds Senior Life Seminars for employees when they reach the ages of 53 and 58. The seminars help employees to plan their lives after the company retirement age of 60, with information on areas such as retirement career planning, skills development, retirement benefits, and the pension system.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 104 In April 2012, Casio established the Casio Environmental Vision 2050, a long-term environmental management policy with a target year of 2050. At the same time, the company also issued the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020, which is its medium-term action guideline. Casio’s determination to become a leading environmental company is demonstrated by its commitment to visionary global initiatives to help build a more sustainable world. Basic Environmental Policies Casio’s goal is to help build a more sustainable world while contributing to the creation of new markets and cultural phenomenon by developing compact, lightweight, slim, and energy-efficient products. In its Environmental Vision 2050, Casio articulates objectives for environmental management, looking ahead to the year 2050. Serving as a milestone on the road to 2050, the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020 sets out action guidelines with a target year of 2020. Both the Vision and the Declaration share three priorities: (1) realizing a low-carbon society; (2) building a recycling society; and (3) living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity. By working toward these goals, Casio will ensure legal and regulatory compliance , improve the strength of the Casio brand and highlight the advantages of Casio products—all of which help to meet the expectations of various stakeholders, including customers and suppliers. Realizing a low-carbon society In April 2014, the current Japanese government administration approved a resolution on a new Basic Energy Plan. In preparation for the COP21 conference to be held in Paris, France at the end of 2015, the plan includes consideration of new goals for climate change policies beyond the year 2020 as well as international frameworks for achieving those goals. As one of the leading efforts in Japan in this area, Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) issued its Commitment to a Low Carbon Society in April 2013. Casio has announced that it will participate in the Commitment. The company is working hard in the area of energy conservation, seeking to reduce average annual per-unit energy consumption by 1% by 2020. In 2014, Casio began calculating and disclosing its Scope 3 emissions in all categories applicable to Casio's business. The company plans to improve calculation accuracy and set effective goals for CO2 emissions reduction. Building a recycling society As part of efforts to make compact, lightweight, slim, and energy-efficient products, Casio designates products that fulfill its own higher eco product standards as Casio Green Star Products. The company achieved its goal to see these products account for 50% of total fiscal 2015 sales. Now six years since it set certification criteria for Casio Green Star Products in 2009, Casio plans to revise the criteria, taking into consideration environmental priorities that were not contemplated at that time. Meanwhile, Casio will keep working to provide products with even better environmental performance, doing its part to help build a recycling society. Casio will continue to recycle personal computers and rechargeable batteries in compliance with Japan’s Act on the Promotion of Effective Utilization of Resources, while also making voluntary efforts to collect page printer toner and drum sets and NAME LAND cartridges. Casio will also keep developing and designing products that offer greater recyclability, as required under the Small Electronic Appliance Recycling Act. Living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity In March 2011, Casio issued the Casio Group Biodiversity Guidelines. Under these guidelines, the company established a target for implementing impact assessments, aiming to preserve biodiversity. However, group-wide initiatives for the use of sustainable paper did not begin until more recently, so this issue was given greater priority. In CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 105 fiscal 2013, preliminary investigations began into Casio's paper procurement situation, and in June 2015, a Paper Procurement Policy for the Casio Group was established. All the companies of the Casio Group intend to promote activities based on this Paper Procurement Policy, while ensuring that suppliers and other stakeholders are also well aware of it. Through these efforts, Casio will continue to help preserve biodiversity. Conclusion Casio is developing its business globally. Casio is determined to implement its own environmental management policies as it continues to create products that are compact, lightweight, slim, and energy efficient, as well as products which help to realize a paperless society. Casio believes that these activities will further improve the strength of the Casio brand, presenting Casio as a leading environmental company.

has established and is implementing Climate Change Action with mediumand long-term targets to be achieved by fiscal 2051. Mediumand long-term targets The mediumand long-term reduction targets for the Casio Group’s greenhouse gas emissions, which were set based on the Casio Environmental Vision 2050 and the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020, are shown below. Casio group's mediumand long-term targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction Medium-term target： To reduce the total volume of global greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 30% compared to fiscal 2006, by fiscal 2021 Long-term target： To reduce the total volume of global greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 80% compared to fiscal 2006, by fiscal 2051. * Business activities: This indicates activities of production sites and offices in Japan and overseas, and does not include CO2 emissions from logistics, product usage, or employee travel. Managing risks and opportunities As a result of the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and the ensuing accident at the Fukushima nuclear power station, virtually all nuclear power stations across Japan have suspended operations. Japan is faced with such risks as rising electricity tariffs and power shortages in summer and winter. Moreover, the greenhouse gas emission coefficient for electricity has risen as a result of the decline in the utilization of nuclear power generation, resulting in an increase in real CO2 emissions. This translates into greater risk of incurring emissions trading costs under the Ordinance on Environmental Preservation to Secure the Health and Safety of the Tokyo Metropolitan Area (Environmental Preservation Ordinance). Also in 2011, there was major flooding in Thailand, which may be partially attributable to global warming and upstream deforestation. Consequently, global risks have become apparent including threats to the value chain for production and parts. In order to avoid these risks, Casio plans to expand the introduction of renewable energy, and secure alternatives in the value chain. On the other hand, the greenhouse gas reduction effect at time of product usage offered by Casio products which promote paperless lifestyles, such as data projectors and electronic dictionaries, has been identified as a significant opportunity to address climate change over the product life cycle. Casio will work to further expand its business in these products. In order to minimize the various risks mentioned above, and expand opportunities, Casio must contribute to the sustainability of the planet and its human societies. Casio recognizes that this is an extremely important issue for further strengthening its business foundation, and will make even more strenuous efforts in the fight against climate change. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 112 Measures for achieving mediumand long-term targets Casio has set medium and long-term targets for achievement by 2020 and 2050. Among the three areas that the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020 focuses on, Casio will put the highest priority on realizing a low-carbon society. Realizing a low-carbon society The Casio Group will provide products and services that make an even greater contribution to the reduction and absorption of CO2 emissions. In addition to expanding products and services that use energy sources that are friendly to people and the planet, including solar, wind, and hydro power, Casio will incorporate these renewable energy sources into its own business operations. Casio Europe has been operating geothermal cooling and heating in its office building since January 2009. In fiscal 2013, Casio will also begin investigating initiatives for the use of renewable energy including solar. Regarding other indirect CO2 emissions (GHG Protocol Scope 3 emissions), Casio will work to expand the scope of disclosure of other indirect CO2 emissions generated during distribution and product usage, which it already discloses, based on the calculation guidelines being considered currently by the electrical and electronics industry associations. Measures for 2020 Casio is studying the potential of the following initiatives to achieve the medium-term target for 2020. It will also strive to assess as quickly as possible their potential to help meet the 2050 target. 1. Response to social environment changes after the Great East Japan Earthquake ・Responding to energy issues ・Introducing renewable energy sources 2. Environmental contribution through product usage ・Reducing the amount of electricity used by products ・Minimizing and optimizing the amount of product packaging ・Increasing the percentage of products that run on solar cells 3. Utilizing carbon offsets ・CO2 absorption effect based on the expansion of paperless products (reducing demand for logging, etc.) ・Purchasing carbon offsets for products ・Promoting tree planting and greening ・Emissions trading, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), and Joint Implementation (JI) 4. Reduction of CO2 emissions in various business activity processes ・Materials procurement, product manufacturing, transport and distribution, product usage, recycling, and disposal ・Expansion of the scope of CO2 emission data gathering on logistics, transport efficiency improvement, and modal shift ・Making production facilities more energy efficient, and improving production processes 5. Increasing the percentage of non fossil-fuels used at sites ・Installation of LED lighting ・Installation of solar panels ・Installation of highly efficient air conditioning equipment CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 113 Energy Conservation Targets by Fiscal 2016 (Power, Fuel, etc.) Starting in fiscal 2014, Casio established the new energy conservation targets described below with a target year of fiscal 2016 in an update of its energy conservation targets up to fiscal 2013. By fiscal 2016, the Casio group overall will reduce energy usage (crude oil equivalent kL) by 13% per unit of total floor space compared with fiscal 2011. In setting the new target, Casio changed from establishing targets for production sites in Japan, offices in Japan, production sites outside Japan and offices outside Japan, respectively, as it did in the past, to establishing an overall Group target. Moreover, while the target for production sites was previously expressed per production, Casio has employed per unit of total floor space for the new target, which is as close as possible to an absolute target. Casio has established energy conservation targets as a crude oil equivalency (kL) for fuel and power usage, and this has made it possible to evaluate actual energy conservation programs without relying on the CO2 emission coefficient for purchased power. Fiscal 2015 Performance In fiscal 2015, output grew at production subsidiaries Yamagata Casio and Casio (Thailand), but the total amount of energy used by the Casio Group fell by 3.3%, crude oil equivalent, compared to fiscal 2014. This was due to energy-saving activities including power saving by the entire group. Looking at energy saving per unit of total floor space, energy consumption in fiscal 2015 was reduced by 12.7% compared to fiscal 2011. This is close to the target of a 13% reduction in energy consumption by fiscal 2016. Meanwhile, in fiscal 2015, CO2 emissions for the entire group increased by 0.3% compared to fiscal 2014. This was due to an approximately 17% deterioration in the CO2 emission coefficient for electricity in Japan, which is used to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions generated per unit of electricity consumed. Compared to fiscal 2006, the base year for the medium-term targets, emissions have been reduced by 70.9%, thereby achieving the goal for fiscal 2021. (The reduction would be 31.6%, if the base year were set according to the GHG Protocol.) For more information, see “Reducing CO2 emissions”, “Fiscal 2015 Casio Environmental Action Plan Performance”. （PDF / 48KB） CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 114 This page introduces Casio's initiatives for preserving biodiversity. Casio's approach to biodiversity preservation The 10th Conference of Parties (COP10) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was held in Nagoya, Japan in October 2010, and it adopted a new Strategic Plan for Biodiversity (2020), and the Aichi Biodiversity Targets (2050). Following up, business corporations have become more active in their efforts to preserve biodiversity. Casio Group Biodiversity Guidelines Basic Policy The Casio Group recognizes that its existence and business activities depend on the benefits afforded by biodiversity, and that these activities also have an impact on biodiversity. Casio emphasizes biodiversity preservation activities as well as efforts to fight climate change. By including biodiversity preservation in environmental management and creating a system for implementation, the Casio Group is working to build a more sustainable world. Specific Initiatives 1. Business Activities: Casio will help to build a more sustainable world by creating and providing products and services that encourage consumers to care more about the environment. This will be done by learning from nature and developing technologies that utilize this wisdom. ・Facilitating a paperless society ・Contributing to resource saving by developing original technology ・Developing products with care for nature 2. Impact Assessment: Casio will survey and analyze its impact on biodiversity through activities including R&D, design, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, sales, product use, disposal, and recycling, and at its office and plant locations. It will establish improvement measures and implement them starting with areas of highest environmental impact and benefit. ・Actively taking initiatives for proper procurement of parts (leather, wood, paper, etc.) and materials (mineral resources, etc.) that depend on ecosystem services. ・Conducting questionnaire surveys across the supply chain in order to check ecosystem protection efforts for parts and materials that make up products. ・Establishing impact assessment methods (checklists and indices) for the Casio Group 3. Information Disclosure: Casio will strive to improve social awareness of biodiversity, by actively disclosing the results of its environmental activities. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 115 4. Community Involvement: Casio will actively support activities that contribute to biodiversity preservation by NPOs and NGOs, government agencies, and local citizens. 5. Full Employee Participation: Casio is aiming for activities that involve the participation of all employees, by increasing understanding of biodiversity preservation, and training employees to act on their own initiative. March 31, 2011 Yukio Kashio Chairman, Casio Environmental Conference While benefit from biodiversity, corporate activities also have a significant impact on it. By fully understanding this relationship, Casio aims to avoid the risks associated with failing to make efforts in the area of biodiversity and, instead, to identify the opportunities that these efforts present. Example Problems in the upstream supply chain identified from the perspective of biodiversity preservation could make it impossible risk: to use certain resources, materials, and parts, and Casio could lose customers because it is perceived as having a negative impact on the environment. Specifics: Use of carelessly sourced paper contributes to global forest decline. Due to the toxicity of the mercury used in projector light sources, its use is legally restricted. Example Casio takes the lead ahead of other companies in implementing policies that allow it to more safely and reliably procure opportunity: resources, materials, and parts, as well as substitutes for the same, and is therefore able to highlight the environmental friendliness of Casio products when appealing to customers. Specifics: Efforts that address environmental impact, such as the formulation of a paper procurement policy, are well received by the general public. Through original development of a light source that does not use mercury, Casio is able to supply projectors that are legally compliant. By supporting NGOs and NPOs with Casio products, for instance by issuing collaborative wristwatches that support dolphin and whale conservation, Casio is able to strengthen its product brands. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 116 Paper Procurement Policy established Based on the Casio Group Biodiversity Guidelines, established in 2011, the company created a medium-term plan. Under the plan, it has launched biodiversity impact studies in its product and site-related activities, and is examining and implementing biodiversity preservation measures to be achieved by fiscal 2016. Progress made up until 2014 is summarized in the table below. One such result is the Paper Procurement Policy shown below, established in June 2015. Casio Group Paper Procurement Policy Purpose: To preserve biodiversity by protecting and sustainably using the forest resources which provide the raw material for paper. Scope: All paper products procured by the Casio Group worldwide Policy: Casio will procure paper for use in its business activities according to the following standards: 1) Paper must be made from trees harvested in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the logging area concerned, 2) Products must not come from companies that are destroying any forest with high conservation value or that are a source of serious environmental or social issues, 3) Priority must be given to reliable certified paper or recycled paper. In the Sustainability Report 2014, Casio described its plan to develop a paper procurement policy for operations in Japan in fiscal 2015. However, the company decided to establish a worldwide Paper Procurement Policy, ahead of plan. Regarding the paper procurement situation in Japan, the preliminary investigation conducted by Casio in 2013 and 2014 confirmed that procurement is being carried out according to the procurement policy already in place. In order to maintain this situation, in 2015 the company explained its procurement policy to suppliers of paper for catalogs and user manuals. It also implemented mechanisms for maintaining paper procurement according to the new policy. Regarding the paper procurement situation outside Japan, Casio applies the policy to newly adopted paper sources and is working to confirm whether existing sources are compliant with the policy. Through the enactment of this paper procurement policy, Casio seeks to raise the awareness of its direct paper suppliers concerning the importance of biodiversity preservation through the paper supply. Although Casio can only have a limited impact as a single company, it is expected that even more corporations will establish similar policies in the future. As a company that sells numerous products to consumers, Casio has established and is disclosing its Paper Procurement Policy to the general public, taking advantage of it as an opportunity to raise awareness of the issue of biodiversity protection. Through corporate initiatives and activities such as the Consortium for Sustainable Paper Use, in which Casio has participated since June 2014, the company will continue to raise biodiversity awareness in society. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 117 Participation in the Consortium for Sustainable Paper Use Companies and NGO Collaborating to Achieve Sustainable Paper Use by 2020 In June 2014, Casio joined the Consortium for Sustainable Paper Use, which was established to promote the use of paper in a way that is both environmentally and socially responsible throughout society. Casio has been working hard as a dedicated member of the Consortium. The Consortium was established in November 2013 by five companies that are making progressive efforts related to their use of paper, the WWF Japan, and Response Ability, Inc, which promotes corporate sustainability. By enabling each member to promote uses of paper that are environmentally and socially responsible from their various perspectives, the Consortium hopes to expand the sustainable use of paper throughout the broader society.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 120 Casio's Green Star Products offer even greater environmental performance than Casio's conventional products. Green Star Product concept In order to minimize the environmental impact of its products, Casio is promoting the development of environmentally friendly products in every aspect of planning and design. In 1993, Casio began product assessment in order to systematize and promote its development of eco products. New products had to undergo a preliminary assessment for their environmental impact and meet certain criteria in order to be certified as Casio Green Products. Prior to FY2008, Casio worked towards an initial Green Product sales target of 80% of total sales, and in that year the company achieved 84%. Now the company promotes to continue target of 80%. With the achievement of this target, Casio decided to create even stricter criteria and implement more specific, detailed assessments. Qualifying products are certified as Green Star Products, representing the best of Casio Green Products. This ensures that Casio's products continue to set the bar higher and drive the realization of a sustainable society. For Green Star certified products, the environmental features are listed in catalogues and on the product packages.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 128 This page provides an overall picture of the environmental impact of the Casio Group's business activities. What is a material balance? A material balance shows the amount of resources used and the amount of materials with environmental impact that are produced (outputs) in business activities from R&D to after-sales collection and recycling (inputs). Fiscal 2015 performance Despite expanded production at Yamagata Casio in Japan and at Casio (Thailand) in fiscal 2015, energy use was reduced for the entire group. Meanwhile, CO2 emissions increased slightly from the previous year, due to the deterioration of the CO2 emission coefficient for electricity in Japan. Offices and production sites in Japan continued to engage in energy conservation activities throughout the year, including summer and winter, which were stepped up after the Great East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The power usage and CO2 emissions resulting from customers’ use of Casio products is calculated on the assumption of five years of use based on Scope 3 assessment standards adopted in fiscal 2014. Casio will continue to strive to improve its production equipment and business processes, to make the products it sells in such a way that they conserve energy and resources, and to reduce its environmental impact. Material balance in business activities (FY2015) *1 Groundwater is included in the water resource inputs. *2 Parts and materials include consumables, such as toner cartridges. *3 Ozone depleting substances have been fully phased out. *4 Recycled waste includes thermally recycled material. *5 Product distribution is consigned to transportation companies. *6 Electricity is calculated based on five years of use in accordance with the Scope 3 standards. *7 CO2 emissions are calculated based on five years of use in accordance with the Scope 3 standards. The exchangeable battery amounts used for these calculations are based on general market prices. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 129 In order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, Casio’s main sites have acquired ISO14001 certification and operate an environmental management system. Under the environmental management system, Casio plans and executes environmental protection activities based on a range of environmental legislation and the Casio Group Environmental Action Plan as well as various voluntary action plans established by Keidanren and the industry association. Moreover, Casio applies and operates its own unique environmental management system to relatively small office sites, which takes into account the extent of their environmental impact. CO2 Medium-and long-term greenhouse gas reductions Casio has established medium-term (2020) and long-term (2050) objectives on reducing its total greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts are being made to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions from business activities by 30% by fiscal 2021 and 80% by fiscal 2051 (compared to fiscal 2006). In the fiscal 2015 results, emissions were reduced by about 32% compared to the base year, and the medium-term plan has already been achieved. However, activities will be carried out for emissions reduction to achieve long-term targets. Furthermore, total CO2 emissions for the entire group in fiscal 2015 increased by 0.3% compared to fiscal 2014. However, this was due to an approximately 17% deterioration in the CO2 emission coefficient for electricity in Japan, which is used to calculate the amount of CO2 emissions generated per unit of electricity consumed. Greenhouse gas emissions Starting in fiscal 2015, the base year (fiscal 2006) will be adjusted to a level that conforms to the GHG Gas Protocol. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 130 Energy Conservation Casio revised its Environmental Action Plan in fiscal 2014 and established an energy conservation goal that covers all of its sites. This goal is to reduce energy usage (crude oil equivalent kL) by 13 % per unit of total floor space compared to FY2011, by FY2016. Since fiscal 2015 was an interim year, and since there was an approximately 12.7% reduction for the fiscal 2015 result of 0.0374 kl/m2 compared to the fiscal 2011 base year level of 0.0428 kl/m2, the target is now in sight. With an awareness that this target is close to the total reduction amount, further efforts will be made in the future. Casio is continuing to strive to conserve energy at its production facilities and to improve production processes at all production sites in Japan and abroad. At offices in and outside Japan, Casio is promoting energy conservation efforts in its lighting, heating, and cooling equipment, and is striving to reduce CO2 emissions. Energy Conservation Since there was a change in total floor space at some sites, the energy consumption per unit of floor space figures have been revised going back to the previous year. Reducing CO2 Emissions in Logistics The target for CO2 emissions from logistics activities in Japan is a 20% reduction per unit of domestic sales in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2015, emissions were 38.5% lower than in fiscal 2011, already achieving the target. Nevertheless, Casio will keep working to further reduce CO2 emissions. In August 2011, the logistics center was relocated from Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture to Toda City, Saitama Prefecture. In January 2012, the Eastern Distribution Center in Koto-ku, Tokyo was amalgamated with the logistics center. Through this staged effort, Casio reduced the number of consumer distribution centers in Japan from five to four. This transition not only shortened transportation distances, but also facilitated a modal shift from truck to rail, helping to further reduce CO2 emissions. In fiscal 2013, Casio began an initiative to send products manufactured overseas directly to the Western Distribution Center in Osaka. This allows transport distances to be shortened significantly by cutting out transit through the Toda Logistics Center. CO2 emissions and emissions per unit of sales for logistics in Japan CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 131 Waste Reducing waste Casio revised its Environmental Action Plan in fiscal 2014, and transitioned to absolute volume goals that are not dependent on production volumes. [All sites in Japan] The target is to reduce waste from sites in Japan by 4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2015, waste was reduced by about 122 tons, a decrease of approximately 8% compared to fiscal 2012. Although the target has been achieved, further efforts will be made in the future. Moreover, landfill disposal volume was reduced by approximately 71 tons compared to fiscal 2014. [Production sites outside Japan] The target is to reduce waste at production sites outside Japan by 48% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2015, the waste reduction was about 67% compared to fiscal 2011, and the target was achieved. One reason for the substantial reduction was the closure of the Panyu Factory of Casio Computer (Hong Kong) in fiscal 2014. Casio will continue to work to achieve further reductions. Generation of waste and volume of final landfill disposal (all sites in Japan) Generation of waste and volume of final landfill disposal (production sites outside Japan) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 132 Water resources Reducing input of water resources Casio revised the parts of its Environmental Action Plan related to water resources in fiscal 2014, and transitioned to absolute volume goals that are not dependent on production volumes. [Production sites in Japan] Casio's goal is to reduce water usage at production sites in Japan by 5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2015, the reduction was about 18% compared to fiscal 2011, and the target was achieved. Along with increased production at Yamagata Casio, water usage has risen since fiscal 2014. Casio will continue to pursue further reductions. Although data from Yamanashi Plant of Yamagata Casio was not included in the base year level, it has been incorporated into the actual figures starting in fiscal 2014. [Production sites outside Japan] Casio's goal is to reduce water usage at production sites outside Japan by 5% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2015, the reduction was about 66% compared to fiscal 2011, and the target was achieved. The reasons for this were the closure of the Panyu Factory of Casio Computer (Hong Kong) in fiscal 2014 and lower production at some sites in fiscal 2015. Casio will continue to strive to achieve further reductions. Usage of water resources and recycled industrial water (production sites in Japan) Usage of water resources and recycled industrial water (production sites outside Japan) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 133 Paper resources Reducing usage of paper resources Casio revised the part of its Environmental Action Plan related to office paper at sites in Japan in fiscal 2014, and transitioned to absolute volume goals that are not dependent on production volumes. The goal is to reduce the volume of office paper used by 12% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2015, the reduction was about 10% compared to fiscal 2011, and steady progress was made. Efforts will continue to be made. Figures were not calculated for Yamagata Casio (Yamanashi Office) in the base year, but results from this site are included in the actual figures for fiscal 2014. Office paper usage (all sites in Japan) PRTR Reducing PRTR substances Since goals for reducing PRTR substances were met in fiscal 2013, these have been left out of current targets.

Includes fuel usage by company vehicles, but does not include energy used for contracted logistics services, commuting, and business trips. Crude oil equivalents are calculated based on Japan's Energy Conservation Act. Energy used at sites outside Japan is calculated on a crude oil equivalent by applying coefficients pursuant to Japan's Energy Conservation Act. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 136 2. Water resource input amount Usage amounts of tap water and industrial water are combined. 3. VOC input amount For substances subject to follow-up surveys related to VOC emission controls by the four main electrical and electronics industry associations, those whose annual usage at each site exceeds 50 kg are included in the tabulations. 4. Paper usage amount Managed and tabulated based on the purchased amounts of paper used in printers, fax machines, and copy machines each year. The weight of one sheet is determined for each paper size, and weights are calculated based on the amounts purchased. 5. PRTR substance input amount Calculated for chemical substances subject to Japan's PRTR Act whose annual amount handled per substance is 0.05 tons or more at each site. 3. Outputs 1. CO2 emissions The CO2 conversion factors for electricity used to calculate output amounts are as follows. For emissions in Japan, Casio used the fiscal 2014 emission coefficient of 0.00057 (t-CO2/kWh), as announced by the Federation of Electric Power Companies in September 2014 to reflect an adjustment for depreciation credit. For emissions in sites outside Japan, the “emissions factor adjusted for the CO2 emissions from CHP (combined heat and power) generated electricity” was used. It is taken from the latest year value (2003 estimate) in the Japan Electrical Manufacturers’ Association (JEMA) estimate survey (June 2006). Regarding CO2 equivalent for fuel, CO2 conversion coefficients were calculated using the emission coefficients and unit calorific values by fuel type based on Japan’s Global Warming Act, and then applied to different fuel types and totaled. 2. Air pollutants Calculated at sites that have smoke generating facilities based on the concentration measurements and gas emissions at each facility. Concentrations of dust emissions, NOx, and SOx, which must be managed by law, are measured at target sites, to confirm that they are below regulation levels. The following substances are not used at any Casio site: dichloromethane, trichlorethylene, tetrachlorethylene, chloroform, vinyl chloride monomer, 1,3-butadiene, benzene, acrylonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane, formaldehyde, trinickel disulfide, nickel nitrate, and acetaldehyde. 3. Wastewater Calculated from values at sites that measure wastewater amounts. Sites that do not measure wastewater amounts but can ascertain tap water use treat the amount of tap water used as their wastewater amount. At sites with special facilities that fall under the Water Pollution Prevention Act and/or the Sewer Act, water quality surveys are conducted based on applicable laws, and confirmation is made that emissions are below regulatory limits. Since fiscal 2014, the applicable facilities have not been operating. In the case of discharge into public sewer systems, BOD is left blank, but figures are shown if voluntary measurements are taken. 4. PRTR Release and transfer quantities are calculated for each chemical substance subject to Japan's PRTR Act whose annual usage is 0.05 tons or more. 5. Waste Waste is tabulated as the total amount of industrial waste generated when product is transferred from a Casio site to the processor, general waste derived from sites, and the quantity of valuables. Because sales sites are small in size and mixed waste is handled by a contractor, it is difficult to get accurate figures for recycling quantities and landfill waste quantities. Thus, all waste from these sites is conservatively treated as landfill waste for calculation purposes. 6. Base year figures For evaluation of medium and long-term targets, starting in fiscal 2015, base year (fiscal 2006) figures are adjusted according to the GHG Protocol. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 137 Building a low-carbon society is one of the mediumto long-term goals of the Casio Environmental Vision 2050 and the Casio Environmental Declaration 2020. This will require not only efforts from within the Casio Group, but also a commitment to reducing CO2 emissions both upstream and downstream in the supply chain. For this reason, Casio has calculated emissions for each category in an effort to help everyone involved visualize CO2. CO2 emissions for the entire Casio Group supply chain in fiscal 2015 were 814,582 t-CO2. • Scope 1 direct emissions (e.g., fossil fuels, natural gas) were calculated at 4,721 t-CO2. • Scope 2 indirect emissions (e.g., electricity) were calculated at 33,762 t-CO2. • Scope 3 other emissions (e.g., use of sold products and end-of-life treatment of sold products, transportation and distribution, employee commuting, lease assets, and investments ) were calculated for 12 of 15 categories (with the three lowest-impact categories excluded). When CO2 emissions were calculated pursuant to the GHG Protocol that serves as the international standard, emissions for fiscal 2014 stood at 776,099 t-CO2. As a result, Scope 3 accounted for more than 95% of entire supply chain emissions. Within Scope 3, purchased goods and services accounted for the greatest share, about 65%. The reason that emissions have increased compared to fiscal 2014 is that tap water, industrial water and advertising expenses were also added in order to improve the calculation system. Also, along with increased sales, there was an increase in emissions relating to upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products. In the future, the following issues will be addressed: • Improve calculation accuracy in each category • Propose and implement emission reduction measures for each category within Scope 3 • Develop measures for reducing emissions both upstream and downstream in the supply chain GHG Protocol: International standards for calculating and reporting greenhouse gas emissions CO2 emissions for the entire Casio Group supply chain CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 138 Efforts to Ascertain Scope 3 CO2 emissions in fisacal Category 2015 ｔCO2 rasio Scope 1 4,721 0.6% Scope 2 33,762 4.1% Scope 3 Scope 3 accounted 95.3% of entire emissions. 1 Purchased goods and services 531,867 65.3% 2 Capital goods 18,311 2.2% Fueland energy-related 3 activities not included in Scope 2,215 0.3% 1 or Scope 2 Upstream transportation and 4 92,934 11.4% distribution 5 Waste generated in operations 467 0.1% 6 Business travel 1,264 0.2% 7 Employee commuting 1,378 0.2% 8 Upstream leased assets 2,064 0.3% Downstream transportation and 9 － － distribution 10 Processing of sold products － － 11 Use of sold products 96,748 11.9% End of life treatment of sold 12 14,316 1.8% products 13 Downstream leased assets 6,821 0.8% 14 Franchises － － 15 Investments 7,714 0.9% Total 814,582 100% Category 4: The breakdown for transportation and shipping (upstream) is shown below.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 140 Overview of fiscal 2015 performance In fiscal 2015, environmental accounting showed that investment in environmental conservation increased, and the economic benefits associated with costs and environmental conservation measures were virtually the same level as the previous year. Investments in environmental conservation, such as energy-saving equipment and LED lighting, were valued at ¥108 million, while the cost of environmental conservation including recycling products, parts, and toner cartridges and other consumables was ¥1,227 million. Meanwhile, the economic benefits from environmental conservation included real effects, like business profits due to recycling activities of ¥816 million. They also include estimated effects valued at ¥437 million related to reducing environmental impact through the use of, for example, paperless products and non-mercury lamp projectors. Total economic benefits for the fiscal year were ¥1,253 million. Moving forward, Casio will accurately ascertain and inform people about the effects of its environmental management activities from an economic perspective and will strive to engage in efficient and effective environmental conservation efforts.

It also includes the environmental benefit of paperless products such as electronic dictionaries, data projectors, non-mercury lamp projectors and smaller printers, efforts to increase the longevity of the parts in these devices that require regular replacement, and distribution cost reductions achieved through packaging reduction. Regarding the reduction of power consumption during product use by customers, the monetary value of the environmental impact reduction effect is calculated as follows: Reduction of power consumption during product use by customers = (Annual power consumption of the previous model – Annual power consumption of the new model) x Number of units sold in the year x Electric power unit price. When calculating the estimated effects, the following coefficients are used: CO2 unit prices are the average full-year value for fiscal 2015 based on the EU emissions trading price (¥859.07/t). The electric power unit prices are fiscal 2014 electricity costs from the Fiscal 2014 Energy White Paper issued by Japan’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy (¥17.53/kWh).

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 142 Carbon offset initiative As an initiative to help combat climate change, Casio began selling toner cartridges featuring a carbon offset in July 2008. In general, carbon offset works like this: an organization purchases a credit equivalent to a reduction of emissions of certain gases thought to contribute to climate change in order to “cancel out” its own emissions. Even though Casio’s products are compact and energy-efficient, which in itself reduces emissions, Casio’s toner initiative seeks to offset CO2 emissions equivalent to the amount generated to produce the electric power the printer uses during the life of the toner cartridge with credits in and outside In the first year of the program, the offset was implemented with credits from Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects outside Japan, registered with the CDM Executive Board at the United Nations. Starting in fiscal 2010, the offset has also been provided using domestic credit in Japan. By 2012, the final year of the first commitment period as defined in the Kyoto Protocol, Casio had offset 9,520 tons of CO2 using overseas CDM credit. This counted towards Japan's reduction portion, and contributed towards the achievement of Japan's commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 6%.

Casio’s Special Committee on Packaging spearheads the company’s effort to revise and improve general packaging. Specifically, the committee promotes efforts to improve transport efficiency, reduce CO2 emissions during transportation, and reduce the amount of material used in packaging by making packages more compact and lightweight for all products. Here are three examples of these activities. 1. Watch packaging: Eliminated an extra step of distribution processing by standardizing packaging that had been different for each customer, and further reduced the packaging size. 2. Electronic dictionary packaging: Realized more compact packaging with fewer package components by improving the shock resistance of the products themselves. 3. Digital camera packaging: In consideration of actual customer usage, eliminated some included items (accessories) and revised specifications of others, thereby reducing packaging weight. Watch Packaging Casio redesigned three different packaging formats (C ring stands) that had been used for North American customers. By standardizing the packaging format, the packaging volume was reduced by about 17%. In addition, a step of distribution processing was eliminated. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 145 Electronic Dictionary Packaging One of the packaging components, the product tray, was eliminated by improving the shock resistance of the products themselves. Also, by redesigning the box construction, a place for putting the included product accessories was created. In total, the box volume was reduced by about 13%. Digital Camera Packaging In consideration of actual customer usage, some included items (accessories) were eliminated and the specifications of others were revised to reduce packaging weight. For instance: Simplified user manual content, with further details provided online Changed the manual from CD size to A7 size Eliminated the CD-ROM CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 146 Changes to Included Accessories User manual CD-size booklet A7-size booklet A7-size insert CD-ROM Eliminated Eliminated AV cable Eliminated Eliminated AC cord Eliminated ⇒ ⇒ AC adapter (charger) Eliminated Strap Rechargeable battery USB cable CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 147 Casio is working to ensure its logistical operations have as low an environmental impact as possible by improving its inter-site parts-shipment routes and switching to more efficient modes of product transportation. Logistics process initiatives Casio is actively reducing its environmental impact by striving to reduce CO2 and waste emissions arising from logistics. In order to reduce CO2 emissions in the logistics process, Casio is promoting the following three action plans. Shortening transport distances： Promoting direct shipping to customers from logistics centers in and outside Japan Promoting a modal shift： Actively using modes of transport with low environmental impact such as rail for transport between sites Improving loading efficiency and reducing transport volume： Improving the packaging design of digital cameras, electronic dictionaries, musical instruments electronic cash registers, and other products, and reducing the volume of packaging Relocation and Consolidation of Logistics Centers in Japan Casio’s logistics center in Mie Prefecture was moved to Saitama Prefecture, and then its distribution center in Tokyo was ultimately consolidated with the logistics center, a transition that was achieved in stages. In August 2011, the logistics center was moved from Suzuka City, Mie Prefecture, to Toda City, Saitama Prefecture. Then in January 2012, the company’s Eastern Distribution Center in Koto-ku, Tokyo, was consolidated with the logistics center. With this change, Casio reduced the number of consumer product distribution sites in Japan from five to four. This transition not only shortened transport distances, but also promoted a significant shift from truck to rail shipment, and has contributed greatly to CO2 emissions reduction. Promoting Modal Shift and Reducing Intermediate Transport CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 148 ■Results of the Transfer and Consolidation 1. Elimination of intermediate transport Shortened the distance from the logistics center to the Hokkaido Distribution Center in Sapporo Intermediate transport no longer required from the logistics center to the Eastern Distribution Center in Tokyo 2. Promotion of modal shift Partial shift to rail between the logistics center and the Western Distribution Center in Osaka Switch to rail between the logistics center and the Kyushu Distribution Center in Fukuoka 3. Transport distance shortened Shortened the transport distance in the Kanto (Tokyo) region which accounts for about 46% of direct shipments from the logistics center (delivery direct to customers without going through a distribution center) * As a result of the efforts above, annual CO2 emissions were reduced by about 300 tons. In fiscal 2013, Casio began an initiative to send products manufactured outside Japan directly to the Western Distribution Center in Osaka. This allows transport distances to be shortened significantly by cutting out transit through the Toda Logistics Center. Introduction of reusable shipping cartons in Asian distribution To reduce packaging material, Casio is working to introduce the use of reusable shipping cartons in its Asian distribution operations. In an effort to switch to plastic reusable shipping cartons in its air freight shipments between Japan, Hong Kong, and Thailand, Casio launched the use of new cartons in September 2009. These cartons can be used to ship parts made in Japan to Hong Kong for use at Chinese production sites, and to ship timepiece parts from vendors in China, from Hong A reusable shipping carton employed for distribution in Asia Kong to Thailand. By then transporting finished timepieces or timepiece parts from Thailand to Japan, the cartons never have to travel empty between the three countries. Unlike traditional cardboard boxes, these cartons do not have to be discarded, and instead can be used many times over, thereby reducing environmental impact. Casio has now begun to introduce even larger shipping cartons. The large shipping cartons are mainly used for ocean transport. Packaging damage can be avoided through the use of LCL shipping (freight from different companies in one ocean shipping container), which also eliminates the need to use air transport when the shipping volume is small. Casio has been using these large shipping cartons to ship products since fiscal 2012, and in fiscal 2014 new shipping cartons with even greater strength were added to the lineup of shipping supplies. Shipping carton receives Chairman of Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) Award On October 4, 2012, the large shipping carton shown here received the Chairman of Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO) Award at the Japan Packaging Contest 2012, one of Japan’s biggest packaging competitions, which is organized by Japan Packaging Institute. Four products obtain Eco Rail Mark certification On February 28, 2013, Casio obtained Eco Rail Mark certification from the Railway Freight Association for four products: clocks, digital pianos, electronic keyboards and electronic cash registers. The Eco Rail Mark indicates that a product or company is proactively addressing global environmental issues by using rail freight transport. Rail transport produces about one sixth of the CO2 emissions of commercial trucking, making it an environmentally friendly method of transport with a low environmental impact. The criteria for certification are utilization of rail for at least 30% of land freight transport for distances of 500km or more for a product, and CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 149 utilization of rail for at least 15% of land freight transport for distances of 500km or more for a company. Casio obtained Eco Rail Mark certification as a company in October 2009 and successfully obtained product certification as a result of further expanding rail transport due to the relocation, amalgamation and closure of business sites. Casio now actively uses rail for transport from its logistics center in Saitama Prefecture to distribution centers in Hokkaido, Osaka and Fukuoka. Going forward, Casio will make active efforts to reduce environmental impact by pursuing environmentally friendly transport. Eco Rail Mark Promoting a modal shift to rail transport Environmentally friendly rail containers CO2 emissions for logistics (Environmental Data) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 150 In compliance with global laws and standards, Casio is striving to achieve environmentally compliant product design and green procurement. Environmental laws and regulations relating to Casio products and green procurement As a company with operations around the world, Casio must comply with the laws and standards of many different countries. This is why Casio starts with the design and procurement stages to ensure that its products comply with restrictions on specified chemical substances in parts and materials, while complying with obligations for labeling, information provision and energy-saving standards for finished products. Covering the procurement stage, Casio has formulated Casio Green Procurement Standards to cover the legal regulations for the chemical substances contained in Casio products, and is procuring its parts and materials in accordance with those standards. To ensure that Casio products comply with the latest laws and standards around the world, the Casio Green Procurement Standards are constantly reviewed and updated. Thus, by procuring parts and materials that meet its own strict standards, Casio can be confident that its product development meets legal requirements worldwide. Casio also ensures the compliance of its products by scientifically verifying and analyzing the content of chemical substances in parts and materials used. In the design stage, the company confirms that all parts and materials that will go into a completed Casio product meet the Casio Green Procurement Standards. Products are approved for production only after confirmation using a database of the chemical substances contained in procured materials. Casio selects recyclable materials and provides symbol marks and the necessary information to ensure separate collection, complying with the relevant laws and standards worldwide on product recovery and recycling as well as on chemical substances contained in products. In response to laws and regulations requiring more energy-saving designs (such as the ErP Ecodesign Directive), Casio is creating technical documents and other internal standards. The table below shows the principal environmental laws relating to the distribution of Casio products in countries around the world.

In the development and design stages, Casio promotes product development by setting targets that surpass its competitors' products with the best energy consumption efficiency in the same category. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 153 This section describes Casio’s environmental protection initiatives in the area of general production. Saving resources by eliminating defects At Yamagata Casio, which boasts the most advanced manufacturing technologies of any Casio facility, a computer-simulated system is adopted for the design process in an effort to eliminate the creation of defective products even before the trial production stage. They calculate the flow of resin inside a mold, and try to predict and resolve any problems that might occur in the manufacturing process. This enables production to begin without a test production phase, thereby minimizing the waste of resources. Simulation display In the mass production stage, the condition of the molds used to form components is analyzed digitally using acoustic emission (AE) technologies that Yamagata Casio developed itself. This technology detects even slight deformations or cracks that appear in the mold over the course of manufacturing many tens of thousands of parts, sounding an alarm before such problems can have an impact on product quality. This prevents the generation of defective products As an indication of the success of these initiatives, the factory is now using parts per million (PPM) Mold diagnostic system using AE rather than a percentage (%) as the index to manage its defective product production rate. Winter Eco-style challenge On August 7, 2014, Yamagata Casio was recognized as an outstanding business establishment for its efforts in the Winter Eco-Style Challenge campaign coordinated by Yamagata Prefecture. This annual activity, which began in fiscal 2009, is promoted to raise energy-saving awareness in the homes and businesses of the prefecture. In 2014, 862 establishments in Yamagata submitted details of their energy-saving activities carried out between November 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014. Just five were recognized as particularly outstanding business sites. Yamagata Casio reduced the amount of compressed air it uses to drive machine tools and automated machines as well as to blow dust off components, while also Measuring air leaks at points marked with arrows constructing a power monitoring system. The company was recognized for these and other efforts, resulting in the outstanding business establishment award. Yamagata Casio will continue to actively promote energy saving initiatives in the future. Energy-saving training by the compressed-air equipment manufacturer CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 154 All Casio office sites are engaged in efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and cut resource use by upgrading office equipment and improving work processes. Reducing power consumption through server integration Casio has vastly reduced its energy consumption by integrating the servers that had once been disparately located across the group. Server integration results A total of 1,020 servers had been integrated by March 2015.

Initiatives at Casio America Casio America has been carrying out various environmental initiatives over many years. These include sorted collection of bottles and cans, collecting and taking out used paper and cardboard for recycling, using recycled materials for individual watch packaging and display stands, replacing old energy-inefficient personal computers, and providing employees with reusable drink bottles to reduce the need for paper cups. These activities have been recognized by the Morris County Municipal Utilities Authority (MCMUA), which promotes environmental protection by presenting awards to companies for their green endeavors. Individual watch package and display stand made from recycled materials CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 155 Casio Europe's energy-efficient building Casio's office sites have shifted from focusing on reducing CO2 per unit of production to cutting the total volume of CO2 emitted across the entire Casio Group. In January 2009, Casio Europe integrated its offices, distribution center, and service center, which had previously been separately located around Germany, into a new energy-efficient building. CASIO Europe This building has an innovative air conditioning system that uses Geothermal heat collecting equipment 130m below ground to pump water through pipes embedded in the concrete ceiling and floor of the building. The system pumps cool water in the summer and hot water in the winter to either cool or heat the building. Energy consumption in the building is further reduced by controlling room temperatures using blinds that open and close automatically according to the weather as well as proper ventilation. Geothermal heat usage model Hachioji R&D Center takes on the challenge of climate change and environmental preservation The Hachioji R&D Center was designed and constructed to reduce CO2 emissions in order to contribute to the fight against climate change. The center continues to take on the challenge of environment protection. Some of its innovations are highlighted below. Ongoing power-saving activities The Hachioji R&D Center completed in November 2003 is a research and development facility that incorporated environmentally friendly equipment from the initial design stage. It has been running efficiently for approximately 12 years since it opened, boasting energy-saving features such as high-efficiency vertical thermal storage tanks, a natural ventilation system, automatic blinds, lighting control and equipment control based on weather forecasting. Thus, instead of just relying on its hardware, the center has been enthusiastically pursuing other improvements such as finely tuned temperature control adjustments, and the revision of operation methods based on actual daily data. In fiscal 2013, interior lighting fixtures started being converted from fluorescent to LED, as part of effort to reduce energy consumption. As a result of these efforts, in fiscal 2010, five years after the base year of fiscal 2005, the center was able to reduce CO2 emissions by 27.5%. Subsequently, the organization and the number of employees at the center underwent significant changes in fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012, and substantial changes in singular values were also observed in the amount of CO2 emissions. However, in fiscal 2015, CO2 emissions were less than half of what they were in the base year of fiscal 2005. Base year emissions FY2010 FY2011 FY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 (FY2005) Emissions (tons) 2,952 2,140 705 961 1,319 1,272 1,306 Reduction rate compared to the base year 28％ 76％ 67％ 55％ 57％ 56％ Figures reported up to fiscal 2010 differ due to a change in the CO2 emissions calculation method In fiscal 2015, CO2 emissions rose slightly over the previous year despite a reduction in energy consumption. This was due to a deterioration of the power conversion coefficient used to calculate CO2 emissions. Natural ventilation system maximizes use of outside weather conditions No heating equipment is needed at the Hachioji R&D Center. This is because the building has comprehensive thermal insulation, which prevents interior heat from escaping to improve thermal efficiency. Since room temperatures increase even in winter, due to body heat and CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 156 heat from equipment such as computers, the interior is cooled by letting outside air in as needed through ducts on each floor. This provides ventilation through natural airflow using the chimney effect to lower room temperatures. Thus, the temperature is adjusted using hardly any electric power. Making the most of sunlight with automatic blinds The opening and closing of the blinds is controlled automatically by calculating the position of the sun and using sensors to detect its intensity at the same time. Thanks to this technology, a comfortable interior environment is maintained. In addition to this, the system reduces unnecessary usage of electricity by regulating air conditioning to match the number of people in the center obtained by using building entry data and automatically control interior lighting, switching it on and off and adjusting brightness with sensors that detect room brightness and human movement. The building also has a green wall of vegetation to prevent it from heating up. The center has developed educational tours for local elementary school students and others to explain the use of its features. Automatic blinds Related materials: See the “Environmental Communication” section for information The automatic blinds help to maintain optimal interior about educational tours of the facility temperatures and lighting through automatic control of natural http://world.casio.com/csr/env/communication/ light. They block the intense summer sun. In addition, employees came up with the idea of saving more electricity by opening the blinds at lunchtime to let light in and turning off the Through these measures,the Hachioji R&D Center is contributing greatly to the lights. reduction of CO2 emissions, thereby helping in the fight against climate change and protecting the environment. While fully utilizing the environmentally friendly functions of this energy-saving building, the center is implementing cycles of improvement, operation, results,verification, and evaluation in order to achieve even more power savings in the future. Every spring since 2012, a green wall of vegetation has been grown on part of the building exterior. In the summer it partially shields the surface of the building and the interior from direct sunlight to prevent increases in temperature. In 2014, bitter gourd, melon, and Ryukyu morning glory were planted for the green wall. The climbing plants reached and covered the second-floor windows of the Hachioji General Affairs Section. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 157 Installation of LED lighting Through the active adoption of LED technology within the Casio Group, energy consumption for lighting has been greatly reduced. As of March 2015, about 4,000 LED fixtures have been installed, saving about 80 kWh per year compared to conventional fluorescent lamps. LED lighting in the lobby of the Hatsudai headquarters LED lighting in the Hamura R&D Center lobby Participation in Light Down Japan 2014 In support of the global warming prevention efforts being implemented by the Ministry of the Environment, Casio has been participating in the Team Minus 6% initiative, Challenge 25 Campaign and Fun to Share Campaign. In fiscal 2015, five Casio sites also participated in Light Down Japan 2014, which calls for lights to be turned off on the day of the summer solstice and the day of the Tanabata (Star) Festival. (Casio Computer Co., Ltd.: Headquarters, Hamura R&D Center, Hachioji R&D Center, Yamagata Casio, and Casio Electronics Manufacturing) Lights were turned off for a total of six hours on each of two days at five sites, reducing electricity consumption by 1,140.8 kWh. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 158 Casio's environmental management system is driven by the annual Casio Environmental Conferences. The company makes the most of this system to implement its environmental management strategy. Implementation framework The annual Casio Environmental Conferences decide on the company's specific environmental plans, including its environmental policies and action plan targets. Positioned within the conference are special committees that deal with environmental issues shared by all group companies. Each business site and group company then implements the policies and plans. An environmental management system based on environmental management tools such as ISO 14001 has been adopted at each site and group company, and since fiscal 2012, 100% of group company employees have been working at sites with ISO 14001 certification.

CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 160 Worldwide, environmental regulations are being strengthened to preserve the beauty of the Earth. Whether global or local, compliance with environmental regulations has become an integral part of the corporate mission. Companies today recognize the need to address issues such as risk management and environmental information disclosure, while complying with greenhouse gas emissions regulations, the prohibition of products containing harmful chemical substances and ISO 14001 legal requirements. Here is an overview of Casio’s environmental compliance initiatives. Standards management and audits: Regular internal audits and third-party audits There are 14 Casio sites which have obtained ISO 14001 certification. Each of these sites regularly implements conditions management and improvement activities by measuring concentrations of dust, SOx, and NOx in exhaust emissions, based on voluntary standards and standards established by national and local governments. They also measure wastewater quality (water containing harmful substances). Moreover, the sites measure and report usage conditions for harmful atmospheric pollutants, as well as handling quantities and atmospheric emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Each site trains internal environmental auditors and environmental provisional auditors. In addition to carrying out internal audits, third-party audits by external organizations are also regularly performed, and improvement activities are carried out. Going forward, Casio will work to improve the environmental risk detection skills of its internal environmental auditors, as a way to improve its overall environmental audit capability. Casio will also seek to improve auditors’ understanding of various environmental laws, and provide training in worldwide laws relating to chemical substance control and information management. Casio intends these auditors to lead the way in environment compliance, starting at the local site, by discovering issues and proposing ways to improve. Compliance Audits in the Phases of Product Development, Design, and Manufacturing In recent years, laws and regulations on the environmental performance of products have become stricter. In addition to stricter regulations in EU nations and US states, stronger laws are also being discussed and enacted in the newly emerging economies of Asia and Latin America, referencing those already established by developed countries. In some cases, the newer laws are based on the established ones, but they often have small differences in the specific requirements. It is vital for Casio to interpret these regulations properly, and make whatever product adjustments are needed. Accordingly, Casio always obtains the latest news from each region and specialized information services, while also exchanging information with other companies in the same industry. The information is used to check that Casio products meet legal requirements. The company analyzes the text of laws including those under deliberation, and establishes specific product response policies immediately after new laws are officially announced, ensuring that all Casio products are legally compliant. Casio has established a Product Environment Law Study Working Group within its New Green Product Development Council. The working group includes representatives from the environmental management, technology, development/design, and sales departments, and investigates measures for product compliance. The group members share information, establish reasonable response policies, and confirm response progress, for efforts relating to both current and future laws. They also offer support to the development, design, manufacturing and sales departments. The working group performs the following. 1. Gathering and sharing legal information from and with sources such as industrial associations, sales companies in each region, information services, and other companies in the same industry 2. Analyzing and interpreting legal information 3. Ensuring obligations are met by manufacturing, import, export, and sales entities 4. Creating development and design standards, and conducting inspections 5. Improving the usage efficiency for design support tools (database of chemical substances contained in products, etc.) CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 161 With the enactment of some regulations carrying severe penalties, Casio also recognizes the need to keep strengthening risk management. Furthermore, Casio conducts environmental audits before shipping new products in the development and design departments to check for environmental design that conforms not only to laws and regulations by also to the Casio Voluntary Plan for the Environment. The group also conducts audits of chemical substances to check whether products comply with laws and regulations on chemical substances in various overseas markets. Products are cleared for shipment on confirmation that all parts and materials satisfy standards on chemical substances. Compliance Relating to Chemical Substances Contained in Products Countries around the world have implemented new laws pertaining to chemical substances contained in electrical and electronics products, while existing laws continue to be strengthened each year. Individual laws and regulations vary in terms of the applicable chemical substances, regulated applications, exempt applications, threshold values, scope, and requirements (content restrictions, labeling, and information provision, etc.). Casio has consolidated the requirements of various laws on chemical substances contained in products and has incorporated them into the Casio Green Procurement Standards. The development and design departments are then able to comply with regulations worldwide by checking a database to see whether a part or material to be included in a product meets the Casio Green Procurement Standards. Compliance Relating to the Proper Collection, Recycling, and Disposal of Used Products Countries around the world also have regulations for the collection and recycling of used electrical and electronics products, packaging materials, and batteries. Companies must comply with the requirements of each law including product design to save resources and facilitate recycling, labeling and information provision to promote user participation in the sorted collection of products for recycling, as well as information provision for proper product disposal. Through audits at the end of the product design process, Casio evaluates each product design in terms of resource savings, ease of dismantling, recycling potential, and recycled material content. Confirmation is also made to see whether the recycling symbols and displayed information meet legal requirements worldwide. In response to the enactment of the Small Appliance Recycling Act in April 2013, Casio has pulled together a project team that includes employees involved in each product category (such as designers and others) to develop products that are easily recyclable. As part of this project, Casio is asking intermediate processors and metal smelters who recycle used small household appliances to participate in interviews regarding dismantling methods and other issues. The lessons learned are being incorporated into internal design manuals, helping Casio to create products that are easy to recycle. Compliance Relating to Power Consumption There are also regulations on power consumption and efficiency for electrical and electronics products including external power supplies and chargers, based on product categories and power source types. Companies must also meet various requirements relating to power consumption and efficiency, including regulations that require the meeting of minimum standards and those that mandate the display of power consumption information. Casio confirms the applicable regulations for each of its products, and carries out product development and design to meet the requirements. Approval applications and reports are made to the relevant agencies as necessary. Compliance Relating to Energy Saving and the Prevention of Global Warming Casio is committed to investigating and strengthening its voluntary efforts, such as those included in its Environmental Action Plan, based on laws and regulations related to energy conservation and the fight against global warming. Casio has measures addressing regulations around the globe, but this section focuses on the steps Casio is taking to comply with the laws and regulations in Japan that apply to its relatively large business facilities. 1. Act on the Rational Use of Energy Pursuant to the requirements of the Energy Conservation Law, Casio is separately evaluating the rational use of energy at the business level. Casio Computer Co., Ltd. and Yamagata Casio are both currently designated as specified businesses. Since fiscal 2010, Casio has been regularly submitting reports and medium and long-term plans on this issue, and in accordance with the determination standards relating to the rational use of energy at plants and facilities, has been promoting the development of management systems, such as creating CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 162 the new position of energy management supervisor. 2. Act on the Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures Casio does not exceed the standards for emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 arising from energy use set by Japan’s Act on the Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures. It is complying with requirements for the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, by regularly submitting reports under the Act on the Rational Use of Energy 3. Environmental Regulations in Tokyo As a site with energy usage of 1,500 kl/year or more on a crude oil equivalent basis, the Hamura R&D Center was initially considered as a large-scale business facility. However, after three years of energy reduction activities that began in fiscal 2012, the center’s designation was changed to a small and medium-sized facility, as its energy consumption dropped below 1,500 kl/year. Since it is no longer considered to be a large-scale business facility, the center is no longer obligated to reduce its total greenhouse gas emissions. However, now that the Casio Group has at least wo other small and medium-sized business facilities in Tokyo (i.e., the head office and Hachioji R&D Center, etc.), with the total energy use of the three exceeding 3,000 kl per year, it is obligated to submit reports under the Global Warming Countermeasures Reporting Program. Therefore the group will continue to promote further energy saving measures. Compliance relating to environmental information disclosure There is a growing international movement calling for the creation of information disclosure standards for companies. Along with the need for Japanese standards to coincide with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), there is a movement calling for the provision of Management Commentaries (MC) as a form of disclosure of non-financial and corporate forecast information. In other words, companies will need to disclose non-financial data which describes the connections between the company’s current situation, business strategy, risks, and financial performance, and other relevant information. In order to provide its stakeholders with the proper environmental information in a way that it is easy to understand, Casio has the following aims. 1. To adopt more accurate indices relating to environmental impact, and to provide comparable information 2. To provide non-financial information including environmental information that indicates the connections with corporate strategy 3. To explain the capability of environmental information to improve corporate performance Along with working to disclose environmental information, Casio will promote international disclosure standards for non-financial information, and work towards standardization. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 163 Casio understands the importance of communicating with all of its stakeholders about environmental issues. Asakawa Photo Contest In cooperation with the cities of Hachioji and Hino, Casio has been sponsoring the Asakawa Photo Contest in order to raise the profile of Asakawa, the home of the Hachioji R&D Center. The recent fourth year of the contest invited photo submissions on the theme, “Our Asakawa Connects to the Future.” In the general category 275 entries were received, along with 73 entries from elementary and junior high school students. Casio Computer Co., Ltd. has sponsored the event every year since its inception, and a general affairs section chief presented the awards at a special ceremony. Awards ceremony Contest poster Elementary school students visit the Hachioji R&D Center The Hachioji R&D Center at Casio Computer Co., Ltd., has developed an educational program for elementary school students in Japan. In August 2007, it began to offer learning opportunities that include site tours and school visit programs. In addition to three schools in Hokkaido, the program has so far provided learning opportunities to students at 17 schools in Tokyo. The Hachioji R&D Center, the home of the program, is one of the most advanced environmentally friendly buildings in the Casio Group. Visitors can see the actual facilities the company is using and understand methods used to reduce environmental impact. The students not only learn about Casio, but also the history of calculators, while also getting to take apart and reassemble these devices. Through this activity, Casio is sharing the fun of product creation while creating new Casio fans.

Casio has been a foster-sponsor of these tulips since 2004. Every year, many tourists visit these tulip fields, the largest in the Kanto region. Since 2006, Casio has also been a foster-sponsor involved in the preservation and cultivation of Ohga lotus plants, an ancient form of lotus flower excavated from ruins dating back to ancient times (c. 400 BC~300 AD). Fields containing 400,000 tulips of 33 varieties As part of its social contribution activities, Casio became the owner of about 500 square meters of paddy field, half of the Ohga lotus field at the Negaramimae Paddy Field in Hamura city. Casio is helping to preserve and cultivate the historically significant Ohga lotus. At a special early-morning lotus viewing event held on August 2, 2014, participants were able to drink sake from lotus leaves. Poured into a cut lotus leaf, the sake traveled down the stem to the mouths of participants. In Japan, drinking sake this way is traditionally believed to promote long life. Many people came out early to participate in the event. The Ohga lotus is an ancient lotus variety from the Yayoi period (about 2,000 years ago). Under the direction of the late Dr. Ichiro Ohga, it was discovered in the Kemigawa ruins of Chiba Prefecture in 1951. The descendants of local farmers in Hamura city Sign indicating Casio’s sponsorship of this have cultivated the Ohga lotus every year since then in their paddy fields, and the flowers bloom Ohga lotus paddy field. Some non-Japanese from late July until early August. guests also attended the lotus viewing event. The Ohga lotus was reintroduced in modern times from a 2,000-year old seed discovered in an archeological dig. Tulips can be viewed at the Negaramimae Paddy Field in spring, and other flowers bloom there through the seasons. Exhibiting at Eco-Products 2014 Every year Casio exhibits at Eco-Products, the largest environmental trade show in Japan. Held at Tokyo Big Sight from December 11 to 13, 2014, Eco-Products marked its 16th year with more than 160,000 visitors in attendance and about 750 companies and organizations setting up exhibits to display their environmentally friendly products and services. Casio has been an exhibitor at the event since its inception, and in 2014, it introduced its initiatives under the theme of harmony between technology and ecology. With an exhibit entitled, “Conveying the Ecological Mind of Casio,” various environmental activities of the group were highlighted. The stage featured presentations that focused on Casio Green Star products, and included audience participation such as a TV-style quiz show concerning environmental activities. In the Casio booth, the company highlighted the environmentally friendly parts of its products in ways that are more easily understood, using memorable slogans and stamp rally-inspired quizzes. In addition to the calculator assembly class, which is popular every year, Casio also hosted a pomrie stamp-making experience for adults. The exhibit attracted a large number of visitors over the course of the event, including children and students. With the cooperation of the Hamura Tourism Association, Casio also showcased its biodiversity preservation and community support efforts in that city. This includes participation in Hamura's tulip field sponsorship program, as a local employer. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 165 By continuing to participate in this exhibition, Casio can widely publicize its environmental activities and propose new concepts and strategies for taking care of the environment. Eco Hunter quiz show Stamp-making class Environmental panel exhibit Ice sculpture Local elementary school students visit Hamura R&D Center On February 17, 2015, Casio Computer Co., Ltd. once again welcomed students from a social studies class at Hamura Sakae Elementary School, located in the same community as the Hamura R&D Center. This year's visit, the fourth to date, was made by 77 people, including 73 fifth-grade students and 4 teachers. Staff from the environmental affairs department talked to the students about the initiatives Casio is taking to create products with minimal environmental impact. To further enhance their understanding, after the lesson they had a chance to see actual product models and environmental exhibits, organized by various topics such as solar power and recycling. Calculator assembly class offered at the Hamura City Industrial Fair On November 1, 2014, at the 45th Hamura City Industrial Fair, Casio offered a calculator assembly lesson for elementary school students. The event is held every fall in Hamura City, home of the Hamura R&D Center. The industrial fair introduces visitors to various industries and consumer group activities in the city, and allows them to experience these enterprises by seeing, listening and touching. The main theme of this year's fair was “challenge,” which was perfect for encouraging elementary school students to take on the challenge of calculator assembly. On the day of the fair, about 60 elementary school students, broken up into five groups, enjoyed learning how to assemble a calulator. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 166 Supporting activities of the International Cetacean Education Research Center (ICERC) Japan Ever since the International Dolphin and Whale Conference was held in Japan in 1994, Casio’s G-Shock and Baby-G brands have been working with the International Cetacean Education Research Center (ICERC) Japan*1 in supporting education and research activities involving dolphins and whales in Japan and around the world. To convey the natural wonder and beauty of dolphins and whales to as many people as possible, Casio has produced watches imprinted with the All as One slogan and logo, and supports the activities of ICERC Japan. *1: ICERC Japan (International Cetacean Education Research Center) Go to website Casio supports the ICERC Ocean Environmental Classroom Project. Support is provided for environmental lessons on dolphins, whales, and the sea, where people of all ages, children to adults, can have fun learning by seeing, touching, and creating things. Casio will continue to work to realize the sustainable coexistence of people, the ocean, and its dolphin and whale population. Photo provided by ICERC Japan Supporting activities of Earth Watch Japan Based on the slogan of “Love the Sea and the Earth,” Casio's G-SHOCK and Baby-G watch brands are partnering with Earth Watch Japan, which supports research and engages in a wide range of environmental protection activities. These include activities to help protect endangered ecosystems, conserve marine environments, preserve biodiversity, and prevent climate change. In August 2014, Casio employees participated as volunteer researchers in the East Japan Green Restoration Monitoring Project of Earth Watch Japan. The project involves surveying butterfly populations in the region devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Activities Receiving Ongoing Support WWF Japan Casio endorses the mission and action principles of the World Wide Fund for Nature Japan (WWF Japan), which is striving to build a future where people and nature can live in harmony. Casio also supports the organization as a corporate member. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 167 Tree planting In an effort to promote harmonious co-existence and mutual prosperity with the global environment and its local community, Casio Electronics (Shenzhen) has been participating in tree-planting activities for the past nine years. On April 19, 2015, the company once again participated in an annual tree-planting activity sponsored by the Shenzhen City government and other local government agencies. Although the planting site was far from the city center, as many as 20 employees took part. Working in dusty conditions, they planted 20 trees. The participants also visited the location of last year's tree planting, which had become a lush Tree planting in 2015 green space, unrecognizable from the plot of muddy red soil they had seen before planting in 2014. The employees realized that they were making a difference with their small but steady planting efforts. This shared experience is helping to motivate employees to take on more activities. Nursery tree planted in 2014 Initiative to Save Otoguro Cherry Trees Otoguro cherry trees (scientific name: Cerasus serrulata, or Komatsunagi ) are a type of wild cherry that comes into full bloom in mid April. They have white blossoms measuring 5 to 6 cm, and the leaves emerge at the same time as the blooms. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, this cherry tree variety was growing along the banks of the Fuefuki River, which flows through present-day Chuo City in Yamanashi Prefecture. The Otoguro cherry gets its name from the Otoguro Embankment in the Otoguro District, where the trees used to bloom. This variety of cherry tree has long been a favorite of the people in that region. However, with the improvement of the Fuefuki River in 1932, the Otoguro cherry trees were cut down. Mr. Matsuhiko Tanaka of Otoguro District grew grafted seedlings from a few remaining descendent trees, in order to bring back the historic Otoguro cherry. His activities eventually came to fruition, and a volunteer group for saving the Otoguro cherry was established in 2002. The Tamaho-cho (now Chuo City) Board of Education lifelong learning center led the whole community in efforts to save and cultivate Otoguro cherry trees. This was achieved through cutting and Otoguro cherry trees on the grounds grafting methods using a few remaining descendents of the original trees. As part of Kofu Casio’s environmental activities, the company offered to participate in the cultivating of this endangered type of cherry tree, for the purpose of preserving the variety and beautifying the landscape around the plant. Kofu Casio received a donation of trees from Tamaho-cho (now Chuo City) in 2004, and over the three subsequent years, the company planted more than 30 Otoguro cherry trees. All the transplanted trees took root, and every spring they provide a beautiful display of blossoms for people to enjoy on the grounds of the Kofu plant. The Otoguro cherry serves as a symbol of the connection between Casio and the people of Chuo City. The company is proud of its early participation in helping to preserve the tree variety, as part of its biodiversity protection efforts on the local level. This is just one example of Casio’s vision of harmony among people, businesses, and living things. Since fiscal 2013, the Kofu Office of Casio Business Service Co., Ltd., has managed the trees. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 168 Employee efforts to preserve biodiversity by protecting endangered species May 21,2015 I work on environmental preservation activities, and I am also a photographer who holds regular photo exhibits featuring photos of wild animals. In recent years, as greater attention has been paid to climate change and biodiversity preservation, I have held regular photo exhibits to share information about endangered species, and I make donations to relevant environmental organizations based on the number of people who visit. In March 2015, I made a donation to Zamami Whale Watching Association. The donation will be used to cover expenses for surveys involving the identification of individual whales. I hope to continue contributing to the protection of endangered species through these kinds of activities.

Casio is now at a stage where the plan-do-check-act (PDCA) management cycle, with a focus on reducing the company’s environmental impact and ensuring socially responsible procurement, should be used to expand CSR initiatives group-wide. Commendable efforts by Casio Under its mediumto long-term environmental management policy, Casio has set greenhouse gas targets for fiscal 2021 and 2051 and has expanded its efforts to reduce environmental impact into the areas of packaging and distribution. This is in line with its three commitments of “realizing a low-carbon society,” “building a recycling society,” and “living in harmony with nature and preserving biodiversity.” For paper used in user manuals and brochures in particular, Casio has established new procurement policies and is complying with local laws and regulations. I am very glad to see that Casio has implemented a procurement policy that gives priority to certified or recycled paper, while avoiding purchases from companies that are associated with deforestation or other serious environmental and social issues. In addition to efforts within the group and supply chain, I have strong expectations that Casio will develop initiatives that cover the entire product lifecycle including the customer stage—such as providing instructions on optimal product usage and improving the recycling rate at the time of disposal—and also disclose information on the progress of those initiatives. As an initiative to improve supplier CSR, Casio continued its questionnaire using a five-point scale on issues such as reducing environmental impact, avoiding conflict minerals, and protecting the human rights of workers. Responses were received from 223 suppliers in Japan, 250 suppliers in China, and 30 suppliers in Thailand. By providing feedback based on the results to suppliers, making inspection visits at 15 suppliers in China and Thailand, presenting awards and providing case studies at meetings, Casio continued to ascertain and appraise its suppliers’ commitment to social responsibility. In the future, I recommend that Casio ask suppliers to provide data and other verifiable proof in their self-assessment of initiatives, and work to make the specific measures and issues even more readily visible and understandable. I also hope that Casio will further improve its system of interaction with suppliers with a view to making continual improvements. Concerning efforts to create more supportive workplaces for employees, it is laudable that 5.29% of employees at Casio Computer Co., Ltd. made use of the company’s leave and reduced working hours programs for childcare or nursing care. It is also highly commendable that support for employee health as well as nursing care and childcare leave was improved through labor-management consultation. In the future, I hope that Casio will actively create opportunities for its employees to hear from users of the nursing care support program and ask questions about any topic. Points for improvement while commending progress to date With regard to the group-wide CSR promotion system, it is admirable that Casio established a Basic Policy on Respect for Human Rights, created its own tool for checking the status of human rights, compiled responses from group companies concerning their human rights issues, and provided the results as feedback to the companies. It is also noteworthy that Casio prepared the Guidance on the Prohibition of Bribery, based on the Casio Group Code of Conduct, revised in fiscal 2014, issued a more detailed anti-corruption manual to provide further guidance, as well as disclosed the number of times its whistle-blowing system has been used. I have strong expectations that Casio will develop an implementation framework that ensures these guidelines and tools are actually put to effective use in everyday management. Looking at the fostering of a culture of social responsibility across the entire group, I am gratified to learn that Casio is preparing to appoint CSR Leaders at major group companies in and outside Japan. In the future, Casio should also translate messages from top management into languages read by employees and send them to Casio Group workplaces worldwide, to encourage the initiatives by CSR Leaders on the frontlines. I strongly hope that Casio will increase opportunities for frontline employees to quickly and thoroughly understand CSR developments at the head office and sites worldwide. Turning to group-wide efforts to enhance and make the most of employee diversity, it is nice to see that diversity preparations are being made. This includes a human resources registration system and assessment training, based on future policy aiming for a worldwide HR governance system for the entire group. Going forward, I hope that Casio will envision in detail a global personnel portfolio that transcends departmental and corporate boundaries, establish a comprehensive system for recruitment, development, exchange, and evaluation of human resources, and expand its human resources database to bring local staff members in each country into the picture. In developing such strategies and systems for making active use of employee diversity, Casio should aim for a target year in the near future, say 2020. CASIO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 171 Points for improvement In the area of employing persons with disabilities, Casio’s average consolidated performance in Japan dipped below the legally mandated rate of employment. However, improvements have been made by holding employee interviews each quarter, and introducing a staggered working hours system. I continue to have strong expectations that Casio will promote community creation efforts based on disability and job types and continue making workplaces more supportive in the future. I hope to see improvement as soon as possible Regarding the environmental impact reduction data in this report, it is commendable that details are provided on the principal sites in and outside Japan including group companies. My hope, however, would be that Casio will continue to increase the level of accuracy of group reporting, not only for environmental data, but also for personnel and procurement initiatives and data.
