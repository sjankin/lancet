The Company’s market share stood at 44.1% in the state and 26.3% in the South region. The year was marked by a significant gain in efficiency at the Terminal. Average number of moves per hour (mph) in vessel operations was 103.4 (mph) in 2015, with the indicator peaking in certain months such as August, when it reached 119.4 MPH. It was the Company’s best result since it went operational. TEU HANDLING – PORTONAVE ('000 UNITS ) Reflecting Brazil’s performance in international trade, the terminal handled 679,789 TEUs in the year, 2.9% lower than the volume recorded in 2014. 699.8 800 Iceport, the cold storage chamber adjacent to the Port Terminal, which is one of Portonave’s key competitive advantages, set a new handling record 679.7 in 2015: 308.500 tons. 600 400 200 2015 TRIUNFO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2014 2015 PORTONAVE HAS 44.1% MARKET SHARE IN SANTA CATARINA AND 26.3% IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL. 43 PRESENTATION THE REPORT 01 CORPORATE PROFILE 02 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 03 FINANCIAL CAPITAL 04 NATURAL CAPITAL 05 AIRPORT SOCIAL CAPITAL 06 Aeroportos Brasil Viracopos registered record passenger traffic in 2015: 10.3 million, increasing by 4.8% from the previous year. This strong performance is mainly due to the increase in international flights offered. All international flights operate in the New Terminal, which should also handle domestic flights starting from 2016. Volume of cargo transported decreased 18.4%. The decrease in volume was offset by actions focused on high-value cargo, improvements to infrastructure (expansion of cold storage chambers) and reduction in the average time for cargo clearance.

Focusing on the quality of services provided to users and on boosting the Company’s economic and financial results, the Program aims to develop management tools through sharing experiences and encouraging the culture of innovation. 2015 TRIUNFO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT In this first stage, which should last until 2016, the Program is being developed on three fronts: processes, innovation and funding. Over the course of 2015, professionals from all concessionaires underwent specific training in these areas. Reduction in losses, optimization of processes, strengthening of governance and strategic monitoring of the businesses are some of the benefits generated by the Program. Also launched in 2015, the Innovation Program is part of Road Management. Aligned with the Company’s business strategy, it plays a key role in the qualification of Triunfo’s investments in Research and Development (R&D), thereby making its businesses more competitive. 2 Results of toll road service companies are not included in the consolidated results since their revenue is considered a cost for concessionaires. 3 After deducting investments in communities. 47 4 Amounts reported by Triunfo Concepa, Concer, Triunfo Econorte, Portonave, Tijoá and Aeroportos Brasil Viracopos.

The Degraded Area Recovery Project (PRAD) entitled Nossa Praia (Our Beach) comprises all 102 hectares of beaches in the municipality and aims to recover vegetation in the restinga, including actions such as removing exotic vegetation, planting native species, rebuilding dunes and closing illegal tracks. The project also aims to revitalize the waterfront by constructing a deck and a bike way, besides improving lighting. The investments of nearly R$7 million are split between the Company and the municipal government of Navegantes, which is a partner in the project. The work, which began in the first half of 2015, is expected to be completed by April 2016. The company’s investment in this initiative is a way of environmental compensation for the use of an ancient preservation area attached to the Terminal. In 2015, Portonave acquired an area adjacent to the current project, including a Permanent Preservation Area (APP) measuring 0.093 km². This area is classified as secondary vegetation in the initial and middle stage of regeneration of the Atlantic Forest6. In Campinas, Aeroportos Brasil Viracopos is responsible for three protected areas that form the airport site, which jointly span around 8,300 km2. The Basic 2015 TRIUNFO SUSTAINABILITY REPORT Environmental Plan (PBA) for airport expansion envisages implementation of programs to ensure conservation of the region’s biodiversity, such as replanting of native species. In 2015, 44.2 hectares of vegetation were recovered. Recovery actions are also carried out in the area of Três Irmãos HEP of Tijoá; by 2015, 3,005.06 hectares had been restored. In Rio de Janeiro, Concer expanded the area restored at the Pedra do Elefante monument in Petrópolis to 26 hectares, of which 25 hectares had been restored in the previous year.
