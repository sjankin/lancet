However, still a significant reducboiler later than estimated we saw a reduction of 1,195 tonnes tion compared to 2014 levels. compared to 2014. Reduction of emissions for the years to come will be significantly better with full operation on the wood chips fired boiler.

With intensive focus we have succeeded to reduce the water consumption by 43,012 m3 in 2015. Less water intake naturally reflect less emission volume, which meant a reduction of 28,868 m3. Originally, Skjern Papirfabrik was founded in 1965 by a group of enterprising local citizens. When calculating the readers will find that the year 2015 had a special meaning for the mill. On the same occasion we celebrated the present group of owners 10th years anniversary and the undersigned’s 40th years anniversary. All three events were celebrated as one common 100th anniversary on September 18 with an Open House. Guided tours at the mill were included where employees acted as guides. The day ended in an appropriate manner with a party for all employees and their partners. With the expectation of more stability and normal market fluctuations we look forward to an exciting and challenging 2016 for the mill and its employees.

From 2013 it has been possible to have FSC-certified products from Skjern Papirfabrik. The mill is located in beautiful natural surroundings close to Skjern River. As a relatively minor paper mill our strength lies in being a good business partner, supplying quality products on time and showing large flexibility when it comes to customer needs. ” We make ongoing investments to make production more efficient, to reduce energy consumption and other environmental 60,642 saleable tonnes of paper were produced in 2015 impacts from the paper production.

Page 8 Skjern Papirfabrik through 50 years In September 2015 Skjern Papirfabrik celebrated its 50th years Skjern Papirfabrik was founded in 1965 by local investors, who anniversary. On the same occasion we celebrated our CEO Jørsaw the potentials in the recycling of paper and cardboard and gen Thomsen on his 40th years anniversary, and also 10 years creating jobs locally. The mill was located close to Skjern River, of independence. A total celebration of 100 years took place on which is one of the largest rivers in Denmark. Up to 2014 the September 18, 2015. river supplied Skjern Papirfabrik with process water. For the last 10 years large investments are made, which means that Skjern Papirfabrik today belongs to the most eco-friendly mills in the world. For the last 5 years large investments in green energy projects are made, which among others secure the utilisation of waste heat for district heating production that is supplied to Skjern City’s district heating network. The wood chips fired boiler plant, which was built in 2015, will more or less phase out the use of fossil fuels in favour of wood chips. On this boiler plant there is also a heat pump which increases district heating production of the waste heat from the flue gas. All this is possible thanks to a group of owners who look at long-term perspectives for both economy and environment, and who have the courage to invest large amounts in the right solutions. ” 1965 was the year, where Skjern Papirfabrik was founded Over the years the mill has had different owners. In 2005 it was bought by Buur Invest and three of the mill’s senior management. Page 9 Employees At Skjern Papirfabrik the number of employees is very constant. Development of seniority There is a positive tendency that employees stay in their jobs at 16 the mill for many years, and that gives a good stability among the employees and a very experienced work force in all depart15 ments. 14 The mill has 73 employees with the following composition: 13 • 4 skilled metalworkers • 2 automation mechanics 12 • 51 blue-collar workers 11 • 16 white-collar workers 10 Skjern Papirfabrik sees it as a natural part of our activities to 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 treat employees with respect and dignity and thus avoid discriAverage seniority mination. This is a natural thing for a Danish company, and we consider it a contributing factor to our staff’s high seniority and thus many employees who celebrate their 25th anniversary. Staff turnover has been increasing for the last 4 years. This is a ” natural development, as Skjern Papirfabrik has a large number of the staff has been of employees who are around or more than 60 years old. We 27.4% employed for more than 25 years expect a considerably high turnover still of employees in the years to come. In Denmark we have many nationalities, and Skjern Papirfabrik Staff turnover in % sees it as a natural thing to offer people of foreign nationalities 10 work at the mill on equal terms with Danish citizens. ” 9 of the work force is today 8 8.2% people of foreign nationality 7 6 5 4 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Staff turnover in % Page 10 Health and safety Health and safety is an interaction between the conditions, impacts and relations under which the staff are working.

Page 11 Environmental Impacts Paper production is known to be a most energy demanding The indirect environmental impacts are not directly affected by method of production. Therefore, we are proud to use primarily the production, but primarily consist of the transportation of wood chips for the steam production as from the end of 2015. raw materials and end products. Environmental impacts caused The steam will mainly feed the drying section of the paper maby the collection of waste paper, the production of auxiliary machine, which is the main consumer of energy.

Fluctuations can be ascribed to variations in the amount of impurities in the raw materials, uncertainties as to moisture content, and a probably better utilisation of the fibres at lower speed on the paper machine. Page 19 Input and output of materials (continued) Auxiliary materials Furthermore, auxiliary materials are used Many auxiliary materials are used at Skjern Papirfabrik, from for band filter cleaning of the condenwhich the majority is used for the production of paper.

However, the largest number of the auxiliary materials are used in the maintenance and boiler plant departments, but in a much A, B and C substances smaller amount. The guidelines on environmentally harmful substances in industrial Auxiliary materials in this report are materials with a relatively wastewater from the Danish Enlarge consumption, which means that for an example consumpvironmental Protection Agency opetion of spray bottles in the welding department are not includrate within three categories: A, B and C ed.

C-substances are regarded as unproblematic. The remaining part consists of water or inorga12 nic auxiliary materials. 10 8 The distribution in percentages of the total consumption of 6 auxiliary materials can be seen in the figure below: 4 0.07% 4.96% 0.07% 4.96% 2 77.55% 17.41% 77.55% 17.41% 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 The table shows the distribution of auxiliary materials compared to quantity produced. It is to be seen that the consumption of auxiliary materials for production is approximately the same level as in 2014. Deviations are mainly due to changes of the production mix deciding which auxiliary materials must be used, and in which amounts. ” The consumption of auxiliary materials for maintenance and boiler plant went up a little compared to 2014, because the of the used auxiliary manew wood chips fired boiler came into operation by the end of Only 0.07% terials consist of the undesired A-substances the year. On this plant relatively large quantities of lye are used for neutralisation. Page 20 Input and output of materials (continued) In 2015 a new ABC evaluation was made for all the auxiliary materials mentioned. The new estimate is based on updated safety data sheets and the Danish Environmental Protection Agency’s guidelines. This means that some materials might be estimated differently. The distribution in percentage of A-substances lies at a very low content in 2015, which is primarily due to less use of a specific dye. The mill got a licence to produce larger batches with this dye, in order to obtain less consumption for running-in of the product with dye. Waste As far as possible Skjern Papirfabrik tries to utilize the waste from the mill. This means that iron is recycled, waste is sent for controlled composting in order to utilise the fibre content for soil improvement, combustible waste is sent for combustion with heat production, and the bottom ashes from the new wood chips fired boiler will be utilised by spreading it on farm land so the nutrients return to nature. ” 93.7% of the waste were utilised in 2015 Waste from the mill mainly consists of discarded impurities from paper raw materials containing a number of non-usable materials, such as plastic, paper clips, glass, fabric remnants, etc. These residual products are discarded through several cleaning units. The term »waste reject« covers waste from the pulper, which primarily consists of metal bands from the paper rolls, plastic and fabric remnants. This fraction is also called the pulper tail, as the waste is wound to a long »tail«, which is drawn from pulper to container. The waste reject is sent for further processing, where the metal parts are sorted out and recycled, and combustible waste is utilised for heat production. Page 21 Input and output of materials (continued) The term »reject for soil improvement« is a waste product Waste and reject compared to produced primarily consisting of paper fibres mixed with a minor part of quantities of paper kg/tonnes DM styropor and plastic. This waste fraction is transported for composting, before it is used for soil improvement. 40 It is to be seen that the quantity of combustible waste has been at a higher level in 2014 and 2015, than has been seen before. It is considered to be due to periods with larger amounts of impurities in the paper raw materials than usual. 20 The calculation of the total quantity of waste includes the quantity of suspended solids led with the wastewater for municipal wastewater treatment. Suspended solids are estimated primarily to consist of paper fibres so small that they are not retained 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 in the mill’s filters. There is for 2015 also a small amount of ashes from the last months of the year, where the wood chips fired boiler has been running.

The establishment of the plant and the crane facilities. Expected yearly consumption is 27,000 tonnes boiler building was the largest investment in the mill’s history of wood chips, to be supplied from forests in western Jutland of approx. 70 million DKK. The installation of the wood chips within a range of 40 km. This will increase the yearly lorry traffired boiler plant required many resources, both in relation to fic to the mill by approx. 1,000 loads, from 7,000 to 8,000. In finances and employees. For that reason other projects were order to meet traffic-related challenges a turning lane with given a low priority in 2015. room for 5-6 lorries was in 2015 established within the same project. The background for the investment is, that the Danish government in 2013 launched an ambitious subsidy scheme (the VEIn connection with operation of the plant a considerable share funds). This supports the distribution of industrial district heaof low temperature waste heat will be developed, which will be ting and further use of biomass within the industry, which has utilised by discharge to the local district heating company.

Subsidies from the VE-fund expectations are that with the district heating production from covers approx. half of the total investment, which reduce the the new wood chips fired boiler plant Skjern Papirfabrik will net investment considerably. supply approx. 70 % of the district heating to Skjern City. In ” connection with the utilisation of the waste heat and the district heating production another storage tank was built, so the approx. 14,000 tonnes CO² mill has now 2 x 1,250 m3 district heating accumulation at our are expected to be saved every year by disposal. The coupling of the 3 tanks – including the tank from using wood chips instead of gas. Skjern district heating plant – calls for advanced control of the levels in both tanks at the mill. Skjern district heating plant controls the pumping out of district heating During the planning period it was decided to include a heat from Skjern Papirfabrik’s accumulated pump to increase utilisation of waste heat from the flue gas. district heating. However, this investment is not included in the VE-funds subsidy scheme. The installation of a heat pump is calculated to give a yearly saving of energy of 10,259 MWh consisting of additional district heating production.
