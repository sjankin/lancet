Using this method, it plans to reduce CO2 emissions by 5,700 tons per year. In December 2014, the company began a “partial procurement scheme,” sourcing part of the energy used at its plants and other major business locations through Japan’s Power Producers & Suppliers (PPS) system, which involves both electric utilities and specified electricity market entrants. Previously each business location selected one major utility company or PPS provider to cover its electricity needs, an approach that allowed selection of a provider with a lower-carbon generation footprint. Facilities like factories, though, with their high demand, generally had to procure electricity from a utility company with proven capacity. The new partial procurement scheme allows all facilities to secure the stable power supply they need while also reducing related CO2 emissions and slashing costs at the same time. To date the scheme has been implemented at eight Nissan facilities, including the Nissan Technical Center, Tochigi Plant, Oppama Plant, Yokohama Plant and Zama Operation Center, and at eight partner company locations, including those of Nissan Shatai, Nissan Kohki and Calsonic Kansei.

Outlets also endeavor to quickly and accurately grasp customers’ repair and inspection needs after purchase. There has recently been room for improvement, though, with dealer actions failing at times to satisfy customers due to repetitious questions, long waiting times and complicated explanations. Nissan reviewed its new vehicle purchase and repair processes from a customer perspective, introducing digital tools to support dealership operations. For example, dealers previously referred to a standard catalog when explaining vehicle functions at the time of delivery. Now, digital tools enable customers to select functions they wish to know about, enabling more comprehensive, effective and efficient explanations. Nissan strives to implement meticulous service tailored to customer needs throughout the entire process of purchasing a vehicle or bringing it in for repair or inspection. Establishing Global Dealership Standards To meet changes in customers’ expectations of dealerships and purchasing behavior, Nissan is making improvements to sales facilities, as well as their service approaches and other intangible aspects. The Nissan Retail Environment Design Initiative (NREDI) 2.0 is a newly developed global standard for the next generation of dealerships under the Nissan brand. The company has overhauled dealership design and layout with an eye on addressing customer dissatisfaction with existing stores, responding to diversifying needs and boosting brand appeal. Nissan is integrating these overhauls with a rethinking of other points of customer contact, such as its website, as well as intangible systems and services in dealerships. It aims to create attractive dealerships for all customers—whether they have come to purchase a new car or to get a vehicle inspected or serviced—that are comfortable, welcoming places to spend time while also offering needed services as efficiently as possible. Nissan’s goal is to provide its customers with dealership experiences of globally consistent high quality. New outlet construction has begun as a pilot scheme in major markets; the new standard will be progressively rolled out worldwide.

The energy use data of each site is based on invoices from suppliers, which are multiplied by a CO2 emissions coefficient publicly available for each production site. ■ CO2 emissions resulting from employees’ commutes: Calculated based on the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard. Specifically, the annual CO2 emissions resulting from each employee’s commute are calculated using a standard unit of measurement announced by Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Ministry of the Environment, and Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. This figure is calculated on the basis that employees working at Global Headquarters commute by bus and other employees use cars that are vehicles designated by Nissan, based on the data they submit when applying for transportation allowances. This is multiplied by the number of employees at each facility or office. ■ CO2 emissions from the use of sold products: Calculated using the average regional CO2 emissions per vehicle multiplied by estimated average lifecycle mileage and multiplied by fiscal 2015 sales volumes. The average CO2 emissions for the use phase (including direct emissions only) per unit are calculated for each of our main regions (Japan, U.S., EU and China) and extrapolated from average emissions of these markets for other markets. The Sustainable Mobility Project (SMP) model issued by the International Energy Agency was used to determine estimated average lifecycle mileages. ■ Scope 3 emissions figures are estimates subject to varying inherent uncertainties. ■ Waste generated from production sites of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in Japan: Calculated based on Nissan internal standards. The discharged waste is based on data from truck scales at the sites or data reported by disposal contractors. All discharged waste within the sites concerned is targeted. However, nonsteady and irregular generated waste, waste generated in canteens, waste from permanently stationed companies at the sites, waste generated by external vendors and waste from construction are excluded. In addition, materials recycled in-house, used in reproduction (reused by Nissan) or recycled (as salable, valuable materials) are not categorized as generated waste. ■ Water input from production sites of Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. in Japan: Calculated based on Nissan internal standards. Water input is the water withdrawal amount according to billing meters or company meters installed on site. The water withdrawal amount includes drinking water (tap water), industrial-use water, underground water (spring/well water) and rainwater or the like.
