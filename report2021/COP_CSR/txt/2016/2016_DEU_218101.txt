Rick Morisson, project manager, Flatiron “Ruskin Dam and ­Powerhouse” Group Management Report Our latest project is absolutely exciting. While upgrading and expanding the Ruskin Dam and hydro power station located less than 60 kilometers from Vancouver, we discovered a light bulb in the powerhouse that had been installed more than 80 years earlier and was still glowing strong! We interpreted this as a good sign. After all, this facility will produce clean hydroelectric power for 33,000 households in the future. Since embarking on the project in 2012, we have gained a wealth of experience and huge respect for water as a force of nature. When, for instance, heavy rains dramatically raised levels in the reservoir in fall 2014, we had to open the spill gates to release enormous volumes of water—900 cubic meters per second for a period of several weeks! Before construction got underway, we devised an environmental management plan. And we have adhered to it strictly ever since, especially as the 40-meter-high, 100-meter-long dam sits in a recreation area used by many people. What’s more, the reservoir behind the dam is not just a source of drinking water. Downstream thousands of salmon also come to spawn. This is why any water we contaminate is collected and treated. The Ruskin Dam is being built to stand the test of time as well as any potential earthquakes. So that 80 years from now it will still be keeping the lights on. In the Canadian province of British Columbia, the HOCHTIEF company Flatiron is upgrading Ruskin Dam and powerhouse, work slated for completion by 2017. 26 Group Report 2015 Group Report 2015 27 Combined HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and Group Management Report Business Activities and Group Structure Group structure 2015 Corporate Headquarters (strategic and operational management holding company) Divisions Group Management Report HOCHTIEF HOCHTIEF HOCHTIEF Americas Asia Pacific Europe **For further information on the Group structure 2015 Business activities of the HOCHTIEF Group** divisions’ business activities, please see pages 3 and 4 as HOCHTIEF delivers its services worldwide through the HOCHTIEF is an international construction group, carrywell as pages 80 to 93. three divisions HOCHTIEF Americas, HOCHTIEF Asia ing out projects in the transportation, energy, and social Pacific, and HOCHTIEF Europe.

We do not therefore cover these points in Peter Sassenfeld detail in the combined Group and HOCHTIEF Aktien­ gesellschaft Management Report. There are no limitations on voting rights, no restrictions on the exercise of José Ignacio Legorburo Escobar Nikolaus Graf von Matuschka Group Report 2015 77 Focus Area: Sustainable Products and Services In my world, I see the big picture. Michael Deane, Chief Sustainability Officer, Turner Construction Group Management Report Group Management Report An integrated approach to construction projects using sustainable products and services pays off. When you look at building use and long-term operation, the advantages of environmentally friendly construction are clear. Turner is the market leader for green buildings which has given us a clear understanding of the vital importance not just of green materials but also the responsible use of energy and resources in every phase of construction and operation of a building. We work to recognized benchmarks, chiefly the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED standard, and have completed 508 LEED-certified structures. We share our clients’ commitment to this concept and trust in our expertise. At Turner, minimizing the impact on the environment and neighboring communities is among our top priorities. To help us achieve these goals, we harness technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM). This computer-aided design and construction method helps us maximize our efficiency. BIM and other lean processes have resulted in improved outcomes including reductions in schedule and project cost, and increases in overall client satisfaction. New York is a dazzling city with a unique energy. Turner has been instrumental in shaping its modern face by adding numerous structures—the majority of which qualify as green buildings. 78 Group Report 2015 Group Report 2015 79 Divisional Reporting HOCHTIEF Americas Division For further information, The HOCHTIEF Americas division combines the activiTurner remains among the leaders in the U.S. building please see: ties of our North American subsidiaries Turner, Flatiron, construction market.

Group Report 2015 93 Focus Area: Compliance In my world, fairness counts. Dr. Alexandra ­A lbrecht-Baba Head of Corporate Compliance HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft Group Management Report Whether in the world’s financial capitals, on construction sites or in offices—wherever people come together to work and do business, clear rules are indispensable. That’s why we at HOCHTIEF have drawn up a Code of Conduct that provides all employees with a set of binding rules and clear guidance on appropriate behavior. HOCHTIEF expects everyone in its employ to adhere to these rules—no ifs or buts. To ensure our external partners are also on the same page, we have additionally formulated a Code of Conduct for Business Partners. It is a matter of great importance to me that the compliance system itself is credible and consistent. Staff should be in a position to evaluate the advice Compliance provides. Not just because they know and understand the rules, but also because they can count on similar matters being handled in the same way. For this reason, training is also an essential part of our job. Over the course of many years, HOCHTIEF and its subsidiaries have earned an excellent reputation around the world—chiefly for our strong sense of tradition and steadfast resolve but also for our outstanding products and services as well as our reliability. Safeguarding this reputation is the key task of every HOCHTIEF employee. Frankfurt am Main is a major financial, trade show, and service-provider center.

The data is used to derive design specifications, verify design assumptions, and monitor safety performance during different stages of the construction process. With the proliferation of monitoring equipment, it is increasingly hard for surveyors and engineers to efficiently manage the complex process of data collection, data storage, and reporting. In response, CIMIC has developed the innovative Group Management Report GeoView system to collect and process all data internally and display it on a range of different devices. This removes the need to engage an external service provider at high cost.

Overall assessment of future developments In 2016, HOCHTIEF will continue to focus on implementing its strategy throughout the Group and systematically press ahead with related initiatives. In the process, operational earnings and profit margins are expected to further improve across all divisions. HOCHTIEF’s profit before tax, EBIT, and consolidated net profit will consequently see sustained growth, with levels well above the prior year. Alongside the anticipated gain in profitability, the strategic focus on cash generation will also maintain a clearly positive effect on Group cash flow and net cash development. This ongoing optimization of HOCHTIEF’s financial strength means we will remain exceedingly well placed in future years to invest on a sustained basis and 132 Group Report 2015 Risk Report Risk management at HOCHTIEF encompasses all orgaHOCHTIEF Group early warning system nizational processes designed to detect risks as well as A Group risk reporting directive that is accessible to all to develop and implement suitable countermeasures.

Group Report 2015 145 Focus Area: Corporate Citizenship In my world, I work to improve quality of life. Birgit Meise, project manager for the 2015 B2P project in Rwanda and a HOCHTIEF Building engineer Building bridges—that means overcoming limitations, gathering new experiences, and bringing people together. In November, I took part in just such an enriching encounter: Nine colleagues from Germany and other countries, the organization Bridges to Prosperity (B2P), and local Sustainability at HOCHTIEF helpers all joined forces to build a footbridge in Rwanda. Residents of the nearby villages were desperately in need of the bridge because the stream swells during the rainy season and creates an insurmountable barrier, cutting them off from schools, markets, and doctors. Getting to know new cultures and mentalities in a foreign country was fascinating. I was especially thrilled to see how well the international team pulled together. We all learned from one another in the process and ultimately completed a 70-meter bridge—with huge benefits for everyone involved.

Group Report 2015 173 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Accounting policies General information The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU and with supplementary provisions of German commercial law applicable under Section 315a (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The same accounting policies applied in the prior year. Alongside the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Financial Statements also include a Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Segment reporting is provided in these Notes. For purposes of clarity, a number of items are combined in the Balance Sheet and in the Statement of Earnings. These items are broken down into their constituents and commented on elsewhere in these Notes. The Statement of Earnings is presented using the nature of expense method of analysis. The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros. As an independent listed group, HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen, Germany, publishes its own consolidated financial statements, which are also included in the consolidated financial statements of ACS Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, S.A., Madrid, Spain (ACS). The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the year 2015, comprising the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The Executive Board of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft released the financial statements for publication on February 19, 2016. They will be approved at the Supervisory Board meeting on February 24, 2016. Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft as well as all significant domestic and foreign subsidiaries in which it directly or indirectly holds the majority of voting rights. This generally goes hand in hand with a majority shareholding. Two companies are consolidated by virtue of contractual arrangements. AssoConsolidated Financial Statements ciates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Companies in which HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft holds a majority of voting rights but over which it exercises joint control by contractual arrangement with other owners are likewise accounted for using the equity method unless classified as joint operations. and Notes Holdings in subsidiaries or associated companies or joint ventures deemed to be of minor overall significance from a Group perspective are not consolidated and are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39. A number of the subsidiaries included in the Consolidated Financial Statements make partial use of the exempting provisions in either Section 264 (3) or Section 264b of the German Commercial Code. A list of the companies that make use of these exemptions is included on page 248 and 249. 174 Group Report 2015 The Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2015 include HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and a total of 58 German and 397 foreign consolidated companies as well as four special-purpose investment funds (Spezialfonds). The number of consolidated companies decreased by 15 and the number of special-purpose funds by one compared with the previous year. A total of four German and 28 foreign companies were consolidated for the first time in the reporting year. The additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (17), the HOCHTIEF Europe division (11), and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (4). The majority are project companies. A total of four domestic and 43 foreign companies were removed from the consolidated group. Most of the companies removed from the consolidated group were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (28) and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (18). An entity is generally added to or removed from the consolidated group at the time the equity stake in the entity is acquired or disposed of. Fifty-two affiliated companies of minor overall significance to the Group’s financial position and results of operations were not consolidated. Their combined sales represented less than 1% of consolidated sales. Sixteen domestic and 166 foreign associates were accounted for using the equity method. This number declined by a total of 11 companies, with 14 companies added and 25 removed. Most of the additions were in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (7) and the HOCHTIEF Americas division (5). The removals related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division (16) and the HOCHTIEF Europe division (9). Due to their minor overall significance, a further 19 companies were not accounted for using the equity method. A total of 59 joint operations from the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements on a proportionate basis. In the year under review, ten entities were added and seven removed. Consolidation policies The financial statements of domestic and international companies included in the Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting principles. All business combinations (acquisitions) are accounted for using the acquisition method. Business combinations are measured at the acquisition date by allocating the consideration given to the acquired subsidiary’s net assets measured at fair value. Transaction costs arising in connection with such acquisitions are recognized directly as expense. All assets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an acquired subsidiary that satisfy the recognition criteria are measured at full fair value regardless of any minority interest. Intangible assets are recognized separately from goodwill if they are separable from the accounting entity or arise from contractual or other legal rights. Any goodwill then left is recognized as an asset. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. Negative goodwill arising on initial measurement is recognized immediately in income. On divestment, a pro rata share of the divesting division’s goodwill is taken into account when Consolidated Financial Statements measuring disposal proceeds. Goodwill increased by EUR 40,494 thousand in the year under review, from EUR 666,677 thousand to EUR 707,171 thousand. and Notes Group Report 2015 175 Income, expenses, receivables, and liabilities between consolidated companies are eliminated. Unrealized intercompany profits and losses are eliminated unless they are of minor significance. Any impairment losses recognized for consolidated companies in their separate financial statements are reversed. The same policies apply to equity-method investments. These include the Group’s associates and joint ventures. Any goodwill increases the carrying amount of an investment. Like other goodwill, goodwill on equity-method investments is not amortized. Reductions in carrying amount due to impairment are reported in the share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures. The financial statements of all equity-method investments are prepared in accordance with uniform Group accounting policies. Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Non-current assets held for sale (disposal group) In view of the intention to sell, mining assets of PT Thiess Contractors Indonesia (HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division) are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5 as assets held for sale. Further negotiations were conducted during the 2015 reporting year and an agreement for the sale of the assets was signed in January 2016. Inventories, property, plant and equipment, and lease liabilities were consequently reclassified, the reclassification having no impact on the Statement of Earnings. The remaining assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale and presented separately in the balance sheet. The table below shows the major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale. No amount is additionally recognized in other comprehensive income.

CIMIC’s entire stake in its subsidiary John Holland Group (Melbourne, Australia) was consequently sold to CCCC International Holding Limited (Beijing, China). CIMIC brought 50% of its activities in Thiess Services (Brisbane, Australia) and Leighton Contractors Services (Sydney, Australia) under a joint venture established with subsidiaries of Apollo Global Management, LLC. Consolidated Financial Statements The prior-year Statement of Earnings for the HOCHTIEF Group showed EUR 537,564 thousand in profit after tax from discontinued operations. No divestments meeting the criteria of discontinued operations were made in 2015. It was therefore not necessary to report profit after tax from discontinued operations in 2015. and Notes 176 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The table below shows the main figures, including for the prior year, for the discontinued operations of the John Holland Group as well as of Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services.

Exchange gains or losses up to the reporting date and Notes on the measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets or liabilities are included in other operating income or other operating expenses at the average exchange rate on the reporting date. Currency translation differences relating to a net investment in a foreign company are accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive income until the company is sold. This includes foreign currency receivables from fully consolidated Group companies for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which therefore resemble equity. Group Report 2015 177 Financial statements of foreign companies are translated by applying the functional currency approach. As all companies outside the euro area operate autonomously in their own national currencies, their balance sheet items are translated into euros using the average exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date in accordance with official requirements. The same method is used to translate the shareholders’ equity of equity-method foreign associates following equity-method adjustment. Differences from the previous year’s translated amount are recognized in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on sale of the equity interest. Goodwill of commercially independent foreign Group entities is translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated into euros using the annual average exchange rate. Accounting policies Intangible assets are reported at amortized cost. All intangible assets have a finite useful life with the exception of company names recognized as assets on initial consolidation and of goodwill. Intangible assets include concessions and other licenses with useful lives of up to 30 years. These are amortized according to the pattern of consumption of economic benefits. They also include future earnings from additions to the order backlog arising from business acquisitions; these are amortized over the period in which the corresponding work is billed. Intangible assets further encompass software for commercial and engineering applications, which is amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years, and entitlements to various financing arrangements with banks amortized over a maximum of 10 years in accordance with the term of the arrangement. Estimated useful lives and amortization methods are reviewed annually. Company names and goodwill are not amortized. They are tested instead for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 on an annual basis and whenever there are indications that they may be impaired. The companies recognized in the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific divisions were classified as intangible assets with an indefi­ nite useful life as they do not have a product life cycle and are not subject to technical, technological, or commercial depletion or any other restriction. Capitalized development costs are reported in intangible assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over three to five years. Property, plant and equipment is stated at depreciated cost. Only amounts directly attributable to an item of property, plant or equipment are included in its cost. Borrowing costs are included in cost in the case of qualifying assets. Property, plant and equipment is normally depreciated on a straight-line basis, except in the contract mining business where depreciation is mostly recognized on an activity basis. Items of property, plant, machinery and equipment typically encountered in the HOCHTIEF Group are depreciated Consolidated Financial Statements on a straight-line basis over the following uniform useful lives: No. of years Buildings and investment properties 20–50 Technical equipment and machinery; ­transportation equipment 3–10 and Notes Other equipment and office equipment 3–8 Estimated useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed annually. 178 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Items of property, plant and equipment on finance leases are recognized at fair value or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or over a shorter contract term if applicable. Investment properties are stated at amortized cost. Transaction costs are included on initial measurement. The fair values of investment properties are disclosed in the Notes. They are assessed using internationally accepted valuation methods, such as taking comparable properties as a guide to current market prices or by applying the discounted cash flow method. Like property, plant and equipment, investment properties are normally depreciated using the straight-line method. Impairment losses are recognized for intangible assets (including goodwill), property, plant and equipment, or investment properties if their recoverable amount falls below their carrying amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is normally defined as fair value less costs to sell or value in use, whichever is higher. Impairment testing may require assets and, in some cases, liabilities to be grouped into cash-generating units. For goodwill, impairment testing is performed on cash-generating units corresponding to the HOCHTIEF divisions that feature in segmental reporting. For any asset that is part of an independent cash-generating unit, impairment is determined with reference to the recoverable amount of the unit. If the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit falls below its carrying amount, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to any goodwill belonging to the unit and then to the unit’s other assets, normally pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset. Except in the case of goodwill, impairment charges are reversed (up to a maximum of amortized cost) when the impairment ceases to exist. A joint arrangement is an arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control. The parties to a joint arrangement classify it as a joint operation or a joint venture depending on their respective rights and obligations. In a joint operation, the parties have direct rights to the assets and direct obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. Each party recognizes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, together with its share of such items held or incurred jointly, relative to the HOCHTIEF Group’s rights and obligations. In a joint venture, where the parties have rights to the net assets arising from the arrangement, the parties each account for their interests in the joint venture using the equity method. Equity-method investments are stated at cost, comprising the acquired equity interest in an associate or joint ventures plus any goodwill. The carrying amount is increased or decreased annually to recognize the Group’s share of after-tax profits or losses, any dividends, and other changes in equity. The full carrying amount is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 whenever there are indications that it may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of an equity-method investment is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the Consolidated Financial Statements difference. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss. and Notes Group Report 2015 179 All other financial assets, comprising interests in non-consolidated subsidiaries, other participating interests, and non-current securities, are classed as held for sale and are measured at fair value where a fair value can be reliably estimated. In the case of publicly listed financial assets, fair value is determined as the market price. If there is no active market, fair value is calculated using the most recent market transactions or a valuation method such as the discounted cash flow method. In cases where fair value cannot be measured reliably, financial assets are reported at cost (less any impairments). Initial measurement is performed as of the settlement date. Unrealized gains or losses are accounted for, after adjusting for deferred taxation, in other comprehensive income and are reversed to income or expense on disposal of the asset. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. Receivables and other assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). An impairment loss is recognized if there is any objective material evidence that a financial asset may be impaired. Objective evidence for impairment includes, for example, downgrading of a debtor’s credit rating and related interruptions in payment or potential insolvency. Impairment losses are recognized according to actual credit risk. “Receivables” comprise financial receivables, trade receivables, and other receivables. Sales are shown net of VAT and other taxes and expected reductions such as trade discounts and rebates. Sales of goods are recognized when: • The significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the buyer • The HOCHTIEF Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold • The amount of revenue and the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably • It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the HOCHTIEF Group. Revenue from transactions involving the rendering of services is recognized by reference to the stage of completion. Revenue under construction contracts is recognized as described below. Long-term loans are stated at amortized cost. Loans yielding interest at normal market rates are reported at face value, and non-interest-bearing and low-interest-bearing loans are discounted to present value. Discounting is always done using a risk-adjusted discount rate. *See glossary on page 260. Construction contracts are reported using the percentage of completion* (POC) method. Cumulative work done to date, including the Group’s share of net profit, is reported under sales on a pro rata basis according to the percentage completed. The percentage of completion is measured by reference to the stage of completion; that is, as Consolidated Financial Statements the ratio of performance delivered up to the end of the reporting period to total contract performance. Construction contracts are reported in trade receivables and trade payables, as “Gross amount due from/to customers for/ from contract work (POC).” If cumulative work done to date (contract costs plus contract net profit) of contracts in progress exceeds progress payments received, the difference is recognized as an asset and included in amounts and Notes due from customers for contract work. If the net amount after deduction of progress payments received is negative, the difference is recognized as a liability and included in amounts due to customers from contract work. Anticipated 180 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements losses on specific contracts are accounted for on the basis of the identifiable risks. Construction contracts handled by construction joint ventures are also accounted for using the POC method. Trade receivables from construction joint ventures include pro rata entitlements to contract net profit. Anticipated losses are immediately recognized in full in contract net profit. Contract income on construction contracts undertaken by the Group independently or in construction joint ventures is recognized in accordance with IAS 11 as the income stipulated in the contract plus any claims and variation orders. Construction contract receivables are realized as part of the HOCHTIEF Group’s operating cycle. In accordance with IAS 1, they are therefore included in current assets even though they are not expected to be realized within twelve months of the balance sheet date. The POC method is used primarily in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between the IFRS accounts and tax base of individual Group companies or as a result of consolidation are recognized as separate assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax refund entitlements resulting from the anticipated use of existing tax loss carryforwards in subsequent years provided it is sufficiently certain that they will be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset within each company or group. Deferred taxes are measured on the basis of tax rates applying or expected to apply in each country when they are realized. For domestic operations, as in the prior year, a tax rate of 31.5% is assumed, taking account of corporate income tax plus the German “solidarity surcharge” and the average rate of municipal trade tax faced by Group companies. For all other purposes, deferred taxes are measured on the basis of the tax regulations in force or enacted at the reporting date. Inventories are initially stated at cost of purchase or production. Production cost includes costs directly related to the units of production plus an appropriate allocation of materials and production overhead, including productionrelated depreciation charges. Borrowing costs for inventories that are qualifying assets are capitalized as part of cost. Most materials and supplies are measured on a FIFO or moving-average basis. Inventories are written down to net realizable value if their recoverable amount is less than their carrying amount at the reporting date. If the recoverable amount of inventories subsequently increases, the resulting gain must be recognized. This is done by reducing materials expense. All marketable securities are classed as held for sale and measured at fair value. They mainly comprise securities held in special-purpose and investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with a residual term of more than three months at the time of acquisition and where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. Initial meas­ urement is performed as of the settlement date and includes any transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the securities. Unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income and are reConsolidated Financial Statements versed to income or expense on disposal. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the carrying amount of an asset is reduced and the impairment loss recognized as an expense. Such evidence includes a significant or prolonged decline in fair value below cost. and Notes Cash and cash equivalents consist of petty cash, cash balances at banks, and marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition that are subject to insignificant fluctuations in value only. Group Report 2015 181 Discontinued operations along with non-current assets held for sale and associated liabilities are meas­ ured in accordance with IFRS 5 and presented separately in the current section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. To be classed as assets held for sale, assets must be available for immediate sale and their sale must be highly probable. Assets held for sale can be individual non-current assets, groups of assets held for sale (disposal groups), or discontinued operations. A component of an entity is a discontinued operation if it represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations and is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a major line of business or geographical area of operations, or if it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Liabilities disposed of with assets in a single transaction are part of a disposal group or discontinued operation. Non-current assets held for sale cease to be depreciated or amortized, and are measured at their carrying amount or at fair value less costs to sell, whichever is lower. Gains or losses arising on the measurement of individual assets held for sale or of disposal groups are reported in the Statement of Earnings under earnings from continuing operations until their ultimate disposal. Conversely, gains or losses arising on the measurement of discontinued operations at fair value less costs to sell, profits or losses of discontinued operations, and gains or losses on their disposal are presented separately in the Statement of Earnings under earnings from discontinued operations. Share-based payment transactions are measured in accordance with IFRS 2. Stock option plans are accounted for Group-wide as cash-settled share-based payment transactions. Provisions for obligations under the Long-term Incentive Plans and the Top Executive Retention Plans are recognized in the amount of the expected expense that is or was spread over the stipulated waiting period. The fair value of stock options is measured using generally accepted financial models, the value of the plans being determined with the Black/Scholes option pricing model. The specific problem of valuing the plans in question is solved using binomial tree methods. The computations are performed by an outside appraiser. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are recognized for current and future benefit payments to active and former employees and their surviving dependants. The obligations primarily relate to pension benefits, partly for basic pensions and partly for optional supplementary pensions. The individual benefit obligations vary from one country to another and are determined for the most part by length of service and pay scales. The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are likewise included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations are computed by the projected unit credit method. This determines the present value of future entitlements, taking into account current and future benefits already known at the reporting date plus anticipated future increases in salaries and pensions and, for the Turner Group, in healthcare costs. The computation is based on actuarial appraisals using biometric accounting principles. Plan assets as defined in IAS 19 are shown separately as deductions from pension obligations. Plan assets comprise assets transferred to Consolidated Financial Statements pension funds to meet pension obligations, shares in investment funds purchased under deferred compensation arrangements, and qualifying insurance policies in the form of pension liability insurance. If the fair value of plan assets is greater than the present value of employee benefits, the difference is reported—subject to the limit in IAS 19—under other non-current assets. and Notes 182 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Amounts ensuing from the remeasurement of defined benefit plans are recognized directly in equity in the period during which they arise. The current service cost is reported under personnel costs. The net interest component, comprising the interest element of the increase in pension obligations less the anticipated returns on plan assets (each calculated using the discount factor for the pension obligations), is reported in net investment and interest income. Tax provisions comprise current tax obligations. Income tax provisions are offset against tax refund entitlements if they relate to the same tax jurisdiction and are congruent in nature and reporting period. Other provisions account for all identifiable obligations as of the reporting date that result from past business transactions or events but are uncertain in their amount and/or settlement date. Provisions are stated at the estimated settlement amount, i.e. after making allowance for price and cost increases, and are not offset against any rights to reimbursement. For obligations with a settlement probability exceeding 50%, the amount set aside is calculated on the basis of the most likely settlement outcome. A provision can only be recognized on the basis of a legal or constructive obligation toward third parties. Non-current provisions are stated at the present value of the estimated settlement amount as of the reporting date and reported under non-current liabilities. Liabilities are reported at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (accounting for factors such as premiums and discounts). Finance lease liabilities are initially recognized at fair value at the inception of the lease or the present value of the minimum lease payments, whichever is lower. Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value regardless of their purpose and reported under other receivables and other assets or other liabilities. Initial measurement is as of the settlement date. All derivative financial instruments are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. The recognition of changes in fair value depends on the purpose for which a derivative is held. Derivatives are only ever used in the HOCHTIEF Group for hedging purposes. Hedges are structured for maximum effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows from a hedged item, as with the hedging of variable rate loans to counter variations in payment amounts due to interest rate changes. Unrealized gains and losses are initially recognized in equity, taking account of deferred taxes. The portion of the changes in value initially recognized in equity is reclassified to income or expense as soon as the hedged item is recognized in income or expense. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are reclassified to income or expense in the period when the financial asset or financial liability affects income. If a hedged planned transaction subsequently results in recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, gains or losses recognized in equity in the meantime are taken out of equity and subtracted from or added to the initial cost of the asset or liability. In the cases described, only the portion of changes in value Consolidated Financial Statements that are determined to be effective for hedging purposes are recognized in equity. The ineffective portion is recognized directly as income or expense. In the HOCHTIEF Group, only cash flow hedges are currently recognized. Derivatives are also used for economic hedging purposes where no hedge accounting is applied. In such cases, changes in fair value are recognized in income or expense. and Notes Group Report 2015 183 Contingencies, commitments, and other obligations are possible or current obligations, based on past transactions, that are unlikely to lead to an outflow of resources. These are disclosed separately and not included in the Balance Sheet unless assumed in the course of a business combination. The amounts stated for contingent liabilities reflect the extent of the liabilities as of the reporting date. Judgments made by management in applying the accounting policies primarily relate to the following issues: • Leases must be assessed to determine whether the substantial risks and rewards of beneficial ownership transfer to the lessee. • Securities may be grouped in different categories. • Assets earmarked for sale must be assessed to confirm that they are available for immediate sale and their sale is highly probable. If the result of this assessment is positive, those assets and any liabilities to be disposed of in the same transaction must be reported and accounted for as assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. • It is necessary to determine whether construction revenue is accounted for under IAS 11 or IAS 18. The decision made by the HOCHTIEF Group for general application in each instance is set out under Accounting Policies in these Notes. Preparation of the IFRS Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, and disclosures of contingencies, commitments, and other obligations. The main estimates and assumptions relate to the following: • Assessing projects on a percentage of completion basis, in particular with regard to accounting for change orders, the timing of profit recognition, and the amount of profit recognized. • Estimating the economic life of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and of investment properties. • Accounting for provisions. • Testing goodwill and other assets for impairment. • Testing deferred tax assets for impairment. All estimates and assumptions are based on current circumstances and appraisals. Forward-looking estimates and assumptions made as of the balance sheet date with a view to future business performance take account of circumstances prevailing on preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and future trends considered realistic for the global and industry environment. Actual amounts can vary from the estimated amounts due to changes in the operating environment that are at variance with the assumptions and lie beyond management control. If such changes occur, the assumptions and, if necessary, the carrying amounts of affected assets and liabilities are revised accordingly. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 184 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements New accounting pronouncements Adoption by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) of new and revised IFRS and IFRIC pronouncements has resulted in changes to accounting policies in those instances where the pronouncements have been adopted by the EU and their application is mandatory for the reporting period from January 1 to December 31, 2015. Changes in IFRS and IFRIC affecting the HOCHTIEF Group are as follows: • Annual Improvements Cycle 2011–2013 and • IFRIC 21 Levies The IFRS pronouncements applicable in the reporting year had no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements. Other new accounting pronouncements issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) take the form of standards and interpretations that affect the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements but do not have to be applied for the 2015 year and in some cases have not yet been endorsed by the EU: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: After publishing the three phases of the new standard over the last few years, the IASB published the final version of IFRS 9 in July 2014. The new standard notably introduces major changes relating to the classification and measurement of financial assets, with classification to be based on the type of business model and on contractual cash flows. In the same connection, impairment assessment is extended from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. A new hedge accounting model is also introduced that aims to bring hedge accounting more closely into line with the risk management activities of the entity. The complete overhaul of IAS 39 with the publication of IFRS 9 results in additional disclosures. The standard is applicable for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. Initial application is retrospective, although transitional provisions apply. Earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment, the new standard will result in a reclassification of financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Group. The new rules on financial liabilities will probably have no material effect on the HOCHTIEF Group. Further implications of IFRS 9 and its additional provisions cannot be assessed until final endorsement by the EU. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: The IASB issued this new standard in May 2014 with the objective of bringing together in one standard the rules on revenue recognition previously contained in various difConsolidated Financial Statements ferent standards and interpretations. IFRS 15 applies across all sectors to revenue from all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other IFRSs, such as leases, insurance contracts, and financial instruments. Revenue recognition is carried out with regard to both timing and amount by applying the following five steps: (1) Identify the contracts with a customer and Notes (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract (3) Determine the transaction price (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Group Report 2015 185 Alongside this five-step model, IFRS 15 includes an array of further provisions, such as on contract modifications and additional notes disclosures. Due to postponement of the date of initial application in September 2015, the revised IFRS 15 applies for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. With regard to the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements, it is assumed on current assessment that the new standard will lead to changes in revenue recognition. However, it will still be possible to recognize revenue over time. Otherwise, the main changes relate to additional requirements for notes disclosures. The effects of IFRS 15 cannot be finally assessed until final endorsement by the EU. IFRS 16 Leases: The standard announced by the IASB in January 2016 mainly introduces new rules for the classification of leases by lessees. The previous risk-and-rewards approach is abandoned in favor of recognizing a rightof-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all leases. Exceptions from this rule only exist for leases with lease terms of less than twelve months and leases where the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors, on the other hand, continue to classify leases as operating or financing leases according to whether substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. The new IFRS 16 applies for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. Earlier application is permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has also been applied. EU endorsement is still pending. The potential impact for the HOCHTIEF Group is currently under assessment. Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: In “Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture” published in September 2014, the IASB clarifies that recognition of a gain or loss on the sale or contribution of assets depends on whether the assets constitute a business as defined in IFRS 3. When a transaction involves a business, the investor recognizes a full gain or loss. When a transaction involves the sale of assets that do not constitute a business, a partial gain or loss is recognized. The amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016; earlier application is permitted. EU endorsement is still pending. On current assessment, the amendments will have no material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Statements. Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: In “Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations” published in May 2014, the IASB clarifies that the acquisition of an initial or additional interest in a joint operation when the operation constitutes a business as defined in IFRS 3 should be accounted for using the principles related to business combinations in IFRS 3 and other applicable standards with the exception of those principles that conflict with the guidance in IFRS 11. On the acquisition of additional interests in a joint operation, previously held interests are not remeasured. The amendments to IFRS 11 do not apply if the parties sharing joint control are under the common control of the same ultimate controlling party. The amendments apply for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The amendments were endorsed by the EU in November 2015. The amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the HOCHTIEF Consolidated Financial Consolidated Financial Statements Statements. and Notes 186 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements As part of its annual improvements process, the IASB published an omnibus standard in December 2013 (Annual Improvements Cycle 2010–2012) and another in September 2014 (Annual Improvements Cycle 2012–2014). This involved minor but necessary changes to various standards. The Annual Improvements Cycle 2010–2012 applies for annual periods beginning on or after February 1, 2015, and the Annual Improvements Cycle 2012–2014 for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2016. The EU has already endorsed both of those omnibus standards. On current assessment, the changes are not expected to have a material impact on the presentation of the financial position or financial performance of the HOCHTIEF Group. The remaining IFRS pronouncements issued by the IASB have no major relevance to the HOCHTIEF Group and are therefore not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements or their potential impact is currently under assessment: • Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: Investment Entities: Applying the Consolidation Exception • Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure Initiative • Amendments to IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements: Disclosure Initiative • Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealised Losses • A mendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 Intangible Assets: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation • Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 41 Agriculture: Bearer Plants • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans: Employee Contributions • Amendments to IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: Equity Method in Separate Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2015 187 Explanatory Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings 1.

No impairments are included in the share of profits and losses of associates and joint ventures (2014: EUR 13,418 thousand). The prior-year impairments related to the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. As in the prior year, net income from other participating interests related in its entirety to the HOCHTIEF Europe division. Participating interests measured at cost—less impairments—and disposed of in the year under review had a carrying amount of EUR 3,450 thousand (2014: EUR 1,826 thousand). Disposals realized a net loss on sale of EUR 691 thousand in 2015 (2014: net gain of EUR 287 thousand).

Likewise as in the prior year, there were no impairment charges on intangible assets in the reporting year; as before, intangible assets are not subject to any restrictions. 194 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Intangible assets include EUR 59,867 thousand (2014: EUR 54,457 thousand) for company names recognized on initial consolidation, accounted for by EUR 43,756 thousand (2014: EUR 38,272 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Ameri­ cas division and EUR 16,111 thousand (2014: EUR 16,185 thousand) in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. The changes compared with the prior year relate to currency adjustments. The company names are not subject to sys­ tematic amortization, but are tested for impairment annually and if there is any indication of impairment. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with IAS 36 as described below for goodwill. As in the prior year, no impairment was identified in the year under review. Goodwill recognized for consolidated companies on initial consolidation is allocated to cash-generating units at segment level for the purposes of impairment testing as described in the following. The cash-generating units cor­ respond to the divisions used in segment reporting. Annual impairment testing of goodwill at segment (division) level is performed at HOCHTIEF in the fourth quarter of each year. In impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a division is compared with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Americas and HOCHTIEF Europe cash-generating units is measured separately for each unit as value in use. Value in use is the present value of future cash flows expected to arise from a cash-generating unit. It is determined from an internal Group perspective using the discounted cash flow method. This is carried out on the basis of cash flow budgets derived from the three-year budget for the detailed planning horizon as approved by the Executive Board and current at the time of impairment testing. The forecasts incorpo­ rate past experience and expected future market developments. Cash flows are assumed to remain constant in sub­ sequent years. Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is used for cost of capital data. Value in use is first meas­ ured on an after-tax basis by discounting the cash flows with an after-tax WACC determined separately for each cash-generating unit. The pretax discount rate is then found by iteration for the purposes of the Notes disclosures. The discount rates used for cash-generating units in impairment testing are between 10.40% and 10.84% before tax (2014: between 10.40% and 12.20%). The recoverable amount for the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific cash-generating unit is measured at fair value based on CIMIC’s stock market valuation. As in the prior year, comparison of the divisions’ recoverable amounts with their carrying amounts has not revealed any impairment of goodwill. Changes in goodwill by division in 2015 were as follows: Consolidated Financial Statements Jan. 1, Currency Consolidation Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2015 adjustments changes 2015 HOCHTIEF Americas 290,828 38,318 – 329,146 and Notes HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific 335,499 2,909 – 338,408 HOCHTIEF Europe 40,350 – (733) 39,617 666,677 41,227 (733) 707,171 Group Report 2015 195 12.

German tax loss carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized amount to EUR 486,865 thousand (2014: EUR 696,944 thou­ sand) in respect of corporate income tax and EUR 828,148 thousand (2014: EUR 914,280 thousand) in respect of German municipal trade tax. The change in the tax loss carryforward figures mainly relates to adjustments made on the basis of tax audits and subsequent changes that followed as a result. No deferred tax assets have been recognized in relation to interest expense carryforwards in the amount of EUR Consolidated Financial Statements 373,807 thousand (2014: EUR 321,106 thousand). The change in the interest expense carryforward figures relates to adjustments made on the basis of tax audits and ongoing changes. Deferred tax assets are normally recognized for tax-deductible temporary differences if it is probable that taxable and Notes profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilized. Group companies that generated losses in the past year or previous years have EUR 41,636 thousand (2014: Euro 68,124 thousand) in deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences or tax loss carryforwards found not to be impaired. Deferred tax liabilities totaling a gross amount of EUR 671,082 thousand (2014: EUR 574,836 thousand) are entirely due to taxable temporary differences, mostly from adjustments to ensure uniform Group-wide compliance with IFRS valuation principles.

The combined total of progress payments received and offset against the gross amounts due to and from customers for contract work (POC) in the year under review stands at EUR 3,839,359 thousand (2014: EUR 3,661,481 thousand). Various fully consolidated companies in the HOCHTIEF Group have been granted service concession or similar arrangements. These arrangements are mostly accounted for as financial assets and reported as part of gross amount due from customers for contract work (POC). The service concession arrangements, which are in the social infrastructure/Europe segment, are agreements to build and modernize, operate, and maintain schools and other 202 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements public buildings. Construction work and improvements are on schedule. These activities broke even with sales of EUR 34,289 thousand (2014: EUR 14,604 thousand). Accordingly, the HOCHTIEF Group companies concerned are required to perform their obligations under the service concession arrangements and are granted the rights nec­ essary to do so in each case. At the end of the period of a service concession arrangement, the infrastructure to which the arrangement relates is returned to the public-sector client. The assets associated with a service conces­ sion arrangement generally remain public property for the entire duration of the arrangement. The sole termination option provided for in the service concession arrangements relates to termination for cause. Some arrangements have renewal options. Trade receivables include EUR 606,312 thousand (2014: EUR 532,773 thousand) in contractual retention amounts. Trade receivables also include properties under development that are subject to restrictions in the amount of EUR 14,541 thousand (2014: EUR – thousand). Receivables from equity-accounted companies total EUR 1,392 thousand (2014: EUR 2,698 thousand). 22. Receivables from the sale of discontinued operations The receivables recognized as of December 31, 2014 for the sale of the John Holland Group and of 50% of the ownership interest in Thiess Services and Leighton Contractors Services were settled on receipt of the corre­ sponding payments in 2015. 23. Securities The marketable securities totaling EUR 576,898 thousand (2014: EUR 741,535 thousand) mainly consist of securi­ ties held in special-purpose and general investment funds as well as fixed-income securities with maturities at the time of acquisition of more than three months where there is no intention to hold the securities to maturity. All marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. The carrying amount decreased due to fair value adjustments by EUR 10,664 thousand (2014: EUR 7,944 thousand). Marketable securities are pledged in the amount of EUR 21,338 thousand (2014: EUR 23,262 thousand) as security for employee benefit entitlements under semi-retirement programs. In the prior year, marketable securities were also subject to restrictions in the amount of EUR 172,552 thousand.

Exercised directly by the Company or by a company in its control or majority ownership or by third parties engaged by the Company or engaged by a company in its control or majority ownership, the authorization allows the share repurchase to be executed in one or more install­ ments covering the entire amount or any fraction. The repurchase may be effected through the stock exchange or by public offer to all shareholders, or by public invitation to all shareholders to tender shares for sale, or by issuing shareholders with rights to sell shares.

Subject to Supervisory Board approval, the Executive Board is also author­ ized to sell treasury shares other than through the stock exchange and other than by way of an offer to all share­ holders, provided that the shares are sold for cash at a price not substantially below the current stock market price for Company shares of the same class at the time of sale. The HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft Executive Board is also authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval and the conditions set out in the following, to offer and transfer treasury shares to third parties other than through the stock exchange and other than by way of an offer to all shareholders. Such transactions may take place in the course of acquisitions of business enterprises in whole or in part and in the course of mergers. They are also permitted for the purpose of obtaining a listing for the Company’s shares on foreign stock exchanges where it is not yet listed. In addition, the shares may be offered for purchase by employees or former employees of the Company or its affiliates. Holders of bonds which the Company or a Group company subordinate to it issues or has issued under the authori­ zation granted at the Annual General Meeting of May 12, 2011 (agenda item 8) may also be issued with the shares upon exercising the option and/or conversion rights and/or obligations attached to the bonds. On condition that they be held for at least two years after transfer, the shares may also be transferred to (current or past) members of the Executive Board of the Company and to (current or past) members of the executive boards and general management of companies under its control within the meaning of Section 17 of the German Stock Cor­ porations Act (AktG), as well as to current or past employees of the Company or of a company under its control within the meaning of Section 17 AktG. Such transfers are only permitted for the purpose of settling the transferees’ variable compensation entitlements in place of cash settlement. Further conditions of transfer are detailed in the resolution. Where shares are issued to members of the Executive Board of the Company, the decision to issue the shares is taken solely by the Supervisory Board. Shareholders’ statutory subscription rights to such shares are barred pursuant to Sections 71 (1) 8 and 186 (3) and (4) of the German Stock Corporations Act (AktG) to the extent that the shares are used in exercise of the authoriza­ tions set out above. Subject to Supervisory Board approval, the Executive Board is additionally authorized to retire treasury stock with­ out a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting being required for the share retirement itself or its execution. The conditions governing awards of subscription rights and the sale, transfer, and retirement of treasury stock are Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in detail in the Annual General Meeting resolution. By a further resolution of the Annual General Meeting of May 6, 2015, the Company is authorized to acquire treasury shares in accordance with Section 71 (1) 8 AktG using equity derivatives as well as to exclude shareholders’ rights and Notes to sell shares and subscription rights. This is not intended to increase the volume of shares that may be purchased; instead, it merely opens the way for other alternatives to purchase treasury shares within and against the upper limit set in the aforementioned authorization to acquire treasury shares. The Executive Board has been authorized to acquire options which, when exercised, entitle the Company to acquire shares of the Company (call options). The Executive Board has been further authorized to sell options which, when exercised by their holders, require the Company to acquire shares of the Company (put options). Additionally, the shares can be acquired using a combi­ nation of call and put options or forward purchase agreements. The conditions governing the use of equity deriva­ tives to acquire treasury shares and the exclusion of shareholders’ rights to sell shares and subscription rights are set forth in detail in the Annual General Meeting resolution.

Share-based payment The following Group-wide share-based payment systems were in force for managerial staff of HOCHTIEF Aktien­ gesellschaft and its affiliates in 2015: Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 The Executive Board resolved in June 2008 to launch a Top Executive Retention Plan 2008 (TERP 2008) for selected managerial employees. This plan is based on stock awards and consists of three tranches. The first tranche was granted in July 2008, the second in July 2009, and the third in July 2010. The total term of the plan is ten years. The waiting period after the granting of each tranche is three years. The exercise period is between five and seven years, depending on the tranche. The conditions stipulate that, after the waiting period, entitled individuals receive for each stock award either a HOCHTIEF share or, at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discretion, a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The gain is capped for each year of the exercise period. The cap rises annually up to a maximum gain at the end of the term. The maxi­ mum gain is set to EUR 160 per stock award for the first tranche, EUR 81.65 for the second tranche, and EUR 166.27 for the third tranche. The first tranche was exercised in full in 2015. Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2010 (LTIP 2010) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2010 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affiliates. Alongside grants of stock appreciation rights (SARs), LTIP 2010 also provided for grants of stock awards. The SARs can only be exercised if, for at least ten consecutive stock market trading days before the exercise date, the ten-day average (arithmetic mean) stock market closing price of HOCHTIEF stock is higher relative to the issue price compared with the ten-day average closing level of the MDAX index relative to the index base (rela­tive perform­ ance threshold) and, additionally, return on net assets (RONA) in the then most recently approved set of consolidated financial statements is at least 10% (absolute performance threshold). The relative performance threshold is waived if the average stock market price of HOCHTIEF stock exceeds the issue price by at least 10% on ten consecutive stock market trading days after the end of the waiting period. Consolidated Financial Statements Provided that the targets are met, the SARs can be exercised at any time after a four-year waiting period except during a short period before publication of any business results. When SARs are exercised, the issuing entity pays out the difference between the then current stock price and the issue price. The gain is limited to EUR 27.28 per SAR. and Notes The LTIP conditions for stock awards stipulated that for each stock award exercised within a two-year exercise period following a three-year waiting period, entitled individuals received at HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft’s discre­tion either a HOCHTIEF share or a compensatory cash amount equal to the closing price of HOCHTIEF stock on the last stock market trading day before the exercise date. The maximum gain was set to EUR 81.83 per stock award. The plan for the stock awards ended in 2015. 208 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2011 (LTIP 2011) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2011 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­ates. The conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2010. The gain is limited to EUR 32.67 per SAR and EUR 98.01 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2012 (LTIP 2012) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2012 and is open to Executive Board members and upper managerial employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft and its affili­ ates. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2011 in two points: 1. Return on net assets (RONA) as per the most recently approved Consolidated Financial Statements must be at least 15%. 2. The waiting time for stock awards was extended from three to four years and the total term of the plan accord­ ingly from five to six years. The gain is limited to EUR 25.27 per SAR and EUR 75.81 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2013 (LTIP 2013) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2013 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions differ from those of LTIP 2012 in only one point: The performance target for RONA was replaced with a performance target for adjusted free cash flow. The number of SARs that can be exercised depends on attainment of the planned value range for adjusted free cash flow. This value range is set in the business plan for each exercise year. The gain is limited to EUR 24.61 per SAR and EUR 73.83 per stock award. Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2014 (LTIP 2014) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2014 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2013. The gain is limited to EUR 30.98 per SAR and EUR 92.93 per stock award. Consolidated Financial Statements Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 The Long-term Incentive Plan 2015 (LTIP 2015) was launched by resolution of the Supervisory Board in 2015 and is open to Executive Board members. The plan conditions do not differ in any material respect from those of LTIP 2014. and Notes The gain is limited to EUR 31.68 per SAR and EUR 95.04 per stock award. Other information Return on net assets (RONA) Return on net assets (RONA) indicates how well HOCHTIEF’s assets are performing as an investment and thus measures the profitability of the HOCHTIEF Group. RONA measures return as a percentage of net assets. For this purpose, return is defined as operational earnings (EBIT, shown in the Operational Statement of Earnings) plus in­ terest income from the Group’s financial assets. The net assets figure reflects the total capital commitment from which returns are to be generated. Group Report 2015 209 The HOCHTIEF Group generated a return on net assets (RONA) of 13.2% in 2015 (2014: 20.3%). RONA thus ­decreased by 7.1 percentage points compared with the prior year. The conditions of all plans stipulate that on the exercise of SARs or stock awards—and the fulfillment of all other requisite criteria—HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft normally has the option of delivering HOCHTIEF shares instead of paying out the gain in cash. Where the entitled individuals are not employees of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, the expense incurred on exercise of SARs or stock awards is met by the affiliated company concerned. The quantities of SARs and stock awards granted, expired, and exercised under the plans are as follows: Originally Outstand­ing Granted in Expired in Exercised/ Outstand­ granted at Dec. 31, 2015 2015 settled in ing at Dec. 2014 2015 31, 2015 TERP 2008/Tranche 1 130,900 4,800 – – 4,800 0 TERP 2008/Tranche 2 359,000 16,950 – – 13,650 3,300 TERP 2008/Tranche 3 174,100 22,300 – – 13,100 9,200 LTIP 2010 – SARs 353,200 49,050 – 800 44,150 4,100 LTIP 2010 – stock awards 166,000 3,800 – 1,900 1,900 0 LTIP 2011 – SARs 275,250 157,050 2,800 4,600 125,850 29,400 LTIP 2011 – stock awards 124,850 15,750 – 200 13,450 2,100 LTIP 2012 – SARs 457,406 290,706 – 13,800 – 276,906 LTIP 2012 – stock awards 82,991 46,814 – 2,520 – 44,294 LTIP 2013 – SARs 38,288 38,288 – – – 38,288 LTIP 2013 – stock awards 9,297 9,297 – – – 9,297 LTIP 2014 – SARs 86,907 86,907 – – – 86,907 LTIP 2014 – stock awards 20,453 20,453 – – – 20,453 LTIP 2015 – SARs – – 96,801 – – 96,801 LTIP 2015 – stock awards – – 20,262 – – 20,262 Provisions recognized for the stated share-based payment arrangements totaled EUR 14,811 thousand as of the balance sheet date (2014: EUR 11,766 thousand). The total expense recognized for the stated arrangements in 2015 was EUR 8,335 thousand (2014: EUR 1,784 thousand). The intrinsic value of options exercisable at the end of the reporting period was EUR 2,195 thousand (2014: EUR 4,150 thousand). 27. Provisions for pensions and similar obligations Defined benefit plans Consolidated Financial Statements Under defined benefit plans, the Company’s obligation is to provide agreed benefits to current and former employees. The main pension obligations in Germany consist of direct commitments under the current 2000+ pension plan and deferred compensation plans. The 2000+ plan in force since January 1, 2000 takes the form of a modular defined contribution plan. The size of the annual pension component depends on employee income and age and Notes (resulting in an annuity conversion factor) and a general pension contribution reviewed by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesell­ schaft every three years and adjusted as necessary. The future pension amount is the sum total of the pension components earned each year. In isolated instances, length-of-service and final salary pension arrangements are in existence for executive staff, although except at Executive Board level such arrangements have no longer been offered since 1995. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension, and in almost all cases are granted as a lifelong annuity. 210 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Up to December 31, 2013, employees in Germany additionally had the option of deferred compensation in a com­ pany pension plan. The deferred compensation was invested in selected investment funds. The pension amount is based on the present value of acquired fund units at retirement, subject to a minimum of the deferred compensation amount plus an increment that is guaranteed by HOCHTIEF and ranges from 3.50% down to 1.75% p.a. There is a choice at retirement between a lump sum payment and an annuity for five or six years. Outside of Germany, there are defined benefit plans at Turner in the USA and HOCHTIEF UK in the United Kingdom. The plan at Turner was frozen as of December 31, 2003, and no new entitlements can be earned under it. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. There is a choice at retire­ ment between a lifelong annuity and a lump sum payment. Commitments at Turner also include post-employment benefits in the form of medical care for pensioners. HOCHTIEF UK has a length-of-service, final salary pension plan. For each year of service, 1/75th of the eligible final salary is granted as a monthly pension. Benefits comprise an old-age pension, an invalidity pension, and a surviving dependants’ pension. Defined benefit obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2015 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 116,993 90,919 12,842 Final salary [15,964] – [12,842] Not final salary [101,029] [90,919] – Vested benefits 154,162 46,477 17,077 Current benefit payments 488,211 102,376 15,468 Similar obligations 93 54,350 – Total 759,459 294,122 45,387 Duration in years (weighted) 14.7 7.9 21.0 Dec. 31, 2014 (EUR thousand) Germany USA UK Active members 144,137 87,107 11,212 Final salary [19,613] – [11,212] Not final salary [124,524] [87,107] – Vested benefits 171,419 44,594 15,110 Current benefit payments 521,605 100,762 15,069 Consolidated Financial Statements Similar obligations 91 48,827 – Total 837,252 281,290 41,391 Duration in years (weighted) 14.8 8.3 20.0 and Notes Group Report 2015 211 Plan assets There are no statutory or regulatory minimum funding requirements for pension plans in Germany. Domestic pension obligations are fully funded. The funded plans take the form of a contractual trust arrangement (CTA). The trans­ ferred assets have been administered since January 1, 2015 by an external trustee and serve exclusively to fund domestic pension obligations. To ensure that final investment decisions continue to be made in-house as in past years, HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e.V. has set up what is known as the Investment Committee as a new decisionmaking body within the Trust, which is a registered association under German law. The core function of the Invest­ ment Committee is to collectively represent the interests of the trustors vis-à-vis an external trustee with regard to the administration and investment of their trust assets. The transferred cash is invested in the capital market in accordance with investment principles set out in the trust agreement and the investment guidelines. The investment guidelines and decisions are based on the findings of an asset liability matching (ALM) study compiled by outside specialists at regular intervals of three to five years. This uses Monte Carlo simulation to model the development of the pension liabilities and other key economic factors over a very long forward horizon and in numerous combina­ tions. Based on the ALM study, a range of criteria are then applied to determine the optimum asset allocation in order to ensure that pension liabilities can be met in the long term. To assure an optimum conservative risk structure, we have also established risk overlay management using the services of an external overlay manager who is given a fixed annual risk budget and works fully autonomously in a clearly structured risk overlay management process. HOCHTIEF aims to ensure full funding of pension obligations and to fund new vested benefits on the basis of current service cost annually or at least on a timely basis. The companies pay in additional amounts from time to time in the event of any shortfall. Pension commitments in Germany in excess of the contribution assessment ceiling applied in the statutory pension insurance scheme are additionally covered using pension liability insurance. Pension liabilities from deferred employee compensation are funded by the purchase of retail fund units. Funding of the obligations served by HOCHTIEF Pension Trust e.V. as of December 31, 2015 is about 61% (2014: 60%); the figure for Germany as a whole is about 67% (2014: 64%). It should be noted in this connection that the size of pension obligations has increased significantly in recent years due to the low level of market interest rates and that the funding ratio will sig­ nificantly increase again when interest rates recover. The frozen defined benefit obligations in the Turner Group are likewise managed in a pension fund. Plan assets are administered in trust by BNY Mellon and serve exclusively to fund the plan. The trust’s independence is reviewed annually and attested to by auditors. Investment decisions are not made by the trust but by a special committee. The investment of plan assets is based on a regularly compiled ALM study. The investment objectives are to maxi­ mize the funding ratio and reduce volatility in the funding ratio. With the pension obligations fully funded, high-risk investments in equities are to be reduced in favor of fixed-interest bonds. These ideally perform in line with plan liabilities, thus ensuring full funding. There is no statutory minimum funding requirement, but low funding levels result in higher contributions to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, and limits to lump-sum payments, Consolidated Financial Statements hence maximum funding is aimed for. The funding of obligations covered by plan assets at Turner as of December 31, 2015 is about 87% (2014: 91%); funding at Turner overall is about 71% (2014: 75%). Funding of plan assets at and Notes 212 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements HOCHTIEF UK is likewise on a trust basis. Statutory minimum funding requirements apply. If funding is insufficient to make up a funding shortfall, an additional restructuring plan is drawn up. Plan funding is reviewed at least once every three years. Funding of pension obligations at HOCHTIEF UK is about 81% (2014: 81%). Defined benefit obligations are covered by plan assets as follows: Coverage of defined benefit obligations by plan assets Dec. 31, 2015 Dec. 31, 2014 Defined benefit Plan assets Defined benefit Plan assets (EUR thousand) obligations obligations Uncovered by plan assets 55,705 – 50,159 – Partially covered by plan assets 977,080 679,337 1,039,671 711,133 Incompletely covered by plan assets 1,032,785 679,337 1,089,830 711,133 Fully covered by plan assets 66,183 72,397 70,103 71,559 Total 1,098,968 751,734 1,159,933 782,692 Actuarial assumptions The size of pension provisions is determined on an actuarial basis. This necessarily involves estimates. Specifically, the actuarial assumptions used are as follows: 2015 2014 (Percent) Germany USA UK Germany USA UK Discount factor* 2.50 4.20 3.70 2.00 3.85 4.00 *Weighted average Salary increases 3.25 – 1.90 3.00 – 2.15 Pension increases* 1.75 – 4.45 1.75 – 4.48 Health cost increases – 5.00 – – 5.00 – The discount factors are derived from the Mercer Pension Discount Yield Curve (MPDYC) model, taking into account the company-specific duration of pension liabilities. Salary and pension increases ceased to be taken into account in the USA (Turner Group) in 2004 due to the changeover in pension arrangements. Mortality assumptions are based on published country-specific statistics and experience. Domestically, they are determined using the Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck 2005 G tables. Turner uses the RP 2014 separate annuitant/non-annuitant no collar tables with genera­ tional improvement using scale MP-2014 as published by the Society of Actuaries (SOA); HOCHTIEF UK uses the S2PxA CMI_2015 [1.25%] males [1.00%] females year of birth mortality tables.

Before deferred taxes, the cumulative amount is actuarial losses of EUR 443,071 thousand (2014: EUR 471,587 thousand). The Turner Group’s obligations to meet healthcare costs for retired staff are included in pension provisions due to their pension-like nature. The defined benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015 came to EUR 54,350 thousand (2014: EUR 48,827 thousand). Healthcare costs accounted for EUR 1,785 thousand (2014: EUR 1,416 thousand) of the current service cost and EUR 2,223 thousand (2014: EUR 2,004 thousand) of the interest expense. Sensitivity analysis Pension obligations in the HOCHTIEF Group are subject to various risks. The main risks result from general changes in interest and inflation rates; there is no unusual risk inherent in the pension obligations. One major risk is interest rate risk. For defined benefit plans, (notional) contributions are translated into benefits using a table of fixed interest rates, independent of the current market interest rate. HOCHTIEF thus bears the risk of general capital market interest rate changes with regard to the determination of benefits. Pension obligations have increased significantly in recent years due to the generally low level of capital market interest rates. The correspond­ ingly large impact is due to the relatively long term of the obligations. There is also inflation risk. By law, company pensions in Germany must be raised level with the inflation rate at least every three years. German company pensions under the 2000+ plan rise at a fixed 1% p.a., hence there is only minor inflation risk in the pension phase. Turner plans are free from inflation risk as the main defined benefit plan was frozen and no more adjustments to the company pension are made. In addition, there is longevity risk. The granting of lifelong pensions means that HOCHTIEF bears the risk of pen­ sioners living longer than actuarial calculations predict. This risk normally cancels out collectively across all pension plan members and only comes into play if general longevity is longer than expected. The impact of the stated risks on the defined benefit obligations under a corresponding change in actuarial assump­tions is shown in the sensitivity analysis that follows.

It has no obligation to pay further contributions. There are defined contribution plans at Turner, Flatiron, and E.E. Cruz in the USA as well as at CIMIC in Australia. Depending on length of service and salary level, Turner pays between 3% and 6% of an employee’s salary into an external fund. In addition, Turner employees have an option to pay up to 25% of their salaries into an investment fund as part of a 401 (k) plan. Turner matches the first 5% of the deferred compensation by up to 100% depending on length of service. All employees can join the plan immediately, and are vested in the company’s contributions after three years’ service. Tax relief is granted on payments into the fund; the investment risk is borne by employees. The defined contribution plans at Flatiron and E.E. Cruz are likewise 401 (k) plans. All non-union employees are entitled. Flatiron pays a contribution in the amount of 6.0% of the wage or salary, while E.E. Cruz doubles one-third of employee contributions, in each case up to the statutory maximum. In Australia, since July 1, 2014 CIMIC has paid 9.50% (previously 9.25%) of the wage and salary total into the statutory pension (superannuation) scheme. The contribution rate is expected to rise incrementally up to 12.0% by 2025. Employees have a choice of investment funds and bear the investment risk. They are able to pay top-up contributions on a voluntary basis. Tax relief is granted on top-up contributions. EUR 172,255 thousand was paid into defined contribution plans in 2015 (2014: EUR 182,071 thousand), mostly in the CIMIC Group (EUR 129,525 thousand; 2014: EUR 148,689 thousand) and the Turner Group (EUR 38,207 thousand; 2014: EUR 30,731 thousand). An additional EUR 69,881 thousand was paid into state pension schemes in 2015 (2014: EUR 66,366 thousand). Costs of defined contribution plans are reported as part of personnel expenses. 28.

Personnel-related provisions primarily comprise provisions for stock option schemes, long-service awards, leave entitlements, termination benefits, and early retirement arrangements. The size of provisions for insurance claims is computed annually by an external actuary. Items covered by sundry other provisions include contract administration, contract costs incurred subsequent to invoicing, investment risk, preparation of annual financial statements, payments for damages, and other uncertain liabilities.

Amounts due to banks include a EUR 50,000 thousand portion of a bilateral promissory note loan taken out by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft on December 13, 2012. The loan has an initial term of four years and has a fixed interest rate. Repayment of a promissory note loan issue placed in the market in 2008 with an initial term of seven years and a nominal amount of EUR 39,000 thousand was completed on schedule at the end of its term on July 4, 2015. An international banking syndicate provided HOCHTIEF with a credit facility on market terms with a term to April 30, 2019 comprising a EUR 1.5 billion guarantee tranche and a EUR 500,000 thousand cash tranche. As in the prior year, there are no drawings on the cash tranche as of December 31, 2015. The sum of EUR 34,914 thousand (2014: EUR 946,146 thousand) of amounts due to banks concerns borrowings by CIMIC. Consolidated Financial Statements Amounts due to banks at the balance sheet date comprise EUR 111,392 thousand (2014: EUR 1,018,922 thousand) subject to variable rates of interest and EUR 59,035 thousand (2014: EUR 125,503 thousand) subject to fixed rates of interest. The average interest rate on the variable-interest portion stood at 2.42% (2014: 2.31%) and the average and Notes interest rate on the fixed-interest portion was 3.84% (2014: 3.72%). The average term was one year (2014: 1.5 years). Financial liabilities due to companies accounted for using the equity method were EUR 1,000 thousand (2014: EUR 23,307 thousand). The EUR 171,621 thousand (2014: EUR 198,288 thousand) in lease liabilities mainly relates to plant and equipment under finance leases at CIMIC. 220 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The minimum lease payments for liabilities under finance leases break down as follows: Finance leases Dec. 31, 2015 Dec. 31, 2014 Present Present (EUR thousand) Nominal value Discount value Nominal value Discount value Due in up to 1 year 105,539 5,752 99,787 74,921 9,326 65,595 Due in 1–5 years 73,325 1,491 71,834 137,483 4,790 132,693 Due after 5 years – – – – – – 30.

Undiluted and diluted earnings per share Undiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the consolidated net profit attributable to the Company’s stock by the average number of shares in circulation. This indicator can become diluted as a result of potential shares (mainly stock options and convertible bonds). HOCHTIEF’s share-based payment arrangements do not have a dilutive effect on earnings. Consequently, diluted and undiluted earnings per share are identical. 2015 2014 Consolidated net profit—continuing operations (EUR thousand) 208,287 (122,439) Consolidated net profit—discontinued operations (EUR thousand) – 374,126 Total consolidated net profit (EUR thousand) 208,287 251,687 Number of shares in circulation in thousands (weighted average) 66,953 69,124 Consolidated net profit per share—continuing operations (EUR) 3.11 (1.77) Consolidated net profit per share—discontinued operations (EUR) – 5.41 Total earnings per share (EUR) 3.11 3.64 Dividend per share (EUR) 1.90 Proposed dividend per share (EUR) 2.00 The number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015 was 65,191 thousand. The number as of December 31, 2014 was 68,466 thousand and is equal to the number of shares outstanding at the beginning of the period, as of January 1, 2015 (January 1, 2014: 69,309 thousand). 34. Reporting on financial instruments Financial instruments include financial assets and liabilities as well as contractual claims and obligations relating to exchanges and transfers of financial assets. Financial instruments can be derivative or non-derivative. Non-derivative financial assets mostly comprise cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables, and other financial assets. Marketable securities are carried at fair value. The fair values of available-for-sale financial Consolidated Financial Statements assets are established with reference to market prices or, in the absence of such prices, determined using accepted valuation methods. Non-derivative financial liabilities are mostly current liabilities measured at amortized cost. and Notes According to their fair value, derivative financial instruments are reported either in other receivables and other as­ sets or in other liabilities. Derivatives are used in the HOCHTIEF Group exclusively for hedging existing transactions and in asset management. 222 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Holdings of non-derivative and derivative financial instruments are carried on the balance sheet; the maximum risk of loss or default is equal to total financial assets. Any such risk identified in respect of financial assets is accounted for with an impairment loss. Risk management All financial activities in the HOCHTIEF Group are conducted on the basis of a Group-wide financial framework directive. This is fleshed out by individual, function-specific operating directives on issues such as currency and collateral management. These lay down principles for dealing with the various classes of financial risk. Trading, control, and settlement activities are divided within Corporate Finance between front, middle, and back offices. This ensures effective operational risk management in that monitoring and settlement of front office exter­ nal trading activities are performed by a separate and independent back office. All external trading actions are also subject to at least dual control. Internal authorizations to give instructions are strictly limited in number and mon­ etary amount, and are reassessed at least once a year and adjusted as necessary. Management of liquidity risk HOCHTIEF uses predominantly centralized liquidity structures—in particular cash pooling—to pool liquidity at Group level, among other things to avoid liquidity bottlenecks at the level of individual entities. The central liquidity position is calculated at regular monthly intervals and budgeted in a bottom-up process over a rolling 18-month period. Liquidity budgets are supplemented with monthly stress testing. HOCHTIEF uses liquidity budgets in active management of the securities portfolio and loans portfolio. The tables below show maximum payments. The tables show the worst-case scenario for HOCHTIEF, i.e. the earliest possible contractual payment date in each case. Creditors’ rights of termination are taken into account. Foreign currency items are translated using the closing rate as of the balance sheet date. Interest payments on variable rate items are translated uniformly using the last interest rate fixed prior to the balance sheet date. Both primary and derivative financial instruments (for example, forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps) are taken into account. Credit facilities granted but not yet drawn in their full amount are also included, as are financial guaran­ tees given by the Group. The maximum payments shown in the following tables (worst case scenario) are offset by contractually fixed receipts in the same periods that are not shown here (for example, from trade receivables). These cover most of the cash outflows shown.

The following table shows the main liquidity instruments: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2015 2014 Cash in hand and on deposit 2,133,884 2,291,978 Marketable securities 1,119,420 812,585 Undrawn revolving credit facilities 2,191,196 2,027,911 5,444,500 5,132,474 The revolving credit facilities include a credit facility tranche with a facility amount of EUR 500,000 thousand under the syndicated guarantee and credit facility that was extended ahead of term in April 2014 to April 30, 2019. As in the prior year, the credit facility was undrawn as of December 31, 2015. HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft also has short-term, bilateral, revolving money market facilities with a total facility amount of EUR 239,000 thousand (2014: EUR 259,349 thousand); as in the prior year, these are undrawn as of the balance sheet date. Some of the facilities are subject to creditors’ rights of termination in connection with a financial covenant, which is continuously monitored as part of corporate planning. In light of the broad international syndication in each instance and the successful extension of the credit and guarantee facilities in April 2014, there is no refinancing risk with regard to long-term guarantee and credit facilities. As a further precautionary measure, there is appropriate scope for raising additional capital under resolutions adopted at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. HOCHTIEF also has sufficient revolving guarantee facilities, which play an important role for the Group. The guar­ antee facilities have a total size of EUR 13.96 billion (2014: EUR 12.90 billion) and are 75% drawn (2014: 66%). Under a legally binding arrangement with banks, financial assets in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division in the amount of EUR 856,688 thousand (2014: EUR 1,065,540 thousand) and financial liabilities in the amount of EUR 407,601 thousand (2014: EUR 600,576 thousand) are offset and presented in the balance sheet with their net amount of EUR 449,087 thousand (2014: EUR 464,946 thousand). Consolidated Financial Statements Management of currency risk HOCHTIEF is exposed to currency risk (in the form of transaction risk) from receivables, liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, securities, and pending transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the Group com­ pany concerned in each case. Currency derivatives, mainly forward exchange contracts, are used to hedge against and Notes fluctuations in these payments or items caused by exchange rates. HOCHTIEF normally hedges all currency risk. 224 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group—are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. Binding guidelines clarify their use as well as separate controls and responsibilities for all Group companies. Currency derivatives are normally only used to hedge risk. Any form of speculation is ruled out under a binding, Group-wide risk directive. The counterparties for derivatives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. The following table shows the fair values of currency derivatives: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2015 2014 Assets Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) 3,092 1,612 for hedging purposes (but not hedge accounted) 213 1,987 3,305 3,599 Liabilities and ­sharehold­ers’ equity Forward exchange contracts/currency swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) 1,215 1,902 for hedging purposes (but not hedge accounted) 1,772 746 2,987 2,648 The maximum residual term of currency derivatives in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2015 is 19 months (2014: 13 months). As of December 31, 2015, the maximum residual term of currency derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied is eleven months (2014: 25 months). Where hedge accounting is used, unrealized gains and losses on hedges are initially recognized in other compre­ hensive income, taking into account deferred tax. Gains and losses are not realized until a hedged item affects income. Derivatives are measured on the basis of current market rates as of the balance sheet date. When inter­ preting positive or negative fair value changes relating to derivatives, it is important to remember that they balance hedged items whose values move in the opposite direction. A net EUR 2,167 thousand was credited to equity in 2015 (2014: EUR 5,019 thousand charged to equity) for market value changes on the above derivatives in cash flow hedges. Where hedge accounting is not applied, all unrealized gains and losses on the hedged item are recog­ nized immediately in profit or loss; in 2015 this related to a net loss of EUR 2,800 thousand (2014: EUR 1,511 thou­ sand).

Two approaches are used to minimize this risk. Firstly, the Company uses natural hedging, meaning that it eliminates contrary interest rate risk from primary financial instruments on the asset and liabilities side. The second method is to use interest rate derivatives. These generally take the form of interest rate swaps used in accordance with the Group annual financ­ ing strategy to manage cash flow risk from changes in interest rates for variable-rate financial items. As with currency derivatives, hedges for Group companies—with the exception of hedges in the CIMIC Group— are mainly administered via HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft. There are also parallel regulations and guidelines, and Consolidated Financial Statements derivatives are used solely for hedging (i.e. not speculatively) as a matter of principle. The counterparties for deriva­ tives entered into externally are banks with a top credit rating. and Notes 226 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following table shows the fair values of interest rate derivatives: Dec. 31, Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 2015 2014 Assets Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) – – for hedging purposes (but not cash flow hedge accounted) – – Interest rate futures not for hedging purposes (for asset management structuring) 149 190 149 190 Liabilities and ­sharehold­ers’ equity Interest rate swaps for hedging purposes (cash flow hedges) – 450 for hedging purposes (but not cash flow hedge accounted) – 2,461 Interest rate futures not for hedging purposes (for asset management structuring) 47 65 47 2,976 The maximum residual term of interest rate swaps both in cash flow hedges and otherwise in the prior year was 31 months. As of December 31, 2015, the interest rate futures have a maximum residual term of 363 months (2014: 363 months). An amount of EUR 450 thousand was credited to equity in 2015 (2014: EUR 10,327 thousand) for market value changes on interest rate derivatives in cash flow hedges. An amount of EUR 595 thousand was reclassified to profit or loss (2014: EUR 1,190 thousand). There was no hedge ineffectiveness. A net EUR 2,438 thousand was recog­ nized in profit or loss (2014: EUR 2,432 thousand) for market value changes on the remaining interest rate deriva­ tives. The following sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact that a one percentage point change in the respective market interest rate would have had on equity and profit.

Other price risk stems from participating interests that are classified as available for sale to the extent that they are measured at fair value. Such items are shown in the following table. Participating interests measured at amortized cost because their fair value cannot be reliably measured are not included.

Continuous monitoring and analysis of the markets make it possible to marshal investments at short notice. This allows the Company to detect negative developments on the capital market at an early stage and take appropriate action. Derivatives are only used to control price risk in exceptional instances. To hedge our share-based compensation plans, stock-based derivatives were entered into with a maximum residual term of 39 months as of December 31, 2015 (2014: 51 months). They are not subject to hedge accounting, but are deployed as a natural hedge. Gains and losses in the fair value of these derivatives are contained in personnel costs.

HOCHTIEF performs risk management for operations by continuously monitoring trade receivables at divisional level. If a specific credit risk is detected, it is countered by recognizing an individual impairment. The HOCHTIEF Group has given third parties financial guarantees and loan commitments in respect of Group companies. Financial guarantees and loan guarantees are only given in respect of companies with top credit standing, restricting to a minimum the probability of the guarantees being drawn upon. Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes Group Report 2015 229 The maximum credit risk exposure of financial assets is equivalent to their carrying amounts in the balance sheet. However, the actual credit risk exposure is lower due to collateral given in favor of the HOCHTIEF Group. The maxi­ mum risk exposure on financial guarantees given by HOCHTIEF is the maximum amount to be paid by HOCHTIEF. The maximum credit risk for loan commitments is the amount of the commitment. As of December 31, 2015, the maximum credit risk from financial guarantees and loan commitments amounted to EUR 144,414 thousand (2014: EUR 193,657 thousand). As of the reporting date, the probability of the financial guarantees and loan commitments being drawn upon is very small. HOCHTIEF accepts collateral to secure contract performance by subcontractors, subcontractors’ warranty obli­ gations, and claims to remuneration. Such collateral includes guarantees relating to warranty obligations, contract performance, advance payments, and receivables. Acceptance of collateral is governed by a HOCHTIEF directive. Among other aspects, this covers the contractual drafting, implementation, and management of all agreements. The detailed rules vary according to factors such as the country jurisdiction and applicable case law. In the case of credit risk, HOCHTIEF examines the credit rating of the party providing the collateral for all guarantees accepted. HOCHTIEF uses external specialists (for example, rating agencies) to assess credit ratings where possible. The fair values of accepted collateral are not disclosed as they often cannot be measured reliably. The following table shows unimpaired financial assets that are past due: Dec. 31, 2015 Dec. 31, 2014 Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 Over 90 Up to 30 31 to 60 61 to 90 Over 90 (EUR thousand) days days days days days days days days Trade receivables 129,379 28,753 10,662 56,043 155,438 24,778 19,577 99,334 Current financial ­receivables 1 – – 6,235 3 144 – 7,528 Other current receivables and other current financial assets 228 31 – 461 29 33 – 111 129,608 28,784 10,662 62,739 155,470 24,955 19,577 106,973 The age structure of financial assets that are past due is shaped by industry-specific factors. Receipt of payment depends on acceptance (inspection) and invoice checking, which can often take a relatively long time, especially for large-scale projects. Most of the unimpaired financial assets that are past due are from public-sector clients and industrial companies with top credit ratings.

Capital risk management The HOCHTIEF Group manages capital with the aim of ensuring that all Group companies can continue to operate Consolidated Financial Statements as a going concern. The Group keeps the cost of capital as low as possible by optimizing the balance between equity and debt as the need arises. These measures primarily serve to secure the best possible credit standing as well as to maximize shareholder earnings. and Notes The Group’s capital structure consists of the balance sheet items comprising net debt (current and non-current liabilities less cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders’ equity. The Risk Reporting Committee assesses and examines the Group’s capital structure at regular intervals, taking into account the risk-adjusted cost of capital.

Non-current securities in the available-for-sale category are measured at fair value through equity and, as such, their carrying amounts also correspond to fair value. Shares in non-consolidated subsidiaries and other participating interests are measured at fair value if fair value can be reliably determined. Otherwise, such items are measured at cost in the available-for-sale category. In the disclosures on the fair value hierarchy for financial instruments measured at fair value, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., the exit price). For non-financial assets, fair value is measured assuming the highest and best use of the asset by market participants. A three-level hierarchy is applied that reflects the observability of the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; e.g. quoted securities. Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices); e.g. interest rate swaps and forward exchange con­ tracts. Level 3: No relevant observable inputs available, hence unobservable inputs are determined as an exit price from the perspective of a market participant that holds the asset or owes the liability; e.g. investments measured at fair value determined by business valuation.

This means that there were likewise no changes in Level 3. The fair value of investments in unlisted entities and of debt instruments not traded in an active market is measured using the discounted cash flow method. Any discounting is done using current market interest rates. 234 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Reconciliation of beginning to ending balances for Level 3 measurements of financial instrument fair values Balance Currency Gains/(losses) Other Balance as as of Jan. ­adjustments recognized in profit changes of Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 1, 2015 or loss 2015 Other financial assets 74,690 (376) 3,147 5,870 83,331 Other liabilities Non-current – – – – – Current – – – – – Balance Currency Gains/(losses) Other Balance as as of Jan. ­adjustments recognized in profit changes of Dec. 31, (EUR thousand) 1, 2014 or loss 2014 Other financial assets 59,098 2,272 (68) 13,388 74,690 Other liabilities Non-current – – – – – Current 5,945 – – (5,945) – As in the prior year, the amounts recognized in profit or loss are accounted for in net income from other participating interests; the other changes are accounted for in other comprehensive income.

Group Report 2015 241 Explanatory notes to the segmental data Intersegment sales represent revenue generated between divisions. They are transacted on an arm’s length basis. External sales mainly comprise revenue recognized using the percentage-of-completion method in the mainstream construction business, construction management, and contract mining, in the amount of EUR 17,965,879 thousand (2014: EUR 18,448,153 thousand). The sum of external sales and intersegment sales gives total sales revenue for each division. The share of profits and losses of equity-method associates and joint ventures comprises income and expenses, including impairment losses relating to companies accounted for using the equity method. Depreciation and amortization relate to intangible assets with finite useful lives, property, plant and equipment, and investment properties. The impairment losses relate to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, and financial assets. Purchases comprise additions to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, investment properties, equitymethod investments (excluding equity-method adjustments), subsidiaries, and other participating interests. Total assets are equivalent to the divisions’ totals in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Gross debt equals total assets minus consolidated shareholders’ equity. Operational earnings (EBIT) are derived from profit from operating activities as follows: 2015 2014 (EUR thousand) (restated) Earnings from operating activities 575,350 (75,332) + Net income from joint ventures 102,224 86,408 – Non-recurring items (+) 51,131 (+) 548,102 Operational earnings (EBIT) 728,705 559,178 The method used to calculate EBIT was standardized across the Group in 2015 and the prior-year figures were restated accordingly. The net income from participating interests included in EBIT now consists exclusively of earnings from joint ventures. Non-recurring items comprise income and expenses deemed exceptional for busi­ ness management purposes, or resulting from exceptional transactions, or not attributable to the operating busi­ ness. Non-recurring items are mainly attributable to restructuring expenses, exchange rate gains or losses, as well as income or expenses from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation. In the previous year, the non-recur­ Consolidated Financial Statements ring items item was also impacted by an accounting provision to cover default risk on project receivables in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division. and Notes 242 Group Report 2015 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 37. Notes to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows classifies cash flows into operating, investing, and financing activities. Exchange rate effects are eliminated and their influence on the cash position is disclosed separately. Changes in cash and cash equivalents due to acquisitions and disposals of consolidated companies are shown separately under cash used in or provided by investing activities. As in the prior year, the EUR 465,847 thousand decrease (2014: EUR 309,079 thousand) in cash and cash equivalents due to consolidation changes consists in its entirety of cash and cash equivalents disposed of in divestments. The EUR 2,808,707 thousand (2014: EUR 2,585,359 thousand) year-end total for cash and cash equivalents shown on the cash flow statement matches the cash and cash equivalents item on the balance sheet. The total comprises EUR 913 thousand (2014: EUR 1,574 thousand) in petty cash, EUR 2,243,934 thousand (2014: EUR 2,316,922 thousand) in cash balances at banks, and EUR 563,860 thousand (2014: EUR 266,863 thousand) in marketable securities with maturities of no more than three months at the time of acquisition. Cash and cash equivalents to the value of EUR 110,963 thousand are subject to restrictions (2014: EUR 26,518 thousand). Cash flow from operations represented a cash inflow of EUR 1,135,206 thousand. The balance of cash flows relating to capital expenditure and asset disposals/divestments resulted in a EUR 962,907 thousand net cash inflow in cash flow from investing activities. This reflects the sale of John Holland as well as the Thiess and Leighton Contractors service business at CIMIC in late 2014, which led to a cash inflow in 2015. The net cash outflow of EUR 2,008,798 thousand in cash flow from financing activities was largely attributable to extensive debt repayment. Including ex­ change rate changes, cash and cash equivalents increased overall by EUR 223,348 thousand. All non-cash income and expense and all income from asset disposals or arising on deconsolidation is eliminated in cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations included: • Interest income of EUR 61,736 thousand (2014: EUR 57,272 thousand), • Interest expenses of EUR 240,247 thousand (2014: EUR 284,606 thousand), • Income tax paid amounting to EUR 428,899 thousand (2014: EUR 81,792 thousand). After deducting the non-cash component of income from equity-accounted interests, net income received (as divi­ dends) from such interests was EUR 116,703 thousand (2014: EUR 106,844 thousand). Divestments relate to the deconsolidation of fully consolidated subsidiaries. This reduced non-current assets by EUR 832 thousand (2014: EUR 342,708 thousand) and current assets by EUR 548,510 thousand (2014: EUR 1,665,507 Consolidated Financial Statements thousand). Non-current liabilities decreased by EUR 3 thousand (2014: EUR 60,192 thousand) and current liabilities by EUR 81,648 thousand (2014: EUR 1,352,758 thousand). As of the balance sheet date, the sale proceeds of EUR 494,008 thousand (2014: EUR 1,067,124 thousand) were settled in full (2014: in the amount of EUR 145,350 thou­ sand) in the form of cash and cash equivalents. and Notes Dividends of EUR 128,926 thousand (2014: EUR 103,964 thousand) were paid to HOCHTIEF’s shareholders in the year under review. Dividends paid to minority shareholders totaled EUR 107,294 thousand (2014: EUR 108,120 thousand), of which EUR 79,017 thousand (2014: EUR 96,891 thousand) relates to the CIMIC Group. Group Report 2015 243 Debt repayments came to EUR 2,308,197 thousand (2014: EUR 1,147,210 thousand), compared with EUR 786,090 thousand (2014: EUR 1,650,551 thousand) in new borrowing. Financial assets and financial liabilities are made up as follows: Dec. 31, 2015 Dec. 31, 2014 (EUR thousand) (restated) Cash and cash equivalents 2,808,707 2,585,359 Marketable securities 576,898 741,535 Current financial receivables 66,083 77,474 Current tax receivables (excluding income taxes) 11,447 7,115 Receivables from the sale of discontinued operations – 1,108,112 Total financial assets 3,463,135 4,519,595 Bonds or notes issued, and amounts due to banks 2,472,601 3,815,963 Lease liabilities 171,621 198,288 Financial liabilities to associates 1,000 23,306 Sundry other financial liabilities 12,512 12,222 Financial liabilities 2,657,734 4,049,779 Net financial assets 805,401 469,816 The method and criteria used to calculate net financial assets was standardized across the HOCHTIEF Group in the current year. This mainly affects current financial receivables as well as financial liabilities to associates and sundry other financial liabilities, which are now included in net financial assets. The prior-year figures were restated accord­ ingly. In the prior year, the total financial assets of EUR 4,519,595 thousand included, under receivables from the sale of discontinued operations, proceeds of EUR 1,108,112 thousand from the sale of John Holland and of the services business at Thiess and Leighton Contractors. Financial assets are subject to certain restrictions on their use. Other than by financial liabilities, net financial assets are offset by advance payments from clients, cash call commitments on financial assets, and order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects. Advance payments from clients came to EUR 708,630 thousand (2014: EUR 813,320 thousand) and serve to fund contract costs. Cash call commitments on financial assets total EUR 4,209 thousand (2014: EUR 6,009 thousand) and relate to joint ventures in the HOCHTIEF Europe division. The prior-year figure also included cash call commitments for PPP project companies in the HOCHTIEF Asia Pacific division in the amount of EUR 13,059 thousand. Group order exposure from awarded capital expenditure projects is EUR 2,468 thousand (2014: EUR 22,521 thousand) and mostly relates to the CIMIC Group’s mining activities.

Essen, February 19, 2016 HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft The Executive Board Marcelino Fernández Verdes Peter Sassenfeld José Ignacio Legorburo Escobar Nikolaus Graf von Matuschka Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 250 Group Report 2015 Independent Auditors’ Report We have audited the consolidated financial statements—comprising Group statement of earnings, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, Group balance sheet, statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, prepared by HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, as well as the group management report, which has been combined with the parent company’s management ­report for the financial year from January 1, to December 31, 2015. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under German commercial law as complementarily applicable under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) is the responsibility of the Company’s Executive Board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the group management report based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with § 317 German Commercial Code (HGB) in compliance with German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promul­ gated by the Institut der Wirtschaftsprüfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the net assets, finan­ cial position and results of operations in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with applicable ac­ counting regulations and in the group management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Group and evaluations of possible misstate­ ments are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and the group management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of the audit. The audit includes assessing the annual financial statements of the companies included in consolidation, the determination of the companies to be included in consolidation, the accounting and consolidation principles used and significant estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and the group management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, which is based on the results of our audit, the consolidated financial statements of HOCHTIEF Aktiengesellschaft, Essen/Germany, comply with the IFRS, as applicable in the EU, and the regulations under Ger­ man commercial law as complementarily applicable under § 315a (1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and con­ Consolidated Financial Statements vey a true and fair view of the Group’s net assets, financial position and results of operations in accordance with these regulations. The group management report is consistent with the consolidated financial statements, conveys, in the aggregate, a true and fair view of the Company’s and Group’s position and suitably presents the risks and opportunities of future development. and Notes Düsseldorf, February 19, 2016 Deloitte & Touche GmbH Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft (Schlereth) (Bedenbecker) Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor) Wirtschaftsprüfer (German Public Auditor) Group Report 2015 251 Focus Area: Resource Protection In my world, the environment stays intact. Craig Tucker Group Environment Manager, CPB Contractors (CIMIC) In all of our projects, we work to protect the environ­ ment. And the railway upgrades between Kingsgrove and Revesby in Sydney were no exception. Among other things, this involved expanding the section to four tracks and constructing a number of rail bridges. As the prin­ cipal contractor representing a consortium, CPB Con­ tractors assumed responsibility for all aspects of the project including safety, environmental protection, and community consultation—all while trains continued to run. The consortium worked closely with the planning author­ ities, putting in place compensatory measures to main­ tain biodiversity. In the process, we ensured that our bridge work didn’t impact the protected mangroves at Salt Pan Creek. What’s more, right from the earliest stages of the project, we consulted with industry ex­ perts about initiatives to conserve resources. That cre­ ated a wealth of ideas, most of which were ultimately implemented. For instance, our team installed solar panels on the temporary noise barriers to generate green electricity. This project was the first in Australia where we built a bridge incrementally, meaning that we were able to leave the sensitive nearby waterway virtually untouched. When the 165-meter-long bridge was completed, the creek was returned to its original state—as nature intended. Further Information Further Information CIMIC Group company CPB Contractors (formerly Leighton Contractors) formed part of an alliance that successfully expanded the railway line between Kingsgrove and Revesby in Sydney, including building a bridge over Salt Pan Creek. 252 252 Group Report 2015 Group Report 2015 253 Index for the 10 Principles of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) GRI G4 index (for “in accordance”—Core) UNGC principles Exter­ Page number Link/notes General GRI indicators nal review G4-1 Strategy and analysis G4-1 Sustainability strategy and relevance of sustainability ✔ 9–11, 32ff, 38–39, 132, 162–165 www.hochtief.com/sustainability G4-3–16 Organizational profile G4-3 Name of organization ✔ 1, 2, 263 G4-4 Brands, products, and services ✔ 3–4, 80–93 www.hochtief.com/clientportal G4-5 Location of organization’s headquarters ✔ 263 G4-6 Number and names of countries where organization ✔ 30–31 operates G4-7 Nature of ownership and legal form ✔ 24, 28–31, 263 G4-8 Markets in which organization operates 30–31, 41–51, 80–93 www.hochtief.com/interview✔ eb2015 G4-9 Scale of organization ✔ 22–25, 30–31, 249, 263 06 G4-10 Detailed information on workforce ✔ 16–19, 115–125 03 G4-11 Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements ✔ 97, 98, 115, 116, CoC www.hochtief.com/compliance 05 G4-12 Organization’s supply chain ✔ 126–129 G4-13 Changes during reporting period ✔ 9–17, 32–39, 80–93, 115 07, 08 G4-14 Precautionary principle Ω✔ 123ff, 137, 148, CoC www.hochtief.com/commitments www.hochtief.com/compliance 01, 02, 05 G4-15 Commitments ✔ 3, 11, 97, 148, 149 www.hochtief.com/commitments G4-16 Memberships ✔ 3 www.hochtief.com/commitments G4-17-23 Identified material aspects and boundaries G4-17 List of subsidiaries, associates, and other significant ✔ 32–33, 254 www.hochtief.com/reports participating interests G4-18 Reporting principles and report content ✔ 2, 40–41, 150–165, 174 G4-19 Material aspects of report content ✔ 38–39, 162–165 G4-20 Material aspects within organization ✔ 38–39, 162–165 G4-21 Material aspects outside organization ✔ 38–39, 162–165 G4-22 Restatements of information provided in previous reports ✔ 2, 9–11, 150–165 G4-23 Changes in scope and aspect boundaries ✔ 2, 38–39, 148ff G4-24-27 Stakeholder engagement G4-24 Stakeholder groups engaged by organization ✔ 2, 38–39, 148–149 G4-25 Basis for identification of stakeholder groups ✔ 2, 38–39, 148–149 G4-26 Approach for engagement of stakeholder groups ✔ 2, 38–39, 148–149 G4-27 Key topics raised through stakeholder engagement ✔ 2, 38–39, 148–149 G4-28-33 Report profile G4-28 Reporting period ✔ 2, 174 G4-29 Date of previous report ✔ 2 G4-30 Reporting cycle ✔ 2, 174 G4-31 Contact point ✔ 263 www.hochtief.com G4-32 GRI Index assurance report ✔ 254–255 08 G4-33 Basis and scope of assurance; relationship between ✔ 2, 14, 251, 256-257 www.hochtief.com/auditor organization and auditors; Executive Board support G4-34 Governance G4-34 Governance structure ✔ 18f, 32f, 38f, 96 www.hochtief.com/corporategovernance 01, 02, 04, G4-56 Ethics and integrity Further Information 05, 06, 10 G4-56 Principles, values, and standards ✔ 32f, 55, 96ff, 148f, CoC www.hochtief.com/vision CoC = Code of Conduct 254 Group Report 2015 GRI G4 Index (for “in accordance”—Core) Exter­ Page number Link notes Industry-specific general GRI Indicators nal review Strategy and analysis G4-2 Refurbishment and upgrading ✔ 48, 157 www.hochtief.com/clientportal Organizational profile G4-9 Sales by region; green building, green infrastructure, ✔ 45–49, 53, 80–93, 159, 09 PPP, significant market segments 162–165 G4-10 Employees of different ethnic origins ✔ 121, CoC, 99, 129 Due to differences in national legislation, we are unable 06 to present statistics by gender for all companies.

It was not part of our engagement to review any product or service related statements, any links to external sources, future-looking statements or statements from external experts. Management’s Responsibility The Company’s Executive Board is responsible for the accurate preparation of the report in accordance with the criteria stated in the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). This responsibility includes the selection and application of appropriate methods to prepare the report as well as the usage of reasonable assumptions and estimates for individual sustainability disclosures. Furthermore, the respon­ sibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining systems and processes relevant for the preparation of the report in a way that it is free of – intended or unintended – material misstatements. Our Independence and Quality Control We have met the requirements regarding independence along with the additional requirements relating to profes­ sional conduct of the IESBA Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, which is based on the fundamental prin­ ciples of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional conduct worthy of the profession. The quality assurance system of Deloitte & Touche GmbH is based on the International Standard on Quality Con­ trol 1 “Quality Control for Audit, Assurance and Related Service Practices” (ISQC 1) and, in addition on national statutory requirements and professional standards, especially the Professional Code for Certified Accountants as well as the joint statement of WPK (Chamber of Public Accountants) and IDW (Institute of Public Auditors in Ger­ many): Requirements for quality assurance in the auditing practice (VO 1/2006). Practitioner‘s responsibility Our responsibility is to express a conclusion based on our work performed and the evidences obtained on the above mentioned information of the report. Procedures and extend of the assurance engagement We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised): “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”. This standard requires that we comply with our professional duties and give an attestation, based on the results of our work, as to whether any matters have come to our knowledge that could give rise to the assumption that the sustainability information as stated in the Group Report 2015 does not comply, in all material respects, with the above mentioned criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI. In a limited assurance engagement the evidence gathering procedures are more limited than in a reasonable assurance engagement. Hence, the scope of a limited review is less comprehensive and may not reasonably assure all material facts as could a reasonable assurance. The selection of audit activities is subject to the auditor’s own judgement. This includes the assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the report under consideration of the GRI reporting criteria. Further Information 256 Group Report 2015 Within the scope of our work, we performed amongst others the following procedures when conducting the limited assurance engagement: • Interviewing employees at group level in order to gain an understanding of the process for determining material sustainability topics and the stakeholder engagement process of HOCHTIEF • Interviews with relevant staff at group level responsible for providing the data and information, carrying out internal control procedures and consolidating the data and information, including the explanatory notes • Analytical procedures on relevant data • Comparison of selected data with corresponding data in the HOCHTIEF consolidated financial statement and management report • Evaluation of information on selected sustainability performance measurements Our Conclusion Based on our limited review, nothing has come to our knowledge that could give rise to the assumption that the infor­ mation of the materiality analysis, management approaches and quantitative and qualitative sustainability information as stated in the Group Report for the business year starting January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2015 of HOCHTIEF, Essen, does not comply with the criteria of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines G4 of the GRI. Recommendations Without qualifying our conclusion above, we make the following recommendations for the further development of the company‘s sustainability management and sustainability reporting: • Continuing cross-functional data gathering within the entire group using a centralized software system • Focusing on performance relevant KPI systems • Further linking of financial and non-financial performance indicators This assurance report is issued based on an assurance engagement agreed upon with HOCHTIEF. The assurance engagement to obtain limited assurance is issued for the purposes of HOCHTIEF and the report is intended solely to inform HOCHTIEF of the results of the assurance engagement. This assurance report is not intended as a basis for (financial) decision-making by third parties of any kind. We have responsibility only towards HOCHTIEF. We do not assume any responsibilities for third parties.
