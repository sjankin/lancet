The end year results of Trimo exceeded annual plan and also performance indicators from 2014. The support and trust of the key stakeholders contributed considerably to encouraging business trends for Trimo. In 2015 Trimo generated net sales revenues of 85,3 million EUR, which is 15,8 percent above the plan and 26 percent above the result from 2014. Net profit of Trimo in the amount of 2,7 million EUR also exceeded expectations, considering the loss in 2014. The results for Trimo Group also show positive trends. Trimo Group generated net sales revenues in the amount of 129,7 million EUR, which is 3,7 percent above the plan and 17,0 percent above the revenues in 2014. Net profit of the controlling owner at group level reached 3,1 million EUR, which is considerable improvement compared to 2,3 million EUR of loss in 2014. Important milestone of 2015 was also a selling procedure of Trimo. In December Trimo gained a new owner, Polish private equity fund Innova Capital. The successful transaction, which was closed in April 2016, will allow the debts of the company to be cleared and the new Trimo will now sit on a strong financial foundation. The new owner in April 2016 appointed a new supervisory board and a new management team. The objective of the new management team is to re-establish Trimo as one of the leading companies in the sector, providing both panels and high-value added façade solutions, like our Qbiss One façade systems. The management team will be focusing efforts on growing the company, including the sales of Trimoterm across Europe and in addition expanding the reach of Qbiss One in global markets. Working together, this team and their colleagues will have several key short term objectives: expanding and refocusing the company's marketing strategy and brand, strengthening and expanding the European sales organisation for Trimoterm and Qbiss One, introducing product improvements and modifications, implementation of new financial management tools and risk control procedures, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Order to Delivery process in the company, reviewing and evaluating 'product/market' fit and making strategic decisions on new value added products in the Trimo pipeline. The short term goals are, of course, strongly aligned with the long term objectives of Trimo: to increase Trimoterm growth by optimizing the product and improving customer service across Europe, to establish Qbiss One as a leading architectural façade solution in Europe, to globalize the Qbiss One system by establishing sales relationships in key overseas markets and to continue to develop additional innovative façade solutions and introduce them to the market. I believe that we stand at the start of a new and promising era for Trimo. I am sure that we can reestablishing Trimo as one of the leading companies in the sector of panels and high value added façade solutions. I look forward to pursue this mission together with the management team and all employees of Trimo.

Achievement of goals in 2015 and business goals in 2016 Achievement of business goals in 2015 A turn in operations was achieved, the company operated with positive results and it fulfilled all the commitments arising from the financial restructuring (MRA). The attained revenue of Trimo in the amount of 85.3 million EUR, exceeded the plan by 15.8%; at the level of the group, we attained net sales revenue in the amount of 129.7 million EUR, thus exceeding the plan by 3.7%. EBITDA margin in the amount of 6.1% was achieved, which is less than the planned margin of 7.5%, due to a less profitable product portfolio. The achieved net profit in the company was 2.7 million EUR (19.8% above the plan) and net profit of the controlling owner 3.1 million EUR in the Trimo Group (16,7% above the plan). Trimo achieved the planned level of order intake in the amount of 90 million EUR. The Trimo Group did not achieve the order intake sales plan, especially due to the aggravated operations of Russian companies, which was mostly the consequence of the deterioration of the business environment in the region. The share in sales outside Slovenia was 90% in Trimo and 91% in the Trimo Group. The share in sales of new products and solutions in total sales was 25% (strategic goal is 30%). Business goals in 2016 Trimo Trimo Group Net sales revenue 93.0 million EUR 137.7 million EUR Added value per employee 54,348 EUR 40,952 EUR Average number of employees 358 733 15 Risk management Risk management It is vital to recognise and effectively manage risks in business decisions considering how rapidly the external macroeconomic conditions are changing in various international markets and also how rapidly internal conditions of operations determined with business processes are changing. Our risk management process is shown below. Figure 3: Risk management process RISK IDENTIFICATION ASSESSMENT MANAGEMENT FUTURE RISKS MONITORING Assessment – risk identification and management The Trimo Group manages 44 different risks divided into three main groups: business risks (19), operational risks (20) and financial risks (5). Descriptions of individual risks, groups and sub-groups of risks are shown below in the risk matrix. Risk management is an integral part of the business plan of Trimo within the competencies and responsibilities of the administrators of key and support processes. The risk takers are in most cases the administrators of key and support processes; they are responsible for the risk management of their processes. Business risks, financial risks and operational risks are managed within the responsibilities and authorisations of individual organisational units in Trimo. Subsidiaries in the Trimo Group should establish their own process of risk management that is in accordance with the policies of the parent company Trimo as well as with the umbrella process of risk management in the parent company Trimo. Risk monitoring is done annually in internal plans of process operators or risk takers. Takers of individual risks assess the probability of the risks occurring and the consequences if the risk actually occurs using a 5x5 matrix. 16 Figure 4: Matrix for risk assessment High 5 Medium High High High High Very high 4 Medium Medium High High High Probability Medium 3 Low Medium Medium High High Lower 2 Low Low Medium Medium High Low 1 Low Low Low Medium Medium A B C D E Very serious, Small, Medium, Large, very Very small critical, moderate manageable influential dangerous Consequences Risk management The approaches for the management of risks in the business risk group and operational risk group are specific for each risk separately. They are described in detail in the internal document Risk management. Key indicators are defined for each risk. Apart from the assessment matrix, they are also used for measuring risk exposure. Key indicators that measure risk exposure are defined by the risk takers who also monitor them. The key element for preventing risks is suitable planning and predicting. Risk monitoring and assessment We periodically review key risks and adopt corrective and preventive measures to avoid risks. At regular time intervals, we review key risks and determine the measures for risk management. We also regularly review the changes in risk probability and the changes in risk consequences, in case a key risk occurs. We determine the manner and frequency of reporting. The content of reports depends on the type of risk and the selected instruments and methods. Risk priorities in 2015 At Trimo in 2015, key risks for achieving the sales plan defined in the below figure were recognised, so we paid special attention to those risks in 2015. For each of the key risks, we defined risk management activities and detailed plans for managing each risk and we defined possible consequences, indicators of monitoring and assessment and a system for reporting, supervision and preparation of an action plan in the event of identified deviations. 17 Figure 5: Risk analysis with groups, subgroups of risk and individual risks as well as emphasis in 2015 PROBABILITY AND GROUP OF RISKS BUSINESS RISKS RISK MANAGEMENT (TRIMO D.D.)

Key future risks are risks to which the company is heavily exposed, therefore we will devote considerably more attention to them in 2016 than to the other risks. We assess the following risks as the key risks in 2016:  price risk,  the risk of (non)achievement of sales, loss of key customers and the (non)acquisition of new customers,  the risk of changes in macroeconomic business conditions on individual markets,  the risk of delays in individual stages of the project and the (late) completion of the project,  the risk of exceeding the contractually agreed project budget and the (non)achievement of the planned added value for the project,  (non)payment risk,  currency and interest risk,  solvency risk,  financing structure risk. Apart from these risks, we also assess as important risks in 2016 the risks that were already defined in 2015 and that were identified as medium level risks. The action plan for key future risks includes preparation of risk management plans, definition of consequences and monitoring of indicators as well as the system of reporting and supervision. 20 Business environment 2015 was marked by an improved but still uncertain business environment, with a steady recovery of the world and European economy and increased economic and geopolitical risks. According to the information of the European Commission, the economy of the euro area countries increased by 0.9 percent in 2015, while the world economy increased by 3.0 percent in 2015, which is less than in 2014 (3.3%). Decreased growth of the world economy is mainly the consequence of the consistently slower growth in fast growing countries such as China, Brazil and Russia, which are under pressure from the fall in raw material prices. The Chinese economy increased by 6.9 % in 2015, whereas its growth was almost 10% in 2012. Russia, one of the most important markets for the Trimo Group, experienced negative growth of -3.7% in 2015. Negative growth of -1.2% is also predicted for 2016, which is also reflected in the operations of the Trimo Group in this market. In 2015 also, the USA recorded higher growth than the countries of the European Union (2.5 percent), whereas Japan recorded minimum 0.7 percent growth. It is expected that the same trends will continue in both countries in the next two years. Middle East Countries, with an average growth of 2.7%, recorded similar growth as in the previous year, whereas it is expected that this growth will increase to 3.5% in the next two years. In 2015, international trade increased by 2.6%, which is slightly less than in 2014 (3.4%). The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) considers that the value of direct foreign investments on the world level significantly increased in 2015, namely by 36% to the estimated 1,700 billion dollars, which is the highest value after the economic crisis of 2008-09. However, the bigger part of the growth is due to international purchases of undertakings, especially in developing countries, and to a smaller extent due to the so-called greenfield investments. According to Euroconstruct, the European construction market achieved positive growth in 2015 in the amount of 1.6%, which is only slightly more than the previous year (1.3%). In the key segment of new, non-residential construction, the growth was again negative (-0.6%) after the stagnation in 2014. Association for the period 2016-2018 predicts moderate recovery of the construction market, with an average annual growth rate of 2.6 percent or 3.0 percent in the non-residential construction segment where there are major differences in trends between individual countries. Figure 6: Average annual growth of construction market in Euroconstruct10 countries and comparison by markets According to data from the World Bank that monitors prices of individual raw materials on the world market, the global prices of key raw materials dropped in 2015, which is especially true for the price 10 Members of Euroconstruct are: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Great Britain. 21 of crude oil. In 2015, the prices of energy products decreased by 45% on average, whereas the prices of other raw materials decreased by 15% on average. The reduction in the prices of raw materials is a reflection of excess supply, expected lower growth in emerging countries and a strong US dollar. The World Bank expects strengthening of the prices of raw materials in 2017. In 2015, purchase prices of mineral wool remained at the same level as in 2014, whereas in 2016 we expect prices to increase by 1-2%. In certain strategic raw materials such as iron metallurgy and thin steel sheet-metal, the drop in prices was present throughout the whole year. The prices of steel, both for the production of steel construction and the production of panels, were falling mainly due to excess supply, our ordering of iron metallurgy directly to rolling and receiving project discounts. We expect stable prices of steel in 2016. Slight growth is possible in the second half of the year, but it depends on numerous factors. The prices of assembly and other services remained at the same level as in the previous period. In 2016, we expect continued moderate improvement of the macroeconomic environment in the core markets of the operations of Trimo, but with an increased risk. The greatest risk for world economic growth is possible simultaneous, consistently slower growth of the biggest emerging markets, namely China, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, that could spread to the rest of the world. We should also mention volatility in global financial markets and increased geopolitical risks as well as regional tensions. Due to different dynamics among individual segments of the construction market, a lot of attention should be given to the identification of more promising construction segments and market niches in the future. Trimo will adapt target marketing to the changed circumstances also in the future, and it will focus on more promising markets and branches of economic activity. We are also aware that due to global warming, the future of the construction industry is in sustainable construction. Therefore, in the following decades, key innovations will be in the field of energy efficiency, use of renewable resources, improvement of insulating materials, development of new technologies and intelligent buildings. Trimo is actively joining various environmental programmes and developing complete solutions for energy efficient buildings and efficient use of alternative energy resources. 22 Business performance analysis Relevant information on operating activities of Trimo company 2015/2014 index TOTAL REVENUE 87,145,710 EUR 121 OPERATING PROFIT OR LOSS 4,586,586 EUR TOTAL CAPITAL (31 DEC 2015) 15,357,137 EUR NO.

The net profit or loss was positive and equalled 2,726,915 EUR.11 The main reasons for higher total profit or loss lie in higher net sales revenue and lower financial expenses from the impairment of financial investments.12 Assets At the end of 2015, Trimo’s volume of assets was 68,886,326 EUR, a 9 percent increase compared to 2014.13 At the end of 2015, long-term assets represented 61 percent of total assets and were lower than the year before (index 96). The largest proportion of long-term assets is land and buildings (47 percent of the long-term assets), followed by intangible assets (18 percent of the long-term assets), manufacturing equipment and machines (17 percent of the long-term assets) and long-term financial investments (6 percent of the long-term assets).

Figure 10: Added value per employee by year Sales revenue per employee In 2015, the sales revenue per employee in Trimo increased by 33.6 percent and was 250,817 EUR. Figure 11: Sales revenue per employee by year Return on assets In 2015, Trimo’s return on assets increased and was at 4.1 percent (-5.2 percent in 2014).15 Return on equity In 2015, Trimo’s return on equity16 increased and was at 19.5 percent (-58.6 % in 2014). Book value per share The book value of a Trimo share at the end of 2015 was 1.38 EUR (1.05 EUR in 2014). 14 When calculating added value per employee, the average number of employees was rounded to the nearest whole number. 15 In this calculation of the return on assets, only the net profit or loss in the period enters the numerator of the indicator with regard to the average balance in the same period. 16 It is calculated as a ratio of the net profit or loss of the financial year with regard to average equity in the financial year. 26 Relevant information on operating activities of Trimo Group Index 2015/2014 TOTAL REVENUE 136,309,813 EUR 114 OPERATING PROFIT/LOSS 4,277,416 EUR TOTAL CAPITAL (31 DECEMBER 2015) 19,064,592 EUR NO.

Figure 12: Total revenue of the Trimo Group by year In 2015, sales revenue was 17% higher than in 2014. The bulk of sales revenue was generated on foreign markets, namely 112,296,990 EUR (82.4% of total revenue, in 2014: 80.1%). Sales revenue on foreign markets was 18% higher than in 2014.

Operating expenses in 2015 increased by 11.6% compared to the year before. Financial expenses decreased by 15.8%. The negative performance of some subsidiaries, relatively high operating expenses from revaluation and financial expenses to a high degree influenced the final performance result of the Group in 2015.17 Figure 14: The structure of operating expenses of the Trimo Group in 2015 compared to 2014 17 Financial expenses or surplus financial expenses over financial revenue 28 Profit or loss Net profit of the controlling owner of the Group in 2015 amounted to 3,126,220 EUR.18 Operating result stood at 4,277,416 EUR. Total operating result for 2015 is positive, equalling 2,868,864 EUR. Assets The volume of assets of the Trimo Group was 98,176,826 EUR at the end of 2015 or 4.5% more than in 2014.19 At the end of 2015, long-term assets accounted for 59.9% of total assets, having decreased by 4.1%. The major portion of long-term assets is represented by land and buildings (50% of long-term assets), production machinery and equipment (23% of long-term assets), intangible long-term assets (16% long-term assets), investment property (5% long-term assets), and long-term financial investments (1% long-term assets). In 2015, the share of short-term assets in the total rose to 39% (2014: 33%). Capital and liabilities At the end of 2015, the capital of the Trimo Group stood at 19,064,592 EUR, accounting for 19.4% of liabilities. Long-term provisions and long-term accrued expenses and deferred revenue decreased by 2% in 2015 compared to 2014 to 4,508,848 EUR. In 2015, long-term liabilities of the Group increased and accounted for 38% of liabilities (in 2014: 36%). The increase in long-term liabilities of the Group was mainly influenced by the transfer of bank loans from short-term financial liabilities to long-term financial liabilities. The share of short-term liabilities in the total dropped in 2015 to 32% (2014: 40%), whereas in the absolute amount these liabilities decreased by 18% compared to the previous year, especially because of lower short-term financial liabilities and a decrease in short-term operating liabilities arising from advances and other short-term operating liabilities. Operating result Value added per employee Value added per employee20 in the Group was 41,198 EUR in 2015, having grown by 19% compared to 2014. 18 More information on this is available in the Financial Report of the Group under disclosures referring to the consolidated income statement. 19 More information on this is available in the Financial section of the Consolidated Annual Report of the Trimo Group. 20 Value added per employee is calculated as the ratio between the total value added and the average number of employees based on the hours worked in the same period. The total value added is calculated as the difference between the categories of income statement = Gross operating income – Costs of goods, material and services – Other operating expenses. It represents the basic employee performance indicator in the Trimo Group. 29 Figure 15: Value added per employee in the Trimo Group by year Sales revenue per employee In 2015, sales revenue per employee rose by 26% reaching 178,441 EUR (in 2014: 141,298 EUR). Return on assets In 2015, return on assets improved, equalling 2.91% as a result of improved operating result of the Group in the year.21 Return on equity In 2015, return on equity improved, equalling 16.9% as a result of improved operating result of the Group in the year. 21 The numerator in the calculation of ROA is only the net profit for the period compared to the average assets in the same period. 30 Sales achievements Sales achievements 22 In 2015, Trimo realised 91.2 million EUR in order intake, whereas in the Trimo Group order intake amounted to 141.1 million EUR. On the level of the company, we exceeded last year's realisation by 1.2 million EUR or by 1.3 percent, whereas on the level of the Group we fell behind by 2.5 percent in comparison to the previous year, which is mostly a reflection of worse sales results of Russian companies due to the deterioration of the business environment and the drop in the value of the rouble. Figure 17: Movements in order intake in the company and in the Trimo Group by year Sales by product groups In Trimo and the Trimo Group, we focus our marketing and sales activities on the sales of façades and roofs (building envelope). The share of building envelopes in total sales of the Group was 57 percent in 2015, and on the level of the company it was 65 percent. Within building envelopes, Trimoterm panels represent the largest share, and higher price-level façade solutions from the Qbiss family also represent an important share. In 2015, we acquired a few larger projects with Trimo's steel construction, so the share of steel construction in the Group's sales increased. On the other hand, the share of the sales of modular units and engineering decreased, whereas the share of the sales of acrylic products in the Group stayed at a similar level as in the previous year. 22 Data on order intake is subject to changes over time, due to changes in specification and scope of individual investment. 31 Figure 12: Product sales structure of Trimo and the Trimo Group in 2015 Sales of new products and solutions New products significantly contribute to the growth of sales, acquiring new customers and entering new markets and new segments. They are the motor of development and at the same time the result of innovative solutions, approaches and concepts in the company. In 2015, the share of sales of new products and solutions in total sales represented 25 percent. In 2015, Qbiss One modular façade system and the new range of thermally and structurally efficient panels Trimoterm Power were the top-selling new products. The most important reference project that was acquired and already implemented with new products was the project of the energy renovation of an office building in Oslo, Norway, with the glass curtain wall façade system Qbiss Air, where five-chamber façade elements were used for the first time, and they represent the only transparent façade system in the world with a six-fold glazing. The centre of contemporary art HOME in Manchester in Great Britain. The envelope of the building is an innovative combination of the Qbiss One modular façade system, Trimoterm panels and the transparent glass façade envelope. 32 We also successfully develop and realise innovative, special solutions for individual clients. Thus, in the field of the Qbiss One modular façade system, we continued to upgrade the system with special and individual solutions for commercial projects, where exclusiveness of the exterior and conservation of the properties of the building envelope were requested. Sales by regions 23 Trimo realises the largest part of its sales in the region of Western and Northern Europe, where Great Britain represents the largest single market, followed by Germany. In 2015, the region of Western and Northern Europe was also the most important region on the Group level, since we had worse results in the traditionally strongest region of Eastern Europe. We realised an important share of sales with strategic customers. The sales in Germany strengthened most among individual markets. Figure 19: Regional sales structure in Trimo and the Trimo Group in 2015 Slovenia According to the regional sales structure of the Trimo Group in 2015, Slovenia represented 12 percent of the total sales of the Trimo Group and 13 percent of the total sales of Trimo company. In 2015, we achieved a similar value of orders on the domestic market as in the previous two years. We acquired a few larger projects of which we would like to single out the project of the third phase of the production facility of the investor Filc and the project of the production plant of Krka in Ljutomer. We also participated in the production of the modern centre for waste management RCERO in Ljubljana. The Slovenian market remains the most important market in terms of acrylic products sales, which we produce and market in Akripol, and one of the most important markets in terms of façade and roof panels sales as well as steel construction. 23 The regions of the Trimo Group: West and North Europe: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Island, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK East Europe: Belarus, Estonia, Kazakhstan, countries of the Caspian region and the Caucasus, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Ukraine Central Europe: Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia South Europe: Albania, BiH, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Montenegro, Greece, Croatia, Italy, Kosovo, Macedonia, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Spain, Turkey Overseas markets: countries of the Middle East and North Africa, North and Latin America, Asia, Australia and Sub-Saharan Africa as well as projects with global, strategic customers 33 West and North Europe In the region of West and North Europe, we generated 27 percent of the total sales of the Trimo Group and 33 percent of the sales of Trimo company in 2015. The most important three markets in the region are Great Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, both according to total sales and the sales of new products. In 2015, the highest growth was reached on the German market, where we acquired several projects with the Qbiss One modular façade system. The project that should be singled out is the furniture trade centre Finke Center Hamm, which represents the largest order for Qbiss One on German market until now, and the order for the Porsche car showroom in Munich. The largest and most important reference project in the region was in Norway, where we acquired and already implemented the project for the renovation of an office building in Oslo with the glass curtain wall façade system Qbiss Air. East Europe In 2015, East Europe represented a smaller share of total sales than in previous years, which was due to lower sales of both Russian companies as a consequence of the deterioration of the business environment in Russia and the effect of the drop in the value of the rouble. Therefore, the share of the region in total sales of the Group was 16 percent and 4 percent in the company. In Russia, we acquired a larger project for an office building of the investor Transneft in Kazan, which will be dressed in the Qbiss One façade system. Central Europe In this region, we generated 15 percent of the total sales of the Trimo Group and 18 percent of the sales of Trimo company in 2015. The share of the region in total sales of Trimo company and the Trimo Group has remained at a similar level over the years, whereas in 2015 it slightly strengthened due to higher sales in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The Czech Republic remains the most important market in the region. There we acquired several larger projects in the logistics facilities segment in 2015. In Slovakia, the most important of the acquired projects was the Lidl logistics centre, which is one of Lidl's largest logistics centres in Europe. South Europe In the regional structure, the region of South Europe represents 12 percent of the total sales of the Trimo Group, which is a similar share to the previous two years. The most important market in the region is still Serbia, where we are present with the production company Trimo Inženjering. In 2015, Trimo Inženjering exceeded the previous year by 22 percent, with higher sales in Serbia and higher exports to countries in the region. We achieved important growth of sales in Croatia in 2015 in comparison to the previous year. The most important project in the region was acquired in Spain, where we will carry out the project of a business and commercial facility in Barcelona with the Qbiss One façade system for the prestigious fashion brand Mango. Overseas markets In 2015, we created 19 percent of sales for the Trimo Group in overseas markets, the biggest part of which was for global strategic customers that operate in the demanding energy sector. We saw higher sales in Singapore, which represents one of the perspective new markets for Trimo. Among the individual projects, those that should be highlighted are the orders for the university research centre The Prince Naif Centre for Health Science Research Princ Naif , the largest university in Saudi Arabia, for which the Qbiss One façade system was chosen. 34 In 2016, marketing activities will be focused on the countries of West and North Europe, especially Great Britain, Germany, France and the Scandinavian countries. Furthermore, we would like to strengthen our presence in overseas markets, where we are carrying out target marketing through large international construction companies, especially in the field of energetics where we are performing activities in order to acquire new strategic customers. Research and development Sustainable development is a key component of the development strategy Development activities are based on successful development of innovative, high quality products and solutions that satisfy the needs of different markets, segments and customers. Added value of products and solutions is an important development factor for Trimo and our customers. The main guidelines for the development and management of the building envelope product portfolio are: simple, fast, (multi)functional, sustainable and aesthetic complete solutions. The principles of sustainable development and construction are key guidelines of the development strategy of Trimo company and the Trimo Group. We take into account safety and environmental starting-points in the development of products, systems and production technologies. The newest development activities focus on the field of highly insulated thin-layered envelopes, reduction of the use of energy in buildings and reduction of CO2 footprint and energy balance while at the same time increasing the level of recyclability of the products. The criteria for the Life Cycle Assessment of a product or solution are considered with regard to these activities. A common thread in development and marketing in the Trimo Group is the fire safety of our products and systems, considering construction physics, energy efficiency and comfort of living in spaces with an emphasis on architectural solutions and design. In order to promote changes in legislation in the direction of greater fire safety, we are an active member of the alliance Fire Safe Europe (FSEU). New products, improvements and applicative solutions In the Trimo Group, development is one of key areas of operation that ensures long-term, stable growth of the company and the boosting of brand recognition. With regard to the strategic orientation of the company, the focus of the development is on the products and systems for building envelope. Over the past years, we have been focused on the development of higher price range solutions for building envelope Qbiss One, Qbiss Air and Trimoterm Power that are intended for comfortable and safe living and energy efficient execution of building envelope. Development includes several fields, namely the development of new products, improvements and applicative solutions as well as the development of suitable technological solutions and equipment. We ensure long-term competitive advantage and new penetration with basic development of new materials and systems. For this purpose, we connect with various knowledge centres and tenders through which we realise our development goals. In 2015, we generated more than 25 percent of revenue with the sales of new products and solutions. As regards innovations, applicative solutions represent an important share in revenue. This refers to the response to market requirements for individual or project solutions with higher added value. In 2015, there were 36 active development projects, 11 of which were completed. We increased the share of newly developed products and systems in the structure with regard to previous years. 35 Figure 13: Structure of development tasks in 2015 CBS Inštitut has been operating in the Trimo Group for more than a decade. It is a development company that continued with development of the glass curtain wall façade system, Qbiss Air, in 2015, focusing on transparent solutions for the most demanding projects. Trimoterm fireproof façade and roof systems The use of Trimoterm panels is most common in industrial, commercial and partly business segments. The competition in these segments is strong, which is why the focus is on development activities that on one hand increase the competitiveness of products and on the other hand allow for penetration into new market segments. In 2015, among other things, we were intensively developing a new façade system for the residential segment that enables fast construction with a pre-fabricated wall composed of several panels with already built-in glazing and a chosen external finish. We performed material and technological improvements on the product Trimoterm PIR (which is most often used in food industry) that ensure higher added value and competitiveness on the market. Qbiss One modular façade system In the field of the Qbiss One modular façade system, we continue to upgrade the system with special and individual project solutions. The demand for noble metallic materials and possibilities of glazing is increasing. Consequently, development is focused on combining non-transparent and transparent façade elements. We also focused on further development of the ventilated façade system Qbiss One S. As regards design and aesthetics, the solution is based on the Qbiss One façade system, and it enables us to combine the systems on the same building. We continue to upgrade the system through the performance of the A2 combustibility classification, which we will confirm with a certificate in 2016. Qbiss Air glass curtain wall façade system We presented the Qbiss Air glass curtain wall façade system for the first time in 2013. Since then, we have developed transparent and non-transparent glass systems. Further development is directed towards efficient energy use and achievement of high comfort living. Architectural trends dictate the use of different materials in combination with glass, so we focus our development on the combination of Qbiss Air and Qbiss One elements as part of a uniform façade. 36 Trimo modular units We have developed a panel with a new manner of attaching for an important European supplier of containers and modular units. Acrylic products Aglas and Alux In 2015, we finished the development of the above-standard thickness of acrylic sheets in the dimension of 30mm, which enables us to enter a new niche segment with more demanding customers. Key activities were directed towards the improvement of different functional characteristics such as increased scratch resistance, diffuse light transmission and reduced combustibility. We also continued with the optimisation of compositions in order to reduce the number of input materials. Intellectual property In the field of the protection of own knowledge and industrial property, the Trimo Group has 38 brands, 3 models, 21 patents and 13 patent families. We registered 4 brands in 2015. Building partnerships In 2015, we actively cooperated with over 100 domestic and foreign partners in the development process. These included universities, institutes, departments for development from other companies, including many suppliers, and a large number of independent researchers and designers. In 90 percent of all development projects, we cooperated with external partners. We develop cooperation with knowledge centres through other forms of cooperation such as the Trimo Research Awards, cooperation in joint calls for applications in development (for example Horizon 2020 , Smart Specialisation Strategy, Economic Centres), collaboration with students, enabling visits and tours of production facilities and our specialists functioning as guest speakers at universities or members of specialised associations. Investment In 2015, the amount of investment was limited due to the Master Restructuring Agreement (MRA). Therefore, we directed these activities towards the most necessary investments in order to provide suitable quality of products for customers. In 2015, the Trimo Group allocated 799 thousand EUR to investment, 744 thousand EUR of which in the parent company and 55 thousand EUR in subsidiaries. Apart from investment, we carried out regular annual maintenance work on the technological equipment and for the maintenance of business facilities. A key part of the investment was for production equipment with which we modernised production capacity, improved product quality, reduced production costs and improved health and safety at work. With regard to investments, we also consider environmental aspects and energy efficiency. 37 Supply of products One of Trimo's main strategic guidelines is customer satisfaction. The most important factor of customer satisfaction is the provision of competitive and quality products with agreed content and within agreed deadlines. We achieve this with continuous optimisation of cost effectiveness of products and technologies as well as with continuous improvement of processes. The optimisation of processes is carried out according to the system of lean management of processes. Lean means providing:  education of employees, team work and creating an environment of a learning organisation,  quality in all processes and the strengthening of key operative fields,  customer satisfaction (timeliness of supply, quality, high responsiveness) and owner satisfaction,  cost reduction and ensuring high quality,  optimisation of processes on all levels, authorisations,  reduction of waste, no errors and accidents,  implementation of good practice in other processes. Production planning In 2015, we started implementing the program for effective production planning that ensures the optimal combination of utilisation of production lines, resources and reaching customer expectations. The goal of our next step is to additionally shorten the supply deadlines to our customers. With coordinated and focused operations throughout the whole chain, and with the implementation of new approaches such as lean production, we were able to optimise the level of supplies of raw materials and thereby improve the tying up of money in materials in 2015. Purchasing process Purchasing operations are based on the optimisation of costs and time as well as the support of Trimo's development activities. Also in 2015, we worked intensely on linking together all members of Trimo's supply chain to ensure shorter and more efficient complete solutions for our customers and to shorten the time to develop new products and solutions. Production Trimo has production facilities in Slovenia, Serbia and Russia. High-technology, adjustable and reliable production of façades and roofs allows us to produce more than 50,000 different combinations of panels with regard to the thickness, module, profiling, type of panel, colour, etc. Full automation of the production process of fireproof panels ensures exceptional quality, repeatability, flexibility and a quick-change system of various types of products. On-going measuring of the geometry of panels in the process of production on the line enables immediate reaction in case of irregularities, which assures our customers that they get only the best, since we upgraded the method with non-destructive control of mechanical characteristics: a reliable system for process control and determining of the state of the interior of the panel during the process. The process of the production of steel structures is based on a high-end CNC and CAD-CAM technologically supported process of the processing of steel profiles and sheet metal, which enables high flexibility, accuracy and reliability of production. With ensuring quality according to the most 38 demanding standards of manufacturing steel structures, we are the right choice for the most demanding customers. In 2015, the emphasis was on an increase in productivity, effectiveness of the utility of hours and optimisation of waste. The productivity of the line for the production of panels at the Trebnje plant increased by 4 percent in comparison to the previous year, and at the Trimo Inženjering plant by 29 percent, in particular due to improving the speed of operation of the line. The proportion of waste in the production volume decreased by 0.15 percentage points at the Trebnje plant and by 0.92 percentage points at the Trimo Inženjering plant. Logistics Logistics is the process that ensures correct, timely, quality and economical storage, handling, shipment and delivery of materials, products and services with the lowest costs and impact on the environment, in accordance with customer and legal requirements as well as legislative requirements and other regulations. All Trimo panels and strategic materials are stored in high-tech rack warehouses designed by Trimo according to its needs. With the storage of products and raw materials in these warehouses, complete protection of materials for uninterrupted supply of production and finished products awaiting delivery to the customer is ensured. We handle the management of input and output materials as well as customs documentation in accordance with customs legislation and the permission of the Authorised economic operator (AEO). In 2015, we started with the project of intensive optimisation of working capital and thus reduced the volume of inventories and increased inventory turnover. Complete quality management and process approach Our strategic orientation is the development and provision of high quality products and services, incorporation of innovative and complete solutions in new products and processes as well as the development of an efficient integrated company management system. Our basic guideline is the satisfaction of all stakeholders, so care for complete quality management throughout the chain of operation is integrated into each of our activities. The main guidelines of quality management are:  excellent quality of products and services, acknowledged and measured by the customers,  certification, the ensuring and managing of the quality of products and systems of management in accordance with the valid legislation, harmonised standards, additionally included certification systems and with special requests of customers and interested partners in view of providing optimal support to all stakeholders.  continuous improvement of the efficiency of processes in Trimo company and in the Trimo Group. Integrated management system We are aware that quality of operations, responsible environmental management and care for the safety and health of employees are key elements in the management of an efficient integrated system of quality management that is based on the requirements of the standards ISO 9001:2008, ISO 14001:2004 and OHSAS 18001:2007. 39 We understand and implement the integrated management system as a system of mutually connected processes with the help of which we realise Trimo's ambition and development guidelines. Key processes form a chain of values, whereas their successful operation is enabled by support and management processes. Trimo's process model is schematically presented by the figure below. Figure 21: Trimo's process model With constant supervision, measurement and analysing of processes, we are focused on achieving results and assessing their successfulness and efficiency with the aim to develop and constantly improve them in order to increase the satisfaction of all stakeholders. Product certification Certified products are an important part of the sales process, since customers recognise the advantage of Trimo's quality products. Trimo has one of the most comprehensive networks of certificates and sales permits in its market segment. We have more than 1,500 certificates and sales and technical permissions for our products and solutions in 23 countries all around the world. The majority of our products are manufactured, tested, controlled and marketed in compliance with harmonised standards and technical approvals, such as EN 14509:2013, EN 14782:2006, EN 1090-1, STS-10/0015 and STS-11/0023. Trimo also holds the most important quality labels such as FMA or LPCB and SBSC, which meet the highest demands made by insurance companies for the most demanding projects by following stringent requirements of independent quality control and monitoring. In the area of quality 40 development, we are actively involved with the professional association Panels and Profiles Association Europe (PPA)24. In 2015, in the field of certification, we continued the certification process for the Trimoterm Power S and T as well as Qbiss One Power S and T product families with improved characteristics, and we acquired additional classifications of fire resistance. The acquisition of the DTA certificate in France for Qbiss One Power T is very important as well as the extension of the certificate for Trimoterm panels. Within the tests for the French market, we also performed tests that prove that the panels are suitable for construction in earthquake areas. Furthermore, we acquired the certificate regarding fire growth according to the LPS 1181:2 standard for the English market, which proves that Trimoterm and Qbiss One panels do not spread fire in case there is one. We performed a test for Trimoterm panels with which we proved the anti-theft characteristics of the panels. In the field of the certification of Qbiss Air products, we performed mechanical tests and air-tightness and water-tightness tests for the Wergelansveinen project. In 2015, we continued with the procedure for the acquisition of the BREEAM certificate that is required in the market of Great Britain. For the areas of Russia and Kazakhstan, we performed tests for fire-resistance and extended hygiene certificates for Trimoterm and Qbiss One panels, and by doing so we obtained relevant attestation documentation for selling Trimoterm and Qbiss One products on this market. We carried out the test of fire resistance for the Trimoterm FTV 120, SNV 100 and Qbiss One 120 panels. For the production in Serbia, we carried out the tests of fire-resistance for FTPi panels and the tests for SNPi panels with which we proved that the panels do not spread fire from the outside. We also extended the certificate on the compliance of panels for the Serbian market. In 2015, Trimo was not aware of any complaints concerning disregarding rules or concerning codes on product and service information or marking. Management of the system of management, products, services With continuous supervision over process operations and measurement of products in all phases of their production, we provide a suitable basis for proving the capability of processes, compliance of products and assessment of business performance of the whole Group. At defined control points, we regularly check if the requirements of customers, regulations, owners, employees and other interested publics are fulfilled. 24 For more, go to: http://www.epaq.eu 41 Continuous improvement We systematically recognise examples of good practice and implement them in our processes and management systems. We actively involve all employees in the process of improvement, and we encourage innovative thinking and the creativity of each individual, so that they give suggestions for improvements in their own working environment or that they actively join in the implementation of the improvement of a wider working field through team work. We systematically manage the mass improvement system through the procedure for the improvement of employees who support Trimo's values for employee growth and development as well as the efficiency of our operations with their work. For each process, there is monitoring of suitable efficiency and performance indicators established. The improvement indicators are integrated into the system of planning and monitoring of business performance, which ensures their regular monitoring. We manage the continuous improvement and optimisation of processes in accordance with the lean process management philosophy. In 2015, we paid special attention to efficient process management, with an emphasis on:  increase of productivity and efficiency of the operation of order realisation processes,  the development of technologies and solutions for continuous improvement and achievement of high quality of products and services,  efficient preventive maintenance and shortening of the times of the change of lots for optimisation of the utilisation of production lines,  the reduction of costs of poor quality in all segments of our operation,  the efficiency of logistic processes and the utilisation of space capacities,  the optimisation of the supply of materials, products and services,  a clean and safe working environment,  the authorisation, informing and development of employee competencies for an increase of flexibility and development of a learning organisation. In the first half of the year, we upgraded the system for the improvement of workplace organisation with the 5S method. Together with supervisors, we check and recognise improvement opportunities for workplaces with higher risks in the field of safety and environment on a weekly basis. With suitable daily activities, ideas and better solutions, employees improve the quality of products and services and health and safety at work, and they more efficiently manage environmental aspects and resources, which they manage with due diligence. 42 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Responsibility towards employees Having competent, motivated and responsible employees is vital for the development and success of Trimo company and the Trimo Group. The employees' energy and loyalty are a guarantee for longterm, successful operation of the company and the Group. The guidelines in the area of staff acquisition and development are as follows:  the employment and competency development of employees for successful operation in the global environment as well as the fulfilment of the strategic goals of the company,  efficient connection between staff and strategic goals of the Trimo Group,  the employment and development of senior management staff with internationally comparable knowledge and relevant experience,  the cultivation of the appropriate climate and culture of employees. Key indicators for 2015 Trimo Trimo Group Number of employees as at 31.12.2015 347 763 Change in the number of employees in 2015 -17 -25 Fluctuation 6% 11 % Sick leave 4.4 % 4.1 % The proportion of female employees 29 % 31 % The proportion of permanent employees 97 % 93 % Trimo's operations are guided by values based on high ethical standards, respecting human rights25 and treating each individual as a free-thinking person. In that way, every person can express their full potential in accordance with their capabilities and interests. 25 We are members and co-founders of the Slovenian United Nations Global Compact (UNGC). 43 Fluctuation of the number of employees for Trimo company and the Trimo Group Figure 22: Fluctuation of average annual number of employees for Trimo company and the Trimo Group Employee distribution and categorisation and education structure The personnel structure for employees is adapted to the strategic needs of the company. In 2015, the company mostly employed people in international sales, and it reduced the number of employees in administration and processes where activities were reduced due to adaptation to the volume of business. In 2015, there were 350 employees on average in the parent company, whereas there were 767 employees in the entire Group. In 2015, the average number of employees in the parent company decreased by 8 percent in comparison to the year before and in the Group by 7 percent, which is the result of adaptation to the reduced volume of business in individual companies and process optimisation within companies. Trimo reduced the number of employees using soft methods such as retirement, fixed-term employment, consensual termination and termination for business reasons. At the end of 2015, 97 percent of employees had contracts for an indefinite period in the parent company Trimo. In Trimo, fixed-term employees have the same employment relationship rights as employees with contracts for an indefinite period, except for the possibility of supplementary pension insurance. In company Trimo, 71 percent of employees are men and 29 percent are women. The ratio of employees in the Trimo Group is similar. In 2015, the fluctuation in Trimo was 6 percent, which means that it decreased by 6.6 percentage points in comparison to 2014. The main reason was the rebound in business. Employees of the Trimo Group have the same rights as employees at Trimo company with regard to local labour legislation. In 2015, the average age of employees in Trimo company was forty-four. We expect that the average age will increase in the coming years, in particular because of the trend of raising the retirement age. At the end of 2015, 48 percent of Trimo employees had a level six education or higher. The Group employs people with comparable levels of education and vocational groups. 44 Competencies and development of employees Employee competencies are systematically upgraded in accordance with the strategic directions of the Trimo Group and the established needs of employees for managing processes in the demanding international environment. The competencies model, which we updated in 2014, consists of 24 competencies, the first assessment of which was performed in 2015. The analytics of the model enable us to monitor the potential of employees as well as their leadership competencies, performance and commitment to company values. We connected the competencies model with the new remuneration system, with which we additionally encourage the interest and responsibility of employees for the relevant competency. In 2015, 66 percent of employees were included in the trainings. There were 13.5 hours of training on average. Employees were trained in various professional fields (6.8 hours on average) and in the fields of quality (2.8 hours on average), health and personal growth as well as foreign languages and management. For the staff of our sales net, we organised the sales net meeting and several individual introduction trainings for new employees. Employee remuneration and motivation The employee remuneration system monitors results achieved – i.e. the contribution of an employee to the added value and successful operation of the company. Tariff classes of the collective labour agreement are considered when assessing the ratios for starting salaries. There is no differentiation between men and women in salaries. In 2015, we updated the remuneration system for employee performance and we prepared three models of remuneration. The remuneration model for management employees, the remuneration model for sales staff and the remuneration model for other staff, connected with the range, quality, efficiency, relationship, innovation and competency of the employee. We also reward employees with the possibility of promotion on the basis of determined and measurable criteria as well as in a non-material way through praise and recognition; we organise joint events for employees, former employees and children of employees. Occupational health and safety The health of employees is an important area to which we pay much attention by implementing various activities for improving work conditions. In the Trimo Group, we ensure a safe and regulated work environment to all stakeholders. Every company in the Group is committed to ensuring the necessary resources (personnel, finance, etc.) for the operation of a health and safety at work system and to prevent the risk of injuries and health problems. Sick leave In 2015, average total sick leave in Trimo was 4.4 percent, a decrease of 0.34 percentage points compared with the previous year. Average total sick leave on the level of the Trimo Group in 2015 was 4.1 percent. 45 Safety of the employees In the Trimo Group, we provide for the safety and health of employees through risk management, improvement of work conditions, training and education in the workplace, technical, organisational and preventive measures, supervision over the following of rules on safety and health at work and measures to reduce or prevent work related injuries. Trimo’s environment and security policy26 recognises a clear commitment to a healthy and safe working environment, which is also expressed in the declaration on health and safety at work. Trimo also implements a health and safety at work programme using a systematic and transparent method in accordance with the principles of the OHSAS 18001 standard.27 The programme for 2015 was dedicated to the prevention of the risk of work related accidents and a healthier lifestyle of employees. Among important indicators of successfulness in providing safety and health at work, we also monitor indicators of the frequency of injuries and sick leave due to work related accidents. Safety indicators Figure 23: Targets and achievements of key safety indicators Calculation of the indicator Target Achieved frequency of injury28 [injuries/million working hours] < 12 5.6 severity of injury [lost days/injury] < 15 17.2 sick leave29 [lost hours/working hours] < 0.20 % 0.06 %30 In 2015, all indicators are significantly lower in comparison to 2014. The comparison of the indicators of the number of work related injuries per 1000 employees in Trimo with the indicators of two branches of industry in Slovenia shows that the safety indicators in Trimo are lower in comparison to those of the mentioned branches. The Trimo Group will continue to pay great attention to the field of the management of risks of safety and health at work. Technical measures and the development of safe technologies will be given priority over the measures that require the use of protective equipment. In all production companies, we will increase awareness of safe work and healthy working conditions through education and practical training for employees. Care for the health of employees is part of Trimo's safety policy. 26 Environmental and safety policy is available on the Trimo website under Sustainable development. 27 Trimo introduced it in 2003 and it is integrated into the system of the company’s Procedure Manual. 28 The frequency of injuries is calculated on the basis of all hours. 29 Sick leave is calculated on the basis of all hours. 30 Only absence due to work related accidents is considered without accidents during arrival/departure from work or outside work. 46 Communication with employees In 2015, we openly and regularly informed the employees about the circumstances and operations of the company and the Trimo Group through the internet information newsletter Trimoinformator, Trimoinformer, intranet, Trimonet, internal magazine Trimotim and the workers' meeting. Relationship between staff and the Board of Directors Employees can state their opinions and points of view directly to the managers at regular meetings and annual interviews. The trade union SKEI operates within Trimo and on 31 December 2015 it included 23 percent of all employees and an 11-member works council. Two staff representatives are also members of the Supervisory Board. Employees can communicate their opinions through them and give proposals regarding their position at Trimo. Good dialogue has been established between the Board of Directors of Trimo, the trade union and the works council. At meetings, the Board of Directors informs employees about current events, important changes in operation and measures concerning employees. Representatives of both bodies inform the Board of Directors about their positions and proposals for improving work conditions and ensuring staff rights in accordance with labour legislation. Responsibility towards investors Shareholder relationships and dividend policy The basic goal of Trimo is to maximise the company's value and performance for the benefit of all stakeholders, including for the benefit of shareholders and investors. Responsible behaviour is reflected in the achievement of business goals, suitable transparency and communication with investors. At the 27th regular general meeting, on 21 July 2015, the shareholders were informed of the annual report for 2014, and they did not adopt any resolutions in relation to the distribution of dividends. 47 Responsibility towards customers The Trimo Group acknowledges that a satisfied customer is an important factor of success, therefore our activities are aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and realising their wishes. The system of complete customer relationship management has been regularly upgraded for 15 years. We create relations with them and build long-term partnerships. We provide our customers with complete solutions, which means not only a wide range of products and services for the customer but also a specific business model that enables Trimo to offer its customers solutions across the entire spectrum of services from generating and searching for ideas, development, design and technical support to production, assembly and service. Technical advice and support as well as the quality of Trimo's products are key parts of Trimo's strategy for complete solutions and key factors of success. The quality of Trimo's products and services is confirmed by more than 1,500 certificates in 23 countries. If necessary, we also provide project certificates or assist our customers in obtaining other necessary certificates. Communicating with customers We nurture relations with strategic customers, architects, investors and contractors through business meetings and presentations that aim to educate. By organising trainings throughout the year and through regular annual meetings, we develop mutual relations and increase the satisfaction of key target groups. The Trimo Group acknowledges that market communication activities aimed at goals are vital for achieving the company’s business goals. In 2015, market communication helped strengthen and raise brand awareness and reputation, ensuring faster market penetration of new products and services and supporting Trimo's sales and other activities. Trimo's exhibition space at the fair BAU 2015 in Munich 48 In 2015, we performed the following activities:  We participated at the BAU 2015 fair, which is regarded as the largest fair dealing with architecture, materials and systems in construction. There, we presented Qbiss Air – a glass curtain wall façade system of structural appearance and Qbiss One a prefabricated modular façade system.  We exhibited at the largest construction fair in the Russian-speaking area MosBuild.  We organised the international competition ArtMe Façade Design Challenge, which encourages the development of creative solutions for building envelopes.  In cooperation with the Faculty of Design, we organised the workshop European Green office – EGO, where students designed workspaces using Trimo's products while considering the principles of management, execution and modern green EU recommendations.  We organised business and professional presentations in the markets as well as trainings for target public groups, such as architects, project designers, investors and installers.  We participated in specialised fairs and conferences in the field of construction and architecture.  We published expert articles and advertisements in various specialised media in the field of construction and architecture.  We strengthened our presence on the internet by upgrading the content on our corporate website as well as our regional and product websites.

Trimo respects the laws, standards and voluntary codes regarding market communication, including advertising, promotion and sponsorships. There were no violations of these. Trimo has not received any complaints on violations regarding customer privacy and loss of customer information. Trimo has not been imposed with fines for breaching laws and regulations regarding product and service supply and use. Technical support and advice With its technical support, Trimo provides the following key services as part of a complete offer for customers:  individual technical support for customers, architects and other stakeholders as well as decision-makers in all phases of the sales process (from the ideal concept to project completion),  proactive involvement in projects, meeting market needs with technical proposals and solutions as well as adjustment to changes in the markets,  specialised trainings of all target groups,  BIM (Building Information Modelling), a tool for the Qbiss One modular façade system with which we give support to all decision-makers in the process of project design and construction, especially architects in innovative BIM processes in the field of construction and architecture,  the graphical presentation of products, the preparation of conceptual architectural solutions and the preparation of the analyses of static stability and building physics. 49 Customer satisfaction We have been measuring customer satisfaction, according to key groups, for several years, namely for the largest customers, architects and project designers. Trimo knows that satisfied and loyal customers are not just long-term partners – they also provide word-of-mouth marketing. Trimo performs activities to improve satisfaction based on analyses of satisfaction measurements and personal interviews with customers as well as creates increased added value for customers through the process of improvements. Figure 24: Customer satisfaction with the Trimo brand by year The general assessment of customers for 2013 and 2014 is slightly worse than in previous years due to the financial circumstances in the company, whereas in 2015 it improved significantly based on the stabilisation of operations. Almost 90 percent of customers assessed business cooperation as excellent or good, and nobody assessed it as poor or very poor. As the key advantage of business cooperation with Trimo, apart from the certificates that we acquired, customers indicated product quality. They also evaluated the professionalism and responsiveness of the Trimo sales teams as good. 50 Responsibility towards suppliers We build strong relationships and long-term partnerships with our suppliers. We expect our suppliers to join us in meeting the highest standards of materials and services expected by the market with the purpose of optimisation and minimisation of the risks of the supply chain and on time supply. Together with them, we are committed to complete provision of quality with an emphasis on timely and complete supply. We value suppliers who understand and share our challenges and who help us find the best solutions. In cooperation with our strategic suppliers, we strive to improve technical, functional and aesthetic characteristics of our existing products. Long-term cooperation with key strategic suppliers is directed towards:  the development of new materials, technologies and processes,  the development of a joint marketing approach in order to strengthen the market position,  strategic joint activities with the suppliers in order to shorten the delivery periods,  continuous improvement of functionality to ensure the best solutions for the customer. We regularly carry out development and education round tables, joint workshops and presentations of new materials and systems in various research and development areas, both with existing and potential suppliers. We continue to upgrade e-commerce with the suppliers who have not yet been included in this type of operation. In 2015, we improved the technical, functional and aesthetic qualities of the existing products with our strategic suppliers. We focused activities on improving the characteristics of materials, especially mineral wool, optimisation of materials and searching for new sheet metals. Together with suppliers, we pursued solutions and rationalised manufacturing and assembly processes with a project-based approach. Responsibility towards social environment Trimo is aware of its responsibility towards the social environment, which is evident in the various forms of cooperation with the local environment and outside the local environment. With sponsorships and donations, we make the operation of various non-profit organisations and associations possible. In this way, we encourage sports and education, carry out humanitarian activities, strengthen cultural creativity and support youth projects. We also cooperate with the Pensioners' Organisation and organise meetings with former employees. Thus, we are contributing to the improvement of the quality of life and to development of the social environment. In 2015, Trimo allocated 78,272 EUR or 0.1 percent of realised sales revenue for sponsorships and donations, the largest share being allocated to the Trimo Trebnje handball club. The Trimo Trebnje handball club is an incubator for young talent. At the moment, a record number of children, 185, regularly train at the club. 90 percent of the players in the member team are from the hometown. Six former members of the club played for the national teams of Slovenia, Croatia, Belarus and Macedonia at the last world championship. 51 Responsibility towards natural environment The commitment to sustainable development is one of the foundations of Trimo's organisational culture and mission. We realise our strategy through the implementation of the model of green business, such as developing environment-friendly and people-friendly products and technologies, introducing the cradle to cradle principle (C2C) and developing highly energy efficient building envelope systems. We define sustainable development as achieving a balance between long-term commercial, social and ecological interests and develop it in accordance with our values and with the help of Trimo's key competencies and a clear vision. As members of the UNGC, we respect their 10 principles (on human rights, labour standards, environment, transparency and anti-corruption). Environmental protection The Trimo Group has committed itself to balanced sustainable development of products, technologies and processes. We develop and implement the strategy of providing complete and innovative solutions, taking into account high safety standards and the reduction of risks for all stakeholders. We introduce life cycle analysis, including degradation, of products into product development. The transfer of technologies and setting up of new production facilities is based on the criteria of European environmental legislation with minimum environmental risks. We monitor emissions and separately collect waste in all production companies. The Trimo company spreads the culture of continuous improvement and raises awareness of the importance of responsible environmental action in a local and global sense. We have an integrated business system in accordance with the ISO 14001 standard in Trimo and Akripol. Trimo's offer of complete solutions also includes the option and implementation of environmentallyfriendly solutions that contribute to the added value for the customer and to sustainable development in the broader sense. Trimo's products and services are focused on energy efficiency, fire protection, noise protection and airtight solutions. Trimo's key products are at least 98 percent recyclable. Trimo's field of the environmental management system is led by the authorised person of the management who is responsible for the development of the whole field and the implementation of the sustainable development strategy. The most important elements of this strategy are waste reduction, the introduction of full recycling approaches or an approach that leads to the ‘cradle to cradle’ concept, rational use of natural resources, the use of renewable energy resources and the development of products and technologies that are in balance with natural processes. Important activities and achievements of the management of the environmental management system in Trimo in 2015 are:  large share of recyclable waste and handing over in the form of secondary or primary raw materials (97.1 percent of all waste),  revision of the Plan for the management of packaging and packaging waste,  around 55 thousand tons of materials were purchased for production needs,  other periodic activities (monitoring of emissions, inspection of active fire protection systems, employee training...). 52 Emergency preparedness Trimo carries out measures of risk management in the field of environmental protection such as fire, spill and explosion. In 2015, we had two minor incidents without negative impact on the environment and without injured employees. Waste management We pay a lot of attention to the waste management system, especially at the site where the waste occurs. We constantly upgrade the waste management system through the system of employee training and informing and through supervision and implementation of improvements. Municipal waste Reducing municipal waste represents a constituent part of Trimo's waste management programme. The share of municipal waste represents a little over two percent of the total waste of the company, whereas this share was 15 percent ten years ago. Secondary waste The relative share of waste intended for recycling in the form of secondary raw materials at Trimo has become relatively steady over the past years after increasing for several years, as the waste management programme is implemented consistently; constant improvements also positively contribute to the results. Dangerous waste Dangerous waste is collected in a controlled environment and handed over to authorised processors or collectors that hold concessions for this type of service. The amounts of dangerous waste are relatively low at Trimo and represent around 0.5 percent of all waste. Water use The environmental protection programme includes caring for the rational use of natural resources drinking water being the most important. We use water mostly for sanitary needs and our own kitchen. Processing water is not used during the production of panels, whereas on the Qbiss Air production line a minimal quantity of water is used. All waste water goes to the public central wastewater treatment plant Trebnje. Energy products consumption The most important energy products for Trimo are electricity and heating gas oil (HGO). The Trimo Group also uses other energy sources as shown in the table below. Figure 25: Energy products consumption in production companies of the Trimo Group Trimo d.d. Trimo VSK Trimo Inženjering Electricity X X X HGO X Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) X X Natural gas (NG) X Diesel fuel X X X 53 Electricity consumption is also an important environmental consideration at Trimo. It includes the electricity consumption for production processes, ventilation, air conditioning and heating and lighting. In 2015, the consumption was higher in comparison to the previous year due to increased production. Trimo's two solar power plants operated the whole year, generating about 60,000 kWh of green electricity. Impact on the environment By implementing careful natural resource and energy product management and measures for reducing the indirect impact on the level of emissions, we provide minimum impact on the environment. We monitor CO2 emissions occurring from the activities in the production factory on the basis of energy product use. In 2015, the total emissions increased due to increased production and, consequently, due to the increase in energy products consumption. We regularly monitor the emissions of combustion plants and other sources of emissions. We ensure minimal noise emissions into the environment with built-in technology and set anti-noise protection. All the measured results of the emissions and noise in the environment are below the prescribed legal limit values. We perform regular supervision over the use of paints and solvents for the VOC emissions from the varnishing machines for painting steel structures. We also take care of proper proportions between solvents and dry matter so that we do not exceed the quantities of allowed emissions. Figure 26: Absolute CO2 (kg) emissions – operation of Trimo by year 54 FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE TRIMO COMPANY FINANCIAL REPORT Financial report of Trimo Fundamental accounting assumptions and policies used in the preparation of the financial report Basis for the preparation of financial statements The Financial Statements and the notes thereto have been compiled in accordance with the Slovenian Accounting Standards (2006) and the applicable amendments and in compliance with the Companies Act (ZGD-1) and the provisions of the Trimo Rules on Accounting adopted on 1 January 2012. The following basic accounting assumptions were considered: accrual basis and going concern. The financial statements have been rounded to the nearest euro. Due to rounding of data, calculation differences may occur when adding. They have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, while fair value is considered in the following financial assets and liabilities: land, buildings, important production lines, investment property. In compiling the financial statements, the Board of Directors submits assessments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies, the stated amounts of assets and the liabilities, revenues and expenses. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making assessments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Assessments and the stated assumptions need to be checked continuously. Adjustments to accounting estimates are recognised only for the period in which the estimate is adjusted if the adjustment affects only that period. They may be recognised for the period of the adjustment and future years if the adjustment affects both current and future years. In disclosing individual items in the annual report, the company follows the principle of materiality and assesses whether each disclosure to the financial statements significantly influences the decisions of both internal and external users of financial statements. The management adopted the Annual Report of the company Trimo on 11 July 2016. Changes in accounting policies In the period from January to December 2015, the company did not make any changes to its accounting policies. Corrections of mistakes The mistakes that occur during recognition, measurement, presentation or disclosure of the elements of financial statements in the current year, and that are discovered in that period, are corrected before the financial statements are approved for publication. Foreign exchange rate and conversion into local currency Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were converted into euros in accordance with the ECB's reference rate on 31 December 2015. 55 Exposure to risks and risk management Currency risk Currency risk represents a risk of fluctuation in the value of financial instruments due to foreign exchange rate changes. To ensure protection against currency risks, the company uses currency clauses, the calculation of selling prices and regulation of assets and sources of assets in the same currency. In the period from January to December 2015, the company did not ensure protection against currency risk by purchasing currency options. Interest rate risk Interest risk means the risk of fluctuation in the value of a financial instrument due to a change in market interest rates and higher interest rates on the money and capital market. Credit risk Credit risk represents a risk arising when a client involved in an agreement, regarding a financial instrument, fails to fulfil their obligations, thereby causing the company financial loss. Insurance instruments used by the company for the insurance of credit risk are: insurance of foreign receivables with SID31 PKZ, up-to date recovery of receivables, advances paid by customers and the use of bank guarantees and documented letters of credit. Larger receivables are insured with a guarantee or bill of exchange, with authorisation to the bank for their realisation. Insolvency risk Insolvency risk is the risk of the company running into difficulties when collecting financial assets necessary for the realisation of financial obligations. The company actively manages insolvency risk with basic tools used for the regulation of insolvency risks: cash-flow planning, regulation of the maturity of assets and liabilities, spread of sources of financing, regular payment of receivables. Balance Sheet Intangible assets and long-term deferred costs and accrued revenue Internally generated brands, publication titles, customer lists and items similar in substance shall not be recognised as intangible assets except in the case of a transaction (acquisition of the company). Expenditure in research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense when incurred. Expenditure in development activities where research results are used in planning and designing the production of new or substantially improved products and processes is recognised under intangible assets if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, if there is an intention and ability to complete the project and then use or sell it and expect economic benefits from the project, if the company has sufficient resources to complete development and if it is able to measure reliably the cost during development. The recognised expenditure incurred includes not only the costs caused by its production and indirect costs that can be attributed to it and recognised by the market but also the cost of borrowing in relation to its acquisition. Other expenditure incurred is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense when incurred. The useful life is equal to the period of expected future sales related to the project. 31 Slovenian Export Corporation 56 On initial recognition, an intangible asset is measured at cost. After initial recognition, the company monitors intangible assets according to the cost model, whereby its cost is decreased by any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are classified as those with finite useful lives. The carrying amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reduced by depreciation and impairments, if there are reasons for this. Depreciation of intangible assets begins to be calculated when the asset is available for use. The adequacy of the depreciation period and the depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Any adjustments necessary are accounted as a change in an accounting estimate. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, beginning the following day when the asset is available for use. The depreciation rate used was 10 percent for the brand name, patents and long-term deferred development costs. The depreciation rate for other property rights is from 10 to 50 percent. In the context of long-term differed development costs, we recognise the following costs recorded in suitable cost documents (development orders): material, labour costs and the costs of external services. Tangible fixed assets An item of tangible fixed assets (property, plant and equipment) that qualifies for recognition as an asset is on initial recognition measured at its cost. The acquisition cost comprises the asset's purchase price, non-refundable purchase taxes, directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the condition necessary for the intended use and the estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. For subsequent measurement of land, buildings and important production lines, the company uses the revaluation model. The individual groups of tangible fixed assets are carried at fair value reduced by the accumulated depreciation value adjustment and impairment losses. The increase in fair value of a group of tangible assets is recognised in equity as a revaluation surplus unless the previous decrease in fair value was recognised in the Income Statement. The decrease in fair value of a group of tangible fixed assets is recognised in the Income Statement upon prior elimination of the revaluation surplus established in equity. Revaluation is performed periodically (usually every three years) so that the carrying amount does not differ significantly from the fair value. Part of the revaluation surplus is realised if the asset is used in the company, while each year a transfer from the revaluation surplus to retained net profit is made, equalling the higher depreciation, without including it in the Income Statement. For subsequent measurement of other production equipment and other items that are recorded as tangible fixed assets, the company uses the cost model. Tangible fixed assets are carried at historical cost reduced by the accumulated depreciation value adjustment and impairment losses. If the acquisition price of an item of tangible fixed assets is high, it is distributed among its significant parts that may have different useful lives, and the company depreciates separately each such part. Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of each item of tangible fixed assets. Land does not depreciate. Depreciation of a tangible fixed asset begins on the first day of the following month when the asset is available for use. The adequacy of the depreciation period and the depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Any adjustments necessary are accounted as a change in an accounting estimate. The estimated useful lives are the following (in terms of priority): 57  Buildings: from 15 to 33.33 years  Production equipment: 10 years  Motor vehicles: 5 years  Computers: 2 years  Other equipment: from 5 to 10 years The difference between the sales value, decreased by the cost of sale, and carrying amount of a disposed tangible fixed asset is transferred to operating revenue from revaluation if the former is higher than the latter and to operating expenses from revaluation if the latter is higher than the former. Upon the disposal of a revalued asset, the difference between its fair value, decreased by the cost of sale, and last carrying amount must be corrected for the revaluation surplus connected to this asset. Leases, in terms of which the company assumes substantially all major risks and benefits of ownership, are classified as financial leases. The assets under a financial lease are stated separately from other assets of the same type. The projected costs of high-value repairs are treated as part of tangible fixed assets and depreciated at the rate that allows for the estimated amount to be recovered by the time the costs of high-value repairs actually incur. Costs that increase tangible fixed assets' future benefits or extend their useful life increase their acquisition price. All other costs are recognised in the Income Statement under expenses as incurred. Borrowing costs are recognised as expenses when incurred. Items of small tools whose individual acquisition price does not exceed 500 euros are classified as materials. Investment property Investment property is held to earn rental revenue, increase the long-term investment value or both. At the beginning, the investment property is carried at cost, and transaction costs are included in the amount of cost. For subsequent measurement of investment property, the revaluation model is used, with investment property being recognised at its fair value. Changes in fair value of investment property are recognised as other expenses or revenue in respect of investment property. Investment property does not depreciate. Impairment of long-term assets other than financial investments At each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indications exist, the company must assess the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is considered the fair value, decreased by costs of sale or value upon use, depending on which amount is higher. Assessing the value in use comprises assessing receipts and disbursements arising from the further use of the asset and its final disposal and applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows. Value in use may also be established for a cashgenerating unit, which is the minimum identifiable group of assets, the continued use of which is a source of future cash receipts, predominantly independent of cash receipts from other assets or asset groups. Its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount only if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. This reduction is treated as impairment loss. Any impairment loss measured under the cost model is recognised in the Income Statement. Any impairment loss measured 58 under the revaluation model is debited directly to each revaluation surplus before the difference is recognised in the Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised for an item in prior periods are reversed if, and only if, the assessment applied to determine the recoverable amount of that item changed after the recognition of the last impairment loss. In such a case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss. The increased carrying amount of an asset due to a reversal of the impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years unless such increase resulted from revaluation. Any reversal of the impairment loss measured under the cost model is recognised in the Income Statement. Any reversal of the impairment loss measured under the revaluation model is attributed directly to the revaluation surplus. If the impairment loss of the same revalued asset was recognised in the Income Statement, the reversal of such an impairment loss shall also be recognised in the Income Statement. Financial investments In accordance with the SAS, the company classifies long-term and short-term financial investments into four groups of financial investments: 1st group: financial investments designated at fair value through the Income Statement (we do not recognise them on 31. December 2015) 2nd group: held-to-maturity investments (we do not recognise them on 31. December 2015) 3rd group: loans and receivables 4th group: available-for-sale investments Investments in non-negotiable securities or shares are classified in the fourth group. At the end of the financial year, if this is allowed and appropriate, the company appropriately reclassifies individual long-term and short-term financial investments into a different group. For financial investments classified in any of the four groups, the trade date is consistently used. Upon recognition, the financial investment is measured at cost. In the case of a financial investment measured at amortised cost and a financial investment measured at fair value through the revaluation surplus and a financial investment measured at cost, the fair value is supplemented by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial investment. The valuation of financial investments depends on which group an individual investment is classified into. Financial investments classified into the 1st and 4th groups are valued at fair value. Fair value is based on market value (average share price, published daily value of a mutual fund unit, a single bond price, ...). A change in the fair value of financial investments in the 1st group is recognised in the Income Statement as financial revenue or expense. A change in the fair value of financial investments in the 4th group is recognised under revaluation surplus. Financial revenue resulting from the elimination of the revaluation surplus for financial investments in the 4th group is recognised upon the sale of the financial investment or its derecognition. Financial investments classified into the 2nd and 3rd groups are valued at amortised cost. Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial investment is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the depreciation of the discount or premium (using the effective interest method) and less any possible impairments. 59 Financial investments in non-negotiable securities classified in the fourth group are measured at cost. Financial investments in subsidiary companies are measured at cost. A financial investment is derecognised when the contractual rights expire to receive cash flows from the said investment. At each reporting date, the company assesses whether there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial investment. If any such evidence exists, it must be assessed to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Losses resulting from revaluation from impairment, which could not be settled with the revaluation surplus, are recognised as a financial expense in the Income Statement. For financial investments measured at cost and when assessing whether they need to be impaired the company complies with the provisions of Note 1 to SAS 3, according to which the impairment test should be performed if the value of the financial investment exceeds the associated capital by more than 20%. In the case of financial investments held to maturity and loans and receivables that are carried at amortised cost, the impairment loss is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Impairment losses are reversed through profit or loss. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not yet been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate of a financial asset (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). Impairment losses that are recognised for the available-for-sale financial investments measured at cost cannot be eliminated. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the financial asset's carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Impairment losses recognised for a financial investment in an equity instrument classified as available for sale cannot be reversed through profit or loss. If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the profit or loss, it is necessary to reverse the impairment loss through the profit or loss as financial revenue. The amount of losses on available-for-sale financial investments at fair value are measured as the difference between the acquisition price and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the profit or loss. Inventories Inventories are assets in tangible form that will be used for the creation of products or performance of services or be sold in the ordinary course of business. The company disclosed the following types of inventories:  materials and small tools,  work in progress and semi-finished products,  finished products,  merchandise. The company monitors in the general ledger the following materials: raw materials, auxiliary materials, material under processing, non-invoiced material, small tools with a lifetime of up to one year and merchandise. Records on purchase, use, persons responsible for small tool inventory and write-offs are also kept. The company recognises quantity units of the inventories of materials and merchandise at cost, which includes the purchase price, import duties, purchase taxes and direct acquisition costs. The purchase price is decreased by the amount of approved discounts. 60 Direct acquisition costs are: transportation costs, costs of loading and unloading, transport insurance and agency costs. In disclosing the inventories of materials and merchandise, the company uses the average cost method. Inventories of materials transferred to processing are shown among inventories through special records and upon their return from processing their disclosed values are then increased by the costs related to their processing. Quantity units of products or work in progress are shown at reduced own prices. The reduced own price includes production costs in the narrow sense, indirect costs of purchase and sales and general administration but not, however, direct costs of sale and costs of borrowing. In stating inventories of work in progress and products, the method of standard prices with the corresponding variances is used. Inventories of materials are not revalued for value strengthening, nor are work in progress or the inventories of products. Inventories are revalued due to impairment if the carrying amount, which includes recent purchase prices and costs in the evaluation, exceeds their market value or it is higher than the net realisable value. Decreases in the values of inventories of raw materials, materials and small tools debit the operating expenses from revaluation, while decreases in the value of work in progress inventories and inventories of products and merchandise decreases debit the related operating expenses. Inventories are revalued according to the coefficient of inventory turnover. Based on their age, the value of 1-year-old inventories is adjusted by 20 percent, the value of 2-year-old inventories by 40 percent and the value of 3-year-old inventories by 60 percent. Net realisable value of inventories of finished goods and merchandise, which is more than a year old, is considered individually. The administrator of inventories prepares an estimate of the net realisable value. Inventories of finished goods and merchandise older than one year are revalued due to impairment, if the carrying value of the inventories exceeds the estimated net realisable value. Operating receivables In terms of maturity, receivables are divided into long-term and short-term receivables. Long-term operating receivables are from issued deposits or merchant credits with maturities longer than one year and deferred security. Short-term portions of long-term operating receivables due in the next year reduce the balance of long-term commodity credits and are included in the Balance Sheet under short-term operating receivables. Short-term operating receivables are divided into short-term trade receivables (domestic and foreign), advances (advances for inventories, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets are recognised in the Balance Sheet under the category to which they relate), short-term operating receivables from operations for the account of third parties, short-term operating receivables associated with financial revenue and other short-term operating receivables. They are shown separately as receivables from subsidiary and associated companies. Receivables from group companies are classified by the individual components of the operating receivables. Receivables that are not settled within a regular maturity period are considered doubtful receivables, and if they cause judicial proceedings, they are considered disputable receivables. The term regular 61 deadline implies a deadline determined in accordance with a contract or other corresponding document. The revaluation of receivables from group companies in the Trimo Group is recorded up to the amount of negative capital. If the group companies realise negative capital, the adjustments of receivables are formed up to the amount of the negative capital. The revaluation of receivables is a change in their carrying amount. It occurs primarily in the form of revaluation of receivables due to their impairment or revaluation of receivables due to cancellation of impairment. It is performed throughout the year during the preparation of monthly financial statements on the basis of empirical corrections of value adjustments. At the end of the financial year, the state of the value adjustments of receivables is verified according to the policy on forming value adjustments of receivables described in the continuation. For receivables denominated in foreign currency and those where their exchange rate is changed after their initial recognition, or the contracting parties agreed on a revaluation to preserve their real value, reducing receivables by exchange rate differences increases financial expenses, and increasing receivables by exchange rate differences increases financial revenue. Receivables are revalued due to impairment if their carrying amounts exceed their fair values. The company assesses the need to impair receivables based on consideration of criteria for maturity or insurance of receivables that are furthermore corrected through individual evaluation. Receivables from companies that have gone bankrupt are written off at 100 percent, except when receivables from those companies are insured (in that case an adjustment equalling the uninsured part of the receivables is made) or when at least a partial repayment is possible, subject to the debtor’s assets. Adjustments are calculated according to individual receivables in accordance with the following criteria:  receivables from customers whose financial state has weakened considerably or they are in the process of compulsory composition;  receivables in judicial proceedings;  receivables from companies in bankruptcy;  receivables which are not coordinated. Subsequent write-offs of individual receivables are, based on a corresponding document, covered by forming the revaluation adjustments of receivables. Cash Cash consists of cash on hand, deposit money and cash in transit. Cash also includes cash equivalents that represent investments that can be converted into cash amounts, known in advance, quickly or in the near future, and where the risk of changes to the value is insignificant. These include short-term deposits and bank deposits and similar investments and are intended to ensure solvency. Cash is shown in the amounts denoted on the corresponding documents. Cash expressed in foreign currencies is converted to the local currency using the reference exchange rate of the European Central Bank and, for justifiable reasons, the appropriate exchange rate of a commercial bank may also be used. Exchange rate differences arising may increase or decrease the original value of cash shown, with regular financial revenue or financial expenses arising in connection with cash. Overdrafts in transaction accounts are disclosed as loans received. Equity 62 Total equity consists of:  called-up capital,  capital reserves,  profit reserves,  revaluation surplus,  retained net profit or loss,  net profit or loss for the financial year. Acquired treasury shares or business shares are deducted from equity. Upon purchase, sale, issue or cancellation, any profit or loss from the transaction is not recognised in the Income Statement and any differences are offset against equity. Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which the general meeting decides that they should be distributed. A revaluation surplus refers to preliminary recognised strengthening of assets, both of the total amount as well as off-set with future effects of asset impairments prior to them being collected. The recognised positive or negative revaluation surplus is the result of revaluation according to the revaluation model applied to tangible fixed assets. Provisions and long-term accrued costs and deferred revenue The company disclosed provisions in its Balance Sheet if it has, as the result of a past event, a present legal or indirect obligation and if it is probable that it will be required to settle the obligation through an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate. This reflects current assessments of the time value of money and, if needed, the risks specific to the liability. Effect arising from discounting is recorded as a financial expense or revenue. If a company expects with great certainty that some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision will be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset that does not exceed the amount of the provision. In this context, expenses for provisions are offset by revenue from the recognition of an asset. Provisions are reduced directly for costs or expenses for which they were made, which means that they no longer appear in the Income Statement except in the case of provisions for onerous contracts and long-term deferred revenue, the consumption of which is transferred to operating revenue in line with depreciation calculated. In compliance with the law, collective agreement and internal rules, the company is obligated to pay jubilee benefits and retirement severance to employees for which it forms long-term provisions. Other pension liabilities do not exist. Provisions are made in the amount equalling the expected amount of future jubilee benefits and severance payments, discounted as at the date of the Balance Sheet. A calculation was made for every employee, taking into account the costs of severance payments upon retirement and the costs of all projected jubilee benefits until retirement. The calculation based on a projected unit is prepared by a certified actuary. If company management estimates that in the financial year there were no events that would have a significant impact on the amount of the recognised long-term provisions for jubilee benefits and retirement severance, the state of recognised long-term provisions is changed simply because of interim jubilee benefits and severance payments. The actuarial calculation is performed at least every third financial year. 63 Provisions for onerous contract costs are recognised when the unavoidable costs of non-compliance with contractual obligations exceed the economic benefits expected on the basis of the contract. The company recognises in its financial statements the provisions for ongoing major lawsuits in terms of their amount. Every year, it verifies the eligibility of the provisions formed with regard to the status of the dispute and the likelihood of a favourable or an unfavourable outcome. The amount of provisions is determined based on the amount of the claim or the expected likely amount if the actual claim is not yet known. If the outcome of litigation is not sufficiently certain along with the amount of future outflows, it is shown as a contingent liability outside the Balance Sheet. The company forms long-term provisions with regard to issued warranties upon the sale of products and major contracts that include guarantees on the work performed, construction and roofs. Longterm provisions from contracts that include a guarantee on the work performed, construction and roofs are formed on the basis of several years of experience and actual costs related to past complaints. Long-term provisions for given warranties upon the sale of products are created in line with the percentage that the company determines on the basis of the average share of the number of complaints concerning products in relation to the production output of the last five years. Provisions are as a rule available for use for a period of three years, but no longer than up to the date when the warranty period expires. The use of provisions formed is carried out using the linear method. The amount of operating revenue calculated in the current year is defined based on this. The utilisation of these provisions decreases expenses in the current financial year in the amount of the actual identified complaints in the financial year, whereas the difference between the excess provisions is eliminated in favour of profit. Based on experience of the Quality Sector, the majority of complaints arises in the first three years after the handover of the building, which is why provisions are created for a period of three years. Liabilities Liabilities may be of a long-term, short-term, financial or operating nature. Long-term liabilities represent a liability with regard to the financing of company’s own assets whose maturities are longer than one year following their appearance or date of the Balance Sheet. Long-term liabilities are broken down into:  long-term financial liabilities that represent long-term loans acquired on the basis of loan agreements or acquired deposits and liabilities to lessors through financial leasing,  long-term operating liabilities that comprise long-term supplier credit for purchased goods or services and long-term security received. Long-term liabilities are divided into long-term liabilities to Group companies and other entities. Longterm liabilities are also classified into long-term liabilities obtained from banks and other legal and natural persons at home and abroad. Short-term liabilities are recognised liabilities connected to the financing of the company’s own assets that must be settled within a year’s time at the latest. Short-term liabilities are divided into:  financial liabilities that arise when creditors place cash into a company or pay its business events with cash,  operating liabilities that arise when suppliers place into a company elements required for production and the performance of services. 64 The company discloses short-term liabilities acquired from banks and other legal and natural persons at home and abroad separately. Liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. If significant amounts do not bear interest, they are recognised at a discounted amount, taking into consideration the average interest rate achieved by the company in comparable transactions. If the actual or agreed interest rate does not materially differ from the effective interest rate, they are recognised in the Balance Sheet at their initial recognised amounts less repayments. Short-term accruals and deferrals Short-term accruals and deferrals are receivables and other assets and liabilities that are expected to arise within a year’s time and whose occurrence is probable. Accrued revenue and deferred costs include short-term deferred costs or short-term deferred expenses and short-term accrued revenue. They are shown and classified separately by the type of accrued revenue and deferred costs. Accrued costs and deferred revenue include short-term accrued costs or expenses and short-term deferred revenue. They are shown and classified separately by the type of accrued costs and deferred revenue. Accrued costs related to engineering projects are also shown in accrued costs and deferred revenue. Costs or expenses calculated in advance arise on the basis of a uniform burdening of activities, profit and loss or inventories. Short-term deferred revenue arises if the work has not yet been performed and the costs of the services have already been invoiced or paid. Similarly, it can arise if the entitlement to the recognition of revenue in the profit or loss is doubtful at the moment of sale. Income Statement The Income Statement has been prepared according to Version I in accordance with SAS 25.5. The Income Statement represents the fundamental financial statement and gives a realistic and fair overview of the profit or loss for the current and previous financial year. The structure of items presented in the Income Statement refers to the total revenue attained in an individual financial year. Revenue Revenue represents increases in economic benefits in the accounting period in the form of increased assets or decreased liabilities. Through its effect on profit or loss, revenue influences the capital amount. Revenue is classified into operating revenue, financial revenue and other revenue. Revenue from the sale of products is recognised in the Income Statement when the company has transferred to the customer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods. Revenue from the sale of products, merchandise and materials is measured at selling prices stated in invoices or other documents, less discounts and rebates approved either when the sale is made or subsequently, including those granted for early payment. Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Income Statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the Balance Sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. No revenue is recognised if there are uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due, associated costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods. 65 Rental revenue from investment property is recognised in revenue evenly during the lease term. A government grant is initially recognised in the financial statement as deferred revenue when there is reasonable assurance that the company will comply with the conditions attached to it and receive it. Government grants received for covering costs are recognised strictly as revenue over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants associated with assets are recognised in the Income Statement strictly as other operating revenue over the useful life of that asset. Interest revenue is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues using the effective interest rate method. Dividend revenue is recognised in the Income Statement on the date when the shareholder's right to receive payment is exercised. Financial revenue in the Income Statement also includes exchange rate gains and gains on hedging instruments and other revenue derived from financial investments. Revenue from engineering projects is recognised in the Income Statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project. If, in individual projects, it is determined that the costs incurred exceed the planned costs, the estimated overall loss on the project is recognised as an expense of the accounting period. Expenses Expenses are broken down into operating, financial and other expenses. The acquisition price of goods sold includes the net invoiced value of goods sold, expenses for customs and other import duties that are levied according to the supplier's price, transportation costs, insurance costs and other associated acquisition expenses. Production costs of goods sold and cost of sales and general operations are dependent on inventory valuation methods described under Inventories. Operating expenses from revaluation arise from impairment of fixed, current assets and investment property measured at cost as well as from the loss on disposal of intangible assets, tangible fixed assets and investment properties in comparison to their carrying amount. Financial expenses comprise interest payable on loans calculated using the effective interest rate method, exchange rate losses, losses on hedging instruments and other expenses that arise from financial investments. Deferred taxes Corporate income tax for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit for the financial year, using tax rates enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in regard to previous financial years. Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except for:  goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes;  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in an event other than a merger, division, exchange of capital shares and transfer of activities and that does not affect the accounting or taxable profit; 66  differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated companies and interests in joint ventures in the amount for which it is probable that it will not be reversed in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all temporary differences, unused tax credits and tax losses in the amount for which it is probable that there will be future taxable profit available against which the said asset can be debited, except if:  the differences arise from the initially recognised assets or liabilities in an event that at the time of occurrence affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit, except in the case of receivables from business mergers, divisions, exchange of capital shares or transfer of activities;  the differences arise from financial investments in subsidiaries, branches and associated companies and interests in joint ventures, and it is not probable that the temporary differences will be reversed in the foreseeable future. When compiling the Balance Sheet, the company reassesses previously unrecognised deferred tax assets and recognises them if it is probable that future taxable profit will allow for the utilisation of deferred tax assets. The company reduces the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset if it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available. Any such reduction is reversed if it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available. Corporate income tax is disclosed in the Income Statement, except where it refers to items directly disclosed as equity, in which case it is disclosed under equity. Insignificant amounts of receivables and deferred tax liabilities are not recognised. Business and geographical segments The company does not monitor operations by business and geographical segments. 67 Financial statements as at 31 December 2015 The financial statements comprise: 

brands and property rights to land. Part of intangible assets were excluded from the use on the basis of a proposal from the Commission for fixed assets and the Commission for the inventory of fixed assets. The development costs of the products of the Qbiss One family are disclosed in deferred development costs. 77 Intangible assets in acquisition are related to the development costs of Qbiss Air products. Their capitalisation amounted to EUR 340,306 in 2015. The company discloses the lease of two pieces of land in the Republic of Serbia, the Municipality of Pečinci, for a period of 99 years, in other property rights, in the present value of EUR 5,295,772. In its financial statements in 2014, the company transferred the lease right for a period of 99 years for two pieces of land in the Republic of Serbia, the Municipality of Pečinci, to intangible fixed assets. Trimo d.d. undertook to build facilities on that land within 3 years after the conclusion of the lease contract. After the expiration of the deadline, the facilities were not yet built due to objective circumstances. In 2015, the company successfully entered in the accounts the ownership right on the part of land that was adequately recorded within tangible fixed assets. On 4 December 2015, the company submitted a request for the conversion of the lease right of the remaining part of the land into the ownership right at the real estate register of Pečinci on the basis of the change in the legislation. This part of land is still recorded as other property right. The company did not receive any feedback regarding the completion of the conversion process by the day of the preparation of the report. The company assessed the value of the leased land on the basis of the valuation of the real estate performed by a certified appraiser for real estate at the Serbian Institute for Auditors. In the event of proceedings by the lessor in the direction of attempted termination of contract, the company will exercise entitlements to reimbursement of the rest of the lease payments and past investments in that land. According to an internal calculation, the company establishes that the reimbursement by the lessor in such a case would be higher than the assessed value of real estate recorded in the statements of the company. Based on this, the company establishes that the value of the entitlement is not recorded as too high. On 29 January 2015, Trimo received a request in relation to property rights for leased land in the Republic of Serbia (the Municipality of Pečinci), sent by the Municipality of Pečinci requesting the rescission of the lease contracts concluded on 1 February 2010 and 6 December 2007, because of the breach of contractual commitments with regard to investment. Trimo was prepared to undertake consensual termination of the contract and requested that the Municipality of Pečinci reimburse the proportional part of lease payments and compensate for the increase in land value resulting from the investment of Trimo, in accordance with the law and contract provisions. A final agreement was not reached. The Board of Directors of the company estimates that it is very unlikely that the Municipality of Pečinci will request rescission of the lease contracts in the court procedure, mainly due to the obligations of the municipality to reimburse the proportional part of lease payments and reasonable and useful investments in the increase in land value. The potential dispute had not been initiated by the date of the preparation of this Annual Report. According to Article 103 of the Act on Planning and Construction of Facilities, it has to be initiated within one year after the law enters into force (the law was published on 17 December 2014). Trimo used legal options in accordance with Article 103 of the Act on Planning and Construction of Facilities and filed a request for conversion without compensation on 4 December 2015. The request has not yet been decided on. As at 31 December 2015, the company does not disclose significant commitments for the acquisition of intangible fixed assets. 78 Tangible fixed assets CHANGES IN TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS Production Other Fixed Advances devices and devices and assets in for fixed (in EUR) Land Buildings machinery equipment acquisition assets Total Acquisition price 31 December 2014 5.640.121 20.061.677 27.650.137 15.867.700 7.758 291.922 69.519.315 Adjustments 1 January 2015 5.640.121 20.061.677 27.650.137 15.867.700 7.758 291.922 69.519.315 Acquisitions 718.044 718.044 Transfer from property rights 1.139.497 1.139.497 Transfer from investments in progress 12.664 45.197 426.541 233.642 (725.802) (7.758) Transfer 291.922 (291.922) Disposals (208.960) (1.312.841) (1.521.801) Impairments (380.067) (380.067) Adjustments to fair value (97.673) (97.673) 31 December 2015 7.084.204 19.897.914 27.979.005 14.408.434 69.369.557 Accumulated value adjustment 31 December 2014 6.693.851 20.004.937 14.973.020 41.671.808 Adjustments 1 January 2015 6.693.851 20.004.937 14.973.020 41.671.808 Depreciation for the year 608.062 1.110.537 231.884 1.950.483 Disposals (82.853) (1.262.615) (1.345.468) Impairments (218.538) (218.538) Adjustments to fair value (70.551) (70.551) 31 December 2015 7.219.060 21.044.923 13.723.751 41.987.734 Carrying amount 31 December 2014 5.640.121 13.367.826 7.645.200 894.680 7.758 291.922 27.847.507 1 January 2015 5.640.121 13.367.826 7.645.200 894.680 7.758 291.922 27.847.507 31 December 2015 7.084.204 12.678.854 6.934.082 684.683 27.381.823 The acquisitions of production devices and equipment are related to production line upgrades. The acquisitions of other devices and equipment are related to the purchase of ancillary production equipment, warehouse equipment, computer equipment, passenger cars and other tools and equipment. In 2015, the entry of the ownership right on the part of the land in Serbia into the land register was performed. The company reclassified the owned part of the land, which was disclosed in long-term property rights in 2014 in the amount of EUR 1,139,497, to tangible fixed assets land. The majority of disposals is related to the sale of buildings, passenger cars, computer equipment and other ancillary production equipment. Part of the assets were excluded from use on the basis of a proposal from the Commission for fixed assets and the Commission for the inventory of fixed assets. The impairments of other devices and equipment are related to the impairments of ancillary transport equipment. In 2011, the company changed its accounting policy and revalued land, buildings and key production lines to the fair value for the purpose of financial reporting. In accordance with the Rules on accounting, the company again checked the assessment of the fair value for accounting purposes as at 31 December 2015. A certified appraiser for real estate at the Slovenian Institute of Auditors gave an opinion on the real estate value for the purpose of the assessment of real estate value for accounting purposes on 31 December 2015 with regard to the assessed value of real estate on 31 December 2014. The findings and conclusions of the opinion were that the value of the real estate assessed on 31 December 2014 would not have significantly change in the time period since the assessment and that it would be in 79 the range of +/5% from the basic assessed value in the event that a new assessment was made on 31 December 2015. The assessment of the equipment market value was prepared by a certified appraiser for the value of machines and equipment at the Slovenian Institute for Auditors for the accounting purposes as at 31 December 2015. Reconciliation of key production lines with a fair value for accounting purposes as at 31 December 2015 is reflected in the reduction of the value of key production lines by EUR 27,122. Reconciliation of key production lines for accounting purposes is reflected in the decrease of the corresponding revaluation surplus in the amount of EUR 22,512 and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of EUR 4,610. If the company evaluated land, buildings and key production lines using the cost model, the carrying amount of tangible fixed assets as at 31 December 2015 would be EUR 20,601,657. In 2015, the company did not change depreciation rates. As at 31 December 2015, the company does not disclose significant commitments for the purchase of fixed assets. The book value of the pledged land, buildings and equipment for the payment of liabilities as at 31 December 2015 equals EUR 24,757,056. The property given to the creditor as security cannot be disposed of by the company without its permission.

The tax base was also reduced for used provisions that were completely or partly unrecognized upon formation; for financial investments whose impairments were not tax deductible; for covering past tax loss; from investments in research and development, for using the relief for investment. The increase of the tax base is mostly a result of non-deductible expenses from revaluation of receivables and expenses from the impairment of financial investments. 103 Other disclosures Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the highest exposure to credit risk.

(hereinafter: EAS) based in Luxembourg. As part of the Agreement, EAS also assumed the debt of Trimo d.d. and Trimo Inženjering Serbia totalling EUR 30,713,061. In addition to the said shares and debt assumption, the Agreement covered the transfer of 11,226 shares or a 44.94% stake in Trimo MSS d.d. to EAS and the disposal of the entire interest in Akripol d.o.o. or transfer thereof from Trimo d.d. to the bank syndicate. After the completed transaction, EAS became a 97.45% owner of Trimo d.d., directly and through Trimo d.d. the owner of 99.87% of Trimo MSS d.d. and a creditor to whom EUR 30,713,061 was due. The interest in Akripol d.o.o. was completely disinvested from the Trimo Group. Disposal of the investment in Trimo VSK At the end of April, an agreement was concluded on the sale of a 51-percent equity stake of Trimo in the Russian production company Trimo VSK to Spetstamozhstroy. With this transaction Trimo d.d. fully disposed the investment in Trimo VSK. At the same time, a licence agreement was concluded on knowhow and the Trimo brand for 20 years, based on which Trimo VSK may produce, sell and put the Trimo brand label on products in the territory of Russia. Law suit regarding the land in Serbia On 20 May 2016, Trimo d.d. was served a law suit from the District Court of Novo mesto due to the termination of lease contract dated 1 February 2010 on long-term lease of the land plots 1807/1 and 1960, both c.m. Šimanovci. In the operative part of the law suit, the plaintiff requests the court to determine that the lease contract on long-term lease of 99 years dated 1 February 2010 referring to land plots 1807/1 and 1960 is terminated; the plaintiff further requests the court to find that the contract was terminated through the fault of Trimo d.d. and that once the relevant judgement becomes final, it is permitted to delete the entered lease right to the benefit of the lessee Trimo d.d. and allow the entry of state property with the right of use to the benefit of the Pećinci Municipality. Trimo d.d. in due time filed a statement of defence based on the fact that the plaintiff Pećinci Municipality has no legal interest to file suit for termination of contract dated 1 February 2010; that the plaintiff Pećinci Municipality failed to fulfil its contractual obligation, as it did not provide for utility infrastructure of the land that was the subject matter of the contract, namely: the Pećinci Municipality failed to provide utility infrastructure, sewage, electrical infrastructure and the path to the border of the plots, whereby it failed to perform the contract and is at fault for the objective cause for non-construction of the facility. Furthermore, Trimo d.d. stated that if the court finds in favour of the Pećinci Municipality, the defendant shall claim damage suffered by Trimo due to non-performance of contractual obligation by the Pećinci Municipality. Trimo would thus claim the legal right to reimbursement of the rest of the lease paid and past investments in the relevant land. According to an internal calculation, the company establishes that the reimbursement by the lessor in such a case would be higher than the assessed value of real estate recorded in the statements of the company. From the date of the consolidated financial statements up to the preparation of this Annual Report, no events occurred that would have an effect on the truthfulness and fairness of the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015 and that would require adjustment of the consolidated financial statements for 2015. 111 Contingent liabilities of the company Until the day of the conclusion of the Annual Report for 2015, the company did not recognise additional potential obligations that would have effect on the fair presentation of the financial state of the company. 112 Statement of management responsibility The Management Board confirms the financial statements of the company Trimo for the year that ended on 31 December 2015 and the accounting policies applied as well as the notes to the financial statements included in this Annual Report. The Management Board is responsible for the preparation of the Annual Report in such a way that that the Annual Report gives a true and fair view of the financial position of the company and the results of its operations in 2015. The Management Board confirms that suitable accounting policies were consistently applied and that the accounting estimates were made according to the principle of prudence and due diligence.

The Management Board is not aware of any circumstances that might give rise to any material liability arising from the above. Date: 11 July 2016 Chief Executive Officer: Maciej Radomski Chief Procurement Officer Member of Management Board: Bartosz Paweł Jurkiewicz 113 Auditor’s report 114 115 FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE TRIMO GROUP Consolidated financial statements of the Trimo Group Fundamental accounting assumptions and policies used in the preparation of the financial report Basis for the preparation of consolidated financial statements The Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto have been compiled in accordance with the Slovenian Accounting Standards (2006) and the applicable amendments and in compliance with the Companies Act (ZGD-1) and the provisions of the Trimo Group Rules on Accounting adopted on 1 January 2012. The following basic accounting assumptions were considered: accrual basis and going concern. The consolidated financial statements are compiled in euros. They have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, while the fair value is considered in the following financial assets and liabilities: land, buildings, important production lines and investment property. In compiling the consolidated financial statements, the Management of the Group submits assessments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies, the stated amounts of assets and the liabilities, revenues and expenses. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making assessments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Assessments and the stated assumptions need to be checked continuously. Adjustments to accounting estimates are recognised only for the period in which the estimate is adjusted if the adjustment affects only that period. They may be recognised for the period of the adjustment and future years if the adjustment affects both current and future years. In disclosing individual items in the consolidated annual report, the Group follows the principle of materiality and assesses whether each disclosure to the consolidated financial statements significantly influences the decisions of both internal and external users of the consolidated financial statements. The management adopted the Annual Report of the Trimo Group on 11 July 2016. Changes in accounting policies In the period from January to December 2015, the Group companies did not make any changes to their accounting policies. Foreign exchange rate and conversion into local currency Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were converted into euros in accordance with the ECB's reference rate on 31 December 2015. The items of the income statement denominated in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the average exchange rate of the ECB in 2015. Composition of the Group In addition to the controlling company, the consolidated financial statements also include the following subsidiaries:  Akripol, d.o.o., Slovenia  Trimo MSS, d.d., Slovenia  Tinde, d.o.o., Slovenia  Trimo Polska, Sp.z o.o., Poland  Trimo Inženjering, d.o.o., Serbia  Trimo UK, Ltd., Great Britain  OOO, Trimo VSK, Russia  OOO, Trimo RUS, Russia 116 Limited review of Trimo MSS and Tinde was carried out in 2015. The subsidiaries Trimo Građenje and Trimo UAE FZE were excluded from consolidation on 1 January 2015. The financial statements of other subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements have been audited. The controlling company Trimo d.d. had a long-term investment (100% equity stake) in the sales subsidiary Trimo Građenje. On 6 October 2015, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated against the company. The proceedings were finally completed on 23 October 2015. Due to the decision on initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, reasons arose for derecognition of financial investment and when the bankruptcy proceedings became final, reasons arose for derecognition of operating receivables due from Trimo Građenje according to the accounting standards. As a result of these facts, the control over the subsidiary ceased and Trimo Građenje was eliminated from consolidation. Trimo UAE is inactive, it is not operating and thus the parent company does not meet the conditions for control. The effects of elimination of Trimo Građenje and Trimo UAE FZE from consolidation (as at 1 January 2015) increase the current operating result of the Trimo Group in the amount of EUR 1,637,972. The consolidated financial statements do not include the companies CBS Inštitut, Trimo Macedonia, Akripol-S, Akripol Zagreb and Tehnopark Vyazniki (the subsidiary Trimo RUS). The volume of business of these companies does not influence the true and fair view of the operations of the Trimo Group. In January 2015, the controlling company Trimo disinvested the stake in Trimex Handelsgesellschaft m.b.h. with the sale of a 40-percent interest. When the consolidated financial statements were prepared as at 31 December 2015, the following items of receivables, liabilities, revenues and expenses were mutually set off or eliminated:  Loans to Group companies (shortand long-term) in the amount of EUR 437,375 and loans from Group companies in an equal amount. The amount of excluded financial revenues or expenses arising from loans among Group companies stood at EUR 62,046.  Intra-group receivables totalling EUR 5,517,623 and short-term advances made for inventories in the amount of EUR 220,887. Short-term intra-group operating receivables were offset against the short-term intra-group liabilities in an equal amount.  Long-term financial investments in subsidiaries of EUR 12,731,017 with the pertaining capital of controlling owners in an equal amount.  Revenues from sales among Group companies in the amount of EUR 16,133,896 were offset against the cost of goods and material sold equalling EUR 13,724,858 and the costs of services totalling EUR 2,409,038.  The depreciation charge of property, plant and equipment of EUR 14,682 arose from the gains on the sale of property, plant and equipment among Group companies in previous years (2014). 117 Assumptions for the preparation of consolidated financial statements The following assumptions were applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements:  The assumption of a uniform company; the consolidated financial statements present the assets, financial position and operating result as well as the changes in the financial position and equity of the group of companies as a single economic entity. The following procedures and effects of consolidation were taken into account: The financial investments of the controlling company in the subsidiaries were excluded from consolidation along with the relevant portion of the subsidiaries’ equity. The equity of non-controlling owners is presented up to the amount attributable to the noncontrolling interest in the Group’s equity. Intra-group operating receivables and liabilities were offset. Operating and financial revenues arising from intra-group relations are excluded from consolidated income statement, as are the attributable operating and financial expenses.  The assumption of a true and fair view of the assets and the financial position and operating result  The assumption of group completeness  The assumption of completeness of the financial statements and the uniform capture of data included therein  The assumption of same date  The assumption of consistent consolidation methods; the methods will be consistently applied from one period to the next as specified in the first consolidation. For the purpose of consistent format, the format and content were defined for individual items of the balance sheet, the income statement according to version I, the cash flow statement and the statement of changes in equity. For the purpose of consistent substance, we decided to apply equal methods and procedures in compiling the financial statements in all periods.  The assumption of clarity and transparency  The assumption of cost-efficiency  The assumption of relevance; the consolidated financial statements include Group companies and the items that are sufficiently relevant to influence the assessments and decisions of their users. Exposure to risks and risk management Currency risk Currency risk represents a risk of fluctuation in the value of financial instruments due to foreign exchange rate changes. To ensure protection against currency risks, the Group companies use currency clauses, the calculation of selling prices and regulation of assets and sources of assets in the same currency. In the period from January to December 2015, the Group companies did not ensure protection against currency risk by purchasing currency options. Interest rate risk Interest risk means the risk of fluctuation in the value of a financial instrument due to a change in market interest rates and higher interest rates on the money and capital market. We strive to limit interest rate risk by interest rate cap stipulation in loan agreements, when possible. We did not use any derivatives in the past year for this purpose. 118 Credit risk Credit risk represents a risk arising when a client involved in an agreement, regarding a financial instrument, fails to fulfil their obligations, thereby causing the Group financial loss. Insurance instruments used by the Group companies for the insurance of credit risk are: insurance of foreign receivables with SID35 PKZ, up-to date recovery of receivables, advances paid by customers and the use of bank guarantees and documented letters of credit. Larger receivables are insured with a guarantee or bill of exchange, with authorisation to the bank for their realisation. Insolvency risk Insolvency risk is the risk of the company running into difficulties when collecting financial assets necessary for the realisation of financial obligations. The Group companies actively manage insolvency risk with basic tools used for the regulation of insolvency risks: cash-flow planning, liquidity reserve, regulation of the maturity of assets and liabilities, spread of sources of financing, regular payment of receivables. Balance sheet Intangible assets and long-term deferred costs and accrued revenue Internally generated brands, publication titles, customer lists and items similar in substance shall not be recognised as intangible assets except in the case of a transaction (acquisition of the company). An investment in goodwill represents the difference between the acquisition cost of an acquiree or a part thereof in excess of the determinable fair value of the assets acquired less any debt and contingent liabilities. Expenditure in research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense when incurred. Expenditure in development activities where research results are used in planning and designing the production of new or substantially improved products and processes is recognised under intangible assets if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, if there is an intention and ability to complete the project and then use or sell it and expect economic benefits from the project, if the company has sufficient resources to complete development and if it is able to measure reliably the cost during development. The recognised expenditure incurred includes not only the costs caused by its production and indirect costs that can be attributed to it and recognised by the market but also the cost of borrowing in relation to its acquisition. Other expenditure incurred is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense when incurred. The useful life is equal to the period of expected future sales related to the project. On initial recognition, an intangible asset is measured at cost. After initial recognition, the company Group companies monitor intangible assets according to the cost model, whereby their cost is decreased by any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets are classified as those with finite useful lives and those with indefinite useful lives. The carrying amount of an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reduced by depreciation and impairments, if there are reasons for this. Depreciation of intangible fixed assets begins to be calculated when the asset is available for use. The adequacy of the depreciation period and the depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Any adjustments necessary are 35 Slovenian Export Corporation 119 accounted as a change in an accounting estimate. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis, beginning the following day in the month when the asset is available for use. The depreciation rate used was 10 percent for the brand name, patents and long-term deferred development costs. The depreciation rate for other property rights is from 10 to 50 percent. Intangible assets with indefinite useful life and goodwill of a Group company are tested for impairment at least on the balance sheet date. These assets are not subject to amortisation. The useful life is reassessed to determine whether the assets need not be treated as having finite useful life, and the effect is accounted as a change in an accounting estimate. Property, plant and equipment (Tangible fixed assets) An item of tangible fixed assets (property, plant and equipment) that qualifies for recognition as an asset is on initial recognition measured at its cost. The acquisition cost comprises the asset's purchase price, non-refundable purchase taxes, directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to the condition necessary for the intended use and the estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located. For subsequent measurement of land, buildings and important production lines, the Group companies use the revaluation model. The individual groups of tangible fixed assets are carried at fair value reduced by the accumulated depreciation value adjustment and impairment losses. The increase in fair value of a group of tangible assets is recognised in equity as a revaluation surplus unless the previous decrease in fair value was recognised in the Income Statement. The decrease in fair value of a group of tangible fixed assets is recognised in the Income Statement upon prior elimination of the revaluation surplus established in equity. Revaluation is performed periodically (usually every three years) so that the carrying amount does not differ significantly from the fair value. Part of the revaluation surplus is realised if the asset is used in the company, while each year a transfer from the revaluation surplus to retained net profit is made, equalling the higher depreciation, without including it in the Income Statement. For subsequent measurement of other production equipment and other items that are recorded as tangible fixed assets, the Group companies use the cost model. Tangible fixed assets are carried at historical cost reduced by the accumulated depreciation value adjustment and impairment losses. If the acquisition price of an item of tangible fixed assets is high, it is distributed among its significant parts that may have different useful lives, and the Group company depreciates separately each such part. Depreciation is recognised on a straight-line basis over the useful lives of each item of tangible fixed assets. Land does not depreciate. Depreciation of a tangible fixed asset begins on the first day of the following month when the asset is available for use. The adequacy of the depreciation period and the depreciation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Any adjustments necessary are accounted as a change in an accounting estimate. Amortisation rates (by major type) are as follows:  Buildings: 2% to 6.6%  Production equipment: 10% to 33.3%  Motor vehicles: 15.8% to 25%  Computers: 20% to 50%  Other equipment: 10% to 33.3% If not negligible, the remaining value is checked annually. 120 The difference between the sales value, decreased by the cost of sale, and carrying amount of a disposed tangible fixed asset is transferred to operating revenue from revaluation if the former is higher than the latter and to operating expenses from revaluation if the latter is higher than the former. Upon the disposal of a revalued asset, the difference between its fair value, decreased by the cost of sale, and last carrying amount must be corrected for the revaluation surplus connected to this asset. Leases, in terms of which a Group company assumes substantially all major risks and benefits of ownership, are classified as financial leases. The assets under a financial lease are stated separately from other assets of the same type. The projected costs of high-value repairs are treated as part of tangible fixed assets and depreciated at the rate that allows for the estimated amount to be recovered by the time the costs of high-value repairs actually incur. Costs that increase tangible fixed assets' future benefits or extend their useful life increase their acquisition price. All other costs are recognised in the Income Statement under expenses as incurred. Borrowing costs are recognised as expenses when incurred. Items of small tools whose individual acquisition price does not exceed 500 euros are classified as materials. Investment property Investment property is held to earn rental revenue, increase the long-term investment value or both. At the beginning, the investment property is carried at cost, and transaction costs are included in the amount of cost. For subsequent measurement of investment property, the revaluation model is used, with investment property being recognised at its fair value. Changes in fair value of investment property are recognised as other expenses or revenue in respect of investment property. Investment property does not depreciate. Impairment of long-term assets other than financial investments At each reporting date, the Group companies assess whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indications exist, a Group company must assess the recoverable amount of the asset. The recoverable amount is considered the fair value, decreased by costs of sale or value upon use, depending on which amount is higher. Assessing the value in use comprises assessing receipts and disbursements arising from the further use of the asset and its final disposal and applying the appropriate discount rate to those future cash flows. Value in use may also be established for a cashgenerating unit, which is the minimum identifiable group of assets, the continued use of which is a source of future cash receipts, predominantly independent of cash receipts from other assets or asset groups. Its carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount only if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount. This reduction is treated as impairment loss. Any impairment loss measured under the cost model is recognised in the Income Statement. Any impairment loss measured under the revaluation model is debited directly to each revaluation surplus before the difference is recognised in the Income Statement. Impairment losses recognised for an item in prior periods are reversed if, and only if, the assessment applied to determine the recoverable amount of that item changed after the recognition of the last 121 impairment loss. In such a case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase is a reversal of an impairment loss. The increased carrying amount of an asset due to a reversal of the impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years unless such increase resulted from revaluation. Any reversal of the impairment loss measured under the cost model is recognised in the Income Statement. Any reversal of the impairment loss measured under the revaluation model is attributed directly to the revaluation surplus. If the impairment loss of the same revalued asset was recognised in the Income Statement, the reversal of such an impairment loss shall also be recognised in the Income Statement. Financial investments In accordance with the SAS, the Group companies classify long-term and short-term financial investments into four groups of financial investments: 1st group: financial investments designated at fair value through the Income Statement 2nd group: held-to-maturity investments 3rd group: loans and receivables 4th group: available-for-sale investments Investments in non-negotiable securities or shares are classified in the fourth group. At the end of the financial year, if this is allowed and appropriate, the Group companies appropriately reclassify individual long-term and short-term financial investments into a different group. For financial investments classified in any of the four groups, the trade date is consistently used. Upon recognition, the financial investment is measured at cost. In the case of a financial investment measured at amortised cost and a financial investment measured at fair value through the revaluation surplus and a financial investment measured at cost, the fair value is supplemented by the transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial investment. The valuation of financial investments depends on which group an individual investment is classified into. Financial investments classified into the 1st and 4th groups are valued at fair value. Fair value is based on market value (average share price, published daily value of a mutual fund unit, a single bond price, ...). A change in the fair value of financial investments in the 1st group is recognised in the Income Statement as financial revenue or expense. A change in the fair value of financial investments in the 4th group is recognised under revaluation surplus. Financial revenue resulting from the elimination of the revaluation surplus for financial investments in the 4th group is recognised upon the sale of the financial investment or its derecognition. Financial investments classified into the 2nd and 3rd groups are valued at amortised cost. Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial investment is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the depreciation of the discount or premium (using the effective interest method) and less any possible impairment. Financial investments in non-negotiable securities classified in the fourth group are measured at cost. Financial investments in subsidiary companies are measured at cost in separate financial statements. A financial investment is derecognised when the contractual rights expire to receive cash flows from the said investment. 122 At each reporting date, the Group companies assess whether there is objective evidence of impairment of a financial investment. If any such evidence exists, it must be assessed to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Losses resulting from revaluation from impairment, which could not be settled with the revaluation surplus, are recognised as a financial expense in the Income Statement. For financial investments measured at cost and when assessing whether they need to be impaired the Group companies comply with the provisions of Note 1 to SAS 3, according to which the impairment test should be performed if the value of the financial investment exceeds the associated capital by more than 20%. In the case of financial investments held to maturity and loans and receivables that are carried at amortised cost, the impairment loss is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised. Impairment losses are reversed through profit or loss. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not yet been incurred), discounted at the original effective interest rate of a financial asset (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). Impairment losses that are recognised for the available-for-sale financial investments measured at cost cannot be eliminated. The amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the financial asset's carrying amount and the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Impairment losses recognised for a financial investment in an equity instrument classified as available for sale cannot be reversed through profit or loss. If the fair value of a debt instrument classified as available for sale increases and the increase can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in the profit or loss, it is necessary to reverse the impairment loss through the profit or loss as financial revenue. The amount of losses on available-for-sale financial investments at fair value are measured as the difference between the acquisition price and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in the profit or loss. Inventories Inventories are assets in tangible form that will be used for the creation of products or performance of services or be sold in the ordinary course of business. The Group companies disclosed the following types of inventories:  materials and small tools,  work-in-progress and semi-finished products,  finished products,  merchandise. The inventories of material and merchandise are disclosed according to the average purchase price method. The inventories of materials in the process of completion or modification are disclosed in inventories in a special record and their value should be appreciated by the costs of completion and/or modification once the materials are returned. Units of quantity of products or work-in-progress are valued at contracted full cost. Contracted full cost comprises production costs in narrow sense, indirect purchasing and selling costs and general overheads, whereas direct selling costs and borrowing costs are not included. When disclosing inventories of work-in-progress and products, the company uses fixed prices with appropriate deviations. 123 The inventories of material are not revalued upwards nor are work-in-progress and inventory of products. Inventories are revalued for impairment if their carrying amount, including the amount established using the latest actual purchase prices or acquisition cost, exceeds their market value or if the latter is higher than the net realisable value. A decrease of inventories of raw and other materials as well as small tools is charged against the operating expenses from revaluation, whereas a decrease of inventories of work-in-progress, products and merchandise is charged against relevant operating expenses. Net realisable value of inventories of material, finished goods and merchandise, which is more than a year old, is considered individually. The administrator of inventories prepares an estimate of the net realisable value. Inventories of finished goods and merchandise older than one year are revalued due to impairment, if the carrying value of the inventories exceeds the estimated net realisable value. Operating receivables In terms of maturity, receivables are divided into long-term and short-term receivables. Long-term operating receivables are from issued deposits or merchant or consumer credits with maturities longer than one year and deferred security. Short-term portions of long-term operating receivables due in the next year reduce the balance of long-term commodity credits and are included in the Balance Sheet under short-term operating receivables. Short-term operating receivables are divided into short-term trade receivables (domestic and foreign), advances (advances for inventories, tangible fixed assets and intangible assets are recognised in the Balance Sheet under the category to which they relate), short-term operating receivables from operations for the account of third parties, short-term operating receivables associated with financial revenue and other short-term operating receivables. They are shown separately as receivables from subsidiary and associated companies. Receivables from group companies are classified by the individual components of the operating receivables. Receivables that are not settled within a regular maturity period are considered doubtful receivables, and if they cause judicial proceedings, they are considered disputable receivables. The term regular deadline implies a deadline determined in accordance with a contract or other corresponding document. The revaluation of receivables is a change in their carrying amount. It occurs primarily in the form of revaluation of receivables due to their impairment or revaluation of receivables due to cancellation of impairment. It is performed throughout the year during the preparation of monthly financial statements on the basis of empirical corrections of value adjustments. At the end of the financial year, the state of the value adjustments of receivables is verified according to the policy on forming value adjustments of receivables described in the continuation. For receivables denominated in foreign currency and those where their exchange rate is changed after their initial recognition, or the contracting parties agreed on a revaluation to preserve their real value, reducing receivables by exchange rate differences increases financial expenses, and increasing receivables by exchange rate differences increases financial revenue. Receivables are revalued due to impairment if their carrying amounts exceed their fair values. The Group companies assess the need to impair receivables based on consideration of criteria for maturity or insurance of receivables that are furthermore corrected through individual evaluation. 124 Receivables from companies that have gone bankrupt are written off at 100 percent, except when receivables from those companies are insured (in that case, an adjustment equalling the uninsured part of the receivables is made) or when at least a partial repayment is possible, subject to the debtor’s assets. Adjustments are calculated according to individual receivables in accordance with the following criteria:  receivables from customers whose financial state has weakened considerably or they are in the process of compulsory composition;  receivables in judicial proceedings;  receivables from companies in bankruptcy;  receivables which are not coordinated. Subsequent write-offs of individual receivables are, based on a corresponding document, covered by forming the revaluation adjustments of receivables. Cash Cash consists of cash on hand, deposit money and cash in transit. Cash also includes cash equivalents that represent investments that can be converted into cash amounts, known in advance, quickly or in the near future, and where the risk of changes to the value is insignificant. These include short-term deposits and bank deposits and similar investments and are intended to ensure solvency. Cash is shown in the amounts denoted on the corresponding documents. Cash expressed in foreign currencies is converted to the local currency using the reference exchange rate of the European Central Bank and, for justifiable reasons, the appropriate exchange rate of a commercial bank may also be used. Exchange rate differences arising may increase or decrease the original value of cash shown, with regular financial revenue or financial expenses arising in connection with cash. Overdrafts in transaction accounts are disclosed as loans received. Equity Total equity consists of:  called-up capital,  capital reserves,  profit reserves,  revaluation surplus,  retained net profit or loss,  net profit or loss for the financial year,  revaluation reserve,  non-controlling interest. Acquired treasury shares or business shares are deducted from equity. Upon purchase, sale, issue or cancellation, any profit or loss from the transaction is not recognised in the Income Statement and any differences are offset against equity. Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which the general meeting decides that they should be distributed. A revaluation surplus refers to preliminary recognised strengthening of assets, both of the total amount as well as off-set with future effects of asset impairments prior to them being collected. The recognised positive or negative revaluation surplus may be the result of revaluation according to the 125 revaluation model applied to tangible fixed assets and financial investments classified under availablefor-sale financial investments, according to their fair values and derivative financial instruments. Provisions and long-term accrued costs and deferred revenue The Group companies disclose provisions in the Balance Sheet if they have, as the result of a past event, a present legal or indirect obligation and if it is probable that they will be required to settle the obligation through an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate. This reflects current assessments of the time value of money and, if needed, the risks specific to the liability. Effect arising from discounting is recorded as a financial expense or revenue. If a Group company expects with great certainty that some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision will be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset that does not exceed the amount of the provision. In this context, expenses for provisions are offset by revenue from the recognition of an asset. Provisions are reduced directly for costs or expenses for which they were made, which means that they no longer appear in the Income Statement except in the case of provisions for onerous contracts and long-term deferred revenue, the consumption of which is transferred to operating revenue in line with depreciation calculated. In compliance with the law, collective agreement and internal rules, the Group companies are obligated to pay jubilee benefits and retirement severance to employees for whom they form longterm provisions. Other pension liabilities do not exist. Provisions are made in the amount equalling the expected amount of future jubilee benefits and severance payments, discounted as at the date of the Balance Sheet. A calculation was made for every employee, taking into account the costs of severance payments upon retirement and the costs of all projected jubilee benefits until retirement. The calculation based on a projected unit is prepared by a certified actuary. If the Group company’s management estimates that in the financial year there were no events that would have a significant impact on the amount of the recognised long-term provisions for jubilee benefits and retirement severance, the state of recognised long-term provisions is changed simply because of interim jubilee benefits and severance payments. The actuarial calculation is performed at least every third financial year. Provisions for onerous contract costs are recognised when the unavoidable costs of non-compliance with contractual obligations exceed the economic benefits expected on the basis of the contract. The Group companies recognise in their financial statements the provisions for ongoing major lawsuits in terms of their amount. Every year, they verify the eligibility of the provisions formed with regard to the status of the dispute and the likelihood of a favourable or an unfavourable outcome. The amount of provisions is determined based on the amount of the claim or the expected likely amount if the actual claim is not yet known. If the outcome of litigation is not sufficiently certain along with the amount of future outflows, it is shown as a contingent liability outside the Balance Sheet. The Group companies form long-term provisions with regard to issued warranties upon the sale of products and major contracts that include guarantees on work performed, construction and roofs, if the estimated amounts are relevant. Long-term provisions from contracts that include a guarantee on work performed, construction and roofs are formed on the basis of several years of experience and actual costs related to past complaints. Long-term provisions for given warranties upon the sale of 126 products are created in line with the percentage that the Group company determines on the basis of the average share of the number of complaints concerning products in relation to the production output of the last five years. Provisions are as a rule available for use for a period of three years, but no longer than up to the date when the warranty period expires. The use of provisions formed is carried out using the linear method. The amount of operating revenue calculated in the current year is defined based on this. The utilisation of these provisions decreases expenses in the current financial year in the amount of the actual identified complaints in the financial year, whereas the difference between the excess provisions is eliminated in favour of profit. Based on experience of the Quality Sector, the majority of complaints arise in the first three years after the handover of the building, which is why provisions are created for a period of three years. Liabilities Liabilities may be of a long-term, short-term, financial or operating nature. Long-term liabilities represent a liability with regard to the financing of company’s own assets whose maturities are longer than one year following their appearance or date of the Balance Sheet. Long-term liabilities are broken down into:  long-term financial liabilities that represent long-term loans acquired on the basis of loan agreements or acquired deposits and liabilities to lessors through financial leasing,  long-term operating liabilities that comprise long-term supplier credit for purchased goods or services and long-term security received. Long-term liabilities are divided into long-term liabilities to Group companies and other entities. Longterm liabilities are also classified into long-term liabilities obtained from banks and other legal and natural persons at home and abroad. Short-term liabilities are recognised liabilities connected to the financing of the company’s own assets that must be settled within a year’s time at the latest. Short-term liabilities are divided into:  financial liabilities that arise when creditors place cash into a company or pay its business events with cash,  operating liabilities that arise when suppliers place into company elements required for production and the performance of services. The Group companies disclose short-term liabilities acquired from banks and other legal and natural persons at home and abroad separately. Liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. If significant amounts do not bear interest, they are recognised at a discounted amount, taking into consideration the average interest rate achieved by the Group company in comparable transactions. If the actual or agreed interest rate does not materially differ from the effective interest rate, they are recognised in the Balance Sheet at their initial recognised amounts less repayments. Short-term accruals and deferrals Short-term accruals and deferrals are receivables and other assets and liabilities that are expected to arise within a year’s time and whose occurrence is probable. 127 Accrued revenue and deferred costs include short-term deferred costs or short-term deferred expenses and short-term accrued revenue. They are shown and classified separately by the type of accrued revenue and deferred costs. Accrued costs and deferred revenue include short-term accrued costs or expenses and short-term deferred revenue. They are shown and classified separately by the type of accrued costs and deferred revenue. Accrued costs related to engineering projects are also shown in accrued costs and deferred revenue. Costs or expenses calculated in advance arise on the basis of a uniform burdening of activities, profit and loss or inventories. Short-term deferred revenue arises if the work has not yet been performed and the costs of the services have already been invoiced or paid. Similarly, it can arise if the entitlement to the recognition of revenue in the profit or loss is doubtful at the moment of sale. Income Statement The Income Statement has been prepared according to Version I in accordance with SAS 25.5. The Income Statement represents the fundamental financial statement and gives a realistic and fair overview of the profit or loss for the current and previous financial year. The structure of items presented in the Income Statement refers to the total revenue attained in an individual financial year. Revenue Revenue represents increases in economic benefits in the accounting period in the form of increased assets or decreased liabilities. Through its effect on profit or loss, revenue influences the capital amount. Revenue is classified into operating revenue, financial revenue and other revenue. Revenue from the sale of products is recognised in the Income Statement when the Group company has transferred to the customer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods. Revenue from the sale of products, merchandise and materials is measured at selling prices stated in invoices or other documents, less discounts and rebates approved either when the sale is made or subsequently, including those granted for early payment. Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the Income Statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the Balance Sheet date. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed. No revenue is recognised if there are uncertainties regarding the recovery of the consideration due, associated costs, the possible return of goods or continuing management involvement with the goods. Rental revenue from investment property is recognised in revenue evenly during the lease term. A government grant is initially recognised in the financial statement as deferred revenue when there is reasonable assurance that the Group company will comply with the conditions attached to it and receive it. Government grants received for covering costs are recognised strictly as revenue over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs that they are intended to compensate for. Government grants associated with assets are recognised in the Income Statement strictly as other operating revenue over the useful life of that asset. Interest revenue is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues using the effective interest rate method. Dividend revenue is recognised in the Income Statement on the date when the shareholder's right to receive payment is exercised. Financial revenue in the Income Statement also includes exchange rate gains and gains on hedging instruments and other revenue derived from financial investments. 128 Revenue from engineering projects is recognised in the Income Statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project. If, in individual projects, it is determined that the costs incurred exceed the planned costs, the estimated overall loss on the project is recognised as an expense of the accounting period. Expenses Expenses are broken down into operating, financial and other expenses. The acquisition price of goods sold includes the net invoiced value of goods sold, expenses for customs and other import duties that are levied according to the supplier's price, transportation costs, insurance costs and other associated acquisition expenses. Production costs of goods sold and cost of sales and general operations are dependent on inventory valuation methods described under Inventories. Operating expenses from revaluation arise from impairment of fixed, current assets and investment property measured at cost as well as from the loss on disposal of intangible assets, tangible fixed assets and investment properties in comparison to their carrying amount. Financial expenses comprise interest payable on loans calculated using the effective interest rate method, exchange rate losses, losses on hedging instruments and other expenses that arise from financial investments. Deferred taxes Corporate income tax for the financial year comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable profit for the financial year, using tax rates enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in regard to previous financial years. Deferred tax is recognised using the Balance Sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences except for:  goodwill that is not deductible for tax purposes;  the initial recognition of an asset or liability in an event other than a merger, division, exchange of capital shares and transfer of activities and that does not affect the accounting or taxable profit. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all temporary differences, unused tax credits and tax losses in the amount for which it is probable that there will be future taxable profit available against which the said asset can be debited, except if:  differences arise from the initially recognised assets or liabilities in an event that at the time of occurrence affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit, except in the case of receivables from business mergers, divisions, exchange of capital shares or transfer of activities. When compiling the Balance Sheet, the Group companies reassess previously unrecognised deferred tax assets and recognises them if it is probable that future taxable profit will allow for the utilisation of deferred tax assets. The Group company reduces the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset if it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available. Any such reduction is reversed if it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available. 129 Corporate income tax is disclosed in the Income Statement, except where it refers to items directly disclosed as equity, in which case it is disclosed under equity. Insignificant amounts of receivables and deferred tax liabilities are not recognised. Business and geographical segments The Group companies do not monitor operations by business and geographical segments. 130 Consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015 The consolidated

The increase in the acquisition price of intangible assets is related to the purchase of computer software and certificates, registration of brands and property rights to land. The development costs of the products of the Qbiss One family are disclosed in deferred development costs. Intangible assets in acquisition are related to the development costs of Qbiss Air products. Their capitalisation amounted to EUR 340,306 in 2015. In 2014, the controlling company Trimo and the company Trimo Inženjering d.o.o transferred from fixed assets to other property rights the land in the Republic of Serbia, Pečinci Municipality, leased for 99 years. Trimo d.d. undertook to build facilities on that land within three years after the conclusion 140 of the lease contract. Due to objective reasons, the facility has not yet been constructed on the entire land, even after the expiry of the deadline. A plant was constructed on an area representing 53% of the total land, the title to which was transferred by Trimo Inženjering d.o.o. According to the lease contract concluded with the Pečinci Municipality and in line with the applicable legislation of the Republic of Serbia, the companies may convert the right to lease applying to the remaining land into property right when the condition of facility construction is fulfilled. In 2015, Trimo successfully entered in the accounts the ownership right on the part of land that was adequately recorded within tangible fixed assets. On 4 December 2015, Trimo submitted a request for the conversion of the lease right of the remaining part of the land into the ownership right at the real estate register of Pečinci on the basis of the change in the legislation. This part of land is still recorded as other property right. The company assessed the value of the leased land on the basis of the valuation of the real estate performed by a certified appraiser for real estate in the Republic of Serbia. In the event of proceedings by the lessor in the direction of attempted termination of contract, the company will exercise entitlements to reimbursement of the rest of the lease payments and past investments in that land. According to an internal calculation, the company establishes that the reimbursement by the lessor in such a case would be higher than the assessed value of real estate recorded in the statements of the company. Based on this, the company establishes that the value of the entitlement is not recorded as too high. Further procedures are described in events after the balance sheet date. On 29 January 2015, Trimo received a request in relation to property rights for leased land in the Republic of Serbia (the Municipality of Pečinci), sent by the Municipality of Pečinci, requesting the rescission of the lease contracts concluded on 1 February 2010 and 6 December 2007 because of a breach of contractual commitments with regard to investment. Trimo was prepared to undertake consensual termination of the contract and requested that the Municipality of Pečinci reimburse the proportional part of lease payments and compensate for the increase in land value resulting from the investment of Trimo, in accordance with the law and contract provisions. As at 31 December 2015, the Group does not disclose significant commitments for the acquisition of intangible fixed assets. 141 Property, plant and equipment (Tangible fixed assets) CHANGES IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Production Fixed Advances machinery and assets being for fixed (in EUR) Land Buildings other equipment acquired assets Total Cost 31 December 2014 8.361.391 33.236.081 61.669.252 174.435 303.637 103.744.796 Adjustments (309.756) (1.838.777) (2.148.533) 1 January 2015 8.361.391 32.926.325 59.830.475 174.435 303.637 101.596.263 Acquisitions 4.406 153.301 386.170 11.501 555.378 Acquisitions – own manufacture Transfer from investments in progress Exchange rate differences (24.999) (206.628) (341.518) (5.717) (578.862) Disposals (245.476) (1.670.334) (1.915.810) Transfer to short-term assets Impairments (62.716) (477.740) (540.456) Reconciliation with fair value 183.479 993.752 1.177.231 Adjustments other Transfer to investment property Transfer 2.001.892 96.806 1.016.325 (415.509) (315.138) 2.384.376 Adjustments other (140.506) (140.506) 31 December 2015 10.275.568 32.758.912 59.363.755 139.379 102.537.614 Accumulated value adjustment 31 December 2014 12.994.509 47.758.697 60.753.206 Adjustments (309.756) (1.838.777) (2.148.533) 1 January 2015 12.684.753 45.919.920 58.604.673 Depreciation for the year 938.480 2.301.836 3.240.316 Increase due to acquisition Disposals (99.420) (1.578.913) (1.678.333) Exchange rate differences (62.586) (157.329) (219.915) Transfer to short-term assets Impairments (289.089) (289.089) Reconciliation with fair value Transfer from investment property Transfer to investment property Adjustments other (139.942) (139.942) 31 December 2015 13.461.227 46.056.483 59.517.710 Carrying amount 31 December 2014 8.361.391 20.241.572 13.910.555 174.435 303.637 42.991.590 1 January 2015 8.361.391 20.241.572 13.910.555 174.435 303.637 42.991.590 31 December 2015 10.275.568 19.297.685 13.307.272 139.379 43.019.904 In the scope of drafting the Consolidated Annual Report for 2015 we again reviewed the opening balance of tangible fixed assets and adjusted them to the actual balance. The acquisitions of production devices and equipment are related to production line upgrades, purchase of production and computer equipment as well as passenger cars under financial lease. The Group companies state the land, buildings and key production lines at fair value for the purpose of accounting. If the carrying amount of fixed assets was assessed to be inconsistent with the actual fair value, the Group companies re-examined the fair value of the assets for the purpose of accounting as at 31 December 2015 according to the parent company’s policies. The assessment was made by certified appraisers of real estate and equipment. The effect of revaluation of land to fair value for 142 accounting purposes as at 31 December 2015 is reflected in the decrease in the value of land by EUR 62,716. The reconciliation of land with fair value for accounting purposes is reflected in the total amount in operating expenses from revaluation of fixed assets. The reconciliation of buildings with fair value for accounting purposes based on appraisal or market value of buildings as at 31 December 2015 is reflected in EUR 183,479 higher value of buildings. The reconciliation of buildings for accounting purposes is reflected in the increase of the corresponding revaluation surplus in the amount of EUR 174,462 and deferred tax liabilities in the amount of EUR 9,017. The reconciliation of key production lines with fair value for accounting purposes as at 31 December 2015 is reflected in the decrease of the key production lines’ value in the amount of EUR 188,651 and the increase in the key production lines’ value of EUR 993,752. The reconciliation of key production lines’ value for accounting purposes is reflected in operating expenses from revaluation of fixed assets in the amount of EUR 188,651. If the Group companies evaluated land, buildings and key production lines using the cost model, the carrying amount of tangible fixed assets as at 31 December 2015 would total EUR 32,956,331. In 2015, the Group companies did not change depreciation rates. As at 31 December 2015, the Group companies did not disclose significant commitments for the purchase of fixed assets. The book value of the pledged land, buildings and equipment for the payment of liabilities as at 31 December 2015 was EUR 36,620,221. The property given to the creditor as security cannot be disposed of by the company without its permission.

The tax base was also reduced by used provisions that were completely or partly unrecognised upon formation; by financial investments whose impairments were not tax deductible; by covering past tax loss; by investments in research and development, for using the relief for investment. The increase of the tax base is mostly a result of non-deductible expenses from revaluation of receivables and expenses from the impairment of financial investments. 162 The cost of auditing services The cost of the audit of the financial statements of the controlling company and the Trimo Group as at 31/12/2015 totalled EUR 20,400.

Events after the Balance Sheet Date The sales process of the Trimo Group On 30 March 2016, the sales process of the company was completed, whereby 8,910,157 shares or 97.45% of all shares of Trimo d.d. were transferred from the bank syndicate to the acquirer European Architectural Systems S.a.r.l. (hereinafter: EAS) based in Luxembourg. As part of the Agreement, EAS also assumed the debt of Trimo d.d. and Trimo Inženjering Serbia totalling EUR 30,713,061. In addition to the said shares and debt assumption, the Agreement covered the transfer of 11,226 shares or a 44.94% stake in Trimo MSS d.d. to EAS and the disposal of the entire interest in Akripol d.o.o. or transfer thereof from Trimo d.d. to the bank syndicate. After the completed transaction, EAS became a 97.45% owner of Trimo d.d., directly and through Trimo d.d. the owner of 99.87% of Trimo MSS d.d. and a creditor to whom EUR 30,713,061 was due. The interest in Akripol d.o.o. was completely disinvested from the Trimo Group. Disposal of the investment in Trimo VSK At the end of April, an agreement was concluded on the sale of a 51-percent equity stake of Trimo in the Russian production company Trimo VSK to Spetstamozhstroy. With this transaction Trimo d.d. fully disposed the investment in Trimo VSK. At the same time, a licence agreement was concluded on knowhow and the Trimo brand for 20 years, based on which Trimo VSK may produce, sell and put the Trimo brand label on products in the territory of Russia. Law suit regarding the land in Serbia On 20 May 2016, Trimo d.d. was served a law suit from the District Court of Novo mesto due to the termination of lease contract dated 1 February 2010 on long-term lease of the land plots 1807/1 and 1960, both c.m. Šimanovci. In the operative part of the law suit, the plaintiff requests the court to determine that the lease contract on long-term lease of 99 years dated 1 February 2010 referring to land plots 1807/1 and 1960 is terminated; the plaintiff further requests the court to find that the contract was terminated through the fault of Trimo d.d. and that once the relevant judgement becomes final, it is permitted to delete the entered lease right to the benefit of the lessee Trimo d.d. and allow the entry of state property with the right of use to the benefit of the Pećinci Municipality. Trimo d.d. in due time filed a statement of defence based on the fact that the plaintiff Pećinci Municipality has no legal interest to file suit for termination of contract dated 1 February 2010; that the plaintiff Pećinci Municipality failed to fulfil its contractual obligation, as it did not provide for utility infrastructure of the land that was the subject matter of the contract, namely: the Pećinci Municipality failed to provide utility infrastructure, sewage, electrical infrastructure and the path to the border of the plots, whereby it failed to perform the contract and is at fault for the objective cause for non-construction of the facility. Furthermore, Trimo d.d. stated that if the court finds in favour of the Pećinci Municipality, the defendant shall claim damage suffered by Trimo due to non-performance of contractual obligation by the Pećinci Municipality. Trimo would thus claim the legal right to reimbursement of the rest of the lease paid and past investments in the relevant land. According to an internal calculation, the company establishes that the reimbursement by the lessor in such a case would be higher than the assessed value of real estate recorded in the statements of the company. 163 From the date of the consolidated financial statements up to the preparation of this Annual Report, no events occurred that would have an effect on the truthfulness and fairness of the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2015 and that would require adjustment of the consolidated financial statements for 2015.
