Its products, which constitute one of the most complete and integrated solution offerings on the market today, together with its position as a technological leader, place Alstom in a unique situation through which it is able to benefit from the worldwide growth of the rail transport market. Lastly, in order to generate profitable growth, Alstom focuses on operational excellence and product mix evolution. INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS MARKET DRIVERS The rail transportation market is supported by solid long term drivers. should take place in both mature and emerging markets, while the Urbanisation creates a growing demand for infrastructure, trains creation of new networks will create additional opportunities. (especially for integrated solutions) and signalling notably in emerging countries. Mature markets, on the other hand, are mainly supported by Sustainable development projects aiming at updating and modernising existing infrastructure, as Greenhouse gas emissions, impact of air pollution on public health, well as by growing environmental concerns. climate change, recycling, recovery, energy efficiency and noise constitute some of the most significant environmental and sustainable Urbanisation development concerns currently voiced by populations and politicians. The combination of both economic and demographic growth should Based on these criteria, rail transportation offers higher performance entice a growing number of people to live in cities. By 2050, world levels than other transportation modes, which should have a positive population should exceed 9 billion inhabitants, of which nearly 70% will impact on the evolution of the rail transportation market. However, reside in urban areas (source: UNFPA, United Nations Population Fund). some challenges will have to be faced in these various sectors in order This trend towards urbanisation should be particularly strong in China, to meet ambitious emission reduction goals within set time frames. In India and in the developing countries of Africa and Latin America. addition, if concerns regarding these matters are significant in mature markets, they are gradually gaining more clout in emerging countries. This development triggers the growing saturation of airports, roads and existing railway infrastructure.

Alstom ensured that the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value (including goodwill). Presentation of key assumptions used for the determination of recoverable amounts The value in use is determined as the discounted value of future cash flows by using cash flow projections for the next three years consistent with the Group’s internal business plan, the extrapolation of the two following years and the most recent forecasts prepared by the Group. The value in use is mainly driven by the terminal value which is particularly sensitive to changes in the assumptions on the discount rate after tax, the long-term growth rate and the terminal value Adjusted EBIT margin (corresponding to the ratio aEBIT over Sales). ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015/16 67 / 3 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements The main assumptions used to assess the recoverable amounts of goodwill are as follows: Net carrying amount of goodwill at 31 March 2016 (in € million) 1,366 Value elected as representative of the recoverable value value in use Number of years over which cash flow estimates are available 3 years Extrapolation period of cash flow estimates 2 years Long-term growth rate at 31 March 2016 1.5% Long-term growth rate at 31 March 2015 1.5% After tax discount rate at 31 March 2016 (*) 8.5% After tax discount rate at 31 March 2015 (*) 8.5% (*) The application of pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows leads to the same valuation of Cash Generating Units. Sensitivity of the values in use to key assumptions can be presented as follows: (in € million) aEBIT Margin -25 bp +25 bp (150) 150 After tax discount rate -25 bp +25 bp 208 (193) Long-term growth rate -10 bp +10 bp (64) 66 As of 31 March 2016, the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value and the sensitivity of the values in use to key assumptions support the Group’s opinion that goodwill is not impaired. 10.2.

The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information specifically required by French law in such reports, whether modified or not. This information is presented below the audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the Auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account balances, transactions, or disclosures. This report also includes information relating to the specific verification of information given in the Group’s management report. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. To the Shareholders In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your Annual General Meeting, we hereby report to you, for the year ended 31 March 2016, on: yy the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Alstom; yy the justification of our assessments; yy the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I. Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sampling techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at 31 March 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the following matters: yy Note 1.1 “Alstom strategic move”, Note 3 “Major changes in scope of consolidation” and Note 12 “Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates” which set out the accounting treatment and impacts of the transaction with General Electric including the sale of the Group’s Energy activities, the acquisition of General Electric’s Signalling business and the investments in the alliances with General Electric; and yy Note 30.2 “Disputes” which describes ongoing investigations by judicial authorities with respect to alleged illegal payments in certain countries. II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: 1. Completion of the transaction with General Electric and subsequent share buy-back Note 3.1.1. “Capital gain on the sale of Energy” to the consolidated financial statements sets out the calculation principles of the capital gain on the sale of Energy entities to General Electric and Note 3.1.2 “financial statements of discontinued operations” sets out the accounting treatment of assets held for sale and discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. Note 1.1 “Alstom strategic move” to the consolidated financial statements sets out the principles applied for the accounting of the impacts relating to the acquisition of General Electric’s Signalling business, the principles used for the accounting of the investments in the alliances with General Electric and the principles used for the accounting of the share buy-back. / 110 ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015/16 Financial statements Consolidated financial statements 3 We have verified that the principles applied are appropriate and that they have been adequately applied. Furthermore, we have verified that Note 1.1 “Alstom strategic move”, Note 3 “Major changes in scope of consolidation” and Note 12 “Investments in Joint Ventures and Associates” to the consolidated financial statements give the appropriate information. 2. Construction contracts As described in Notes 2.2, 2.3.6, 2.3.17, 24 and 30.1 to the consolidated financial statements and related to the recognition of revenue and operating margin, Alstom makes estimates that may have a significant impact, notably when determining the margin at completion on each contract, determined on the basis of the latest information and contract status available. Those estimates are reflected on the balance sheet under “Construction contracts in progress, assets”, “Construction contracts in progress, liabilities” and for contracts completed “Current provisions”. We have examined the processes applied by Alstom and considered the data and assumptions on which the estimates are based. 3. Goodwill, tangible and intangible assets Alstom performed an impairment test on goodwill at year-end and also assessed whether there was any indication of impairment of tangible and intangible assets, in accordance with the approach described in Note 2.3.12 to the consolidated financial statements. As regards Goodwill, we have assessed the impairment test performed and verified that Note 10.1 to the consolidated financial statements gives the appropriate information. As regards tangible and intangible assets, we have examined the data and assumptions on which the analyses have been performed, we have reviewed the calculations of the impairments recognized and we have verified that Notes 6, 10.2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements give the appropriate information. 4. Disputes We have examined the procedures used by Alstom to identify, assess and account for disputes. We have ensured that the status of the disputes and the related uncertainties are adequately described in Note 30.2 to the consolidated financial statements. 5. Deferred tax assets As described in Notes 2.2 and 2.3.16 to the consolidated financial statements and related to taxation, Alstom reviews the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date. We have examined the data and assumptions on which this analysis has been performed, reviewed the calculations and verified that Notes 2.2, 2.3.16 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements give the appropriate information. As stated in Note 2.2 to the consolidated financial statements, several matters mentioned in the paragraphs above are based on estimates and assumptions which are uncertain by nature, and for which the final outcome may significantly differ from the initial forward looking data used. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III. Specific verification As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

These financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. I. Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sample techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 March 2016 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. Without qualifying our opinion, we draw your attention to the matter set out in the Note 3.1. “Alstom strategic move” to the financial statements regarding the finalization of the transaction with General Electric including the sale of the Group’s Energy activities, the acquisition of General Electric’s Signalling business and the investments in the alliances with General Electric, and the subsequent Public share buy-back offer. II. Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L. 823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters: 1. Completion of the transaction with General Electric Note 3.1 “Alstom strategic move” to the financial statements describes the impacts of the finalization of the transaction with General Electric. Notes 11 “Shareholders’ equity” and 14 “Bonds” to the financial statements present the main consequences of the transaction and its subsequent operations. We have verified that the principles applied are appropriate and that they have been adequately applied. Furthermore, we have verified that these notes to the financial statements give the appropriate information. 2. Investments Investments are recorded as assets in your Company’s balance sheet for a net book value of €8,016 million. Note 2.1 “Description of accounting policies – Investments” to the financial statements describes the methods adopted for accounting of these investments as well as the methods used to calculate impairment losses. We have examined the methodology used and assessed the reasonableness of the estimates applied by Alstom to perform the investment test, as described in Note 8 “Financial assets” to the financial statements. / 130 ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015/16 Financial statements Statutory Financial Statements 3 3. Disputes We have examined the procedures used by Alstom to identify, assess and account for disputes. We have ensured that the status of the disputes and the related uncertainties are adequately described in Note 12 “Provisions for risks and charges” and Note 2.3 “Provisions for risks and charges – Provisions for litigation and disputes” to the financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report.

It is our responsibility to report to shareholders, based on the information provided to us, on the main terms and conditions of agreements and commitments that have been disclosed to us or that we may have identified as part of our engagement, without commenting on their relevance or substance or identifying any undisclosed agreements or commitments.

We performed the procedures that we deemed necessary in accordance with professional standards applicable in France to such engagements. These procedures consisted in verifying that the information given to us is consistent with the underlying documents. Agreements and commitments to be submitted for the approval of the Annual General Meeting Agreements and commitments authorized during the year In accordance with Article L. 225-40 of the French Commercial Code, we were informed of the following agreements and commitments authorized by the Board of Directors: Commitments falling within the scope of Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code with Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom starting 1 February, 2016 Director concerned: Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom starting 1 February, 2016. Nature and purpose: At its meetings of 28 January 2016 and 10 May 2016, the Board of Directors authorised the related-party commitments made to Henri Poupart-Lafarge, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Alstom starting 1 February, 2016, in relation to defined contribution plan, defined benefit plan and severance payment to be paid should his mandate terminate prematurely and motivated the interest of such commitments for the Company, in accordance with Articles L. 225-38 and L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code. Motivations justifying the interest of such commitments for the Group: Given the historical presence of Henri Poupart-Lafarge in the Group, its new attributions as Corporate Officer (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) and, the Group’s need of his experience and continuity of the implemented strategy, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, wishes to set global compensation at the benefice of Henri Poupart-Lafarge, that is in line with market practices and compliant with legal obligations and AFEP-MEDEF Code. These commitments are as follows: Severance payment As regards the length of Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s career as employee before being appointed as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (18 years), the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, authorized the suspension (instead of cancellation) of his contract of employment during his Corporate Office. The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, decided that in the event of revocation of his Corporate Office his contract of employment with Alstom Executive Management S.A.S. would be reactivated. In the event it would not be possible to propose to Henri Poupart-Lafarge a position corresponding to his level of responsibility, he would benefit from a severance payment which cannot exceed two years of his target remuneration as Corporate Officer and is subject to the following performance condition: application of a coefficient corresponding to the average level of attainment of targets applicable to his variable remuneration for the three years preceding his departure to two years of his target remuneration, fixed and variable. It would include and could not be lower than the severance payment to which Mr Henri Poupart-Lafarge is eligible in the frame of his suspended employment contract, or €1,856,000. / 132 ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015/16 Financial statements Statutory Financial Statements 3 Supplemental retirement schemes The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is entitled to a supplemental retirement scheme based on a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan. With regard to the defined benefit plan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from the supplemental collective retirement scheme which covers the Directors of Alstom S.A. and Alstom Executive Management S.A.S. whose base annual remuneration exceeds eight times the French social security ceiling. The acquisition of the entitlements by the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is subject to performance condition. At its meeting dated 28 January 2016 the Board of Directors decided that the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer would acquire the yearly entitlements only in the case where his variable remuneration for the year would reach at least 50% of its target value. Under the scheme, entitlements are acquired gradually and only represent, per year of seniority in the scheme, a limited percentage of the annual compensation corresponding to 0.6% of the annual reference remuneration within a range of eight to twelve times the Social Security ceiling and to 1.2% of the annual reference remuneration in excess of twelve times the Social Security ceiling. The annual reference remuneration is equal to the average fixed and variable remuneration received over the course of the past three years prior to retirement. This annual reference remuneration is capped at €2 million. The gradual accrual of potential rights based on seniority in the scheme represents a percentage that is lower than the 5% cap on the beneficiary’s remuneration provided for under the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Assuming he would retire when leaving the Group, Henri Poupart-Lafarge could claim upon retirement a gross retirement pension under the defined contribution scheme equal to approximately 0.6% of the capped annual reference remuneration within a range of eight to twelve times the Social Security ceiling, and to 1.2% of the annual reference remuneration in excess of twelve times the Social Security ceiling per year as described in the scheme. The annual reference remuneration is equal to the average fixed and variable remuneration received over the course of the past three years prior to retirement. This annual reference remuneration is capped at €2 million. In accordance with the applicable regulation, the acquisition of the entitlements is subject to performance condition. In that frame, upon the recommendation of the Nominations and Remuneration Committee, the level of achievement of Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s Short Term Incentive should be at least equal to 50% in order to be acquired. With regard to the defined contribution plan, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from the supplemental collective retirement scheme which covers the Directors of Alstom S.A. and Alstom Executive Management S.A.S. Social contributions financing the defined contribution plan represent an amount of 1% of Tranche A, 1% of Tranche B, 4% of Tranche C and 11% of Tranche D of Henri Poupart-Lafarge’s annual reference remuneration and are borne by the Company up to 95%.

Together with the sections “Management report on consolidated financial statements – fiscal year 2015/16” and “Description of Group activities”, it constitutes the Board of Directors’ report on the Group’s management for fiscal year 2015/16. Internal control and risk management procedures are described in section “Corporate governance – Chairman’s report” (the “Chairman’s report”), which presents in particular the annual risk assessment process (“Group risk mapping”) and the internal control questionnaire (“self-assessment questionnaire”). As mentioned in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016, the Energy activities are reported as “discontinued operations” in Alstom’s consolidated financial statements until the General Electric transaction closing date, i.e. 2 November 2015. They are therefore not included in orders, sales, income from operations and are reported under the “Net profit from discontinued operations” line. This line also includes the net profit arising from the completion of the transaction. In accordance with IFRS 5, the net income from the Energy activities (discontinued operations) has been presented on a separate line of the income statement of the comparative periods. The assets held for sale and the related liabilities are presented on the opening balance-sheet separately from other assets and liabilities on specific lines. As of 31 March 2016, these lines only include very few assets and liabilities where the disposal process is still on-going, awaiting for authorizations from antitrust authorities (or other competent authorities) or joint-venture partners consent. The net cash flows attributable to the operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operation realized from 1 April 2015 to the transaction completion, i.e. on 2 November 2015 are disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The consolidated statement of cash flows also shows the proceeds coming from the transaction itself.

ALSTOM – REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 2015/16 255 / 6 Sustainable Development: Alstom’s social responsibility REPORT BY ONE OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS, APPOINTED AS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY REPORT BY ONE OF THE STATUTORY AUDITORS, APPOINTED AS AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY, ON THE CONSOLIDATED ENVIRONMENTAL, LABOUR AND SOCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE MANAGEMENT REPORT This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French and is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking readers. This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the year ended March 31, 2016 To the Shareholders, In our capacity as Statutory Auditor of Alstom, appointed as an independent third party and certified by COFRAC under number 3-1060 (1), we hereby report to you our report on the consolidated human resources, environmental and social information for the year ended 31 March 2016, included in the management report (hereinafter named “CSR Information”), pursuant to article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce). Company’s responsibility The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing a Company’s management report including the CSR Information required by article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code in accordance with the “Environment, Health and Safety Reporting Manual” used by the Group’s sites as well as Human Resources standards “Census Rules” and “Social Survey” used by the Company (hereinafter the “Guidelines”), available on request to the CSR direction of the Company. Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and the requirements of article L. 822-11 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Statutory Auditor(s)’s responsibility On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to: yy attest that the required CSR Information is included in the management report or, in the event of non-disclosure of a part or all of the CSR Information, that an explanation is provided in accordance with the third paragraph of article R. 225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information); yy express a limited assurance conclusion that the CSR Information taken as a whole is, in all material respects, fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines (Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information). Our work involved 10 persons and was conducted between October 2015 and April 2016 during a 30 week period. We were assisted in our work by our CSR experts. We performed our work in accordance with the French professional standards and with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and with ISAE 3000 (2) concerning our conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information. 1. Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant Departments, we obtained an understanding of the Company’s sustainability strategy regarding human resources and environmental impacts of its activities and its social commitments and, where applicable, any actions or programmes arising from them. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided in article R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article R. 225-105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code.

Conclusion Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information Nature and scope of our work We conducted more than one hundred interviews with the persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the Departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to: yy assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate; yy verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important (given in appendix): yy at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report; yy at the level of a representative sample of sites selected by us (3) on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents 23% of headcount and between 25% and 43% of quantitative environmental data disclosed. For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the Company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part taking into consideration, if any, industry best practices. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have used, based on our professional judgement, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, no material misstatement has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.
