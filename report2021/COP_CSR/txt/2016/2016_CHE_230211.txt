That is why we announced »add value with sustainability« as a pillar of our corporate strategy in August 2014. The principles of Responsible Care® and the UN Global Compact form the basis for this. Sustainability also plays an increasingly important role for our customers. That is why, as one of the leading specialty chemical companies, we offer products and solutions that address global challenges such as resource scarcity, climate change, energy, nutrition and environmental protection, which concern all of us. We are gradually working to integrate sustainability into all of the company’s processes, and beyond the boundaries of the company. Even the theme »sustainability along the value chain« is becoming increasingly significant: development, innovation, procurement, manufacturing and customer benefits – there are starting points for more sustainable business everywhere. We are working hard to implement the highest possible degree of sustainability at all levels. Transparency and traceability of sources are of growing importance in the production of raw materials. Sustainability can only work if we collaborate closely with suppliers and customers to maintain social and environmental standards. This is why we carefully examine the supply chain for possible improvements. We use renewable raw materials wherever it is possible and wherever it makes sense. For example, certified, bio-based raw materials whose origin can be traced are of increasing importance for cosmetics and personal care products. We have launched the pilot project — »SPOTS®« (Sustainable Palm Oil & Traceability with Sabah Small HARIOLF KOTTMANN Producers) with different partners along the value chain, which Chief Executive Officer provides exactly this transparency for the production of palm oil and palm oil derivatives. 2 Foreword from the CEO Sustainability also fuels our innovation pipeline with new ideas and tled »Accelerate Change – Discover Value« we have brought our is an important factor for our future growth in this respect.

On 2 September 2015, we presented our sustainability strategy to representatives from industry, government, non-governmental organizations and the media at the first Sustainability Dialog. The consistently positive feedback we have received along the way and the open dialog affirms our approach. Hariolf Kottmann We have also made additional progress with regard to production Chief Executive Officer processes. As part of our environmental targets, we have undertaken to improve six key environmental parameters by 30%–40% by 2025 – always with respect to the amount of goods produced. Judging by the progress already achieved, this means another significant step towards more efficient production. Top priority is accorded to the employees at Clariant and we want to be seen as the industry’s preferred employer. Our values and goals should contribute to a motivating and challenging work environment. In this context, it is important to us that we can position ourselves as a responsible company.

Concept and photography by Jo Röttger Text by Bertram Job THE WOODLANDS, UNITED STATES Shannon B. Nicoletti 4 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS TORONTO, CANADA Luke Ng LOUISVILLE, UNITED STATES Robert Reeder CHARLOTTE, UNITED STATES Elizabeth Pullen Joe Rhinehart LAFAYETTE, UNITED STATES Ralph Cormier CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 5 — LUKE NG CA Operations Manager, BU Masterbatches – Toronto, Canada 6 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS O ur business here is color, which definitely has everything to do with diversity. A city like Toronto is enriched by its cultural diversity. That is why we do not seek out nor exclude any particular cultural or ethnic groups in our staffing requirements. When people apply for a job at our site, we focus on ensuring that we select the most qualified person from a diverse pool of candidates. A company is more successful when its team members share diverse ideas and not just ideas that are always the same. That would be like having only one tool in a toolbox. We have employees from Vietnam, the Caribbean nations, Poland, Ghana, the Philippines and many other countries. They are very well trained and driven by the same dream. We all have the same wishes for ourselves and our families. I myself came to Canada when I was eleven years old. My heritage is Chinese. In elementary school, I was the only visible minority, so I was a bit of a mystery to my schoolmates. I still remember well how I stood in line at the university to enroll. An Asian student came up to me and asked if I wanted to join the Chinese chess club. I declined. I feel that if you want to be accepted as a new member of society, everyone should be inclusive, including yourself. Today, I have a strong Canadian identity and work in an industry whose products survive generations. That’s why comprehensive waste management is all the more important. That’s why we throw away as little as possible. Cardboard, wood, metal, electronic equipment, and plastic, our main source of garbage are given a second life through recycling efforts. We achieved our environmental targets for 2015 in 2011 and we are proud of that. Sustainability is ultimately something that needs to be put into practice now. CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 7 — ELIZABETH PULLEN Industrial Hygiene Management, Corporate Sustainability & Regulatory Affairs – Charlotte, North Carolina 8 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS I only found out later in life that I enjoy teaching. It started when I was tutoring my son when he was in high school. I was able to teach him quickly how to rely on his own potential without having to rely on teachers. Then, I heard about a program in our church where the congregation wanted to help Montagnard students, an ethnic group from the Vietnamese highlands. I immediately offered to give them tutoring in science and mathematics. There’s so much that needs to be done, and that was just my part. Initially, we wanted to meet each Saturday at the library. Sometimes I found myself alone there and had to pick up some of my students from home first. Since then, they ask me over Facebook or via text message if they need help in chemistry or another subject on a certain day. This works much better. Many of them are in classes with twenty or thirty students. They need this one-on-one time. It makes me happy when they stop thinking they won’t understand the material. Once they realize their potential, their self-esteem improves. To me, they are very special, warm-hearted people. They often invite us to their homes so we can taste their food or enjoy their festivals. They also inspire a certain amount of patience in me, making me realize that you shouldn’t worry too much. These people supported the American army in Vietnam. Now there is an opportunity to help them – and in a way that allows them to help themselves. This also contributes to a more sustainable society. CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 9 — JOE RHINEHART Customer Service Manager North America, Global Business Services – Charlotte, North Carolina 10 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS I have always been blessed. My father worked for forty years in this company, and I was still in college when I started here, taking odd jobs during school breaks. I like my role in customer service. I’m always required to come up with creative solutions when I’m in touch with people. I think my life is good and that’s exactly why I would like to do something for others. That’s why I am involved in our employee-run volunteer committee to support good causes. We organize a lot of in-house fundraising events and come up with a lot of funny themes for them. A former colleague once asked me if I could participate in an event. I challenged him and said I would collect more donations than him. That actually worked because I put on a costume with goggles, a swim ring, and fins. I made a real show out of it. After that, I never stopped changing roles. I’ve been a snowman, a gnome, a racer, a parrot, and I even once wore a jacket and gloves like Michael Jackson. It probably makes it easier for me to stand up and talk in front of people when I have a costume on. These moments are special. I often get goosebumps. But first, it’s pure stress. Like a choreographer, I want to make sure that all the details of my presentation are just right and that everyone has fun. I’ve never received any negative feedback. People come up to me and say thanks because they were able to laugh and take a step back. That’s the best reward for me. It can sometimes get boring for my coworkers to always be sitting behind the computer. That’s why we do these things. At the same time, it’s an opportunity to give something back to our neighborhood in Charlotte by helping those who are less fortunate. CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 11 — RALPH CORMIER Business Development Specialist, BU Oil & Mining Services – Lafayette, Louisiana 12 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS T he first animal I hunted with a bow and arrow was at the age of 23 or 24 and I haven’t lost my excitement for it since. Meanwhile, I’ve gotten almost all my clients hooked. It’s an honor for me to show them how to do it. It’s not that easy to hit a target from 30 to 40 yards away. If you aren’t certain that you’ll make it, you’re better off not taking the shot. We only hunt a few animals at my camp because the number one rule is: if you don’t want to eat it, you shouldn’t shoot it. The oil business is a small world. I was on a rig in 1976 as a standard laborer. It’s hard to describe how close you get with your coworkers out there. You make friends quickly because you need one another. Some colleagues are now plant managers for big oil companies. When I come into their offices to talk about business, most of them have already decided to go with me. I know what these people want. I’ve been there for ages. Integrity, honesty, trust: these are the values I stand for. There is no recipe for success in this job. You need to find out how to build and maintain relationships yourself. Some people want to see me once a week, others once a month. Then we do what they like to do: fishing, golf, clay pigeon shooting, hunting. Recently, a customer absolutely wanted to cook for us. Most of them don’t want to be treated as something special, and that makes it really fun. My two grown boys are the most important thing to me. They’ve never given us any trouble. I’ve been married to the same woman for 37 years, have lived in the same house for 37 years and have worked for a previous company for 26 years. That’s my sustainability. I am very proud that I have hardly lost any customers in all these years. I love what I do and would do it for free. Just don’t tell anyone. CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 13 — SHANNON B. NICOLETTI Human Resources Partner North America – The Woodlands, Texas 14 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS I grew up in a family of firefighters and police officers and I also have some of that in my blood. In my work, I become a go-to person for most areas I touch. If someone falls down at a live concert, I’m the one who ends up caring for them. My parents are typical Californians, progressive and environmentally conscious. Being willing to help so that everything turns out okay is a way of life for us. Mom made her cleaning supplies herself, using mostly vinegar for them. I think I inherited this mind-set that you can do a lot of things for yourself. At college though, I took the easy way out and just did like everyone else. But once I was out on my own, I was reminded of what I was taught while growing up. Today, I also make a lot of things myself: hair products, lotions, deodorants, and lip balm. My husband and I try to live as organically as possible. We buy most of our food from local farms and preserve as much as possible from the last harvest. After I had my daughter, it became clearer to me how many everyday items we throw away. We spent a lot of money on eco-friendly diapers from overseas, since the childcare center could not use the cloth variety. And we made all her baby food at home and jarred it for storage. Eventually, I’d like to run a childcare center and preschool where the food comes from local farms and all items are reusable. This generation of parents wants sustainable things for their children, which will open up new markets. For these reasons, I am happy to be part of a company that has a vision for sustainability and that provides solutions that have less impact on the environment. For example in Business Unit Masterbatches, in the beginning, I was teased a bit when I asked if we had any solutions to color bioplastics. Since then, our technical and marketing groups have been working with the producers on solutions in which the plastic is lighter or is biodegradable. It’s also clear in other Business Units, that there is a push to provide more sustainable solutions. So I’m not the only one who cares, and I appreciate that this is being considered by others. It makes the world a better place. CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 15 — ROBERT REEDER Apprentice Training Supervisor, BU Catalysts – Louisville, Kentucky 16 In my Real Life 6 EMPLOYEES – 6 VIEWS W hen I heard about the new program we have for training apprentices, I put my name in right away. The apprentices are eighteen years of age on average, and it’s a pleasure to accompany them as they become the future leaders of the company. The areas we focus on are not limited to technical training. We also focus on work ethics, safety and how to conduct oneself in the working world. You can’t help but feel like a father in some ways. I know the opportunities that are available here, and I want to help young people take advantage of them. Through a Christian-based rehabilitation program, I also help young men who have encountered problems due to drug or alcohol abuse. Many of the young men in the program have lost everything, including hope. So we talk with them about how you can improve your life by changing your attitude. The success rate is quite high because it makes a difference when you feel that someone is really interested in you and understands your needs and troubles. Certainly I’ve made some bad choices in my youth, so I would never pass judgement. It’s rewarding to see that no matter how shattered a life may seem, it can be put back together again. Our farm would be a good therapeutic center for many people. It’s something about nature and animals that calms the inner man. As soon as I come home, I change my clothes and tend to the animals. I have owned horses, goats, sheep and chicken, but I currently raise cattle, mainly hybrids of Charolais and Angus. I’m trying to buy more land. Our great-grandfather from Georgia had a lot of land, most of which was sold over the years. I want to instill the value of land ownership into my children. At the end of the day, I want to be able to say I made a positive difference in this world.

Unconventional resources are a good example of where innovative HOSTAFRAC™ is an EcoTain® technology. EcoTain® products are technology has enabled oil and gas to be extracted economically those that are both sustainable and environmentally acceptable, through horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing and therefore benefit hydraulic fracturing by replacing otherwise (fracking). The hydraulic fracturing market is constantly under toxic and harmful chemicals. One example is the replacement of pressure to reduce cost, increase efficiency and address regulations 2-butoxyethanol (2-BE) with HOSTAFRAC™. and public concerns over the application of environmentally harmful chemicals. To support the application of technologies that IMPROVING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTIVITY address these points Clariant has developed the unique HOSTAFRAC™ product line. Improvements to hydraulic fracturing operations can be made in two ways. The first is to improve the efficiency of the rate at which the fracturing fluids can be pumped into the formation. The second is to ensure fast and Hydraulic fracturing involves pumping water, sand and chemicals complete removal of fracturing fluids from the reservoir when the well is at high pressure into the rock causing fractures.

Houses in need of renovation change in quick succession with newly refurbished facades; dissolved businesses provide the backdrop for newly established stores and cafés. Entire neighborhoods that had to struggle in the past are in the process of recovering. They are »in between,« as the locals would say in reference to a phase of radical change. On the corner of South 12th and West Oak Street, just along the Southern Railway tracks, this feeling of progress and change is especially evident. From early morning until late into the evening, bolting, welding and other construction work are being performed at a new facility for the production of a new-generation catalyst. The massive structure consisting of several steel braces and colorful cables growing straight out of the ground into the future. The new plant symbolizes Clariant’s strategy in the US: Maintaining proven production processes while constantly innovating to add new ideas and improvements. Here in Louisville, two catalyst manufacturing facilities are already fixtures in the community. They produce catalysts for use in various industries. The use of these catalysts enable companies to drastically reduce the consumption of energy and raw materials needed to make chemicals, and thereby minimize waste and greenhouse gases. Laboratories for research and development are located near these Clariant facilities to provide synergies between production and innovation. In this center of excellence for catalysts, capacity for additional growth with marketable innovations is being created. The substantial investment project of the company is being developed and implemented in cooperation with CB&I, a market leader in the energy infrastructure sector. Hans-Peter Gabski, the German site manager who is responsible for the production of Clariant’s Business Unit Catalysts in the US, explains: »The entire Business Unit is oriented toward growth, and its largest site in Louisville will need to support that growth.« On the construction site, no time was wasted. At peak times, three hundred craftsmen, all from US contracting companies, worked six days a week in 10-hour shifts. Armed with safety helmets and a sense of humor, they rose to challenges faced, got their job done on time, and were always optimistic. »Get the job done safely« was their most important guiding principle. 42 »The process of linking various skills together and the intercultural challenge appeal to me.« BERND HIRSCHBERG Project Director, BU Catalysts CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 43 »Theoretically, Sunday shifts would also have been possible,« admits Project Manager Bernd Hirschberg who has already managed construction projects in multiple business units, »but then efficiency would have decreased.« And that would have affected what, quite possibly, he holds closest to his heart: carrying out such a project in a way that both eliminates accidents and conserves resources. Gabski agrees. »Deadlines should be kept,« explains the site manager, »but not by compromising occupational safety and environmental protection goals. We made this message clear right at the beginning.« Sustainability and safety are prioritized in every phase and on all levels of the site. In the past two years, no accidents with downtime were ever recorded at the site – and this is their safety standard. The dedication to this project is obvious – Hirschberg and Gabski, despite being top managers, don their personal protective equipment at least once daily to check in on the construction site. They enjoy, as Gabski describes it, »the challenge of helping to erect such a facility.« »This is no small feat,« he says, »and the work leaves its mark. But my motivation is fueled by countless experiences of achievement. I am an engineer. I am fascinated by the way in which such facilities are built and put into operation.« For Hirschberg, on the other hand, the »team experience« is the appeal of his mission – and in particular, the intercultural process »of linking the various skills together.« Throughout the process, the European mentality has collided with the less formal culture in Kentucky on more than one occasion. Gabski explains that Clariant Excellence helped to ease the 44 CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 45 »It’s extremely exciting to collaborate with the policy-makers here.« HANS-PETER GABSKI Head of Production Americas, BU Catalysts 46 friction and increase efficiency throughout the collaboration. It has been no simple undertaking to »change the way we work.« This is the motto stated on the sign displayed in the »Louisville Clariant Excellence Mission Control Room«, which cannot be missed. For Gabski and the team, it has been a challenging process in which only change has remained the constant. The process forced Gabski to re-think his firm attitudes: »Sometimes, people can no longer stand hearing when someone explains that something is done in such and such a way in Germany. But: our colleagues and co-workers here in Louisville let us know about this and we can then put that perspective aside.« Changing oneself while also acting as an agent for organizational change is probably one of the most credible ways of showing one’s commitment to the mission. Today, Gabski is no longer a foreigner in »The Ville« but a citizen. His four children go to school here, and he and his wife make use of the many cultural offerings, from the theater to the Louisville Orchestra, which they support. Moreover, he has pushed to found a Community Advisory Panel with neighbors and stakeholders of the industrial plant to strengthen important relationships for the company and to further bring this great city, as Gabski calls it, forward. That also means: further towards structural growth. The reinvention of Louisville had already begun years ago. Large amounts of public funds have flowed into the renovation of the infrastructure – for instance into bridge construction and the international airport, where a logistics giant operates its Worldport and employs over 20 000 workers. The Ford Motor Company has also invested USD 800 million into its two factories. Pharmaceutical and medical technology industries are developing large research centers, centers of excellence, and rehabilitation centers in the area. In this context, Clariant’s initiative is arriving at just the right time. New high-quality jobs will be created at the production plant, increasing the head count for all three Louisville locations at 12th Street, Crittenden Drive and West Hill Street significantly. For Mayor Greg Fisher, this is »a strong signal of confidence in Louisville,« as he emphasized before the beginning of the construction work. His office provides a great deal of support, as Gabski comes to experience again and again: »It’s extremely exciting to collaborate with the policy-makers here.« In this manner, Clariant‘s project could become a catalyst on multiple levels – accelerating growth for both companies involved, as well as for the development of the Louisville metropolitan area. In any case, the chemistry between the participating parties is just right for sharing the expected success. CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 47 Procurement AND LOGISTICS 48 Procurement AND LOGISTICS C lariant is procuring products and services from around 25 000 suppliers worldwide every year. This requires significant strategic and administrative efforts, not only in a purely economic and management sense, but also to reach and maintain an optimal degree of sustainability for the products and PURCHASES IN THE BILLIONS Clariant bought goods and services worth approximately CHF 4 billion in 2015. Of this, roughly CHF 2.3 billion was allotted to raw materials from around 5 300 suppliers and around CHF 1.7 billion was allotted to other products and services such as technical equipment or energy from another 20 000 suppliers approximately.

For Clariant, sustainability does not begin with the production, but in the selection of suppliers. In the process, the sustainability standard should also be continuously increased along the supply chain at the product level and in relation with the customer. Clariant assesses suppliers in a comprehensive program based on sustainability factors such as employment conditions, respect for human rights, complaint management, environmental aspects, safety standards and creditworthiness. The criteria also include fundaCLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 49 mental aspects such as the presence of certified management sysSUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT tems.

Joint supplier review for more efficiency and PURCHASING CRITERIA FOR consistency across the entire chemical industry SUPPLIER SELECTION AT CLARIANT Sustainability Price aspects Clariant cannot undertake these screenings by itself with the necessary scope and timeliness for the great number of suppliers. For this reason, Clariant joined the »Together for Sustainability« (TfS) initiative and thus elevated the supplier sustainability monitoring to a Supplier reliability and onQuality significantly higher level. TfS was founded in 2011 as an initiative of time delivery six chemical companies to comprehensively and reliably assess and improve the chemical industry’s supply chain in terms of sustainability through a global assessment and audit program. This collaborative approach is based on state-of-the-art sustainability methodologies and an efficient exchange of data from assessment and audit results and scores. By strictly adhering to confidentiality, the initiative is always compliant with anti-trust regulations. 50 Procurement AND LOGISTICS »The Together for Sustainability initiative allows us to leverage an industry-wide approach and state-of-the-art capabilities – significantly enhancing the sustainability evaluation of our suppliers while saving cost, time, and resources.« NORBERT MERKLEIN Head of Group Procurement Services As part of the TfS initiative, the sustainability performance of a RAW MATERIAL PROCUREMENT ACCORDING TO REGIONS in CHF million supplier is assessed according to a predefined set of assessment and 2015 2014 audit criteria that are tailored to the requirements of the chemical Asia/Pacific 480 529 industry.

In doing so, Clariant’s activities support the economic development of the respective regions. However, the cooperation with suppliers is not just about monitoring. Clariant always considers suppliers as partners. To strengthen this approach, Clariant hosts various events such as the so-called Supplier Days. As part of this, Clariant presents its sustainability program and its objectives, and strives to introduce measures to implement the program together with its partners.

In addition, the packaging must also exhibit the functions that are adapted to the specific claims of the products, including oxygen barrier, moisture adsorption and regulation, light barrier, aroma enhancement, odor adsorption, anti-bacterial and anti-static. Ideally, active and passive components are already integrated in the packaging during manufacture. In the process, components such as sachets or canisters are added to the existing packaging or in some cases functionality can be mixed into the polymer used to produce the packaging component using a masterbatch (concentrate) in a single layer or one layer of a multilayer structure. This functionality can be combined with colors. For modifying the polymer used packaging material, Clariant offers with MEVOPUR® a range of solutions for this area. MEVOPUR® is manufactured in production facilities on three continents. In all facilities, the strict separation of product lines is observed. This helps to reduce the risk that products contain undesired material traces, and thereby functions that are not expressly intended. At these designated sites, the processes are verified and validated under the ISO standard 13485 for the design and manufacture of medicinal products. This drives a closer collaboration throughout the entire value chain consistently delivers the impulse for improvements for Clariant, for suppliers and for customers. pages 85, 105 CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 69 People ON ANOTHER LEVEL Photography Jo Röttger, Text Bertram Job I t is barely after noon and the water is already up to the necks of Derwood Arsement and Kyle David. The two Clariant employees, along with a few others, are strapped into a helicopter cabin that is lowered into a swimming pool via a remotecontrolled mechanism, until the water reaches the collar of their overalls, and even their heads. It seems as exciting as a movie, except that they are now a part of it themselves. A moment later, on command, the cabin is tilted with a jerk and at the same time sinks lower. Now everyone must work as quickly as possible to free themselves: out of their seats, through a removable window and into the water. Seconds later, they all emerge, swim to the edge of the pool and hear the rough voice of the trainer while they climb out: »Not bad, guys. Let’s do it again.« And then again and again. You need to have reasonably good nerves for this procedure in pool 1 of the Maritime Survival Training Center (MSTC), a facility in the immediate vicinity of the Lafayette airport in Louisiana. The »Helicopter Underwater Egress Training« (HUET) is an integral part of a course for people who work offshore such as on floating oil platforms, like Arsement and David, two account managers in the Business Unit Oil & Mining Services in the Gulf of Mexico. All day long, both employees were made familiar with precautions and emergency measures on the high seas at the MSTC, an institute of the University of Louisiana. The course starts at eight in the morning with presentations and written tests and ends, if successful, with the presentation of a certificate. However, in the middle of all of this coursework are these two to three hours in the pool in which the participants are prepared for the »worst case« scenario. What do you do if the helicopter lands in the ocean instead of on the platform? Just now, the group practiced how best to throw oneself into a life raft or, if one is not available, how to form a circle on the high seas to stay together, and how to rescue someone who is injured or unconscious. That was pure group dynamics, which are a good way to get to know each other. But in HUET, it is everyone for themselves. It’s all about not reacting in a panic. The only thing that helps is if you have already completed the course like the two Clariant employees already have. 70 »The regular training gives you an extra sense of security.« KYLE DAVID Sales Representative, BU Oil & Mining Services CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 71 He is fortunate to never have had to use it, says Kyle David, a sturdy 30-year-old man. Nevertheless, it gives you an extra sense of security, a confidence boost, when you complete the training regularly. Arsement, the bigger of the two and three years older, agrees unreservedly: »You feel a little safer.« Albert Crownover likes to hear these kinds of statements. The MSTC president lets the group repeat the quick escape from the helicopter a total of six or seven times per group. The fatigue is evident in all the students at the end. Only then is Crownover certain that they take away enough from this exercise to react appropriately in case of emergency. »We can help if someone panics,« he says with a gentle smile of an expert, »this is not like in the army, where people are being yelled at.« As a result, there are hardly any participants who do not complete the one to two-day courses successfully. Only in extreme cases, when simply nothing would help, someone would have to look for another job, unfortunately. A certain level must be met if you want to be safe. This is the guiding principle in the training center, which was founded on the initiative of a lecturer for occupational safety in 1987. The facility, which was also financed by donations from the oil industry, is now worth over a million dollars, estimates Crownover. Today, the center employs nearly a dozen people, all employees of the university. This is the only way to guarantee that the requirements of the Offshore Petroleum Industry Training Organization (OPITO) – a global consortium founded by the industry – are met. Under its umbrella, advanced education and safety training can be established with uniform standards and structures to build a sustainable, competent workforce to work in the oil and gas industry. In this way, it should be ensured »that quality, innovation and partnership underscore everything that we do.« Each year, more than 250000 participants at more than 150 locations around the world take part in the certified courses – in Lafayette, the capital of the »Cajun Country« on the Vermillion River, or elsewhere. These include Arsement and David as well as all others who work for Clariant in the Business Unit Oil & Mining Services in the Gulf of Mexico. At least every three or four years, they are prepared to withstand storms and water once again in one of the training centers – regardless of whether they are used on the platform for 72 CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 73 »We are constantly looking for new ideas in order to reduce the number of accidents at work further.« MICHAEL A. TEAGUE Head of Regional Sustainability & Regulatory Affairs North America 74 weeks or just for a day or two as a technician or consultant. After all, the »safety and security of worldwide activities« are among the most urgent objectives, as was bindingly established in 2013 in the Clariant Sustainability Policy. The ambitious principle has become standard on several levels: overall in the security concept AvoidingAccidents, as well as specifically for the volatile working environment of oil exploration and mining in »Safety Affects Everyone« (SAfE), which provides clear rules of conduct for all employees. This is based on two guiding beliefs: »All accidents and occupational illnesses can be avoided« and »Safety is everyone’s responsibility.« This safety culture and the continuous reduction of accidents and occupational illnesses is implemented in Clariant’s extensive Environmental Safety and Health Affairs (ESHA) program. »Never before has such content been so unreservedly supported at a management level,« assures Mike Teague, Head of Regional Sustainability & Regulatory Affairs North America. This reflects a clearly positive trend in the growth and maturity of our safety culture. Especially in the last ten or more years, according to Teague, »very good results« in reducing accidents at work have been able to be recorded. Nevertheless, there is no reason for euphoria, because »we are not at zero.« Still, there are many opportunities to share concepts and procedures among the experts from different companies: »We are constantly looking for new ideas, both internally and externally, in order to reduce the numbers further.« Do not slack off, never be inattentive: Derwood Arsement and Kyle David also heard this frequently at the MSCT in Lafayette. The two customer advisors have mastered the practical training as well as the theory at the end of the course. Like all the other participants, they have received the certificate with Albert Crownover’s signature and can venture out by helicopter again in the future. Out to where they are needed. Each of them probably assumes that they will never have to use the material they have learned, says Arsement, hair still wet before saying goodbye, »but you feel prepared.« This is what someone sounds like who has been through it all.

The Clariant technique is highly efficient and simultaneously very affordable, with lower operating cost and increased opportunities for reuse of water and sediment – and, with a more intense dewatering of the sediment and a more powerful filtering out of contaminants, it provides better results than other solutions. In certain cases, Invoque™ has achieved sediment solids of up to 94% in just 24 hours, producing an absolutely clear filtrate that is approved for immediate return to the environment. Less water in the sediment leads to lower weight by volume and the more dense material also results in lower absolute volume.

Without CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 91 Planet FLOWING CHANGE Photography Jo Röttger, Text Bertram Job T here are days when this river does not look like a problem at all. On the contrary, in fact. As Sam Perkins starts the freshly fueled motor boat in the first light of morning, the water is clear and smooth in front of him. On the blue border between North and South Carolina, the river fills Lake Wylie, a large reservoir, as it travels further south – where a giant carpet of water lilies floats. The water flows past densely overgrown banks, from the Blue Ridge Mountains down to Lake Marion, and passes by the Charlotte metropolitan area during its 320-mile course. Close to two million people live in the catchment area. Perkins points out that these two million expect almost everything from the Catawba River – everything from contemplative peace to unlimited water for industries, households, and recreational purposes. Perkins, who has a degree in marine science, is a kind of inspector here. »You have to keep an eye on everything,« he says as he pulls a wide headband over his ears to counter the sharp wind. »Otherwise, one day we will potentially have bigger problems here.« Despite all the joys of being outdoors and in the nature, these excursions are not leisure trips. They are aimed at determining the state and the quality of the river water, which Perkins regularly checks on behalf of a non-profit initiative, the »Catawba Riverkeeper«. It is his employer and his home in spirit, which also provides the boat that he now maneuvers against the current – past two fishermen on a wooden pier, and then past the Clariant factory premises. Once Perkins is near a wastewater treatment plant, he takes a routine water sample. »I would be cautious about eating the fish caught here,« he says. For him, this concern stems from a variety of sources, including contaminated ash from the last soon-to-be-discarded coal power plants, frequent soil erosion flushing more toxins into the river, and the discharges from some outdated sewage treatment plants. This has not led to an urgent problem yet, Perkins believes, but there is a reason that the Catawba was at the top of a list of most endangered rivers in the United States a few years ago. In addition, so many people have moved to this area recently, and more continue to come. That’s the big challenge. That is why the Riverkeeper brings the region’s collective awareness to the issues by holding numerous activities throughout the year. Organizing information days, summer festivals and community garbage removal events. 92 »Your river depends on you as much as you depend on the river.« SAM PERKINS Riverkeeper, Catawba Riverkeeper Foundation CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 93 But having a clean-looking river has more benefits than the aesthetics. This is starting to be understood slowly in the backyard of Charlotte, the second most important financial center in the United States. Beyond the tall office towers in the city of 800000 residents, a retreat area has become alarmingly popular. The daily flow of commuters feels as intense as that of megacities around peak rush hours. Similarly, the real flow, the one with water, needs to put up with a lot. It also simultaneously needs to give a lot, because so many use it: around a dozen power plants, 24 counties in two states and countless companies. The Clariant factory is also located directly on the Catawba River. A plant with approximately 150 employees, it is located in Mount Holly, not even 20 miles away from its main office in Charlotte. Intermediate products for personal care, household cleaners, and de-icing materials are manufactured in three production halls. On the opposite side of the river, in Mecklenburg County, Clariant, 94 or, to be more precise, its previous companies, operated a second plant in which dyes and other agents for jeans and textiles were made until production was stopped in 2005. The facility was retired partially due to environmental problems, such as inherited liabilities from previous operations. That was the right decision to make, especially for someone like Michael A. Teague, Head of Regional Sustainability & Regulatory Affairs for Clariant in North America. »Industry makes a positive contribution to the economy, but historically, it often left residual impacts on the environment,« he says in retrospect. The Doctor of Chemistry remembers that the Catawba was once called the »Rainbow River« because the textile mills operating at that time allowed their colored waste water to drain into its bed untreated. He was one of the »Change Agents« in the company who continued the dialog early on with the authorities and citizens’ initiatives such as Riverkeeper. In doing so, a new path was forged in which profitability and environmental protection were considered equal – for the sake of sustainability. »We want to be certain that our production does not compromise the river,« says Michael. »We have a footprint here, and we have an obligation.« These are clear signals of a paradigm shift. Over the years, internal sewage treatment equipment and detention reservoirs have continually been upgraded at the remaining plant in Mount Holly. Here, the waste water is first thoroughly filtered before it is released to the municipal wastewater authority for additional treatment, before ultimately entering the river in a harmless state. The area around the retired factory is now devoted to new uses. Michael’s satisfaction is quickly felt when he shows visitors what has developed in the area since the factory shut down. ReVenture Park is located there, which builds on the infrastructure of the former factory: an invitation to eco-industrial startup companies to expand on favorable terms on the repurposed CLARIANT SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 95 »We want to be certain that our production does not compromise the river.« MICHAEL A. TEAGUE Head of Regional Sustainability & Regulatory Affairs North America 96 grounds. To this end, an independent project manager has entered into a rent-to-buy agreement with Clariant. Gradually, young companies are beginning to settle there. Green duckweed, a biomass source for the production of alternative energy, shimmers on the surface of a heated pond. Silkworms are raised on a plantation with mulberry bushes. Their thread can even be used to strengthen body armor for the US armed forces. There are forward-looking projects made as sustainable as possible in every way. Closer to the river, there are rolling hills amongst forests and meadows – a nature reserve to which Clariant has also entrusted several hectares to Catawba Lands Conservancy (CLC) for supervision and care. The non-profit land trust puts together these kinds of donations like puzzle pieces in order to preserve the areas along the river from private or commercial use. CLC aims to preserve clean water, biodiversity and local farms as well as to provide public access. Along these lines, CLC also acts as lead agency on a decades-long project – the Carolina Thread Trail – which is expected to weave through 15 counties, joining scenic and historical sites into one picturesque trail. More than 220 miles of the planned trail network are already established, such as the area near Long Creek, a tributary of the Catawba. Here, the path also runs through the U.S. National Whitewater Center, a lively water sport area where excursionists and top athletes alike race down the artificial whitewater courses in canoes and rafts. Or you can get to the river via a narrow access point where you can try out a canoe similar to what the Catawba Indians used to use for fishing, back during a time when the area was not as populated. People on the river – this is the exact meaning of »Catawba« in the language of the original inhabitants. This word encompasses everyone: from the hikers and bikers on the »Thread Trail« to the shift workers in Mount Holly, Sam Perkins, the inspector in the green jacket, and Michael Teague, nature enthusiast and facilitator of sustainability. If more people understood the implications of our treatment of water sources, Perkins is convinced they would do more to protect it, because »your river depends on you as much as you depend on the river.« It is just the beginning and a flowing change for the better.

In order to protect the wood building material against weathering and maintain the natural feel and integrity of the surfaces, the wood must be treated with suitable products. In addition, the risk of fires spreading can be reduced through the use of flame retardants. 102 Social RESPONSIBILITY How important are safety issues when it So sustainability played an important What challenges arose during the comes to your building project? role in the decision to build a wooden construction of a home made of wood? — house? — NIKO SCHÄFER Safety is a very important — ANN KRISTIN SCHÄFER As a natural buildtopic particularly with children, and NIKO SCHÄFER Exactly – because anyone ing material, wood is subject to change over it is something which we have considered who has children also thinks of the longtime.

Exolit®, however, is a stability and low weight. This provides benhighly effective protection against fire made from polyphosphates and is halogen-free, and therefore does not contain chlorine or bromine. The product has both a very good performance profile as well as an exefits when conducting the structural analycellent environmental and health profile. For example, Exolit® has flame-resistant properties in its ability sis for a new building. Walls can be made to foam. The protective layer then insulates from heat and blocks the supply of oxygen. In this manner, thinner, allowing for a larger living space the spread of fire to sensitive building components and potential ignition sources is prevented or at least delayed. In the event of fire, there is significantly less smoke than from many other flame retardants, using the same floor area. In addition, wood which allows more time to escape and to fight the fire. provides a pleasant indoor climate, has good thermal insulation properties and is Ceridust® helps protect wood from surface damage. Ceridust® is made from polysaccharides from renewable raw materials that do not compete with the food supply. As a bio-based additive, the product is an widely available to a sufficient degree at innovative solution for a wide range of wood coatings for effective protection of wood. Its suitability for comparatively low prices. water-based formulations can help manufacturers of coatings in the transition to environmentally compatible solutions. Combined with Hostavin® 3330, a water-based dispersion for UV protection of wood surfaces, a set of sustainable products is available for the wood treatment. The products Hostavin®, Ceridust® 8090 TP/9091 TP as well as a wide range of Exolit® solutions have been awarded the EcoTain® label due to their outstanding performance and sustainability profile.
