After the launch, the K-food application rose high on the lists of the most downloaded free apps in Finland. By the end of the year, the application was available in iPhone, Windows Phone and Android versions. By the beginning of March 2016, as many as 120,000 customers had already downloaded the application. In addition to personal benefits and special offers, the application recommends to customers such products they might be interested in based on their shopping history. The application also has nearly 6,000 recipes directly available to customers.

Now we also offer a mobile app with their personal benefits and the store's other special offers handily displayed and added to the shopping list,” says Mika Kakko, Sales Director of Kesko’s grocery trade. The application also offers ideas and inspiration for cooking. The recipe search function includes special diets and the app also suggests the most popular, easy, affordable, topical recipes using seasonal ingredients. The Palokangas family tested the K-food mobile app and commented on it in the Pirkka magazine in January 2016: ”It was good that after finding the recipe I could add all the ingredients needed to my shopping list with one click. In the store, it is easy to delete products from the list by clicking them and see what is missing. The application is also useful when deciding what to make for dinner,” says Mari Palokangas.

With their cooperation, Kesko and DHL aim to respond to the increasing popularity of e-commerce. “Our partnering with DHL is bringing the world close to our customers. Parcels transported by DHL can be conveniently picked up while shopping with us,” says Tommi Kasurinen, Vice President for finance, store sites and logistics of Kesko's home improvement and speciality goods trade. In spring 2015, Starbucks and the K-Group agreed to open Starbucks coffee shops at K-stores across Finland. The first one was opened at K-citymarket Sello in Espoo. In the future, Starbucks coffee shops will be opened in various parts of Finland. “We want to offer K-store customers a new kind of experience by providing them with an opportunity to enjoy a high quality coffee shop experience when shopping for groceries. The core of Starbucks’ operations lies in delivering a superior customer experience, which is also of key importance for K-stores,” says Jorma Rauhala, Senior Vice President of Kesko’s grocery trade division.

We have long delivered food supplies to institutional kitchens in the Mikkeli region. In 2014, when I heard about Kesko’s plans to start online food sales I became interested. At the same time, Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences launched a project called ’Customer-oriented home food services’, which we were asked to contribute to. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 30 Strategy report > This is how we operate > The customer in everything we do When collaboration with the City of Mikkeli was confirmed, the introduction of the click and collect service proceeded rapidly. This collaboration remains an important part of the service. Domestic help workers place their customers’ grocery orders online and we pick the items at the agreed time. Each domestic help worker then collects all of the purchases for her or his area from the store. Customers order a wide range of products online: from fruit to dairy products and household tissues. Currently most of the people using the click and collect service are also customers of the municipal service for the elderly. The second largest group are families with small children. Daily routines become easier for families with children if they can place orders online at home. Customers can choose whether to collect shopping from the store or order home delivery. If delivery is chosen, the shopping is taken directly to the kitchen if the customer so wishes. We think this service is socially significant. Together with domestic help, we can efficiently handle food shopping for the elderly. Staff can pick items for as many as ten old people during one trip round the store premises. Thanks to this collaboration, the store has been able to take on one more fulltime employee. This excellent service should be increasingly highlighted to consumers. This is a very favourably priced and quick way to shop for groceries for the whole week. Customers who use the service have praised it and would not like to return to the old system. The online food store is a new way to save time. The click and collect service requires the store to be accurate. Staff must know the products and the entire store thoroughly. When picking products, special attention must be paid to their size options and EAN codes, so that the item that ends up in the basket is definitely the one the customer has ordered.

Can you get around every part of the store in a wheelchair? How does a visually impaired person handle payment at the checkout? Do security guards follow members of the Romany community who shop in stores? These were some of the issues discussed by the consumer panels organised as part of Kesko’s human rights assessment. In 2014, Kesko started to assess human rights related impacts in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 33 Strategy report > This is how we operate > The customer in everything we do As part of the human rights assessment we listened to our stakeholders’ views on matters such as how they feel about human rights in customer situations. In the autumn of 2015, we organised four consumer panels. On the basis of these, two more extensive customer surveys were carried out, involving about 600 customers. The panels discussed the experiences of the disabled, rehabilitees with mental problems, immigrants and other special groups when shopping in stores and what could be done to correct the faults. “The discussions revealed that special groups should be taken into account to a greater extent from the planning stage of the store or service. Even neighbourhood stores should provide unrestricted access to all, older customers would like to have magnifying glasses on shelf edges to help reading, and many special groups would like assistance and unhurried presence for payment at checkouts,” says Matti Kalervo, Kesko’s Vice President for Corporate Responsibility. Feedback helps improve the customer experience The Non-Discrimination Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, nationality, state of health or other personal characteristics. No group as a whole must be judged on the basis of the actions of one member of the group. Many of the panel participants said, however, that they have sometimes been discriminated against when shopping or applying for a job. A representative of the Romany community said that store security guards often follow her when she goes shopping. Young people feel that they are treated differently from other customers, while immigrants are less keen on shopping because of their inadequate knowledge of Finnish. Consumer panel participants were pleased that the organisers wanted to hear about their experiences and wishes. Several ideas came up during the discussion about how to further improve the shopping experience: • Staff should be trained to understand diversity and multi-cultural issues Kesko's Annual Report 2015 34 Strategy report > This is how we operate > The customer in everything we do • More people belonging to special groups should be employed on apprenticeship contracts, for example • Low-income people also want to eat healthily, so special offers should include more healthy products • Store signage is also needed at sitting height and in plain language, as suggested by panel members The human rights assessment is expected to be completed during the first half of 2016.

Since the spring of 2015, the laboratory has focused on monitoring the quality of groceries and, above all, on microbiological determinations, such as monitoring salmonella and listeria levels. All new own-brand products – those in the Pirkka and K-Menu ranges – are analysed carefully several times. “Each new product to be included in the range goes through a multi-stage survey which consists of lab analyses and sensory evaluations. The quality and safety of the first finished lot of a new product are checked before the product is approved for sale. In accordance with our lot monitoring plan, we also regularly check that the quality of the product remains at the required high level,” says Kesko’s Product Quality Manager, Timo Kivi. The quality of the lab’s performance is assessed every year The Product Research laboratory is a T251 testing laboratory that has been accredited by the FINAS accreditation services. It is the only research laboratory for trading sector own-label products that has been approved to comply with the SFSEN ISO/IEC 17025 standard. An annual accreditation survey is conducted in which external reviewers of the FINAS accreditation services assess the performance and quality of the laboratory and its analyses. The quality of measurements and accuracy of results are ensured when analysis methods are validated and measuring instruments are calibrated. The laboratory annually participates in comparative surveys in which several laboratories from different countries assess factors such as the salt content of the same sample.

The K-maatalous Experimental Farm plays a significant role in the development of the Finnish food chain. Many new plants have found their way to the Finnish production and dinner tables thanks to the development and research carried out by the experimental farm. The cultivation programme concept of the K-maatalous Experimental Farm contains the know-how farmers need to be able to produce the best quality food. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 40 Strategy report > This is how we operate > Quality as the basis of our work The K-maatalous Experimental Farm in Hauho focuses on the development of varieties and research work promoting sustainable cultivation methods and better domestic food production. The research conducted on the farm aims to provide K-maatalous retailers and farmers with tested solutions for making productive product choices and optimising their harvests. During the growth season in Finland, the length of the day – the number of hours of light – is longer than in other areas on the globe where agriculture is practiced. Due to the short and intensive growth season, plants must adapt to the special circumstances in our country. ”Over the years, the Experimental Farm has made several agricultural machinery innovations and developed cultivation technology and completely new plants for Finnish production. The new varieties developed and tested here include beef tomatoes, root vegetables for stock and, most recently, autumn barley. The suitability of the varieties must be tested before they can be adopted for cultivation, and this is what we do for the farmers,” says Marjo Serenius, Research Director of the Kmaatalous Experimental Farm. Sustainable cultivation for decades to come The experimental farm has been operating for over 50 years and also looks further into the future. The farm plans to study how to maintain the soil’s growth potential and keep it productive for future generations. The future impacts of climate change on agriculture have been considered on the experimental farm. “According to scenarios, we may be suffering from drought in the spring, wider variations in temperatures and heavy occasional rains. All this makes farming more difficult, though global warming should also enable the cultivation of southern plant varieties here in the north. Nobody knows yet for certain if soybean, for example, could be cultivated at these latitudes in the future,” says Serenius. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 41 Strategy report > This is how we operate > Quality as the basis of our work Farming may become highly important to Finland. In line with climate change scenarios, the land areas that are currently fertile will dry out or become otherwise unsuitable for farming. “This means that cultivation has to move to new areas in order to ensure food production around the globe. Maybe farming will, to some extent, be replaced with other means of food production, such as the artificial production of proteins or insects.” Responsible purchasing Our customers can always trust that the products Special attention is paid to human rights issues available at the K-Group stores are responsible and working conditions in the purchasing chain. choices.

She earns 200–300 Thai baht (5–8 euro) per day by gutting and drying fish. Her youngest child, seven-year-old Tai, was born in Thailand. The girl has not yet started school. In response to her enquiries, Pa has been receiving the same answer: there is no room at schools. ”I want my daughter to go to school. If there is no other choice, I will send her back to Cambodia. Then I would see her only once or twice a year,” Pa says. Rights also belong to migrant workers In the fish and shrimp industry of Thailand, cases often arise in which the rights of migrant workers are violated. In some cases, they are forced to work excessive hours. Both the EU and the USA have criticised the government of Thailand for not systematically intervening in violations of human rights in the fish industry. Plan International, an organisation that promotes children’s rights, works with local operators and Kesko to improve the conditions of migrant workers in the Thai fish industry. The aim of the project is to prevent all types of abuse and enable schooling and vocational training for migrant workers’ children. It’s great that Kesko considers it important to support children’s rights on a long term basis. By promoting the schooling and protection of migrant workers’ children, Kesko can help us prevent human rights risks, such as child labour, in the production chain. This is in line with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the international Convention on the Rights of the Child. Joint efforts to find solutions to challenges faced by the fish industry Investments in children’s education and vocational skills do not alone permanently solve the malpractices and human rights risks in the fish industry of Thailand.

It is also about quality and experiences. K-retailer entrepreneurship provides strength to local communities and also gives a lot to K-food store customers. At the beginning of 2015, the K-Group started to build up an increasingly rich Finnish food culture together with its customers and suppliers. K-food retailers across Finland offer Finnish consumers the best of both worlds: low prices combined with quality, freshness, domestic origins and diversity. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 91 Strategy report > Divisions > Grocery trade One of the most visible actions in these terms was the ’Thank the Producer’ operating model. The purpose is to highlight Finnish food production and raise discussion about the welfare of Finnish agriculture. In November and December, K-store customers buying groceries for Christmas had a chance to buy a ’Thank the Producer’ pig card for one euro. The proceeds from the sale of the cards were tripled and remitted in full by the K-Group to Finnish pig farmers in cooperation with the Central Union of Agricultural Producers and Forest Owners (MTK) and meat companies. Another example of the both/and mindset were the local food dates that were organised in six locations in 2015 to help Kretailers and local producers in networking. The events will continue in 2016.

Which part of the world does the product come from? While the question is simple, the answer may be far from that. There are over 2,500 Pirkka products, which contain thousands of ingredients. Kesko aims to identify the entire supply chain of these products, while also ensuring that the ingredients are responsibly sourced. Work to assess the origin of the ingredients in own brand groceries started in spring 2015. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 95 Strategy report > Divisions > Grocery trade Sohvi Vähämaa, who was completing her Master’s degree studies in business and economics, was given the task of establishing the countries of origin of the ingredients in Kesko’s own brands in the grocery trade. Sohvi began her risk assessment of the ingredients one product group at a time. The origins of the ingredients in some products had already been identified but the situation was less clear for other products and more work was needed. “Working with one product often takes time, as cereals or biscuits, for instance, may have 20–30 ingredients from all over the world. Cooperation with product managers and suppliers has been great and the missing information about the origins of ingredients has been well complemented,” Sohvi says. By the end of 2015, Sohvi had established the countries of origin of the ingredients in all Pirkka and K-Menu products. In the future, an ingredient survey will be carried out whenever a new product is introduced into the selections. Special attention is paid to products from high-risk countries, though the quantities imported from these countries are small (1.2% of all Kesko’s purchases in 2015). “The number of ingredients is so large that we will carry out a risk analysis. With the help of the high-risk country tool, we will assess which products contain such ingredients from high-risk countries that may require further assessment. Then we will set out to ensure that the ingredients are responsibly produced in cooperation with the supplier,” Sohvi says.

Everything went according to plan during its first year in operation. The Ecotruck significantly improves logistics efficiency, being able to carry more than a traditional trailer combination. In Finland, a country with long distances, the transportation of temperature-controlled groceries is challenging. ”The first year went according to plan and we had no setbacks. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 98 Strategy report > Divisions > Grocery trade And no complaints about the larger-than-normal truck were heard from other people on the road,” says Toni Pelin, Keslog's Environment and Safety Manager. Carbon dioxide emissions from transportation are one of the most significant environmental impacts. The large quantity of goods carried by the Ecotruck cuts the total transport distance, thereby also cutting emissions. The Ecotruck may reduce the annual number of transport journeys by as many as 600, which corresponds to 360,000 kilometres between southern and northern Finland. The Ecotruck is 34 metres long and its full load mass is 90 tonnes. It operates between the central warehouses in Vantaa and the Kempele terminal in the Oulu distribution area.

According to studies, Finnish consumers have strong confidence in national food production. This confidence is justified and is the result of hard work. There are around 50,000 active farms in Finland. The objective of Finnish food production is to produce high-quality and tasty food. Our northern climate is favourable from the viewpoint of animal and plant health, and farmers annually invest millions of euros to keep agriculture free from salmonella and to improve animal welfare. By global comparisons, requirements concerning the environment and animal welfare are very strict in Finnish food production. Compliance with these Kesko's Annual Report 2015 102 Strategy report > Divisions > Grocery trade requirements is part of producers’ corporate responsibility but this comes with costs. The profitability of agriculture has been very low in recent years. In order to be able to offer domestic food to Finnish consumers in years to come, the profitability of agriculture must be improved. Farmers, who are entrepreneurs on their own farms, are the key operators in this process. The trading sector plays a strong role in the food chain and has an influence on consumers’ behaviour. For its part, the sector is also responsible for the future of the Finnish food chain. The pursuit of low prices alone also leads to poor results from the viewpoint of consumers. Kesko has set a good example by highlighting the quality and the importance of domestic origin in the discussion about food and by carrying out the ’Thank the Producer’ campaign together with producers, thus providing consumers with an opportunity to directly support Finnish producers.

The selection focuses on home furnishing and decoration products, paints and tools.

Customers may purchase goods on their way to work or place orders on the internet for collection. We do our utmost to make shopping fun,” says Virpi Viinikainen, Chain Director for K-rauta. K-rauta Express stores are always satellite stores for larger Krauta retailers. This enables the smaller store to leverage the selections, logistics and other operations of a larger K-rauta store. The first K-rauta Express was opened in the Forum shopping centre in central Helsinki in August 2015 and the second one opened in the Sello shopping centre in Espoo in November. The concept will be tested in these stores, and further development and a decision on its expansion will be made on the basis of this trial.

K-Myllypuro does not belong to any of the current K-food store chains  instead, it is the K-Group’s test store. In the test store, Kesko, in cooperation with the retailer entrepreneur, will boldly experiment with various food store concepts and models. The test store also takes customerorientation to a completely new level – customers will decide how the store, its product selections and services develop in the future.

Agility means that ideas can be rapidly tested in practice. When a new concept is being built, key issues include adapting the store according to the wishes of local customers, which means that the store is being tailored to look how its customers want it to look and to constantly provide them with better service. Influences were sought for the test store and the most recent retailing trends were gathered from home and across the world. Today, customers particularly appreciate convenient locations and selections of local foods, easy shopping and a wide choice of fresh products, which form the core of the test store. %!'&' %!'&' %& %%!'(&' %& %%!'(&' %!& &%)  &% ) &-&' %& ( &-&' %& %%' %%'(!'& (!'& %!' ' '' ' !* &( &(& & ! ! (%  (%  &' !&!  1', %' % &' %&&( &' %&&(& & &% )&(& &%)&( & 1% 1% ('('  1 %' 1&(#% %' • Total number of • Total number of K-markets: 476 • Total number of K-citymarkets: 81 • Average total sales area: 380 m² K-supermarkets: 219 • Total number of K-rauta stores in • Average number of products on • Average total sales area: Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia sale: 5,000 K-supermarket 1,250 m² and Russia: 93 • Average number of products on • Average total sales area: sale: K-supermarket 10,000 K-citymarket 6,300 m², K-rauta 5,800–9,100 m² • Average number of products on sale: K-citymarket groceries 18,000, K-rauta even 170,000 Kesko's Annual Report 2015 134 Strategy report > Divisions > Store sites 5 ! !' ! ' ! ' '.& .&(&&((&&('' '' '% '% A social media mayor, a harvest party and an art wall painted by the young are some of the new ways of including local inhabitants in the construction of the new centre in eastern Helsinki. Kesko is building a new urban centre in Itäkeskus, Helsinki. The key themes of the centre are food, social life, easy daily life, leisure and wellbeing. The building project will take several years. The first part, which will house the new K-citymarket, will be completed at the end of 2017. It is estimated that the second part will be completed in 2019. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 135 Strategy report > Divisions > Store sites The new urban centre is being built in the middle of the compact urban structure. Efforts have been made to include local inhabitants in the project at the construction phase. The aim of this involvement is both to maintain interest in the project and create a strong bond between local inhabitants and the new centre even before it is opened. The most important channel to reach the public is social media, where Anna, the social media mayor of Itäkeskus, comments on the building project with pictures and postings. The aim is to help information about the project spread easily and to keep the tone of the communications personal and friendly. During the building project, we are also organising events related to the key themes of the new centre. In September, we held a harvest party where customers had the chance to try street food in the yard of the K-citymarket. Local young students of Helsinki Art School painted a food collage on the temporary inner wall of the current K-citymarket store. Facts of the project • The first phase of the project will comprise 20,000 m2 of rental area, which will also house the new K-citymarket. The opening will be in 2017. The total rental area will be 50,000 m2. The second part of the centre is expected to be completed in 2019. • The capital expenditure of the first phase totals €100 million. Its employment impact is about 250 person-years over two years. • When fully completed, the area will form the largest commercial cluster in Northern Europe together with the Itis shopping centre.

Kesko's Annual Report 2015 336 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 2. Segment information Note 2. Segment information The Group's reportable segments are composed of the Group's divisions, namely the grocery trade, the home improvement and speciality goods trade, and the car trade. Segment information is reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker, responsible for allocating resources to the operating segments, has been identiﬁed as the Group Management Board. The reportable operating segments derive their net sales from the food trade, the home improvement and speciality goods trade, and the car trade. Sales between segments are charged at prevailing market rates. The Group Management Board assesses the segments' performances based on operating proﬁt, operating proﬁt adjusted for non-recurring items, and return on capital employed. Exceptional transactions outside the ordinary course of business are treated as non-recurring items and allocated to the segments. The Group identiﬁes gains and losses on the disposal of real estate, shares and operating activities, impairments and costs of discontinuing signiﬁcant operations and restructurings as non-recurring items. Gains on disposals are presented in the income statement within other operating income, and losses on disposals within other operating expenses. In other respects, the Management Board’s performance monitoring is in full compliance with IFRS reporting. Finance income and costs are not allocated to the segments, as the Group’s cash and cash equivalents are managed by the Group Treasury. Changes in the fair values of intra-Group foreign exchange forward contracts entered into are reported as part of other operating income and expenses to the extent that they hedge the segments’ foreign exchange risk. The assets and liabilities of a segment’s capital employed consist of operating items that can be justiﬁably allocated to the segments. The assets of capital employed comprise property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, investments accounted for using the equity method and other investments, pension assets, inventories, trade receivables and other non-interest-bearing receivables, interest-bearing receivables and assets held for sale. The liabilities of capital employed consist of trade payables, other non-interest-bearing liabilities and provisions. The Group’s real estate assets and the revenue and costs generated from them have been allocated to the segments. Capital employed does not include deferred tax assets and liabilities, ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss, except for fair value measurements of foreign exchange forward contracts recognised in the balance sheet, available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets, cash and cash equivalents, or interest-bearing liabilities.

Kesko's Annual Report 2015 345 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 3. Business acquisitions and assets disposed of Note 3. Business acquisitions and assets disposed of Acquisitions In 2015 and 2014, Kesko Group did not have acquisitions to be accounted for as business combinations. On 18 November 2015, Kesko Corporation's subsidiary Kesko Food Ltd made an agreement to acquire the whole share capital of Suomen Lähikauppa Oy from the private equity investment ﬁrm Triton. The net sales of Suomen Lähikauppa in 2014 were €999.2 million, it has 643 Siwa and Valintatalo stores and 4,100 employees. The transaction price of the debt-free acquisition, structured as a share purchase, is approximately €60 million. The completion of the acquisition is subject to the approval of the Finnish Competition and Consumer Authority and the fulﬁlment of the other terms and conditions of the transaction. The handling of the matter and the acquisition are expected to be completed in the ﬁrst half of 2016. Disposal of assets In March 2015, Kesko sold the department store chain Anttila Oy to the German investment fund 4K INVEST at a price of €1 million. The transaction included all assets and liabilities in Anttila Oy. Anttila Oy's approximately 1,500 employees continue in the employment of the company. The date of the transaction was 16 March 2015. A €-130 million non-recurring loss was recorded on the transaction relating to the ﬁnancing, working capital and ﬁxed assets of Anttila. In June, Kesko, AMF Pensionsförsäkring and Ilmarinen established a joint real estate investment company. The joint venture owns, manages and develops store sites primarily used by Kesko Group. Kesko sold some of its store sites in both Finland and Sweden to the established joint venture. The fair value of the store sites sold totalled €485 million and a €75.6 million non-recurring gain on the sale was recorded. The cash inﬂow generated by the arrangement was €403 million. In addition, Kesko sold four properties to Kesko Pension Fund. A €22.9 million non-recurring gain on the sale was recorded. In 2014, Kesko Group did not make any signiﬁcant disposals of assets.

The Group identiﬁes gains and losses on disposal of real estate, shares and business operations, impairment charges and signiﬁcant costs of discontinuing business operations and restructurings as non-recurring items. Gains on disposal have been presented within other operating income, and losses on disposal within other operating expenses in the income statement. Impairment charges have been presented within depreciation, amortisation and impairment in the income statement. The non-recurring items for 2015 include a €130 million loss on the divestment of Anttila, and gains on disposal of properties in the amount of €101.0 million. Due to Intersport Russia's low volume and unproﬁtable performance, Kesko plans to withdraw from the Russian sports trade in 2016. Relating to the restructuring of Intersport Russia's operations, a total of €17.2 million of non-recurring impairment charges and provisions were recorded in the fourth quarter. In 2014, non-recurring items included a restructuring provision recognised for the reduction of the Anttila department store network and an impairment charge on ﬁxed assets related to the integration of K-citymarket non-food with Anttila, to a total of €46.8 million. In addition, the non-recurring items included a restructuring provision of €5.2 million related to changes in the retail business of Byggmakker in Norway, €4.2 million of personnel reduction costs related to the change in Kesko's divisional structure and a €21.0 million impairment charge on property related to the renovation of Kesko's main oﬃce building.

Hyperinﬂationary accounting requires the presentation of ﬁnancial statements in the measurement units as at the end of the reporting period irrespective of their statement at original cost or current cost. The amounts recognised in the income statement and balance sheet were restated using the general price index. As a result of the restatement, an amount of €4.5 million including tax was recognised in equity in 2014, of which €0.4 million was attributable to the Group and €4.1 million to the non-controlling interests. The revaluations were made using the Belarusian consumer price index. Hyperinﬂationary accounting was discontinued in 2015, because the country is no longer a hyperinﬂationary economy. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 353 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 10. Earnings per share Note 10. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net proﬁt for the period attributable to the parent’s equity holders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of all shares to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares. Until 30 April 2014, the Group operated a share option scheme with a dilutive eﬀect, which increased the number of shares. The share options had a dilutive eﬀect when their exercise price was lower than the fair value of a share. The dilutive eﬀect was the number of shares which had to be issued without consideration, because the Group could not use the assets received from the exercise of the share options to issue an equal number of shares at fair value. The fair value of a share was based on the average share price during the period. 2015 2014 Profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the parent, € million 101.6 96.0 Number of shares Weighted average number of shares outstanding 99,113,741 99,054,293 Effect of options issued 106,375 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 99,113,741 99,160,668 Earnings per share from profit attributable to equity holders of the parent Basic, € 1.03 0.97 Diluted, € 1.03 0.97 Kesko's Annual Report 2015 354 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 11.

The units have been identiﬁed by chain/country, and most of them are legal entities. The useful lives of trademarks (brands) included in intangible assets have been classiﬁed as indeﬁnite, because it has been estimated that the period over which they generate cash inﬂows is indeﬁnite. This is because no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inﬂows for the Group can be seen. Trademarks are part of assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives are tested annually for possible impairment and whenever there is an indication of impairment. Impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets In impairment testing, the recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on valuein-use calculations. These calculations use cash ﬂow projections based on ﬁnancial plans approved by management, covering a period of three years. The key assumptions used for the plans are total market growth and proﬁtability trends, changes in store site network, product and service selection, pricing and movements in operating costs. Cash ﬂows beyond this period have been extrapolated mainly based on 1.0–4.0% (1.0–3.5%) forecast growth rates, allowing for country-speciﬁc diﬀerences. The discount rate used is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) after tax, speciﬁed for each segment and country and adjusted for tax eﬀect in connection with the test. The WACC formula inputs are riskfree rate of return, market risk premium, industry-speciﬁc beta factor, target capital structure, borrowing Kesko's Annual Report 2015 359 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 12. Intangible assets cost and country risks. Compared to the previous year, the discount rates fell in the building and home improvement trade in Estonia and Lithuania. The changes were mainly due to the decrease in the general interest rate level and changes in country risks. Impairment losses There were no impairment charges recognised on goodwill or intangible rights in the ﬁnancial years 2015 and 2014. Sensitivity analysis The key variables used in impairment testing are the EBITDA margin and the discount rate. The most sensitive to movements in assumptions in the home improvement and speciality goods trade are the brand related to the Byggmakker business in Norway, the goodwill related to the business operations in Russia and the goodwill of the machinery trade. If their residual EBITDA decreased by more than 0.2-0.5 percentage points, an impairment would be recognised. Regarding the other cash generating units, according to management’s estimates, a foreseeable change in any key variable would not create a situation in which the unit’s recoverable amount would be lower than its carrying amount.

Kesko's Annual Report 2015 365 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 17. Pension assets Note 17. Pension assets The Group operates several pension plans in diﬀerent operating countries. In Finland, the statutory pension provision of personnel is provided through pension insurance companies and the voluntary supplementary pension provision is mainly provided through Kesko Pension Fund. The statutory pension provision provided through pension insurance companies is a deﬁned contribution plan. The supplementary pension provision provided through Kesko Pension Fund is a deﬁned beneﬁt plan. As regards foreign subsidiaries, the pension plan operated in Norway is classiﬁed as a deﬁned beneﬁt plan. As at 31 December 2015, the net liability in respect of the deﬁned beneﬁt plan in Norway was €0.3 million (€0.6 million). The deﬁned beneﬁt plan in Norway is not included in the tables below, because its impact on the consolidated amounts is insigniﬁcant. The pension plans in the other foreign subsidiaries are managed in accordance with local regulations and practices in each country and they are deﬁned contribution plans. Kesko Pension Fund Kesko Pension Fund is a pension provider of its members providing supplementary retirement beneﬁts to employees who are beneﬁciaries of the Pension Fund's department A. Department A was closed on 9 May 1998. As the conditions set out in the Fund's rules are met, beneﬁciaries between 60 and 65 years of age are granted an old-age pension. The amount of retirement beneﬁt granted by the Fund is the diﬀerence between the employee's retirement beneﬁt based on his/her pensionable salary calculated in accordance with the Fund's rules and the statutory pension. In addition to the individually calculated pensionable salary, the retirement beneﬁt amount of each beneﬁciary is impacted by the duration of his/ her membership of the Pension Fund. At the end of 2015, the Pension Fund had 2,763 beneﬁciaries, of whom 662 were active employees and 2,101 were retired employees. Kesko Group's contribution to the Pension Fund's obligation is 96.7% (97.1%). The notes present Kesko Group's interest in the Pension Fund except for the analysis of assets by category and the maturity analysis of the obligation. In addition to its rules, the Pension Fund's operations are regulated by the Employee Beneﬁt Funds Act, the decrees under the Act and oﬃcial instructions, and the Fund's operations are controlled by the Financial Supervisory Authority. The regulations include stipulations on the calculation of pension obligation and its coverage, for example. The pension obligation shall be fully covered by the plan assets, any temporary deﬁcit is only allowed exceptionally. In addition, the regulations include detailed stipulations on the acceptability of the covering assets and the diversiﬁcation of investment risks. Kesko Group does not expect to pay contributions to the Pension Fund in 2016. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 366 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 17.

The objective of the amendments is to extend working life in order that the ﬁnancing of the statutory earnings-related pension scheme and suﬃcient pension provision can be ensured. The estimated impact of the pension reform on the Group's supplementary deﬁned beneﬁt schemes has been taken into account when calculating the amount of pension obligation in the ﬁnancial statements of 31 December 2015 in respect of those pension promises on which the reform will impact without a Kesko's Annual Report 2015 371 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 17. Pension assets separate decision. Owing to the pension reform, the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation increased by €2 million and the change is included in actuarial gains and losses. In cases where the impacts of the pension reform on the amount of the deﬁned beneﬁt pension obligation require separate decisions to be made, possible impacts are recorded for the ﬁnancial year in which the decisions are made. Risks related to pension plan Asset related risks The Pension Fund's investment assets comprise properties, shares and equity funds, private equity funds and both long-term and short-term money market investments. The Pension Fund's investment policy deﬁnes the investment restrictions pertaining to classes of assets and the allowed investees. The investment plan, annually conﬁrmed by the Pension Fund board, sets the investment allocation and return targets for the year ahead. The objective of investing activity is to secure a return on the investments and their convertibility into cash, as well as ensuring appropriate diversity and diversiﬁcation of investments. On an annual basis, the objective is to exceed the Pension Fund's obligation expenses and costs, so that contributions need not be charged to the members. The long-term target return on investment activity is 5.0%. The risks involved in investing activity are managed by continuously monitoring market developments and analysing the adequacy of the return and risk potential of the investments. The returns compared to chosen reference indices and the breakdown of investments are reported on a monthly basis. In 2015, the realised return on investing activity was 6.5%. If the return on investment assets underperforms the discount rate applied to the calculation of the present value of deﬁned pension obligation, a deﬁcit in the plan may arise. The diversiﬁcation of assets is aimed to reduce this risk in varying ﬁnancial conditions. If a deﬁcit is created in the pension plan, such that the pension obligation is not fully covered, Pension Fund members are obligated to pay contributions to the Fund in order to cover the obligation. Calculated in compliance with the IAS 19 standard, the amount of plan assets exceeded the plan obligation by €176.4 million as at 31 December 2015. Local rules concerning the Pension Fund may also create a contribution obligation in situations in which the IAS 19 obligation is fully covered. In such a case, the amount of contributions charged increases the amount of pension assets according to IAS 19. Obligation related risks In addition to the general level of interest rates, the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is impacted by changes in the statutory pension provision, future salary increases, index-based pension increases and changes in life expectancy. The pension promise made to the Fund's beneﬁciaries is tied to the amount of pensionable salary and it is a lifelong beneﬁt. The total pension amount consists of the statutory pension and the supplementary pension provided by the Fund. Salary increases will increase the future pension amount. Changes in statutory pension provision, such as an increase in the retirement age or a reduction of pension provision, which are compensated to pensioners by the supplementary pension and, consequently, the changes would increase the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. The amount of future pensions is adjusted annually with an index-based increase in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plan. The extension of life expectancy will result in an increase in plan obligation. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 372 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 17. Pension assets Changes in the general level of interest rates and the market yield of high-quality bonds have an impact on the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. When the level of interest rates falls, the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation rises. Because the Pension Fund's investment assets are invested and their return targets are set for long terms, changes in the annual return on investments do not necessarily correlate in the short term with changes in the discount rate applied to the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation. Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation to changes in the principal assumptions is presented in the following table. Impact on defined Impact on defined Change in benefit obligation, benefit obligation, Actuarial assumption assumption increase decrease 2015 Discount rate 0.50% -6.80% 7.60% Salary growth rate 0.50% 1.40% -1.40% Pension growth rate 0.50% 6.00% -5.40% 2014 Discount rate 0.50% -6.90% 7.80% Salary growth rate 0.50% 1.40% -1.40% Pension growth rate 0.50% 6.00% -5.40% The impacts of sensitivity analysis have been calculated so that the impact of a change in the assumption is calculated while assuming that all other assumptions are constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may correlate with each other. The sensitivity of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation has been calculated using the same method as when calculating the pension obligation recognised within the statement of ﬁnancial position.

In addition, Mikko Helander, the Company President and CEO as from 1 January 2015, was granted 8,791 shares held by the Company as treasury shares in December 2014. The transfers of treasury shares were announced in a stock exchange release on 24 March 2014, 25 March 2014, 17 December 2014, 1 April 2015 and 7 April 2015. During the ﬁnancial year, a total of 2,284 shares already granted were returned to the Company in accordance with the terms and conditions of the share-based compensation plan. At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the Company held 877,577 own B shares (995,315 B shares) as treasury shares. The €27.5 million (€31.5 million) acquisition cost of these shares has been deducted from retained earnings in equity. Details of the share-based payments are disclosed in note 30. Dividends After the balance sheet date, the Board of Directors has proposed that €2.50 per share be distributed as dividends. A dividend of €1.50 per share was distributed on the proﬁt for 2014. Equity and reserves Equity consists of share capital, share premium, reserve of invested non-restricted equity, other reserves, revaluation reserve, currency translation diﬀerences and retained earnings net of treasury shares. In addition, the portion of accumulated depreciation diﬀerence and optional provisions net of deferred tax liabilities are included in equity. Share premium The amount exceeding the par value of share received by the Company in connection with share subscriptions was recorded in the sshare premium in cases where options had been granted under the old Limited Liability Companies Act (29 Sept. 1978/734). As at the end of the ﬁnancial year, the share premium was €197.8 million. Reserve of invested non-restricted equity The reserve of invested non-restricted equity, €22.8 million, includes the other equity-related investments and share subscription prices to the extent not designated to be included in share capital. Other reserves Other reserves, a total of €242.8 million, have mainly been created and increased as a result of resolutions by the General Meeting. Other reserves mainly comprise contingency reserves to a total amount of €242.3 million at the end of the ﬁnancial year. Currency translation differences Currency translation diﬀerences arise from the translation of foreign operations’ ﬁnancial statements. Gains and losses arising from net investment hedges in foreign operations are also included in currency translation diﬀerences, provided they qualify for hedge accounting. The change in currency translation diﬀerences is stated within comprehensive income. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 379 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 22. Shareholders' equity Revaluation reserve The revaluation reserve includes the change in the fair value of available-for-sale ﬁnancial instruments and the eﬀective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives for which cash ﬂow hedge accounting is applied. Cash ﬂow hedges include electricity derivatives and interest rate derivatives hedging the Private Placement note interest. The change in the reserve is stated within comprehensive income. Result of cash flow hedging Hedge accounting is applied to hedging electricity price risk. As a result, an amount of €2.6 million (€2.4 million) was removed from equity and included in the income statement as purchase cost adjustment, and €-3.2 million (€-1.0 million) was recognised in equity, respectively. Their combined eﬀect on the revaluation reserve for the year was €-0.5 million (€1.4 million) before accounting for deferred tax assets. A fair value change of €0.5 million (€-0.3 million) was recognised in equity for the USD-denominated Private Placement facility before accounting for deferred taxes. In addition, a €0.5 million (€0.6 million) interest expense adjustment for interest rate derivatives was recognised in the income statement.

Kesko's Annual Report 2015 390 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 30. Share-based payment Note 30. Share-based payment Share-based compensation plan Kesko operates two share-based compensation plans, the 2011−2013 plan and the 2014−2016 plan, decided by the Company's Board of Directors and intended for members of the Group's management and selected other key persons. Under both plans, a total maximum of 600,000 own B shares held by the Company as treasury shares can be granted within a period of three years. Both of the share-based compensation plans have three vesting periods, namely the calendar years 2011, 2012 and 2013, and 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. Kesko's Board of Directors decides the vesting criteria, the target group and the maximum amounts of the share award separately for each vesting period based on the Remuneration Committee's proposal. At the beginning of the year following the vesting period, Kesko's Board of Directors determines the ﬁnal amounts of Kesko B shares to be granted based on the fulﬁlment of the vesting criteria. The criteria for the vesting periods 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 were, with equal weightings, the growth percentage of Kesko Group's sales exclusive of tax, Kesko's basic earnings per share (EPS) excluding non-recurring items, and the percentage by which the total shareholder return of a Kesko B share exceeds the OMX Helsinki Benchmark Cap GI index. The award possibly paid for a vesting period is paid in Kesko B shares. In addition, a cash component equalling at maximum the value of the shares, is paid to cover the taxes and tax-like charges incurred under the award. A commitment period of three calendar years following each vesting period is attached to the shares granted, during which the shares must not be pledged or transferred, but the other rights attached to the shares remain in force. If a person's employment or service relationship terminates prior to the expiry of a commitment period, he/she must, as a rule, return the shares under transfer restriction to Kesko or its designate for no consideration. In individual cases, the Board may decide that the grantee can keep the shares under the return obligation, or some of them. If the grantee retires in the commitment period, he/ she is entitled to keep the shares and other securities already received. Based on the 2014 vesting period, 120,022 shares were assigned during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2015. Based on the 2013 vesting period, 50,520 shares were assigned during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2014. Based on the 2012 vesting period, 66,331 shares were assigned during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2013. Based on the 2011 vesting period, 92,751 shares were assigned during the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2012. The assumptions used in accounting for the share-based compensation plan are presented in the following tables.

Kesko's Annual Report 2015 395 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 32. Financial risk management Note 32. Financial risk management Financial risk management With respect to ﬁnancial risk management, the Group observes a uniform treasury policy that has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors. Compliance with this policy and developments in the Group’s ﬁnancial situation are monitored by the Board’s Audit Committee. The Group Treasury is centrally responsible for obtaining ﬁnancial resources for the Group, for liquidity management, relations with providers of ﬁnance, and the management of ﬁnancial risks. In the main, the Group’s ﬁnancial resources have been obtained through the parent company, and the Group Treasury arranges ﬁnancial resources for subsidiaries in their functional currencies. For subsidiaries with signiﬁcant external ownership, the Group has not guaranteed ﬁnancial liabilities in excess of its ownership interest. Foreign exchange risks Kesko Group conducts business operations in eight countries, in addition to which it makes purchases from numerous countries. In consequence, the Group is exposed to various foreign exchange risks arising from net investments in foreign operations (translation risks) and from assets, liabilities and forecast transactions (transaction risks) denominated in foreign currencies. The Group companies’ ﬁnancial resources are arranged in their functional currencies. The parent company bears the ensuing foreign exchange risk and hedges the risk exposure using derivatives or borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. The Belarusian currency BYR is not a freely convertible currency and hedging the associated exposure to foreign exchange risk is not possible. Translation risks The Group is exposed to foreign currency translation risks relating to net investments in subsidiaries outside the euro zone held on the balance sheet. This balance sheet exposure has not been hedged. The hedge can be designated if equity is repatriated, or if a currency is expected to be exposed to a signiﬁcant devaluation risk. The most signiﬁcant translation exposures are the Swedish krona, the Russian rouble and the Norwegian krone. The exposure does not include the non-controlling interest in equity. Relative to the Group's volume of operations and the balance sheet total, the foreign currency translation risk is low. The functional currency of the real estate companies operating in St. Petersburg and Moscow in Russia has been determined to be the euro, which is why net investments in these companies are not exposed to foreign currency translation risk, and consequently are not included in the translation exposure.

The currencyspeciﬁc transaction risk exposure comprises foreign currency denominated receivables and liabilities in the balance sheet, forecast foreign currency cash ﬂows, and foreign subsidiaries’ liabilities and receivables with respect to the parent. The risk is commercially managed by, for example, transferring exchange rate changes to selling prices, or by replacing suppliers. The remaining exposures are hedged using foreign currency derivatives. The subsidiaries report their foreign exchange exposures to the Group Treasury on a monthly basis. In the main, the subsidiaries hedge their risk exposures with the Group Treasury, which in turn hedges risk exposures using market transactions within the limits conﬁrmed for each currency. Intra-Group derivative contracts are allocated to the segments in segment reporting. The Group does not apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39 to the hedging of transaction risks relating to purchases and sales. In initial measurement, derivative instruments are recognised at fair value and subsequently in the ﬁnancial statements, they are remeasured at fair value. The change in fair value of foreign currency derivatives used for hedging purchases and sales is recognised in other operating income or expenses. The Group monitors the transaction risk exposure in respect of existing balances and forecast cash ﬂows. The following table analyses the transaction exposure excluding future cash ﬂows. The presentation does not illustrate the Group’s actual foreign exchange risk after hedgings. When forecast amounts are included in the transaction exposure, the most signiﬁcant diﬀerences from the table below are in the USD and RUB exposures. As at 31 December 2015, the exposure with respect to USD was €-10.9 million, and with respect to RUB, it was €-1.9 million.

The requirements of these covenants have been met. The borrowing terms include a ﬁnancial covenant deﬁning the ratio between net debt and EBITDA, which remained far from the maximum throughout the ﬁnancial year. At change of control, Kesko is obligated to oﬀer a repayment of the whole loan capital to the note holders. According to the terms and conditions of the loan facility, the change of ownership to retailers or an association of retailers does not constitute a change of control. Payables to K-retailers consist of two types of interest-bearing liabilities by Kesko to K-retailers: retailers’ prepayments to Kesko and Kesko’s chain rebate liabilities to retailers. Chain rebates are retrospective discounts given to retailers and the terms vary from one chain to another. At the balance sheet date, the total equivalent of undrawn committed long-term credit facilities was €100.0 million (€100.0 million). According to the terms and conditions of loan agreements, at change of control, Kesko's Annual Report 2015 400 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 32. Financial risk management the lenders have the right to terminate the credit facility and loan amounts possibly drawn. According to the terms and conditions of the loan facility, the change of ownership to retailers or an association of retailers does not constitute a change of control. In addition, the Group’s uncommitted ﬁnancial resources available contained commercial paper programmes denominated in euros totalling an equivalent of €359 million (€359 million). In addition, in January 2016, the Group companies held a total of €416.3 million available for re-borrowing in a pension insurance company. Part of the pension insurance premiums paid annually by the Group companies are funded and the accumulated funds can be re-borrowed with a term of 1−10 years in accordance with regulations conﬁrmed by the Ministry of Social Aﬀairs and Health. Any amount of borrowing requires the posting of adequate collateral. Interest rate risk on borrowings and sensitivity analysis Changes in the interest rate level have an impact on the Group’s interest expense. The policy for hedging interest rate risk is aimed at balancing the eﬀects of changes in the interest rate level on proﬁt or loss for diﬀerent ﬁnancial periods. The interest rate risk is centrally managed by the Group Treasury, which adjusts the duration by using interest rate contracts. The target duration is three years, which is allowed to vary between one and a half and four years. The actual duration during the ﬁnancial year was 1.9 (2.4) years on average. On 11 September 2012, Kesko Corporation issued a €250 million bond. The bond carries a ﬁxed coupon interest at 2.75% and a maturity of six years from issuance. On 10 June 2004, Kesko Corporation issued a USD Private Placement in a total amount of USD 120 million in the United States. The facility has three tranches with bullet repayments, of which USD 60 million was paid on 10 June 2014, USD 36 million will be due on 10 June 2016 and USD 24 million on 10 June 2019. Kesko Corporation's USD Private Placement credit facility qualiﬁes for hedge accounting against both foreign exchange and interest rate risk and it has been hedged by currency swaps and interest rate swaps with the same amounts and maturities as the borrowing. As a result, the borrowing is fully hedged against foreign exchange and interest rate risk. During the ﬁnancial year, there was no ineﬀectiveness to be recorded in the income statement from this credit facility. The sensitivity analysis for changes in interest rate level in respect of commercial paper liabilities realised during the ﬁnancial year has used average balance values. At the balance sheet date of 31 December 2015, the eﬀect of variable rate borrowings on the pre-tax proﬁt would have been €-/+1.2 million (€-/+1.7 million), if the interest rate level had risen or fallen by 1 percentage point. The bond, Private Placement notes and pension loans, €287.5 million in aggregate, have ﬁxed rates, and their eﬀective interest cost was 3.4%. At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the average rate of variable-interestrate borrowings from ﬁnancial institutions, payables to retailers and other interest-bearing liabilities was 0.1%. Most of the borrowings are euro-denominated and the Private Placement notes are USDdenominated.

Financial risk management Financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value The Group’s liquid assets have mainly been invested in the debt instruments of major Finnish companies, in certiﬁcates of deposit and deposits with banks operating in Kesko’s market area, in bonds of selected companies and in corporate bond funds. The return on these investments for 2015 was 0.3% (0.8%) and the duration was 0.7 years at the end of the ﬁnancial year.

Financial risk management Level 3 includes private equity funds and other shares and interests. These investments have been classiﬁed as non-current available-for-sale ﬁnancial assets. Level 3 ﬁnancial assets are measured based on computations received from the companies. Gains or losses with income statement impact have not been recorded on these investments for the ﬁnancial year 2015. Interest-bearing receivables and sensitivity analysis The objective is to invest liquidity consisting of ﬁnancial assets in the money market using eﬃcient combinations of return and risk. At regular intervals, the Group’s management approves the investment instruments and limits for each counterparty among those analysed by the Group Treasury. The risks and actual returns on investments are monitored regularly. In the sensitivity analysis of ﬂoating rate receivables, average annual balances of invested assets have been used. The receivables include customer ﬁnancing receivables, ﬁnance lease receivables, other interestbearing receivables, and within investments, commercial papers and money market funds. The sensitivity of money market funds has been determined based on duration. If the interest rate level had changed by +/-1 percentage point, the eﬀect of these items on the pre-tax proﬁt would have been €+/-3.5 million (€+/-3.6 million) and €+/-2.7 million (€+/-1.1 million) on equity at the balance sheet date. Credit and counterparty risk The divisions' business entities are responsible for the management of the credit risk associated with amounts due from customers. The Group has a credit policy and its implementation is controlled. The aim is to ensure the collection of receivables by carefully assessing customers’ creditworthiness, by specifying customer credit terms and collateral requirements, by eﬀective credit control and credit insurances, as applicable. In Finland, the main part of the Group’s business activities is carried out in cooperation with retailers. According to retailer agreements, retailers shall arrange overdraft facilities to be held as collateral for their trade payables by the relevant Kesko subsidiary. The Group companies apply a uniform practice to measuring past due receivables. A receivable is written down when there is objective evidence of impairment. The ageing analysis of trade receivables as at 31 December was as follows: Ageing analysis of trade receivables € million 2015 2014 Trade receivables fully performing 540.7 536.2 1−7 days past due trade receivables 9.9 12.3 8−30 days past due trade receivables 11.4 12.1 31−60 days past due trade receivables 5.2 4.3 over 60 days past due trade receivables 14.4 19.2 Total 581.7 584.2 Kesko's Annual Report 2015 404 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 32. Financial risk management Within trade receivables, €331.9 million (€332.9 million) were from chain retailers and €1.9 million (€2.4 million) were credit card receivables. The collateral for chain retailer receivables is an overdraft facility granted by a Kesko associate, Vähittäiskaupan Takaus Oy, with the maximum always limited to the realisable value of the countersecurity from the K-retailer's company and its entrepreneur to Vähittäiskaupan Takaus Oy. At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the aggregate value of countersecurities was €171.1 million (€160.1 million). In addition, the collateral for receivables includes other collaterals, such as business mortgages and other pledged assets. Trade receivables include an impairment charge to a total of €17.2 million (€21.5 million) monitored on a separate allowance account. The original balance sheet value of these trade receivables was €21.9 million (€28.2 million). The aggregate amount of credit losses and impairments recognised in the proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year was €3.7 million (€6.0 million). The amount of receivables with renegotiated terms totalled €3.2 million (€2.7 million). Financial credit risk Financial instruments involve the risk of non-performance by counterparties. Kesko enters into foreign currency and other derivative contracts only with creditworthy banks. Liquid funds are invested, in accordance with limits set annually for each counterparty, in instruments with good creditworthiness. Company and bank-speciﬁc euro and time limits are set for money market investments. These limits are reviewed during the year depending on the market situation. Commodity risks and their sensitivity analysis The Group uses electricity derivatives for the purpose of balancing out energy costs. The electricity price risk is assessed for ﬁve-year periods. The changes in the fair values of derivatives hedging the price of electricity supplied during the ﬁnancial year are recognised within adjustments to purchases. Hedge accounting is applied to contracts hedging future purchases. The eﬀective portion of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting is recognised in the revaluation reserve of equity and the ineﬀective portion in the income statement within other operating income or expenses. The change in the revaluation reserve recognised in equity is presented in the statement of comprehensive income under revaluation of cash ﬂow hedge. At the end of the year, the ineﬀective portion of derivatives hedging the price risk of electricity was €-2.9 million (€-1.6 million). As at the balance sheet date, a total quantity of 464,832 MWH (731,976 MWH) of electricity had been purchased with electricity derivatives and 245,520 MWH under ﬁxed price purchase agreements. The 1–12 month hedging level was 66% (87%), the 13–24 month level was 60% (65%), the 25–36 month level was 38% (45%), and the 37–48 month level was 4% (24%). The sensitivity analysis of electricity derivatives assumed that derivatives maturing in less than 12 months have an impact on proﬁt. If the market price of electricity derivatives changed by -/+20% from the balance sheet date 31 December 2015, it would contribute €-/+0.7 million (€-/+1.6 million) to the 2016 income statement and €-/+1.1 million (€-/+2.7 million) to equity. The impact has been calculated before tax. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 405 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 32.

Financial risk management Capital structure management Kesko Group’s objectives in capital management include target rates set for the Group’s solvency and liquidity. The Group’s capital structure (equity-to-debt ratio) is optimised at the Group level. The objectives for the Group’s solvency and liquidity are set with the purpose of securing the Group’s liquidity in all market situations, enabling the implementation of capital expenditure programmes in line with the Group’s strategy, and maintaining shareholder value. A target rate has been set for the performance indicator ‘interest-bearing net debt/EBITDA’. Some of the Group’s interest-bearing liabilities include covenants, whose terms and conditions have been taken into account in the above target rate. The Group does not have a credit rating from any external credit rating institution. The target levels for Kesko Group’s performance indicators are approved by the Board of Directors.

Kesko's Annual Report 2015 413 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 34. Legal disputes and possible legal proceedings Note 34. Legal disputes and possible legal proceedings Group companies are parties to certain trials or legal disputes related to the Group's business operations. According to management's estimate, their outcome will probably not have any material impact on the Group's ﬁnancial position. The Group is also party to possible legal proceedings, either as plaintiﬀ or defendant, the outcome of which is diﬃcult to forecast. Voimaosakeyhtiö SF has commenced arbitration proceedings in which Voimaosakeyhtiö SF demands that the court of arbitration conﬁrm that Kesko Corporation's group company Kestra Kiinteistöpalvelut Oy would be committed to the future ﬁnancing of Fennovoima Ltd's Hanhikivi nuclear power project. Kesko Corporation has announced in a stock exchange release on 27 March 2014 that Kestra Kiinteistöpalvelut Oy would not participate in the future ﬁnancing of the Fennovoima project due to the related ﬁnancial, contractual and scheduling uncertainties. Kestra Kiinteistöpalvelut Oy considers Voimaosakeyhtiö SF's claims to be unfounded. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 414 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 35. Other notes Liite 35. Other notes Events after the balance sheet date On 12 January 2016, Kesko Corporation made an agreement to acquire Onninen Oy's whole share capital from Onvest Oy. The pro forma net sales of the business to be acquired were €1,438 million and the EBITDA was €39 million for the period from October 2014 until the end of September 2015. The transaction price of the debt-free acquisition, structured as a share purchase, is €369 million. Onninen's steel business and Russian subsidiary are not included in the acquisition. With the acquisition, Kesko's business in HEPAC and electrical product groups will expand signiﬁcantly and it will be able to provide better service, especially to contractor customers. In addition, Kesko will gain new customer relationships from infrastructure and industry customer groups. The transaction will be paid in cash from Kesko's liquid assets and available debt ﬁnancing reserves. The fair value allocations of the transaction price to net assets are estimated to cause an expense item of around €5 million on the ﬁrst six months. The completion of the acquisition is subject to the approval of the competition authorities and the fulﬁlment of the other terms and conditions of the transaction. The acquisition is estimated to be completed during the ﬁrst half of 2016. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 415 Financial statements > Notes to the consolidated financial statements > Note 36.

Principles used for preparing the financial statements Kesko Corporation's ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in compliance with the Finnish Accounting Standards (FAS). Non-current assets Intangible assets Intangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less depreciation according to plan and possible amortisations. Depreciation plan Other capitalised expenditure 5−20 years IT software and licences 3−5 years Tangible assets Tangible assets are stated in the balance sheet at cost less depreciation according to plan and possible amortisations. Depreciation plan Depreciation according to plan is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write oﬀ the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful lives. The most common estimated useful lives are: Buildings 10−33 years Fixtures and ﬁttings 8 years Machinery and equipment 25% reducing balance method Transportation ﬂeet 5 years IT equipment 3−5 years Other tangible assets 5−14 years Land has not been depreciated. The total of depreciation according to plan and the change in depreciation reserve comply with the Finnish Business Tax Act. The change in depreciation reserve has been treated as appropriations. Valuation of financial assets Marketable securities have been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Foreign currency items Foreign currency transactions have been recorded in euros using the rate of exchange at the date of transaction. Foreign currency receivables and payables have been translated into euros using the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. If a receivable or a payable is tied to a ﬁxed rate of exchange, it has been used for translation. Exchange rate diﬀerences have been recognised in proﬁt or loss. Kesko's Annual Report 2015 430 Financial statements > Notes to the parent company's financial statements > Note 1. Principles used for preparing the financial statements Derivative contracts Interest rate derivatives Interest rate derivatives are used to modify the durations of borrowings. The target duration is three years and it is allowed to vary between one and a half and four years. Cash ﬂows arising from interest rate derivatives are recognised during the ﬁnancial year as interest income or expenses, according to the maturity date. In the ﬁnancial statements, outstanding interest rate forward contracts, interest rate future contracts, interest rate option contracts and interest rate swap contracts are stated at market values, but unrealised revaluation is not stated as income. Any valuation losses are included in interest expenses. Foreign currency derivatives Foreign currency derivatives are used for hedging against translation and transaction risks. Foreign exchange forward contracts are valued using the forward exchange rate of the balance sheet date. The exchange diﬀerences arising from outstanding derivative contracts are reported in ﬁnancial items. If a derivative has been used for hedging a foreign-currency-denominated asset, the change in value has been recognised against that of the asset item. The premiums of option contracts are included in the balance sheet accruals until they expire, or if a value change at the balance sheet date so requires, recognition in proﬁt or loss. Commodity derivatives Ankkuri-Energia Oy, a Kesko Corporation subsidiary, uses electricity derivatives to balance the energy costs of the Group and its retailers. Kesko Corporation is an external counterparty in electricity derivatives with a bank, and enters into corresponding internal hedge with Ankkuri-Energia Oy. At no stage does Kesko Corporation have derivative positions, and thus there are no eﬀects on proﬁt or loss. The electricity price risk is reviewed on a 5-year time span. With respect to derivatives hedging the price of electricity supplied during the ﬁnancial year, change in fair value is recognised at Kesko under ﬁnance income and cost. Unrealised gains and losses on contracts hedging future purchases are not recognised in proﬁt or loss. Pension plans Personnel's statutory pension provision is organised through pension insurance companies and the voluntary supplementary pension provision is mainly organised through Kesko Pension Fund. Pension costs are recognised as expense in the income statement. Provisions Provisions stated in the balance sheet include items committed to under agreements or otherwise but not yet realised. Changes in provisions are included in the income statement. Rent liabilities for vacant rented premises no longer used for the Group's business operations, as well as losses resulting from renting the premises to third parties, are included in provisions. Income tax Income tax includes the income tax payments for the period calculated based on the proﬁt for the period, and taxes payable for prior periods, or tax refunds. Deferred taxes are not included in the parent company's income statement and balance sheet.
