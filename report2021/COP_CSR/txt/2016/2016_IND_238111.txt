Further, periodic safety audits are conducted by Corporate HSE Department and health and safety issues of contract workers are also addressed. Fire and Safety Training for security employees As a model principal employer, GAIL while awarding contracts, ensures the provision for safety kits & liveries to contract workers by engaging with the contractor. Some other initiatives taken by GAIL specifically for contractual employees include:Trainings : Induction and monthly refresher fire safety & hazards awareness training before first entry of each contract worker and on regular basis time to time. Tool box talk have been carried out by GAIL executive before commencing job, during tool box talk information regarding all the associated hazard with the work is being given to worker with their mitigation measures.

During the previous reporting period we undertook major safety related initiatives such as implementation of BBS approach at GPUs and Petrochemical Plant, showcasing Standard Operating Procedures through a model film, launch of the ‚ÄúLife Saver Scheme‚Äù to prevent major causes of life threatening incidents, and conducting third party safety audits. Despite such structured approach there were 07 Nos. of Level I incidents and 03 Nos. of Level III incidents reported to PNGRB during the year as per ERDMP regulation of PNGRB.

GAIL did not make any financial or in-kind contribution to political parties, politicians or related institutions. In FY 14-15 GAIL‚Äôs Profitability reduced by 31% in comparison with FY13-14. The Major reasons for this reduction are given below: Under capacity utilization The company has also been facing headwind in terms of growth of Trading and Transmission volumes due to substantial fall in domestic gas from 66 MMSCMD of Natural Gas pipelines in FY14 to 59 MMSCMD in FY15. The capacity utilization of Natural Gas pipelines is only 45%. Lower gas transmission / low pipeline capacity utilization and thereby low revenue is unable to cover fixed cost such as Depreciation & Interest leading to stressed returns from new pipelines such as Dabhol Bangalore Pipeline, Dadri Bawana Nangal Pipeline, Chhainsa-Jhajjar Pipeline etc. Decrease in availability In recent years due to decrease in availability of Domestic Gas for Petrochemical production in FY15 to the level of 17% of total gas consumption as against of Domestic Gas 63% in FY14, higher level of expensive imported LNG is being used for polymer production. In comparison to FY14, Gas cost for Production of Petrochemicals has increased. This has led to decrease in profitability from Petrochemical business segment during FY15. Rapid fall in crude prices With rapid fall in crude prices during FY15, there was a significant fall in average Price realization from sale of Liquid Hydrocarbons by 16% leading to negative impact in FY15. High prices of imported Fall in Domestic gas coupled with Consumer resistance to buy high priced LNG, particularly by Power & Fertilizer companies, led to decrease in Gas Marketing LNG volumes by 7 MMSCMD (decrease by 9%) compared to FY14. Tariff Reduction The negative impact on profitability of FY15 on account of reduction in Natural Gas pipeline network tariffs by PNGRB is INR 449 Crore.

The material issues emerging from the stakeholder engagement were collected and prioritized, and the results are fairly reflected in the Report. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‚ÄòGood‚Äô. Materiality: The materiality determination process was revalidated based on inputs from key stakeholders including employees, customers, suppliers, NGOs, governments, regulatory bodies, local communities and senior management of GAIL.The Report focusses its disclosures on key material aspects at macro level and has not missed out any known material aspects for the Oil and Gas Sector.

Reliability: The majority of data and information verified at the Corporate Office, Jubilee Tower and GTI Noida, five operational sites were found to be accurate. Some of the data inaccuracies identified during the verification process were found to be attributable to transcription, interpretation and aggregation errors and the errors have been communicated for correction. Hence in accordance with AA1000AS (2008) requirements for a Type 2, moderate level assurance engagement, we conclude that the specified sustainability data and information presented in the Report is generally reliable.

The Company has confirmed that the systems for aggregating data for these disclosures are being developed and set the internal time lines for disclosure. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‚ÄòAcceptable‚Äô. Neutrality: The disclosures related to sustainability issues and performances are reported in a neutral tone, in terms of content and presentation. In our view, the level at which the Report adheres to this principle is ‚ÄòGood‚Äô.

Sustainability Report 159 2014-15 ur sustainability journey of the past half a decade has been both challenging as well as exciting for us. From taking small steps with our first report to today being one of the most well-known organizations in the domain of sustainability ‚Äì GAIL has come a long way. We have developed in-house online sustainability data collection module which is indigenous and customised for our reporting framework and operations. This report is also a reflection of the different best practices that we have developed. This year was eventful and made us rethink our approach on a lot of factors ranging from business continuity, financial planning, and safety related issues. These challenging times taught us to identify opportunity even in the midst of chaos. As a result, opportunities we identified and we embarked upon various initiatives such as reinventing our competitiveness, securing raw material supply, marketing of our products, and exploring various pipeline intrusion detection and leak detection systems available which would be implemented in a phased manner to name a few. While we continue to identify and mitigate the range of risks that change dynamically, we are also upgrading ourselves with the latest set of technologies and innovate further. While we upgrade our processes, we have also upgraded our sustainability communications. This report is GAIL‚Äôs 1st Sustainability Report based on GRI G4 guidelines, which is the latest set of sustainability reporting guidelines available. In this context, we conducted a much detailed stakeholder engagement and materiality exercise which has also been discussed in the report. As we move ahead in our sustainability journey, we would aim to fulfil not only to comply with regulatory requirements but also other voluntary initiatives such as those of UNGC and our revised Sustainability Aspirations 2020. We are also committed to all our stakeholders and also seek their support in this journey. We value for constructive feedback.
