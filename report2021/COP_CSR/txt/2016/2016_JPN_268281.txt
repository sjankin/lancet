Nippon Television Holdings, Inc. | Annual Report 2015 5 71 Board of Directors Nippon Television Holdings Nippon Television Holdings Eleven-Year Summary Message from Management Feature Review of Operations Corporate Governance CSR at Nippon TV Holdings Financial Data Investor Information and Auditors Group Companies Network Message from Management In 1953, Nippon Television Network Corporation, the core company of the Nippon TV Holdings Group, commenced Japan’s first commercial television broadcasts. Its business model of generating revenues though corporate advertisements and providing high-quality television programs free of charge to viewers was extremely well suited to the growing Japanese economy. As a result, television became central to the media industry, with television advertising in Japan generating revenues of approximately ¥1,830 billion in 2014 (according to a survey by Dentsu Inc.). But now Japan’s television advertising market is maturing as falling birth rates cause the population to decrease, people use their leisure time in more diverse ways and growth in the domestic economy levels off. Recognizing these environmental factors, in November 2012 the Nippon TV Holdings Group formulated 2012–2015 Next60 as its medium-term management plan and has since worked steadily on measures to achieve mediumto long-term growth under this plan. Going forward, we will continue to leverage our content creation capabilities—a Nippon TV strength—as we relentlessly pursue innovation and take on new challenges rather than merely satisfying ourselves with present circumstances. I ask for your ongoing support of our endeavors.
