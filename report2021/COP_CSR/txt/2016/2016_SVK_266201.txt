V. 8 9 Profile and Governance Profile and Governance VUB GROUP PROVIDES A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES FINANCIAL INDICATORS In 2015, the Slovak economy was faring well. It exceeded the expectations and outperformed the already good year of 2014. GDP growth increased to three and half percent, which was the fastest growth for the past five years. The number of jobs went up beyond two percent and got employment back to the pre-crisis levels of 2008. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest level for the previous seven years. Wages continued rising at a solid pace, on the level of nearly three percent, which in a slightly deflationary environment translated into an even higher growth of real wages. Banking Leasing Factoring An increasing number of jobs, dropping unemployment and growing wages brought improvement in household confidence, which supported further strengthening of demand for consumer goods and housing that was suppressed in the post-crisis period. The banks’ reaction to the improved financial position of households was positive, which lead to a growth in loans to households to nearly thirteen percent. It is important that in 2015 also loans to businesses started finally growing, which was a welcome change after a continuous drop in loans for non-financial companies since 2008. The investment activity of Slovak businesses dramatically rose, which was predominantly attributable to an intense drawing of EU funds used mainly for construction of motorways, modernization of existing roads and bridge infrastructure. Consumer Asset Pension Finance Management Saving Against this macroeconomic background, VUB Bank was faring well. We managed to achieve good results and exceed the planned targets and performance from the previous year in terms of profitability and asset growth.

Positive results were recorded also by subsidiaries within the Group operating in the consumer finance, asset and pension saving management markets.

We are a member of the Business Leaders Forum association joining leaders in enforcement of corporate responsibility principles in Slovakia. 14 15 Profile and Governance Profile and Governance Organization and Governance ADMINISTRATION AND GOVERNANCE Similarly to its parent company Intesa Sanpaolo, also VUB Bank applies a dual administration and control model, within which the control activities and strategic management are separated from the management of business activities performed by the Bank’s Management Board. Ownership and management are thus clearly defined and the Supervisory Board functions as a filter between the shareholders and the Management Board. The Bank’s management disposes of a full execution power, whereas the Supervisory Board performs the control function. This model provides for transparency and reduces the risk of a conflict of interests.

Wide possibilities for cooperation of self-administrations of towns and municipalities near Danube, but also entrepreneurs and various leisure associations and professional public, headed by non-governmental organizations can be provided by the Danube Fund (Dunajský fond) established in 2015. Its first donors and signatories of the Danube Fund Charter are Slovnaft and VUB Foundation, which donated to the project EUR 40,000. Danube is not important only for the capital Bratislava, but also for other towns such as Komárno and Štúrovo, playing an ever increasing role as a source of water, energy and transport route. Everyone, starting with environmental protectors and ending with entrepreneurs trying to run their businesses in its vicinity, has a positive relation to it. Since Danube will be significantly influencing the quality of people’s lives inhabiting the territory close to its banks, it is obvious that significance of this topic in the medium and also long-term horizon will be growing. All these were the reasons behind establishment of the Danube Fund, which believes in cooperation of private, state and self-administrative entities with non-governmental organizations. The Danube Fund coordinates financial and other sources for support of community development activities, which will be performed along the entire flow of the Danube River in the Slovak territory, including Malý Dunaj (Little Danube). The Fund intends to support projects, which will be searching for solutions how to better interconnect the river with the urban environment, protect natural heritage and sources, possibilities of movement along the stream and across the river and connections between urban centres, nations and cultures living at the banks of Danube. These include various activities that will bring life on the river.

It supports the development of sheltered workshops, sheltered housing, it finances the therapies for disabled people, it helps the foster families. In the area of healthcare charity, we donated EUR 66 thousand to medical therapies, purchase of devices and equipment of hospital wards. The grantees included the National Register of Bone Marrow Donors, the rehabilitation centre ADELI in Piešťany and the Hospital of Poprad. In 2015, VUB Foundation announced the grant program Healing Art and Touch (Umenie a dotyk lieči), in which it supported therapeutic projects helping the sick and disabled. Art Therapy is used mainly for healing of the mentally ill, it supports the self-healing processes and development of basic skills. The art helps the patients to overcome barriers, improve communication, self-realization and at the same time it offers an aesthetic experience and joy of creating. Animal-assisted therapy counts among recognized therapeutic procedures, whereas it most popular forms include canistherapy and hippotherapy. Canistherapy is most frequently used in healing of autistic children and hippotherapy has positive effects on the health condition of patients after children’s cerebral palsy, with Down syndrome and various motion apparatus disorders. Grants were given to organizations, which provide services and therapy for children with various types of disabilities or patients with different grave diseases. Their work resulted in many beneficial activities. The starting package for people with a challenging destiny was run by VUB Foundation in cooperation with the WellGiving civic association. Each year, the Foundation gets tens of requests for help from people, whose life stories are marked with a grave disease, disability, pain or a lack of funds for living. In the effort of helping people, whose lives are marked with obstacles, we created a partnership with the dakujeme.sk portal. The help was provided to applicants in a non-traditional form – “starting package” for families with ill children. This did not involve the donation of big financial amounts, but help in starting up their own fundraising. Exceptionality of this help consists precisely in the fact that the donation in the amount of EUR 200 is motivational, encouraging the applicants and giving them strength to keep fighting and raise the missing funds and thus to actively solve the challenging situation they found themselves in. The starting package encouraged the visitors of the donation portal not to stay indifferent and they donated as well because the interest of VUB Foundation is a signal for the public and potential donors about which specific child actually needs help. In 2015, 25 children received the Annexes starting package and as a result the families managed to get additional EUR 3,967 from individual donors. COMMUNITY GRANTS In 2015, VUB Foundation a new program Community Grants. Big interest of people in the environment they live in confirmed that community projects needed support, just like the activists and volunteers who are willing to dedicate their personal time, experience and expert knowledge for the good of the others. The aim of the newly established grant scheme was to improve life on the local level or build a nice environment by means of civic initiatives. Out of 155 projects enrolled, the expert committee selected 3 projects in each region, which were competing for the votes of the public in an online voting. The grant went to that project in each region which won the greatest support in the voting. Sports complex in Bratislava, relax complex in Martin, theatre in Levice and other five meaningful projects will bring people joy, relax and entertainment.
