UN Global Compact Communications of Progress April 13, 2016 Privileged & Confidential Page 1 April 13, 2016 General With two plants in the US, Lectrus is a leading integrator of electrical systems. We engineer, fabricate and install equipment centers, operator centers, generator enclosures, sub-base fuel tanks and other custom metal enclosures that protect complex electrical power and control systems. During a supplier review in mid-2010, Lectrus learned that joining the United Nations’ Global Compact was a key requirement to becoming a recognized global supplier by Schneider Electric, headquartered in France. Lectrus submitted our commitment letter and became a registered member of the UN Global Compact in early October 2010. Lectrus has committed to making the Global Compact’s ten principles part of the growth strategy, culture and day-to-day operations of our company. In order to facilitate a company-wide adoption, Lectrus formed a Steering Team consisting of operations leaders and human resource personnel from each plant and select members of the company’s Senior Leadership Team (SLT). For 201114, Lectrus is focused on implementing key performance indicators in the areas of human rights and environment. The period covered by this Communications of Progress is October 2014 to September 2015. CEO Statement of Support Protecting the environment, fair treatment of employees, and ethical trade is crucial for the preservation of business which provides employment opportunities for future generations. At Lectrus, employees are encouraged to make improvements to all areas of the company, from changes in front office policies to lean process deployments and the reduction of waste streams. In addition, we are committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination and harassment and are intentional in our hiring practices. We invest in the training of our employees, in both skill development and policy and process conformance. This makes Lectrus a sought after employer in our local area. We are proud to be a part of the UN Global Compact and continue our commitment to its principles. Brian Fine Privileged & Confidential Page 2 April 13, 2016 Human Rights: Principles Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Human Rights: Assessment, Policy and Goals Lectrus maintains a Harassment-Free Workplace Policy (located on our internal network as Document #0040; Dated January 1, 2013, Updated July 1, 2015). We are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment. The company will not tolerate any type of harassment based on race, color, national origin, gender, religion, age, disability, military service or other protected characteristics. All reports of harassment will be promptly and thoroughly investigated. Employees’ privacy will be protected to the extent possible while complaints are being investigated and actions taken. Employees will not be subject to retaliation or any other negative action as a result of reporting harassment or discrimination. Inappropriate conduct toward an employee by someone outside the company, while on company property or work time, will be addressed with that individual’s employer. In addition, we publish Equal Opportunity Practices for our suppliers. These documents are located on our website (www.lectrus.com) and on our internal network. Lectrus favors suppliers who have a social and political commitment to basic principles of human rights and who do not discriminate against their employees in hiring practices or any other term or condition of work, on the basis of race, color, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, disability, age or political opinion. Our goal is to eliminate any potential risk and remain free of any complaints that may impact the human rights of our employees and suppliers. Human Rights: Implementation When new employees join Lectrus and each time we revise these policies, our Human Resources Department provides training to all employees and an opportunity to ask questions. Once per year, we provide training for managers and supervisors on maintaining a Harassment-Free Workplace. Our policy states that any employee who believes he or she has been subjected to any type of harassment is requested to immediately tell the person engaging in the conduct to stop. If the person persists, or if for any reason the employee is uncomfortable talking to the person, they are Privileged & Confidential Page 3 April 13, 2016 requested to immediately contact their supervisor and report the incident to any member of management or Human Resources. Employees aware of another employee being harassed are also encouraged to report the behavior to his or her supervisor or to Human Resources. Any employee uncomfortable seeking assistance from a member of management or Human Resources can report the concern through the company’s Ethics Hotline All reports of harassment are promptly and thoroughly investigated. The employee’s privacy will be protected to the extent possible while complaints are being investigated and actions taken. Employees will not be subject to retaliation or any other negative action as a result of reporting harassment or discrimination. Any employee found to have engaged in any type of harassment will be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment. Any supervisor who engages in, knowingly condones any type of harassment, or retaliates against an employee, who files a harassment complaint, will be subject to corrective action and possible termination of employment. As a federal contractor in compliance with Executive Order 11246, Lectrus maintains an affirmative action plan which is updated annually. Each year, all managers and supervisors participate in detailed training and goal setting to develop recruiting methods aimed at increasing our female and minority employee population. We continually establish recruiting sources and strategies that attract a more diverse pool of candidates. Human Rights: Measurement of Outcomes During the reporting year, we started tracking all applicants and a specific metric which records the number of qualified female and minority applicants.

Furthermore, we will recruit, hire, train, and promote people in all job classifications without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, gender, age, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. It is expected that all employees will treat one another with mutual respect. Any employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate supervisor or the Human Resources Department. Employees can raise concerns and make reports without fear of reprisal.
