Approach to Stakeholders G4-18, g4-25, g4-25, g4-26 INA Group companies use the stakeholder feedback they receive to help determine their strategically important issues and focus on the sustainability topics that have the most relevance to the company and its stakeholders in its sustainability reporting. 2015 INA’s primary stakeholder groups include employees, customers, shareholders, Government authorities and regulators, contractors, highlights local communities, non-profit organizations (NGOs) and the media. Other important secondary stakeholder groups include trade unions, financial analysts, academics and the general public. All stakeholders can communicate with INA through different email addresses on • LEADERSHIP the corporate website, depending on the subject of their interest (e.g. pitaj.suljr@ina.hr, eticko.povjerenstvo@ina.hr, lijecnici@ina.hr, ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM Odrzivi_Razvoj@ina.hr, donacije@ina.hr, sponzorstva@ina.hr, etc.). Primary stakeholder groups are prioritized based on their ability to 23 in 2015-more than 200 in 2016 influence INA and the level of the company’s impact on stakeholders. • IPPC COMPLIANCE As for the secondary stakeholder groups, INA considers it an important responsibility to passively monitor these stakeholder groups due 4 INSTALLATIONS to their possible significance outside the company and in order to be able to engage in productive collaborations when appropriate. As part of the ongoing stakeholder engagement program that formed a direct input to the preparation of this GRI G4 report, the company • STOP CARD CAMPAIGN applied the GRI principle of ‘stakeholder inclusiveness’ for defining the report content, reviewed its stakeholder engagement program 51,636 STOP CARDS and undertook specific additional engagement where it required further information to ensure that it fully understood the priorities of its most important stakeholders based on their interest in, and influence over the company’s activities. • ROAD SAFETY PROGRAM RAR DECREASE FROM 3,4 For example, during the reporting period, we conducted a workshop with the help of an external consultant to help determine the issues (2011) TO 0,8 ( 2015) that should be covered in this GRI G4 report. In the workshop, experts from different business areas completed exercises on stakeholder engagement and materiality and linked the material topics for each primary stakeholder group to the corresponding GRI G4 indicators. • SCC CERTIFICATION We subsequently calibrated the results of the workshop against the results of the main stakeholder feedback we had received during and FOR STSI Plc. after the reporting period and the updated document was reviewed and approved by our experts and top management. The finalised list 643 EMPLOYEES TRAINED of material items provided the framework for compiling the sustainability report content of this report. The full list of material topics is shown on the materiality matrix on page 92 with further details included in the G4 Index on page 144. INA informs, consults, negotiates and proactively monitors the expectations of its stakeholders with regard to its sustainability performance through a range of different engagement channels, such as strategic collaborations, one-to-one meetings, conferences, seminars, workshops, roundtables, surveys and similar platforms as described in the following table.

Due to the low penalty level and current market situation, where other market players are not active in terms of bio fuels, blending of total National Action Plan (NAP) 300 quantities is not supported (blending quantities for fulfilling total NAP would cost more than penalties; in case the whole bio cost is transferred to consumers, there is a risk of significant market share lost). 250 Rijeka Refinery thousand GJ Energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions Sisak Refinery 200 ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM Exploration & Production 150 INA, d.d. and major INA Group companies (Crosco d.o.o., ROTARY Drilling Ltd., INA Maziva d.o.o. and STSI d.o.o.) decided to introduce an energy management system according to ISO 50001:2011, in addition to the existing management systems: ISO 9001, ISO 14001 100 and OHSAS 18001. EMS ensures energy efficiency and competitiveness, increases profitability, optimizes costs and reduces environmental impact. 50 In September 2015, INA Group successfully passed the certification process carried out by an accredited independent company, and 274 330 189 250 252 186 316 290 214 introduced the ISO 50001 management system which specifies energy management system requirements applicable to all organizations, regardless of their type and size. 0 With the introduction of ISO 50001 for INA Group, energy policy with specific objectives to improve energy efficiency has been estab2013 2014 2015 lished, as well as the basis for energy use. Furthermore, key areas have been identified and elements that affect energy use have been recognized. The general objectives of energy management system in INA Group are: reduction of energy consumption, optimization of energy sources and introduction of new forms of energy that comply with the best available techniques in the industry. 105 Sustainability in ina group In the Exploration and Production BD, the total amount of direct and indirect energy consumption slightly increased in 2015. More and cost savings, pollution decrease and reducing the possibility of traffic accidents (health and road safety positive effect). electricity was purchased due to installation of new compression units at Molve facility that are used for CO2 injection (EOR project). Integration of Crosco and STSI users in a common INA IT environment was basically performed by migrating Crosco and STSI IT The increase of direct and indirect energy consumption in Sisak Refinery was caused by a 25% increase in the production of crude oil infrastructure to INA IT infrastructure. These activities had significant results in reducing electrical energy consumption (old Crosco compared to 2014. In Rijeka Refinery, increased processing in 2015 affected the increase of technological fuel consumption and the and STSI telecommunication and server infrastructure was shutdown, as well as Crosco and STSI Data Centres facilities) by using the decreased consumption of natural gas, which resulted in an increase of total direct and indirect energy, occurred in 2015. existing INA infrastructure and Data Centre facilities for INA subsidiaries.

One watt-hour of energy savings on server level results in roughly 1.9 watt-hours of facility-level energy savings by reducing energy waste in the power infrastructure and reducing the energy needed to cool the waste heat produced by the server. INA performed server virtualization and set virtualization ratio target for 2015 at 70% for the full scope of servers determined for virtualization. The target was fully accomplished. Implementation of Cisco videoconference (VC) system in INA is part of a wider scope initiative to establish Cisco unified communication infrastructure on MOL Group level and to replace the existing old solution, which reached the end of life. Influenced by growing internationalization, business trip optimization initiatives and collaboration trends, videoconferencing was introduced and integrated communication services have been enabled. All of this resulted in decreasing the number of long distance business trips, which leads to energy 107 Sustainability in ina group European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) Emissions sisak REFINERY One of the main challenges of the refining industry is to ensure growth, while limiting the emission of greenhouse gases. INA recognises that climate change is real and through collaboration with governments, companies and peer companies in the refining sector, INA actively monitors all legal developments, as well as any amendments to the ETS with a potential impact on its business, and at the same time works on setting down the rules for the upcoming fourth trading period (2021 – 2030).

INA, d.d. representatives have submitted to the Ministry of Environmental and Nature Protection a proposal of the Exploration & Production measures which need to be applied in order to achieve a benchmark of emissions in the relevant EU ETS sector. For the implementation of these measures, specific plans, studies and/or analysis will need to be developed, taking into account that the Ministry expressed its intention to assist in the development of these measures by engaging experts to serve as assistants to the operators with the aim of withdrawing funds from the European Union assistance programmes. Compared to 2014, emissions in Rijeka Refinery increased by 4.0%. In 2015, CO2intensity continued to be reported as a key performance indicator for the refining sector. CO2 intensity in Rijeka Refinery has increased compared to 2014 (44.98 t CO2/ kt CWT) and was equal to 47.83 t CO2/kt CWT due to low processing (requires increase in electricity import) and start-ups in Q1 and Q4 (requires higher fuel consumption). CWT (Complexity Weighted Tonne) is used as a benchmarking scheme for the European Union refineries. As a comparison, 10% of the mainstream refineries in the European Union with the lowest emissions intensity in the period 2005 – 2007 had CO2 intensity equal to 29.5 t CO2/kt CWT, while average CO2 intensity for the European refineries for the same period was equal to 37.0 t CO2kt/CWT. In Sisak Refinery, CO2 emissions under the European Union Emissions Trading System were increased by 21%, because crude oil processing in 2015 was increased by 25%. In Exploration & Production CO2 emissions under the European Union Emissions Trading System increased due to additional producexploration and production tion of electricity for the compressor stations under the EOR project (EOR started in October 2014) and the overhaul in 2014. In Ivanić Grad Fractionation facilities, CO2 emissions increased by 11%, while in Molve Gas Processing Facilities, the CO2 emissions increased by 7%.

The sale of the produced water is conducted based on annual contracts with the public water supply companies. Technological Water Withdrawal for own consumption equals Due to increased technological losses in Rijeka Refinery, the amount of Direct GHG emissions from flaring in 2015 was increased by 20%. 545,698 m3. It includes water withdrawn from own wells and water stations (underground water) and water taken from the local municDirect GHG emission from flaring is calculated from technological losses (Loss = total input – total output – technological fuel). For Exploration and Production, direct emissions from flaring decreased by 33% when compared to 2014, because flaring was increased in 2014 due to pipeline pigging and overhaul works. 111 Sustainability in ina group Waste ipal companies. Reduction of the total water withdrawal in relation to 2014 occurred because the water which used to be used for reservoir injection has not been exploited since the EOR project started. In 2015, the INA Group Waste management strategy 2015-2018 was issued. The aim of the strategy is further development of the existing waste management system, better monitoring of costs and treatment or disposal of waste generated during the past activities. During the repair of ruptured water pipes in Ivanić Grad Facilities, Crosco replaced the main water pipes and valves. This resulted in INA Group produces significant quantities of different types of waste and is dedicated to the development of sustainable waste managewater consumption decrease of 136% (in October, the consumption was 2,135 m3 and after pipes and valves replacement, the consumption ment and reduction of waste production. was 903 m3). In 2015, waste treatment contracts were signed based on a regional approach for all INA’s locations where technological waste is generated and appropriate waste treatment is applied. In Rijeka and Sisak refineries, the wastewater is treated on Wastewater Treatment Plants and the quality of wastewater is controlled in The most common types of waste generated in INA Group are soil and stones containing dangerous substances, oily sludge from plant accordance with the conditions prescribed by the Water permit. or equipment maintenance operations and iron and steel. These types of waste should be given additional attention in order to reduce production of such waste types and thereby reduce disposal costs and environmental impact. Water withdrawal and discharge in INA Group (in million m3) Furthermore, one of the main focuses is improvement of municipal waste management through enhancing separate waste collection, which will result in decreasing the municipal waste amount and better cost control. STSI has issued a Hazardous Waste Management Strategy for the period from 2015 to 2020 with the aim of planning hazardous waste treatment using the best available techniques in relation to the cost and environmental acceptability. By analysing data about the types and quantities of waste generated in INA Group, it was observed that one of the most common types of generated waste is contaminated soil. Accordingly, STSI’s strategy is directed towards the development and implementation process of bioremediation as the main method 40 for treatment of soil contaminated with hydrocarbons. Improvement is also achieved by better waste handling on the warehouse locations, where a large amount of old chemicals, spent catalysts and unusable clay was stored. A total of 353 tons of accumulated waste from warehouses were appropriately treated in 2015. 30 Non-hazardous waste (scrap materials) produced at INA, d.d. locations have been collected separately and sold to the contractors. The total income from the sale of scrap materials in 2015 amounted to HRK 3.8 mln.

The program was developed in cooperation with the top ranked consultants in HSE area, Bruno Schmaeling (IBS) Consulting Group Institute. As a starting point of the Program, a Survey on Safety Culture was conducted on representative INA Group locations. The targeted population were blue-collar employees who were invited to participate in the survey completely anonymously. The minimal targeted response of approx. 45% of site population was exceeded, so representative population was achieved and the survey was evaluated by IBS as successful. The applied survey methodology enabled the evaluation of the difference in the managers and workers’ perception of safety culture rating by seven safety culture areas and contribution of employees who rated any of safety culture areas with the lowest grade.

By implementing the above-mentioned program and the related and incorporation of HSE leadership KPIs in the managerial evaluation scope. projects, a big improvement was recorded in this KPI in the past 5 years, as it steadily dropped from 3.4 in 2011 on a Group level to 0.8 in 2015. For INA, d.d. improvements are even bigger – from 6.5 in 2010 to 0.7 in 2015. WORKFORCE SAFETY In 2015, the focus on training of personnel and extension of the program to other INA subsidiaries continued. 294 INA employees were LTIF in INA Group (Lost Time Injuries per million worked hours) (o – own employees; o+c – own employees and contractors) trained. Energopetrol, Holdina, STSI, INA Maziva and Crosco Group also joined this program in 2015. 95 workers were trained in INA subsidiaries: 30 in Energopetrol & Holdina, 18 in STSI, 14 in INA Maziva and 20 in Crosco Group.

There were no fatalities at any of our facilities. However, to continue to set new standards that will allow a more significant progression of standards application by each worker and further there was one fatality as a result of a road accident for which a third party was responsible. The analysis shows that most of our injuries improve the regulatory framework in this field. A team established on INA Group level continuously works on education and program can be contributed to slip, trip and fall type of injuries, road accidents and improper equipment handling which resulted in injuries of promotion through the above-mentioned activities in INA and INA Group, monitors the effects of these activities and, if needed, customextremities, minor wounds and bruises. ises programs and activities. In INA, there is a Central Occupational Health and Safety Committee established, where health and safety issues and programs are discussed on a company level between the employer and employees representatives with the participation of an M.D. (medical doctors) specialist for occupational health and an occupational health specialist. 100% of total workforce is represented in these committees. Representatives of the workforce are selected through elections. Currently, there are three times more representatives then legally required. The second and third phase of the Fall Protection Program in INA were started in 2015 and will continue in 2016. The ultimate goal is to increase safety for works at height and reduce the number of injuries caused by work at height to zero. The program of procuring dioptric protective glasses was started in 2014, collecting needs from all subsidiaries. In 2015, the program continued and a total of 841 employees were sent to an eye examination and received dioptric protective glasses. To enforce the Life Saving Rules (LSR) program, three more programs were launched in 2015 – LOTO (lock out – tag out) program (pilot project), Job Safety Analysis (JSA) / Last minute risk assessment (LMRA) program and STOP Card System program. LOTO pilot project was done on two sites – Refinery Rijeka and Etan. In 2016, it is planned to purchase the LOTO equipment and roll out this project in all affected sites. The JSA/LMRA and STOP Card project were rolled out in all units and subsidiaries in 2015. All affected employees and contractors were trained for implementation of this project and standardization of the permit to work process was made. ROAD SAFETY INA’s Safe Driving Program, started in 2011, is well-established in INA. In 2012, INA prescribed procedures and rules connected with safe driving, which are continuously upgraded and updated according to new standards. A series of activities was conducted within the Safe driving program, such as publishing articles on the Intranet (“Ten tips for winter 119 Sustainability in ina group CONTRACTOR SAFETY Most of the deficiencies determined during site inspections were corrected immediately.

The cornerstone of the competitiveness of a company is the the possibility of a unique display of impact given the size, activity, performance and important expectations and interests of stakeway in which it exploits the available resources, or the way in which it searches for economic rents. So there is no doubt that the most important role holders. of the company in modern society is the economic one.

The Exploration and Production Business Division, as a historically key profit contributor to INA Group EBITDA and still a significant contributor on a 10-year strategic horizon, will continue a financially sustainable organic and inorganic investment in increasing the level of production and reserves developing which are needed to halt their natural decline. In Croatia, onshore production and development activities will be focused on maximizing production from the existing domestic fields, 3D development seismic and geological exploration, continuing in the EOR project, 4P project and implementation of new reservoir stimulation technologies while in offshore, projects will be focused on production activities as well as new, future exploration activities. In Egypt and Angola, planned development and production activities will continue. In the Refining and Marketing Business Division, activities will focus on generating long-term sustainability through capacity optimization and continuous improvement of operational and cost efficiency, working on options for the modernisation and optimisation of its facilities. As with all major investments, in the context of limited balance sheet potential, the timing and prioritization of each investment project is crucial to maintain financial stability. INA’s strategic logistics presence must be maintained close to markets on which the company plans the increase of captive market. Related to this is the planned expansion of wholesale activities in the region – Slovenia, Montenegro, Albania, Kosovo and Macedonia.

Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of the entity’s net An investment in an associate or a joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investee assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share becomes an associate or a joint venture.

Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as Group’s investment in an associate and joint venture. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the ‘measurement period’ (which cannot amount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount.

Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualify as measurement period that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases. adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and or when the investment is classified as held for sale.

The difference between the carrying amount of the When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to its associate or joint venture at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the from disposing of a part interest in the associate or joint venture is included in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or the associate or joint venture. In addition, the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income loss where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of. in relation to that associate or joint venture on the same basis as would be required if that associate or joint venture had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income by that If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, associate or joint venture would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassifies the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted the gain or loss from equity to profit or loss (as a reclassification adjustment) when the equity method is discontinued. during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised at that date. The Group continues to use the equity method when an investment in an associate becomes an investment in a joint venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an associate. There is no remeasurement to fair value upon such changes in Goodwill ownership interests. Goodwill arising from an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture but the Group continues to use the equity method, accumulated impairment losses. the Group reclassifies to profit or loss the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units (or groups of cashincome relating to that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. related assets or liabilities. A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is When a group entity transacts with its associate or a joint venture, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the associate or a joint venture of the Group, are recognised in the Group’ consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of in the associate or a joint venture that are not related to the Group. the unit pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed Interests in joint operations in subsequent periods. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and On disposal of the relevant cash-generating unit, the attribute amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the gain or loss obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, on disposal. which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. 183 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Property, plant and equipment When a Group entity undertakes its activities under joint operations, the Group as a joint operator recognises in relation to its interest in a joint operation: Property, plant and equipment are shown at historical cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated • its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly; impairment loss, except for land, which is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment loss.

The Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with the IFRSs applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. In situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditures have resulted in an increase in the future economic When a Group entity transacts with a joint operation in which a group entity is a joint operator (such as a sale or contribution of benefits expected to be obtained from the use of an item of property, plant and equipment beyond its originally assessed standard assets), the Group is considered to be conducting the transaction with the other parties to the joint operation, and gains and losses performance, the expenditures are capitalised as an additional cost of property, plant and equipment. Costs eligible for capitalisation resulting from the transactions are recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements only to the extent of other parties’ include costs of periodic, planned significant inspections and overhauls necessary for further operation. interests in the joint operation. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference When a Group entity transacts with a joint operation in which a Group entity is a joint operator (such as a purchase of assets), the between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Group does not recognise its share of the gains and losses until it resells those assets to a third party. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortisation Oil and gas properties Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in use (excluding oil and gas properties) are depreciated on a straight-line basis Exploration and appraisal costs on the following basis: Exploration and appraisal costs are accounted for on the successful efforts basis. Costs relating to exploration and appraisal drilling Software 5 years are initially capitalised as intangible oil and gas assets pending determination of the commercial viability of the relevant oil and gas Buildings 5 50 years properties. Refineries and chemicals manufacturing plants 3 15 years License and data provision costs and costs associated with geological and geophysical activities are charged to the statement of profit Petrol service stations 30 years or loss in the period in which they are incurred.

If the prospects are deemed to be commercially viable, such costs are transferred to oil and The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at each year end, with the effect of any changes in gas properties. The status of such prospects is reviewed regularly by management. estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. Fields under development Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill Oil and gas field development costs are capitalised as tangible oil and gas assets. At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable Depreciation amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate Capitalised exploration and development costs of producing domestic and foreign oil and gas properties are depreciated using a unit the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the of production method, in the proportion of actual production for the period to the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual the field. cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified. Commercial reserves Commercial reserves are proved developed oil and gas reserves. Changes in the commercial reserves of fields affecting unit of Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves. Group performed reserves determination in and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. accordance with SPE PRMS (Society of Petroleum Engineers Petroleum Resources Management System) guidelines. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of Intangible assets money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. Intangible assets acquired separately are capitalized at cost and from a business acquisition are capitalized at fair value as at the date If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of of acquisition. Intangible assets are recognized if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately as expenditure, flow to the enterprise and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease. Amortisation is charged on assets with a finite useful life over the best estimate of their useful lives using the straight line method, except intangible assets on oil and gas fields are charged with a unit of production method. The amortisation period and the When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the amortisation method are reviewed annually at each financial year-end. Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that within the business are not capitalized and expenditure is charged against income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level. of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase. future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured. Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less Finance and operating leases any accumulated impairment losses. Costs in development stage cannot be amortized. The carrying value of development costs is The determination whether an arrangement contains or is a lease depends on the substance of the arrangement at inception date. If reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use or more frequently when an indicator of impairment arises during fulfilment of the arrangement depends on the use of a specific asset or conveys the right to use the asset, it is deemed to contain a lease the reporting year indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable. element and are recorded accordingly. Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are 185 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements. payments. Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the outstanding liability. The In preparing the financial statements of the individual Group entities, transactions in currencies other than the entity’s functional finance charge shall be allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the currency (foreign currencies) are translated to the functional currency of entity at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the remaining balance of the liability.

Exchange differences the Company’s strategic customers and impairment of all short-term receivables which are not included in the individual estimate, arising from year-end translation, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation regardless of their financial amount but in amount of due doubtful debt that exceeds 60 days from the maturity date. differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed of. Adequate impairment for estimated non-refundable amount is recognized in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving assets should be reduced. loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign Inventories operation), all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Inventories of crude oil, finished and semi-finished products and natural gas are valued as follows: Company are reclassified to profit or loss. − Crude oil is carried at the weighted average cost or the production cost.

Retirement Benefit and Jubilee Costs Borrowing costs For defined benefit plans for retirement and jubilee awards, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each annual reporting period. necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such Remeasurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. on plan assets (excluding interest), is reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognised Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognised in other comprehensive income is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation. Used capitalisation rate for 2015 was 2.00% and for 2014 was 2.06%. reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised in profit or loss All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are categorised as follows: Foreign currencies • service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements); The individual financial statements of each Company and the Group entity are prepared in the currency of the primary economic • net interest expense or income and environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency).

Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments. economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. A liability for a termination benefit is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination AFS financial assets benefit and when the entity recognises any related restructuring costs. Listed shares held by the Company and Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being AFS and are stated at fair value. Fair value is determined in the manner described in note 42. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised Taxation in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve directly except for interest calculated using The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are recognised directly in profit or loss. Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the Current tax investments revaluation reserve is included in profit or loss for the period. The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated Dividends on AFS equity instruments are recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive payments is established. statement of profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes The fair value of AFS monetary assets denominated in a foreign currency is determined in that foreign currency and translated at items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s and the Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that the spot rate at the statement of financial position date. The foreign exchange gains and losses that are recognized in profit and loss have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date. are determined based on the amortized cost of the monetary assets. Other foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and are accounted for using the statement of financial position A financial asset is classified at fair value through profit or loss if it is classified as held for trading or is designated as such upon liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are initial recognition. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available the near term. Attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Derivatives, including separated embedded against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if derivatives, are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments as defined by IAS 39. the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the fair value presented as finance costs (negative net changes in fair value) or finance income (positive net changes in fair value) in the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill. statement of profit or loss. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates Loans and receivables except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments and that are not quoted in an active market not reverse in the foreseeable future. are classified as ‘loans and receivables’. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each statement of financial position date and reduced to the extent that it is less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. recognition of interest would be immaterial. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the statement of financial position date. Impairment of financial assets The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each statement of financial position date. Financial assets are impaired Company expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the INA, d.d. and the Group intend to settle impairment is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted its current tax assets and liabilities. at the original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance Current and deferred tax for the period account. Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognised in other comprehensive When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognised in other comprehensive income or written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in directly in equity respectively. Where current tax and deferred tax arises from the accounting for a business acquisition, the tax effect profit or loss. is included in the accounting for the business combination.

Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Repurchase of the Company’s own equity instruments is recognised and deducted directly in equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity instruments. Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are hedges of the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized Financial liabilities firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk that Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities ‘at FVTPL’ (Fair value through profit and loss) or ‘other financial could affect the statement of profit or loss. liabilities’. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment to carrying value is amortised through the statement of profit or loss over the remaining term to maturity. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for Financial liabilities at FVTPL which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the statement of profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as at FVTPL when the financial liability is either held for trading or it is designated as at FVTPL. A financial liability is classified as held for trading if: Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for • it has been acquired principally for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. • on initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that the Group manages together and has a recent For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged, actual pattern of short-term profit-taking; or the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to the statement of profit or loss. • it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company and Group have entered into certain long-term, foreign currency supply and sales The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense contracts which, under IAS 39, include embedded derivatives. An embedded derivative is a component of a contract which has the over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees effect that the cash flows arising under the contract vary, in part, in a similar way to a standalone derivative. IAS 39 requires that such and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) embedded derivatives are separated from the host contracts and accounted for as derivatives carried at fair value, with changes in fair through the expected life of the financial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial value being charged or credited to the statement of profit or loss. recognition.

Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately unless the Provisions for decommissioning and other obligations derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or loss depends Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable on the nature of the hedge relationship.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES Provision relating to the decommissioning and removal of assets, such as an oil and gas production facility are initially treated as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment. Subsequent adjustments to the provision arising from changes in estimates Critical judgements and estimates in applying accounting policies as decommissioning costs, reserves and production of oil and gas, risk free interest such as discount rate and inflation rate are also In the application of the accounting policies, which are described in note 2, Management made certain judgements and estimates that treated as an adjustment to the cost of the property, plant and equipment and thus dealt with prospectively in the statement of profit had a significant impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements (irrespective of the underlying estimates referred to below). or loss through future depreciation of the asset. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by EU requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and Revenue recognition disclosure of contingencies. The significant areas of estimation used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced for customer returns, rebates relate to employee benefits, impairment of assets, determination of fair values of assets and liabilities and estimated decommissioning and other similar allowances. costs. Future events may occur which will cause the assumptions used in arriving at the estimates to change. The effect of any changes in estimates will be recorded in the financial statements when determinable. Sale of goods These judgements and estimates are provided in detail in the accompanying notes. However, the critical judgements relate to the Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied: following areas: − the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods; − the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective Consequences of certain legal actions control over the goods sold; INA Group members are involved in number of litigations arisen from the regular course of business. If there is a present obligation − the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; as a result of a past event (taking into account all available evidence, including the opinion of law experts) for which it is probable that − it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and if a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, − the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably. provisions are recorded (see note 32). Sales of goods that result in award credits for customers are accounted for as multiple element revenue transactions. The consideration allocated to the award credits is measured by reference to their fair value, the amount for which the award credits could Carrying value of property, plant and equipment be sold separately. The impairment calculation requires the estimate of the value in use of the cash generating units. Value in use is measured using The Group has not included extensive disclosure regarding the loyalty programme as the amounts are not significant. the discounted cash flow projections. The most significant variables in determining cash flows are product prices, operating and capital expenditures, discount rates, period of cash flow projections, as well as assumptions and judgments used in determining Rendering of services cash receipts and payments. The impairment of assets in the consolidated statement of profit or loss amounted to HRK 1,116 million Revenue from a contract to provide services is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract. The stage of in 2015 (2014: HRK 1,784 million). Additionally, effect of retranslation relating to this impairment of HRK 332 million was also completion of the contract is determined as follows: recognized in profit and loss statement in 2015. − installation fees are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the installation, determined as the proportion of the total time expected to install that has elapsed at the statement of financial position date; Carrying value of goodwill − servicing fees included in the price of products sold are recognised by reference to the proportion of the total cost of providing the In 2015 based on impairment testing for goodwill impairment in amount of HRK 31 million was recorded (see note 16), while there servicing for the product sold and was no impairment in 2014. The carrying amount of goodwill amounted to HRK 152 million as of 31 December 2015, (2014: HRK 183 − revenue from time and material contracts is recognised at the contractual rates as labour hours are delivered and direct expenses million) (see note 16). are incurred. Carrying value of intangible exploration and appraisal assets Dividend and interest revenue The carrying amount of intangible exploration and appraisal assets amounted to HRK 196 million as of 31 December 2015 and HRK Dividend revenue from investments is recognised when the shareholder’s right to receive payment has been established. 299 million 2014 (see note 14). In 2015 in INA Group financial statements the impairment of intangible exploration and appraisal Interest revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be assets is recognized in the amount of HRK 102 million (2014: HRK 107 million) (see note 14). Additionally, effect of retranslation measured reliably. relating to this impairment of HRK 29 million was also recognized in profit and loss statement in 2015. Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net Carrying value of production oil and gas assets carrying amount on initial recognition. The carrying amount of production oil and gas assets amounted to HRK 3,873 million as of 31 December 2015 and HRK 4,332 million 2014 (see note 15). In 2015 in INA Group financial statements the impairment is recognized in the amount of HRK 951 million (2014: Construction contracts HRK 1,380 million) (see note 15). According to Accounting policies and procedures the Group applied IAS 11 Construction Contracts meeting the following criteria: − individual contract value is in excess of HRK 3 million Carrying value of property, plant and equipment in refineries and marketing − the contract period is over twelve months. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in refineries and marketing amounted to HRK 5,106 million as of 31 December The Company accounts for its construction contracts using the percentage of completion method, which is determined based on the 2015 and HRK 5,073 million in 2014. As a consequence of favourable oil price for 2015 reversal of impairment is recognised in the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs. amount of HRK 53 million, (HRK 385 million of impairment was recognized in 2014). (see note 15). Determining the accounting treatment for construction contract revenue and costs: − project costs are reported as costs incurred, Key assumptions used Refining and Marketing BD − revenue is recognised based on the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, The calculation of value in use for the refinery plant CGU is most sensitive to the following assumptions: − estimated losses are presented in full whenever loss is estimated as outcome and can be measured reliably. • Crack spreads • Discount rates • Crude oil prices • USD foreign exchange rate 193 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Change in the estimates of these premises would influence the net present value (NPV) of the CGU, having an impact on the amount While such cash flows reflect the management’s best estimate for the future, these estimates are exposed to an increased uncertainty of potential impairment recognized in relation to Refining and Marketing BD. as a result of the political, security and economic conditions in Syria.

Upstream BD For estimation of future production volumes the proved developed reserves derived from business plans prior to Force Majeure were The calculation of value in use for the CGUs in Upstream BD is most sensitive to the following assumptions: used. Asset-specific discount rates were derived from the USD-based upstream weighted average cost of capital and are adjusted for • Crude oil and natural gas prices project-specific risks, as applicable. The discount rate applied was 17.1% (see note 15).

Inside the Scheme, a part of the emission allowances (one allowance = 1 tonne of CO2) are allocated to installations for free and they are used to “cover” the emissions Minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: from the previous year. If the installation has a shortage of allowances in respect to verified emissions, the rest must be bought on the market through auctioning.

Contingencies at the INA Group and INA, d.d. levels were estimated at HRK 637 million and HRK 427 million, respectively. The estimates were not recognised because the timing of the event is uncertain and there is no Harmonization of INA’s operations with the Industrial Emission Directive (IED) evidence of pollution. Directive 2010/75/EU on industrial emissions regulates the issue of environmental permits by which plant working conditions are determined and requires the application of best available techniques (BAT) by which a high level of environmental protection in Litigation general is achieved (control prevention of emissions to air, water and soil, in waste management, in energy efficiency and accident The Group is exposed to various legal claims.

During 2014 INA obtained Decisions on integrated environmental protection (environmental permits) for its four plants: the financial statements in their respect. Fractionation Facilities Ivanić grad, Gas Processing Facilities Molve, Sisak Refinery and Rijeka Refinery. In order to align the existing technology with the best available techniques, during 2015 projects are ongoing that are in various GWDF Partnership München and GWDF Limited Cyprus stages of implementation. Since alignment with BAT requires time and considerable financial investments, INA, d.d. in Croatia preIn the dispute initiated by GWDF Partnership Gesellschaft Bürgerlicher Rechts and GWDF Limited, Cyprus against INAaccession negotiations with the EU obtained for its refineries in Sisak and Rijeka a transition period to achieve full compliance by 31 INDUSTRIJA NAFTE d.d. and INA-NAFTAPLIN International Exploration, Channel Islands, in front Commercial Court in December 2017.

In the hearing held on 8 February 2011, after the parties repeated their standpoints, the court decided to request from the Republic of 241 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Germany and the Republic of Cyprus by diplomatic ways the wording of the law relevant for decision-making in this case. INA submitted its Statement of Defence in November 2015 and the arbitration procedure is currently in phase of documentation After more than three years, a hearing was held on 11 September 2014 with a new judge, but still no decision was made on the preparation. relevant law. The plaintiffs were invited to respond on the legal merits of the claim and to deliver the regulations of the German Republic regulating the relationships of damages, liability and rules of conduct in civil obligations and the provisions especially EKOMEDIA d.o.o. concerning pre-contractual liability. In September 2012 INA, d.d. entered into an agreement with company Ekomedia d.o.o. (“Ekomedia”), pursuant to which Ekomedia was granted the right to place exterior advertising boards on INA’s gas stations and replacement of them for advertising purposes to The next hearing has been scheduled for 5 February 2015 but was postponed due to illness of the judge, and a new one has not been third parties for which fee to INA is paid. The agreement was concluded for a 10-year period, with financial terms being agreed each scheduled yet. year and if they are not agreed on, this would represent a reason to terminate the agreement. Since pre-contractual liability for damage (culpa in contrahendo) is very differently regulated in German and Croatian law, the choice Ekomedia failed to regularly comply with its obligations, did not pay the fee and, when the agreement was terminated, it still owed of relevant law will directly affect the outcome of the dispute. Since the witnesses have not been heard on the merits of the case, its INA several hundred thousand Croatian kunas. outcome is at the moment completely uncertain. Consequently, INA, d.d. terminated the agreement with Ekomedia at the beginning of 2014. In response, in May 2014 Ekomedia filed a motion for interim measure to the court to prevent taking down of advertising boards from Ljubljanska banka INA’s gas stations. In November 2015 The High Commercial court has reached a final decision and rejected such Ekomedia request. The claims from plaintiff LJUBLJANSKA BANKA, Ljubljana, Slovenia against INA, d.d. in amount of HRK 61 million have arisen On 19 December 2014 Ekomedia filed lawsuit against INA, seeking performance of agreement by INA, and secondly, if it is not from two contracts of 1982 on the use of short-term foreign currency loan abroad which were concluded between INARafinerija successful with this claim, damages for lost profit of cca EUR 12.3 million. In February 2015 INA filed its official replay to such nafte Rijeka and Ljubljanska banka Osnovna banka Zagreb. Ekomedia’s lawsuit and proposed to court rejection of it. Till now, Commercial court has not reached any decision in this case. The claims of Ljubljanska banka in the concerned dispute refer to default interest debt arising from the legally binding decision of the District Economic Court (the predecessor of Commercial Court) in Zagreb which was rendered in the earlier court procedure R.I.G.-TEHNIČKI SERVISI GRUPA d.o.o. c/a CROSCO conducted on the same, above-stated, legal grounds. This is a civil procedure which is conducted before the Commercial Court in Zagreb, the plaintiff being R.I.G.-TEHNIČKI SERVISI GRUPA d.o.o. and the defendant CROSCO, naftni servisi d.o.o., dispute value equalling HRK 81.7 million with the interest running The procedure was initiated by motion for execution which was filed by Ljubljanska banka on 13 September 1995. The Commercial from March 2010, for damages caused by non-payment of extra and unforeseen works and, to a minor extent, for damages due to loss Court in Zagreb rendered the Decision on execution, however INA, d.d. filed an objection against the decision regarding the statute of of computer equipment (cca HRK 520,400.00/EUR 67,000 with the default interest). limitations, the merits and the amount of the claims, so the procedure was continued as a civil procedure initiated by a lawsuit. By the Decision of the Commercial Court in Zagreb dated on May 2011, the concerned procedure was suspended since a bankruptcy The Commercial Court rendered the Decision of 24 November 2008 whereby it dismissed the lawsuit. The plaintiff lodged an appeal proceeding was initiated against the plaintiff. The procedure was resumed because the bankruptcy trustee took over the dispute. against the afore-stated decision, which was adopted by the High Commercial Court and returned to the court of first instance for a retrial. During the retrial, the plaintiff by its application of 3 May 2010, along with the above-stated objections, also filed a claim The last hearing was held on March 2015, in the presence of intervenient as well. Hearing was postponed, due to the fact that preclusion (res iudicata) objection with reference to the above-stated procedure finalized by a legally effective decision Assembly of creditors (RIG bankruptcy procedure) was scheduled for April 2015. INA, d.d. objected regarding the prematurity of lawsuit, since a procedure is already being conducted on the same legal grounds for Management believes, based on legal advice, that no losses will be incurred, so no provision has been recognized as of 31 December the unlawfulness of execution which has in the meantime been ended by a legally effective decision, with the plaintiff requesting for a 2014 as well as 31 December 2015. retrial. INA, d.d. is also objecting in relation to the plaintiff’s capacity to sue. The outcome of the procedure is still uncertain due to the complexity of the legal matter (claims for altered default interest) however it is now more probable that the Supreme Court will take the same standpoint as the High Commercial Court, therefore no provision has been recognized. Management believes, based on legal advice, that no losses will be incurred, so no provision has been recognized as of 31 December 2014 as well as 31 December 2015. The Supreme Court has not decided on review to this date, so no legal actions were taken in 2015. SALBATRING ENERGIJA, Medunarodna trgovina, d.o.o. SALBATRING ENERGIJA, Međunarodna trgovina, d.o.o. (“SALBATRING”) initiated the arbitration procedure in front of London Court of International Arbitration by delivering the Request for arbitration on 17 June 2014. INA received Salbatring’s full Statement of Claim on 20 June 2015 by which Salbatring is claiming the amount of USD 28 million plus the interest and costs as it is indicated below: (i) Claims regarding the Coke Contract and the Settlement Agreement Salbatring is claiming that INA failed to sell coke to Salbatring in the quantities that have been agreed by the Coke Contract and the Settlement Agreement and therefore INA breached the Contract as well as the Settlement Agreement. As a consequence of the breach (non-delivery of the contracted quantities), Salbatring is claiming lost profit in the amount of USD 14 million from the Coke Contract and USD 11 million from the Settlement Agreement. (ii) Compensation for damage reputation Since, allegedly, INA’s failure to supply the contracted quantities of coke has had a serious adverse impact on Salbatring’s business and its reputation towards their buyers, they are also claiming damage to reputation in the amount of USD 2 million. As a legal ground from their claim, inter alia, they are challenging certain provisions of the Contract, interpreting it differently than INA and claiming that INA has not had an unfettered right to choose to produce and to supply little or no coke at all. 243 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Categories of financial instruments 42.

By taking this general approach, INA, d.d. assumes the business activities as a well-balanced integrated portfolio and does not hedge individual elements of its exposure to financial risks in a normal course of business. Therefore, INA, d.d. actively manages its financial risk exposure for the following purposes: • corporate level – maintaining financial ratios, covering exposure to significant monetary transactions, etc; • business segment level – decreasing the exposure to market prices fluctuation in case of deviations from the normal course of business (e.g. planned regular shutdown of refinery units for the purpose of overhaul). INA, d.d. Treasury Sector carries out finance activities of INA, d.d., coordinates finance operations of INA Group on domestic and international financial markets, monitors and manages the financial risks related to the operations of INA Group. The most significant risks, together with methods used for management of these risks are described below. INA Group used derivative financial instruments to a very limited extent in order to manage the financial risks. Derivative financial instruments are regulated by signing an ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) Agreement with counterparties. INA Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Market risk Commodity risk management (price risk) The volatility of crude oil and gas prices is the prevailing element in the business environment of INA Group. INA Group buys crude oil mostly through short-term arrangements in US dollars at the current spot market price. Necessary natural gas quantities in 2015 INA Group imported in EUR based on spot price. 245 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Foreign currency sensitivity analysis In addition to exploration and production, and refinery operations, one of the main core activities of INA, d.d. are marketing and sale of refinery products and natural gas. Prices of crude products were determined weekly based on market principles, which enables INA Group is mainly exposed to currency risk related to change of HRK exchange rate against USD and EUR, due to the fact that quicker responses to market prices fluctuations. crude oil and natural gas trading on international markets and INA Group’s debt portfolio are denominated in the mentioned In accordance with Risk Management and Hedging Policy for INA Group, for the purpose of hedging financial risk exposure on currencies. corporate and business segments level, INA, d.d. may use forward (swap) and option instruments. In 2015 INA, d.d. entered into The following table details INA Group’s and INA, d.d.’s sensitivity to a 10% weakening in HRK at 31 December 2015 (in 2014: 10%) short-term forward swap transactions to hedge its exposure on changes in inventory levels, changes in pricing periods and fixed against the relevant foreign currencies The sensitivity rates used represent management’s assessment of the usual change in foreign price contracts. The transactions were initiated to reduce exposures to potential fluctuations in prices over the period of decreasing exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies. The sensitivity analysis inventories at the refineries, as well as to match the pricing period of purchased crude oil and crude products with the crude includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a change oil processing and refinery product retail pricing periods. These transactions were hedging transactions and qualify for hedge in foreign currency rates expressed as percentage. A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit where HRK changes accounting treatment under IFRS in case of matching the pricing period of purchased crude oil and crude products with the crude oil against the relevant currency by the percentage specified above. For the same change of HRK versus the relevant currency in the processing and refinery product retail pricing periods. opposite direction, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit. At 31 December 2015 fair value of hedged items under commodity derivative transaction designated as fair value hedge was a net receivable of HRK 18 million and no net payable. The corresponding figures at 31 December 2014 were HRK 56 million receivable and INA Group HRK 35 million payable (see Note 25).

(64) (102) (146) (198) INA Group has a net long USD and EUR, and a net short HRK operating cash flow position. Generally, INA Group manages its currency risk using natural hedging, which is based on the principle that the combination of currencies in the debt portfolio should INA, d.d. reflect the currency position of INA Group’s free cash flow. Furthermore, in order to avoid excessive exposures to fluctuations in the Currency USD Impact Currency EUR Impact foreign exchange rate with respect to a single currency (i.e. USD), INA, d.d. applies a portfolio-based approach while selecting the 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 currency mix for its debt portfolio.

Interest rate risk management INA Group INA Group is exposed to interest rate risk, since entities in INA Group generally borrows funds at floating interest rates. INA Group does not speculate on fluctuations in interest rates, and therefore primarily chooses floating interest rates. However, in Liabilities Assets certain instruments and certain macro environment, the selection of fixed interest rate could be more favourable. 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 31 December 2015 31 December 2014 INA, d.d. in accordance with Risk Management and Hedging Policy for INA Group, can use interest rate swap transactions in order to manage the relative level of exposure to interest rate risk on cash flows related to borrowings with floating interest rates. As of 31 Currency EUR 1,951 2,247 489 271 December 2015 there were no outstanding interest rate swap transactions.

Embedded derivative financial liabilSpecific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: 14 14 ities • The fair value of hedge commodity transactions is calculated on the basis of actual historic quotations from Platts and market forward quotations of the underlying commodities. • The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts has been determined on the basis of exchange rates effective at the statement of financial position date and an embedded derivative has been determined as the difference between the cumulative inflation index of the contracted inflation escalation index and the inflation rate in the country of contract execution. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3. Derivative financial instruments Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement derivative financial instruments are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value, with the fair value changes being reported through profit or loss. The Group has concluded certain long-term purchase contracts that contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39. An embedded derivative is a component of a non-derivative host contract, with the effect that some of the cash flows of the combined instrument vary in a way similar to a stand-alone derivative. As required by IAS 39, such embedded derivative instruments should 251 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in 44.
