This is seen in our Core Values which is represented in the following statement:” We are Committed to our clients -through Excellenceto provide our services with Integrity and Respect.” In addition, our up-to-date ISO, EFQM, FCIC and the KAIIAE are certifications and awards attesting to our commitment to the Human Rights Principles, which is one of the components of these certificates’ methodologies. Moreover, our latest commitment to join, contribute and attend the UN Leaders’ Summit in NY, 2016 also is evidence to our commitment to the issue. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labor principles to our stakeholders. Here is a brief of what each accreditation is: EFQM: Recognized for excellence Certificate (R4E) (3 Star-2012) from the European foundation for Quality Management FCIC: Federation of Consultants from Islamic Countries (FCIC) KAIIAE: King Abdullah II Award for Excellence (the highest award at the local Level) Implementation: CEC’s implementation of the Human Rights issue is seen in the following: • CEC has a Quality Procedure Manual which every employee is familiar with, have access to and is required to follow at all times. • Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. • Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis in various formats from emails, presentations to surveys. These prompts keep our employees aligned which is one of our strategic objectives. • Implementing the CSR’s Action Plan for the year. • Our Social and Cultural Committee has been formed since 2006. The members are elected by the staff on a yearly basis and it’s aims and objectives are to provide a platform for the employee and bring, not only the employees together, but the management and employees as well. Page | 3 COP June, 2016 • We have added the Corporate Image Management unit to our organization chart in 2009. This unit’s duties and responsibility is to enhance corporate image, demonstrate the added value of our services mainly by reporting the Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives that we embark on yearly. The CSR manual is part of the written procedure for this CIM unit to be reviewed on a yearly basis. Measurement of Outcomes: Being a Strategy-Focused company, we have opted to use the Balance Scorecard Strategy tool to measure our strategic objectives on a five-year basis. This tool has been implemented since 2006 and we are now in our third 5-year strategy cycle. From our Balanced Scorecard then, we have objectives, initiatives, measures or and targets. Following is what is relevant to the Human Rights issue: • Quarterly review meetings are held to review the Balance Scorecard Strategy measures of outcomes or KPI’s. • All employees have a job description and procedures specific to their job and are audited internally and externally every year. • We require our business partners and our staff to abide by the safety requirements from enforcing safety gear on construction sites, to the safety measures to the public in the area. This is followed up by the Quality Department at all project sites. • We abide and require our business partners to work on an “Environment Assessment” for each project to insure that all projects will have no side effects on the environment or society, this is part of our Project Quality Plan (PQP) which is also included in our Procedure Manual. • Our Environment Policy has objectives, initiatives, measures and is reviewed on a yearly basis. The outcome of the review is a new action plan for the following year. • The “Core Values Commitment Questionnaire has been conducted on a quarterly basis for several years now. The results are measured, compared to previous years against a target for the year as well Preventive action will be taken in case of any result found less than 7. • We are following standard procedure for recruitment to ensure that we hire the most competent employee irrespective to gender, religion, race. This helps to give equal opportunity for all candidates and transparent system to motivate all qualified people to apply for vacant posts. Our equality for hiring is seen in the fact that our male to female ratio is at 55% and our hiring is posted on our website, social media and local newspapers. Page | 4 COP June, 2016 • Neighborhood Questionnaires are made on a yearly basis to make sure that none of our staff have violated their parking spaces, noise or privacy or have committed any other misconduct. • Ergonomics Survey is conducted every two years to look into the needs and complaints of our staff. Recommendations are made and sent to the management for approval. • Employee Satisfaction Survey is conducted on annual basis to get clear feedback from employees about their satisfaction for many aspects related to general working conditions, pay and promotion potential, use of skill & abilities and working nature. CEC management give high importance to this survey and take series actions to keep high satisfaction to motivate employees. • Reviewing CSR’s KPI’s at the end of each year brings about the new changes that needs to be done in our next CSR action plan • The Social and Cultural Committee end of year evaluation by the staff through independent survey. • See Appendix for our:  Environment Policy-Action Plan  Strategy Map  Core Values  Commitment to Core Values Questionnaire sample.  Employee Satisfaction Survey  CSR Manual  Social and cultural committee survey Labor Principles Assessment, Policy & Goals: Our Manual Procedure covers not only the duties and responsibilities of each job at the company, but provides the employees’ labor rights as well. We have a dedicated resource that monitors and mandates labor laws. Our Strategic Objective of “Enhance Knowledge Management” under the learning and growth perspective engages the employees while providing them with a platform for freedom of association and collective bargaining. This goes hand in hand with the Social and Cultural Committee discussed earlier. Our Goal is to communicate our commitment to the labour principles to our stakeholders and to maintain our compliance with labor laws and other official holidays. Page | 5 COP June, 2016 Implementation: • Our Procedure Manual, as well as, the New Employee Handbook provide the knowledge of labor rights among other information regarding the employee. • Medical Insurance coverage • Social Security. • Suggestion Box, Suggestion Form, Open Door Policy and Internal email or Memos are all ways to connect directly and discretely with upper management. • Awareness prompts that are given on a quarterly basis to inform employees regarding any new labor laws or health issues. One such presentation was WorkLife balance. • Continuous Human Resources and the Finance department training and up to date knowledge on the local labor laws. They are the dedicated resource for labor rights. • Based on management believe of the importance of employee satisfaction which has a positively impact on improving their productivity and performance, especially with respect to work-life balance, the working hours has been reduced one hour a day in 2011 after conducting a thorough study, the number of weekly working hours has become 41.25 h which is less than the legal working hours (48 hours/week). • CEC is committed to the official holidays announced by the prime minister due to religious, national and other occasions. • The Social and Cultural Committee provides a platform for employees to voice their opinions and thoughts. • Our Incentive program, Fast Track motivational program and compensations that were developed and is reviewed periodically for our employees. • Our Information Management System which every employee has access to.

Increase Utilization of Staff and Resources, and Enhance Project Quality Plan implementation are two strategic objectives, among Page | 7 COP June, 2016 others, that enable us to achieve Operational Excellence. Our goal is to decrease our recyclable waste and to shift to renewable energy whenever possible. Implementation: • We do and require our business partners to do an Environment Impact Assessment as part of our procedures within each Project Quality Plan to insure that all projects will have no side effects on the environment or society. • The energy saving installations from LED’s light bulbs to motion sensors in sinks and automatic air dryers equipment in toilettes have decreased consumption of both energy and paper. • Energy saving by installing reflective tinted sheets on windows helps to reduce energy for cooling. • The Go Green initiative by the Corporate Image Management Unit in 2014 has led to: Paper recycling in association with Jordan’s Environment Protection Institute.
