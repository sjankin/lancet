In 2016, Borregaard will continue Borregaard’s products more than compensate for the emissions to optimise the control system to further reduce the use of from production (see page 3). propane. A particular focus in 2015 was on an energy efficiency Total direct CO2 emissions generated by all of the Group’s programme which resulted in reduced energy consumption as plants were reduced by almost 9%, from 163,616 mt in 2014 well as reduced CO2 emissions. Borregaard’s direct emissions to 149,474 mt in 2015. CO2 emissions at Borregaard * A public enterprise owned by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy 6 Sarpsborg accounted for 116,296 mt, a decrease of 13,075 three years (starting from 2014). This programme delivered mt compared with the previous year. This was mainly due to savings of 50.9 GWh in 2015, compared to 2014. The lower steam consumption and increased use of biogas in the activities involve making better use of the surplus thermal spray driers. energy and waste energy to be able to reduce the amount of natural gas and electricity used.
