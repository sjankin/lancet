NORDEN's main focus in 2015 has been the development of a new CSR direction, roll-out of the 12 anti-corruption e-learning trainings and the completion of NORDEN’s human rights impact assessments both at sea and on shore. CDP NORDEN reports to the CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project) regarding our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and the impact of climate change on our business. Regulations which attempt to offset the impact of climate change as well as changes in weather patterns are the main consequences of climate change for the industry and NORDEN. NORDEN has been identified as a Nordic leader for the quality of climate change related information disclosed in 2015 to investors and the global marketplace through CDP, an international notfor-profit organisation. NORDEN has therefore been awarded a position on the Nordic Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) for the 6th consecutive year. The reported data has been independently assessed against CDP’s scoring methodology and marked out of 100. Those organisations graded within the top 10% in the region constitute the CDLI. NORDEN has scored 99 and is still the only shipping company represented in the Nordic CDLI. However, NORDEN is not part of the A list this year, as we have gone from performance band A to performance band B. This is due to a combination of reasons, such as higher activity and thereby higher fuel consumption and higher emissions than 2014, while at the same time having a decrease in revenue and number of employees from 2014 level.

(c) CO2 emissions from vessels are calculated from the fuel quantity consumed on a voyage times the duration of the voyage (calculated pro rata) times the CO2 emissions factor for each bunker type (for residual fuel oil the CO2 emissions factor is 3.1144, and for marine diesel oil and marine gas oil the CO2 emissions factor is 3.206 (source: ”Second IMO GHG Study 2009”).

Scope 2 emissions include emissions from land-based activities at NORDEN’s offices worldwide, except from the Annapolis, Santiago and Melbourne offices since electricity is integrated in their rental costs. Scope 3 emissions include emissions from chartered vessels, business travel by air transport and leased company cars. (e) SO x emissions are weighted as SO2 emissions since this is presumably what the emissions will become in time. SO2 emissions are calculated from the fuel quantity consumed during the year times the average sulphur content in the bunker fuel (in 2015: 2.01%) times 2 since sulphur is about twice as heavy as oxygen. The formula is provided by MAN Diesel & Turbo SE. (f) NO x emissions are weighted as NO2 emissions since this is presumably what the emissions will become in time. NO2 emissions are calculated from the energy that the main engine produces times the Tier I NO x limit which is 17 gr/kWh, as NORDEN’s owned and operated vessels are Tier I compliant. The energy produced is calculated using the fuel oil consumed in kg divided by the SFOC which in this case is estimated to be 0.173 kg/kWh (source “Project Guide for MAN S50MC-C7 two-stroke engine, 6th Edition, January 2009”).
