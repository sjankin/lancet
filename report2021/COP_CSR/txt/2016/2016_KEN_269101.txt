The first two principles of the UN Global Compact, which are derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are; Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: Business should make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Krystalline Salt has established a code of conduct and core values which are consequently rooted in our company culture. Our culture is about fostering respect for all, which means all our stakeholders, from our employees, local community, our consumers, customers and suppliers. We are guided by three pillars 1. Respect for all – Respect and work as a team with all stakeholders 2. Continuous improvement – challenge ourselves daily to improve our operations 3. Communication – effective and constant communication to strengthen the respect among all stakeholders and continuously improve at all levels. We expect all our staff to project the following values 1. Integrity, Passion & Ownership 2. Evolution through continuous innovation 3. Service excellence through efficiency and consistency 4. Commitment to quality and safety We recognize our obligation to conduct our activities in full knowledge of and compliance with the requirements of all regulatory and statutory legislations. –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 4/26 We support human rights of our staff through the following actions:  Maintaining a safe working environment. We have selected a committee, which we call the 5s committee at each location. This committee is tasked, to weekly audit all areas of our operation for cleanliness and safety. The report is presented to Management with recommendations and actions completed. We also have a trained Health and Safety Committee which consists of employee representatives and management. The incorporation of the employees into the committee enables the management to involve the employees in decision making and implementation of matters pertaining to employees' health and safety at the workplace. The team conducts inspection of our workplaces quarterly and take actions based on the recommendations agreed upon. The team also speer heads the investigation of injuries and incidents reported in our workplaces with the aim of understanding the root cause and taking corrective and preventive actions.  Treating employees with utmost consideration, respect, dignity and understanding. Human Resource department is accessible to all employees, regardless of their position, hence they are able to bring their concerns and recommendations to Management via the Human Resource department.  Forbidding use either directly or indirectly of forced/child labour All employees whether permanent or casuals are required to produce their national ID hence those under 18 years are not employed.  Compensating and rewarding equitably based on performance All employees whether permanent or casuals are only hired based on them producing their national ID hence those under 18 years are not employed.  Medical In-house clinic We have in place a Medical Clinic for staff within our premises in Gongoni. An average –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 5/26 of 10 employees visit the clinic daily. Other employees in Nairobi and Mombasa have access to a clinic near their locations.  Partnership with other institutes We are working with Swedish Workplace HIV/AIDs Programme (SWHAP): through a mentorship programme, which supports a variety of HIV/AIDS and Wellness programmes that we run together with the employees. We have set up a workplace committee that is tasked with creating awareness on Non communicable illness and HIV/Aids, planning activities such as voluntary testing among others. We are on the sensitization stage and mobilizing employees for testing uptake on the various illnesses, e.g. Blood sugar, blood pressure, HIV &Aids & BMI.  Personal finance management: We provide our employees with accommodation, where we provide them with free water and electricity hence enabling them to save their income and educate their children.  Lifestyle change with assurance of stable work. We have been able to convert over 250 casuals to permanent status, this has uplifted the employees’ standards of living as the income is stable unlike for a casual worker where work is not guaranteed. We support human rights of the local community through the following actions:  Provision of access routes through our salt works We have maintained access routes for the local community through our existing salt works. These enable them to access the neighbouring villages as well as the ocean. We were then given a license to expand our salt works within 800 acres of land. This include construction of evaporation pans, dykes and pump stations for the salt works. We have similarly provided and maintained access routes through the project area for the benefit of the local community. It is notable that the provided access routes are where an existing foot path was. This is to reduce any inconveniences of shifting the routes. –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 6/26  Protection of sources of water Adjacent to the expansion project area is a seasonal wetland that the local community depends on as a source of water for domestic use and for their livestock. We have conserved this area and have left it undeveloped since it’s a source of water for the community.  Respect of the local community's culture and their religion. There was a shrine or sacred groove that was being used by the local community in the past for rituals and religious practices within the company land. However, they had stopped conducting the religious ceremonies at the tree though its sacredness remained. Through consultation with the religious/cultural elders, they informed us that they could get another baobab tree and sanctify it for worship and abandon the said baobab tree. Without any violation of their right to worship and with respect to their culture and religion, they gladly relocated the shrine.  CSR committee with Community Continuous consultation with the local community has promoted a better understanding and respect between Krystalline Salt Limited and the local community. With the assistance of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers, small CSR committees have been formed per community. Each of the CSR community members have been trained on what CSR projects are; how to prepare a CSR project proposal and how to take ownership project. Since we are approachable the community is able to bring their concerns and recommendations to us. This has improved with the establishment of a Corporate Social Responsibility Committee which consist of the local community members, through which the community can get to us. –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 7/26 With Kenya Association of Manufactures and CSR community members.

Krystalline Salt Limited is sensitive to the fact that our operations may have an effect on the local and global environment. As a result of this, the management is committed to a program of continual improvement and the prevention of pollution so as to minimize the potential harmful effects of such activities.  Expansion Project We obtained a license from National Environment Management Authority – Kenya in 2015 to expand our Marereni salt works which involved construction of evaporation pans, dykes and pump stations within an area of approximately 800 acres. In order to conserve the environment and to minimize any potential nuisance of our activities to the community neighbouring the project, we have developed and maintained a 20 metres buffer zone between the project area and the neighbouring developments. The buffer zone includes 10metres of green zone and a storm water drain of 6 metres to protect from any potential floods during heavy rains. Next to the project area is a seasonal wetland that we are also conserving as part of our environmental protection responsibility.  Green Energy We developing a solar farm which will consist of the main solar farm with an installed capacity of 991.1 kWp (kilowatts at pick) to be located adjacent to our salt refinery and eleven mini-solar farms with a combined installed capacity of 811.6 kWp to be located at each pump station within the salt works. While a majority of the world's current electricity supply is generated from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas, these traditional energy sources face a number of challenges including rising prices, security concerns over dependence on imports from a –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 15/26 limited number of countries which have significant fossil fuel supplies, and growing environmental concerns over the climate change risks associated with power generation using fossil fuels.  Tree planting project With our trees growing program, we have planted approximately 96,000 more trees this year in addition to the 800,000 trees planted between 2013 and 2015, hence a total of over 896,000 trees have been planted. We aim to grow one million trees by 2017. –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 16/26 Whilst we carry on with our self-sustainability program of growing trees in our own land and engaging local farmers to grow trees for fuelling our boilers, we are also considering another alternative source of energy for our operations. For these reasons we continue to consider the use of renewable energy sources such as solar, and biomass as potential alternatives which can address some of these concerns. Our guiding principle is to meet, all relevant environmental regulations, laws and codes of practice in order to minimize any adverse environmental effects caused as a consequence of our activities and products. We implement our policies through a coordinated environmental management system. We set targets and goals to improve our environmental performance. The company maintains that a primary part of its corporate environmental strategy is to sustainably manage waste and to recycle materials wherever possible. This leads to effective waste management and efficient resource management in all departments. –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 17/26 ANTI CORRUPTION Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Krystalline is committed to conduct our business fairly, honestly and without improper influence. We are guided by our code of conduct and our core values. Integrity being our first and most important core value.

We continue to practice the ethics code and keep reminding our employees of the same. Krystalline Salt is committed to conducting its business in accordance with high ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws.

Strict controls are in place concerning processing of invoices and making payment where different staff are responsible to ensure transparency and to rule out any kind of misconduct. In 2016, we appointed Fraud and Risk consultants to carry out a 100% investigation and analysis. We have a list of recommendations from them on tightening our controls further. We have started embarking on the recommendations. Our senior staff were also trained on the fraud and risk analysis. Employees are encouraged to report any suspicious activities. There are several options they have for the communication so that they do not feel intimidated. We have experienced the challenges that come with strict discipline on anti-corruption. Our –--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Krystalline Salt Limited UNGC Communication on Progress 2015-2016 Page 18/26 expansion project was stopped for several months which made our operations slow down as the required approvals took longer than usual. Despite the losses we incurred during the period, we waited patiently until the stop order was lifted. This is among many cases where we have to wait for licenses and approvals longer than usual. However, we have adapted to start early and remain patient. Keeping all documentation and following process is helping curb the corruption virus. The Company is committed to reporting any cases of corruption and other forms of dishonesty to the relevant authorities and cooperating with the authorities in facilitating legal actions against those involved.
