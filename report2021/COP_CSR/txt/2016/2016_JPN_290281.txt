Then sales personnel work with internal planning and design departments as well as cost estimation departments to create proposals that will satisfy those customers. 10 1 2 Planning and design 2 The Takuma We develop a basic plan for each plant that will satisfy the customer’s needs. For Group Network local governments, we propose a basic plan for the plant that conforms to the purchase specifications that the ordering agency has provided. The purchase specifications indicate the conditions and level of performance required by the local government, for example in terms of the amount and type of waste it wishes to process, site conditions, and waste-fueled power generation capacity. Engineering coordinators spec out incinerators and waste heat boilers along with other systems in order to satisfy those conditions and performance requirements and determine how the equipment will be laid out at the facility. 4 3 Cost estimation We calculate the costs associated with all equipment and systems that will be installed at the plant up until the facility’s completion based on the basic plan and finalize a quotation to submit to the customer. 5 Order receipt We propose the plan developed through the collaboration of sales, planning and 9 3 design, and cost estimation coordinators to the customer. For local governments, this 1 6 2 7 proposal is submitted during the bidding process. If our proposal outshines other companies’ proposals and satisfies the customer, we will receive an order for the project. 4 Plan implementation and detailed design Once we have received an order, we transition to detailed design work to facilitate the construction of the plant. We conduct a detailed study of equipment 8 specifications and layout based on the plan and design and then proceed to finalize associated details. At this stage, specialists from a variety of fields, including combustion technology, exhaust gas treatment, and electrical control systems work together to create the detailed design. 5 Manufacture and procurement Takuma’s business offices Overseas group companies 1 Head Office 6 Chubu Branch 1 Taiden Environtech Co., Ltd.

This year, we asked customers who operate Takuma facilities for their views. by 32% compared to FY1990 levels by FY2020 and by 50% compared to FY1990 levels by FY2050. Japan Misao Wakamatsu adopted the goal of a 26% reduction compared to FY2013 levels by FY2030 (a 25.4% reduction compared to Senior Managing Executive Officer, Rengo Co., Ltd. FY2005) at the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2015. In response to that goal, our Environmental Committee adopted Participants from Takuma the same goal of a 26% reduction compared to FY2013 levels by FY2030. I believe it will be important to Shunichi Matsuhashi Executive Manager, Energy Plant Division continue a consistent series of energy-saving activities throughout the group in order to achieve steady Shohei Ohara Assistant Manager, Section 1, Plant Sales Dept. I, Energy Plant Division results as we work toward these goals. In the area of environmental investment, we’re working to transition from crude oil and coal to natural gas and LNG, and we’re actively introducing renewable energy such as solar power and biomass boilers from the standpoint of diversifying our energy use, using resources effectively, and preventing global warming. In particular, the biomass power facility you delivered to our Mr. Ohara: Our Management Principles say, Yashio Mill in August 2006 and the biomass incineration facility you delivered to our Tonegawa Mill in “Takuma will strive for social February 2012 are helping us lower CO2 emissions. As a result of energy-saving initiatives undertaken by all contribution, corporate value departments at the Yashio Mill, the facility was recognized for its exceptional pursuit of measures to enhancement, long-term coraddress global warming by Saitama Prefecture, which certified it as a semi-top-level worksite in August porate development and the 2012 and as a top-level worksite in April 2016. satisfaction of all stakeholders Mr. Matsuhashi: I’m happy that the facilities we have supplied to you have met your expectations and helped you earn by providing goods and services praise from outside the group. Going forward, what do you expect of Takuma? that are needed and recogMr. Wakamatsu: First, facility reliability and operational stability will be important issues. The paper manufacturing industry nized as valuable in society.” In is a process industry. Productivity is directly linked to management. Your facilities have excellent reliability January 2016, we delivered a CSR Activities and operational stability. Operators experience that stability directly, and I believe that it derives from the wood biomass boiler power quality of facility planning, design, and maintenance. The next issue will be improving energy efficiency. for the Future generating facility (see page Since our production processes use an extremely large amount of energy, even a 1% increase in energy effi30) to your company’s Yashio ciency would yield enormous benefits for both management and the environment. We expect the wood Mill and a biomass incineration biomass boiler power generating facility recently installed at our Yashio Mill and the biomass incineration facility (see page 31) to Marusan facility recently installed at Marusan Paper Mfg. to deliver those benefits. Your technological capability in Paper Mfg. Co., Ltd., a group reducing CO2 emissions yields major benefits for operators as well as society at large. company of yours. Today, I’d like to ask you as our customer about initiatives in the area of corporate and social sustainable development. Mr. Wakamatsu: Since its founder Teijiro Inoue shipped the first cardboard boxes from Japan to overseas customers in 1909, the Rengo Group has contributed to society by supplying the best possible packaging in order to increase the value of customers’ products and optimize their distribution flows, all while accommodating the changing times in which it operates. As the social environment undergoes enormous change, the question in which our stakeholders are most interested is whether we can achieve sustained growth. In particular, they would find it unacceptable for us to avoid environmental responsibility or CSR in response to the question of what we’re doing to help make society sustainable or how we’re helping bring such a society about. We believe that resolving these issues will help lead the way to our own sustained growth. Today, I’d like to talk about how we take environmental concerns into account in our operations and how we’re working to reduce our environmental impact, both of which are areas in which our relationship with Takuma plays a major role. Rengo has adopted the concept of “Less is more,” signaling a commitment to creating a large amount of value with few resources, in its environmental management. (The idea is to create high-quality products with higher added value while consuming as little energy as possible and producing as little carbon dioxide as possible.) Cardboard is known to be great for recycling because it’s made primarily of used cardboard and is Earth-friendly. The fact that we utilize used paper means we don’t need to cut down any trees to produce pulp. This also contributes to biodiversity. In Response from Takuma FY2014, our products were made from 98% used paper, satisfying our target of at least 97%. Apart from our group’s production process, we’re ensuring that our products themselves continue to evolve so that The 21st yearly session of the Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on they use energy and resources more effectively while having a lesser impact on the environment by reducing Climate Change and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, both held in 2015, set forth key considerations in material thickness and weight, all while maintaining the core functionality of cardboard. To address global building a sustainable society. Going forward, we believe it will be necessary to address stakeholders’ diverse and warming, we’re also working to reduce CO2 emissions. Our goal is to reduce CO2 emissions in production sophisticated needs. Takuma will work to resolve future issues by advancing its technology for reducing CO2 emissions. 41 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2016 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2016 42 Corporate Governance Corporate Governance Internal Control In order to strengthen the supervisory function of the to the execution of our business activities appropriately to Takuma has adopted a Basic Policy for Establishment of occurs, emergency headquarters are established with the Board of Directors and to enhance corporate governance, the divisions that are to execute them. an Internal Control System (the full text is available on our company president as the director in charge of risk Takuma transitioned from an Audit & Supervisory Board to An Audit & Supervisory Committee that consists of four website) in accordance with the Companies Act.

(as of June 28, 2016) Directors Outside Directors Sensing changes in society and dealing with them appropriately I was appointed two years ago as one of Takuma’s first outside directors. I’m a layman in the field, but as I have visited plants and seen how waste treatment facilities operate, I’ve been able to see how the company comes together to work on environmental issues and contribute to society, and I have gotten a sense for the seriousness of the company’s culture. We are continually pursuing corporate activities in an effort to meet a broad range of social demands and requirements, but because those demands and requirements are constantly changing, we must detect change and deal with it in an appropriate manner at all times. These days, companies are evaluated from a variety of perspectives, and we must maintain strong awareness of the fact that misapprehending risk and reacting in a Takaaki Kato Kengo Numata Hiroaki Nanjo Hiromichi Satake delayed manner can harm the company’s image and destroy trust. Fortunately, Takuma is performing well, and meticulous explanation and serious discusRepresentative Director Director Director Outside Director sion characterize the Board of Directors’ approach to governance. Recently, the role of President and Chief Executive Officer Senior Managing Executive Officer Managing Executive Officer (Audit & Supervisory Committee Member ) outside directors is seen as an important one as companies move their audit functions into Audit & Supervisory Committees, and I look forward to continuing to offer my views and ask questions of internal directors from my standpoint as an outsider while bearing in mind the interests of all stakeholders, including shareholders, business partners, and employees. Strengthening compliance and governance In addition to its environmental plant business, which has focused primarily on waste treatment plants for many years, Takuma has moved rapidly to develop a biomass power plant business recently. Most environmental plants are delivered to local governments, Corporate Governance and the biomass power plant business also has a strong public interest component that is related to national energy policy. All companies must serve society’s interests, but I believe Takuma is subject to particularly strong requirements in this regard due to the nature of its business. I believe my appointment as an outside director at Takuma four years ago reflects expectations that I would be able to draw on my long experience with government, Masahiko Izumi Tsuyohito Nishiyama Hideki Takeguchi Osamu Iwahashi primarily in police operations, to play the role of strengthening the company’s compliance and governance. Takuma’s relocation of its audit function from the Audit & Supervisory Director Director Director Outside Director Board to the Audit & Supervisory Committee also reflects a strong awareness of this social Executive Officer Executive Officer Executive Officer (Audit & Supervisory Committee Member ) perspective. Although my status has changed from outside auditor to outside director, I will continue to work to strengthen compliance and governance while redoubling the breadth of my perspective as an outsider. Executive Officers Ensuring that business activities continue in a stable manner I believe that the most important thing for companies is to ensure that their businesses continue over time. Takuma contributes to society by maintaining infrastructure that Shiro Matsumura Shunichi Matsuhashi Takashi Manabe supports people’s lifestyles and important equipment that supports companies’ business Managing Managing Managing activities. These facilities and equipment are used over extended periods of time, and it is Executive Officer Executive Officer Executive Officer essential that Takuma continue to carry out its business activities in a stable manner in order to enable customers to use its products with peace of mind. However, companies are prone to occasionally lose sight of what society requires when Ryoji Tani Norito Uchiyama Yoshiki Kita they focus too exclusively on their businesses. It is essential to exercise caution at all times Executive Officer Executive Officer Executive Officer so that the company’s assumptions and internal conventional wisdom don’t lead it off the Yasushi Enomoto Minoru Murata path it ought to be following. I believe that the role of outside directors is to verify the company’s direction by Director Outside Director Mitsuaki Adachi Akira Taguchi checking its business from a different point of view. Such verification enables the (Audit & Supervisory Committee Member ) Executive Officer Executive Officer (Audit & Supervisory Committee Member ) company to continue its business activities in a stable manner so that it can provide value to customers in the form of peace of mind. 47 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2016 TAKUMA CSR REPORT 2016 48 Human Rights and Labor Practices Respect for Human Rights and the Abolition of Discrimination 3 Improve the work environment, facilitating employees’ efforts to address business tasks without anxiety Our company sets out its respect for basic human rights ● Takuma Group Ethics Charter (excerpt) ● Work-life balance ● Labor-management relations and prohibition of discriminatory acts in the Takuma Group Ethics Charter, Takuma Group Code of Conduct and labor 4.
