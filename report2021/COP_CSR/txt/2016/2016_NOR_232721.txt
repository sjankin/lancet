Mortality K 2013 K 2013 The Group has decided not to continue the scheme with early Disability IR 73 IR 73 retirement agreements for executives employed after 1 July 2013.

These individuals will Voluntary turnover for all ages for all ages receive an additional contribution of 12 per cent of the basic salary in excess of 12G to the unfunded pension scheme, as long as they hold the post, but only until the age of 65 at the latest. The pension calculations are based on mortality table K2013. The reason is an increased life expectancy which will lead to higher pension obligations. IR 73 concerns tables for expected disability. The mortality and disability risks are based on public tables and observations of disabilities at KONGSBERG. The probability that an employee in a given age group will become disabled or die within one year, and the life expectancy is as follows: Disability % Mortality % Estimate life Age Men Women Men Women Men Women 20 0.1 0.2 89 94 40 0.3 0.4 0.1 0.0 88 92 60 1.4 1.8 0.4 0.3 87 90 80 4.4 3.0 90 92 The disability rate in IR 73 was chosen because it offers the best approach to KONGSBERG’s disability statistics. This is based on KONGSBERG's history in which approx. 25 per cent of the disability pension is reimbursed through an international pool.

Information about the background for the impairment is provided in Note 13 “Impairment testing of goodwill”. Impairment of technology and capitalised development costs is also within the business area Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies. The background for the impairment is the expectation of low or no future profit from the assets. With the exception of goodwill, which cannot be amortised, the amortisation of intangible assets is mainly straight-line over the useful life or based on the number of units produced. The amortisation starts when the intangible asset is available for use. 53 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2015 <HL Destination> ABOUT KONGSBERG • KEY FIGURES • CEO • DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • CORPORATE GOVERNANCE • SUSTAINABILITY CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Product maintenance, research and development recognised in profit and loss 2015 2014 Research Research Product and developProduct and developMNOK maintenance ment costs Total maintenance ment costs Total Kongsberg Maritime 209 582 791 203 487 690 Kongsberg Defence Systems 12 87 99 12 86 98 Kongsberg Protech Systems 31 28 59 22 57 79 Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies 10 48 58 10 60 70 Total 262 745 1 007 247 690 937 1) Last year's figures contained a reclassification between the groups “Product maintenance” and “Research and development costs” Capitalisation of development projects At Kongsberg Defence Systems, current capitalisations are related Development projects financed by customers are not capitalised, but to the development of communications systems and to KONGSBERG seeks to obtain ownership rights to the developed KONGSBERG’s share of the development of Joint Strike Missile.

Kongsberg Maritime and Kongsberg Defence Systems will not be in an impairment situation before there are relatively large changes in the key assumptions, and these changes are considered to be outside the probable outcome. For Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technology, as mentioned above, goodwill has been impaired by MNOK 192. A reduction of 2 percentage points in the EBITDA margin would increase the impairment need by an additional MNOK 118. An increase in the discount rates by 1 percentage point would in itself give an impairment of MNOK 46 in addition to the impaired amount. 55 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2015 <HL Destination> ABOUT KONGSBERG • KEY FIGURES • CEO • DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • CORPORATE GOVERNANCE • SUSTAINABILITY CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 14 Financial income and expense MNOK 2015 2014 Interest income from assets at amortised cost 31 76 Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss 9 13 Foreign exchange gain 58 40 Other finance income 11 8 Financial income 109 137 Interest expense from liabilities at amortised cost 24 30 Derivatives at fair value through profit and loss 9 12 Foreign exchange loss 38 20 Discounts of non-current provisions 3 3 Other financial expenses 35 45 Financial expenses 109 110 Net finance item recognised in income statement 27 15 Income tax Tax expense MNOK 2015 2014 Tax payable abroad 129 135 Change in deferred tax 60 270 Tax expense 189 405 Reconciliation from nominal to effective tax rate MNOK 2015 2014 Profit before tax 944 1285 Result from joint arrangements and associated companies (87) (68) Profit before tax excluding joint arrangements and associated companies 857 1 217 Tax calculated at tax rate 27 per cent of profit before tax 231 329 Effect of reducing the tax rate to 25 per cent (114) Effect of tax differences and unrecognised tax benefits abroad 14 6 Impaired goodwill 52 81 Sale of property shares (17) Other permanent differences 6 6 Tax expense 189 405 Effective tax rate 22.1% 33.2% Income from long-term construction contracts is not recognised for tax purposes until the risk and responsibility has been transferred to the customer.

The part that is not an effective hedge will be recognised through profit and loss. 3) Values based on the agreed rates and fair value in the table above also include other currencies other than USD and EUR. Loan hedges are currency hedges connected to loans in foreign currency. 4) The total change in fair value on hedged projects is MNOK -107 during 2015 (reduction of MNOK 1,387 in 2014). Derivatives used as project hedging have had the corresponding negative value through the year and the hedging has thus been 100 per cent efficient. Change of value is recognised in accounts receivable and construction contracts in progress (assets and liabilities). Currency options As of 31 December 2015 KONGSBERG had currency options with a fair value of MNOK 13. The change in fair value is recognised through profit and loss. The total hedged amount is USD 88 million. Fair value for forward exchange contracts is, in addition to the exchange rate on 31 December, influenced by the differences in interest rates in the relevant currencies. The interest rate curves that are used in the valuation are received from Reuters, which retrieves information from various market player.

The gains/losses that occur is deferred and realised in line with the progress of the projects. The carrying amount associated with effects from rollovers of cash flow hedges amounts to MNOK 585 on 31 December 2015 (MNOK 263 on 31 December 2014). 2) The net effect from the cash flow hedges before tax that are recognised in comprehensive income amounts to MNOK -425 in 2015 (MNOK -1.111 in 2014). 3) Comparison figures are changed. If an expected project is contracted and a fair value hedge is established, the recognised hedge reserve is transferred from comprehensive income to the carrying amount of the hedged project. If an expected cash flow occurs and does not result in a project hedge, the hedge reserve is recognised in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transactions. In 2015, a total of MNOK -247 was recognised related to ineffective cash flow hedges in the income statement. The amount is also included in the record “recognised gains/losses in the period” in the table above.

See table below (Interest rate swaps). KONGSBERG has a syndicated credit facility with Danske Bank, DNB, JP Morgan Chase, Nordea and SEB. The facility is for general business purposes. The facility has a term of five years with an option to extend for one year, twice. The interest rate is NIBOR + a margin that depends on the ratio between net interest-bearing loans/EBITDA and can vary from 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent. The credit facilities require that net interest-bearing debt shall not exceed three times the EBITDA, but can be up to 3.5 times the figure for three consecutive quarters at the most. The covenants in the loan agreements have been met. The credit facility was undrawn in 2015. Kongsberg Group ASA had two bond loans at the end of 2015. The bond loans were issued in NOK and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The interest is 3-month NIBOR + 1.8 per cent for loans with a nominal value of MNOK 500 and maturity in 2017, and a fixed interest rate of 4.8 per cent for the bond loan with a nominal value of MNOK 250 and maturity in 2019. The loans are capitalised at their amortised cost using the effective interest method. Other loans are minor debts incurred directly by some of the Group's subsidiaries in local banks. 63 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2015 <HL Destination> ABOUT KONGSBERG • KEY FIGURES • CEO • DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • CORPORATE GOVERNANCE • SUSTAINABILITY CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Interest rate swaps Nominal Nominal amount Fair value amount Fair value Amounts in MNOK Due date Interest rate 2015 31 Dec 15 2014 31 Dec 14 Interest rate swap agreements, floating to fixed rate1) 2 Jan 15 3.43% 150 (1) Interest rate swap agreements, floating to fixed rate1) 2 Jan 15 3.21% 120 Interest rate swap agreements, floating to fixed rate2) 2 Jan 18 2.47% 247 (9) 247 (11) Total interest rate swap agreements, floating to fixed rate 247 (9) 517 (12) Interest rate swap agreements, fixed to floating rate3) 11 Sept 19 4.80% 250 19 250 19 Total interest rate swap agreements 497 10 767 7 1) As of 31 December 2014 KONGSBERG had interest rate swaps from floating to fixed interest rate for a nominal amount of MNOK 270 relating to sales and leaseback agreements entered into as described in Note 26 “Sale and leaseback”.

No adjustment is made with respect to these prices. Level 2: Fair value is measured based on data other than the traded prices covered by level 1, but which is based on observable market data either directly or indirectly. These methods have some uncertainty in the determination of fair value. Level 3: Fair value is measured using models that substantially employ non-observable market data. This involves more uncertainty connected to the determination of fair value. See also Note 4 “Fair value” and Note 17 “Shares available for sale” for description of fair value measurement.

Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 90 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2015 ABOUT KONGSBERG • KEY FIGURES • CEO • DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • CORPORATE GOVERNANCE • SUSTAINABILITY CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Auditor’s Report 2 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements for the Parent Company and the Group.

Kongsberg Gruppen (KONGSBERG) is an international technology corporation that supplies reliable, advanced technological solutions that improve the reliability, safety and efficiency of complex operations and under extreme conditions. KONGSBERG collaborates with global customers in the defence, maritime, oil and gas, and aerospace industries. The report covers the period from 1 January 2015 to The information in the report is based on data obtained from 31 December 2015, and addresses topics we feel are of different parts of the Group.

Process to define the content The content of the report is largely defined based on what Changes in the reporting platform since the preceding we have called ‘Areas of Focus for 2014-2015’. The areas of report focus are a response to a “materiality analysis” conducted in There were no major changes in the reporting platform from 2015. In addition, the areas of focus are derived from goals 2014 to 2015. and lists of activities decided by executive management and, ultimately, by the corporate Board.

The State’s stake is managed by the Ministry of Trade and Fisheries. The process we have used to define the content of the report ensures that we are reporting in accordance with the expectations posed to us through the White Paper. Global Compact The Group joined the UN Global Compact in 2006. Membership requires that we submit a report to the UN each year, describing our activities and the advances we have made in the field of sustainability. The Group’s Sustainability Report serves as such a report – a COP (Communication on Progress). We would maintain that the report complies with Global Compact’s criteria for ‘Advanced Level’. For more details about the Global Compact, see their website at www.unglobalcompact.org Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) We use GRI’s guidelines for voluntary reporting on sustainable development. The guidelines cover financial, environmental and social dimensions related to operations, and they are the leading global initiative in this field. In 2013, GRI published a new version of its guidelines (GRI G4), calling for obligatory implementation as from the 2015 reporting year. As part of the transition to using GRI G4, a materiality analysis related to sustainability for KOG and our most important stakeholders was conducted in 2015. It is described in more detailed on the next two pages. In our opinion, our reporting practice is generally compliant with GRI’s reporting principles. GRI G4 uses a classification that indicates the extent to which a company applies GRI’s definitions and disclosure require­ments, Core or Comprehensive, respectively. KONGSBERG complies with the requirements for Core level. The report’s final pages contain a reference to the individual GRI indicators and where they are discussed in the report. For more details about GRI, see their website at www.globalreporting.org The Norwegian Accounting Act The Accounting Act requires large enterprises to report on their corporate social responsibility either in the Directors’ Report or in a separate report. The report is to cover consideration for human rights, employee rights and social conditions, the outdoor environment and the programme to combat corruption. Special regulations stipulate that reporting pursuant to the UN Global Compact or Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) can supersede the requirement for reporting in the Directors’ Report. It is our assessment that the Sustainability Report for 2015 is fully adequate and compliant with the requirements of the Norwegian Accounting Act.

We have managed to gain traction in new segments with our innovations, at the same time as we have had to adapt to a more challenging oil and gas market. After more than 200 years in operation, KONGSBERG is used to fluctuating markets and changes. We know that great changes invariably afford new opportunities for us, and we intend to take them. No matter what the Group’s further trajectory, sustainability and corporate social responsibility will remain crucial topics for us. Stronger international presence We have continued to expand our international presence, meaning more focus on corporate social responsibility, including anti-corruption, workers’ rights, human rights, climate challenges and the follow up of a responsible and sustainable supply chain. Value platform The Group’s value platform and the attitudes our values represent are the very essence of KONGSBERG’s work with corporate social responsibility. An organisation characterised by wholesome attitudes promotes behaviour that means more than most regulations and procedures. In an ever more globalised competitive situation, where companies and products alike are becoming more and more similar, a strong and visible corporate culture is crucial for differentiation, market recognition and good relations with our customers and partners. Values are put on the agenda by our leaders and key personnel, and there is a genuine follow up of individuals’ behaviour. KONGSBERG’s four values are: Determined, Innovative, Collaborative, Reliable KONGSBERG delivers solutions, products, services and Besides other specific activities associated with corporate systems to multiple industries and market segments.

The minerals are generally sold to perpetuate armed conflicts, oppression and violence perpetrated on the local population. This is a particular problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the adjacent countries (Angola, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia). The most important conflict minerals are tantalum, gold, tin and wolfram. As a result of the Dodd Frank Act that was adopted in the USA in 2010, and the OECD guidelines, companies are expected to be able to report which ‘conflict minerals’, if any, are used in their products, in which products, where the minerals originated and in which part of the value chain the minerals are introduced. KONGSBERG has drawn up a policy and routines to meet the expectations described above. 135 KONGSBERG • Annual Report and Sustainability Report 2015 BR Fokus Klimautfordringen ABOUT KONGSBERG • KEY FIGURES • CEO • DIRECTORS’ REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS • CORPORATE GOVERNANCE • SUSTAINABILITY CONTENTS AREA OF FOCUS 2015–2016 Climate challenge Global warming is most serious threat facing the Earth. 2015 was the first time the world has seen an increase in the mean global temperature of one degree compared with pre-­ industrial times.

The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of the Company. Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the Company and included the subject matters on which we provide our conclusion below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have conducted interviews of managers responsible for sustainability aspects at corporate and at Kongsberg Defence Systems – Arsenalet (Norway), as well as comparing reported data with source documentation for this unit and for the reporting units Kongsberg Maritime South-Korea and Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies – Kongsberg Software & Services PVT Ltd (India). We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to draw a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Kongsberg Gruppen has applied procedures to collect, compile and validate sustainability information for 2015 from its reporting units to be included in the Report, as summarised on pages 107 – 108. Information presented for 2015 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  Data reported for 2015 from the reporting units specified above, has been reported according to the procedures noted above and is consistent with source documentation presented to us.  Information about attainment of targets, as presented on pages 144 – 145, appropriately reflects performance related to the objectives for 2015.  The Report fulfils the content requirements for reporting in regards to sustainability as stated in the (Norwegian) Accounting Act, § 3-3c, article one.  Kongsberg Gruppen applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version G4) reporting principles and the reporting fulfils the in accordance level Core according to the GRI guidelines. The GRI Index presented on pages 152 – 156 appropriately reflects where relevant information on each of the standard disclosure elements and performance indicators of the GRI guidelines is presented. The Company’s reporting on the UN Global Compact is consistent with the description on page 108 and the UN Global Compact table presented on page 151 appropriately reflects where relevant information on each of the UN Global Compact principles is presented in the Report.
