® Rotork plc United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress 2015 STATEMENT OF CONTINED SUPPORT Our company has been a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and we continue to support it and strive to embed its principles into the everyday operations of our business. Since 2003, we have made many measurable improvements in our corporate social responsibility performance. This has included the development of, and subsequently been supported by, a CSR structure including a CSR committee chaired by the Chief Executive with sub-committees covering ethics, the environment, health and safety and social issues. In 2015, our CSR activity and performance improvements included once again exceeding the group accident frequency rate target as well as the continued support of WaterAid and Sightsavers, as Rotork’s global charities, and, in response to the humanitarian crisis in Nepal following the earthquake and subsequent aftershocks in April and May 2015, the CSR Committee also made a donation of £5,000 to Freedom Matters. We are also pleased to be able to confirm that we remain a constituent member of the FTSE4Good index. Full details of our activity and progress in 2015 can be found in our 2015 Annual Report. As a global business manufacturing control products used in a wide range of industries including water, power and oil and gas, we recognise that we have the opportunity to positively impact the lives of a significant number of individuals and businesses globally through the products we manufacture and the services we provide and it is our intention that by adopting the Global Compact principles our positive impact will continue to improve. Full details of our support for the UN Global Compact, progress and future targets can be found in the Rotork plc Annual Report 2015 which can be downloaded from our website.
