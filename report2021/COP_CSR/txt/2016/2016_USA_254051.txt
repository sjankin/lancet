In line with our Essentials for a Better Life vision, we strive to address issues like reducing our carbon footprint by understanding how it affects all aspects of our business – from regulatory complexity to cost implications to environmental and social concerns. To manage and reduce the GHG emissions from our operations, we have developed a corporate-wide GHG inventory of the three major greenhouse gases. These are Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4) and Nitrous Oxide (N20). Using the right Global Warming Potential Multipliers, these three types of emissions are combined and expressed into a single indicator called Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2e). All the GHG emissions reported internally and externally are expressed in Metric Tons of CO2e. Following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) issued by the World Resources Institute (WRI). All the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party entity to provide limited assurance of their accuracy and completeness. We report progress annually based on detailed EPA protocols. As part of our Sustainability 2015 strategy, we set a goal of reducing GHG absolute emissions from manufacturing by 5% from a 2010 baseline. Moving forward as part of our next generation goals aligned with Sustainability 2022 strategy, Kimberly-Clark set a goal of reducing GHG absolute emissions from manufacturing by 20% from a 2005 baseline.

These GHG emissions represent a reduction of 7.2% from the baseline year of 2010 exceeding expectations and surpassing the GHG emissions goal of 5% established in the corporate sustainability program “Sustainability 2015 (S2015)”. –– Energy efficiency as a relevant driver of GHG emissions reduction was improved 20% between 2010 and 2015, reducing the energy intensity in our manufacturing facilities from 14.3 down to 11.4 MBTU/MT. The focus in obtaining resources to support the execution of projects, opportunities and ideas within the three major components of the energy management strategy (energy conservation projects and lean energy, energy supply management and alternative energy projects) was key to obtaining good sustainability results and financial benefits. –– Great progress in GHG emissions reductions was achieved by some specific business sectors and regions, because of the impact of some structural asset changes oriented to optimize the manufacturing and supply chain efficiency and the execution of impactful energy projects and energy supply strategies. Some regions achieving significant reductions at 9% or higher such as Asia Pacific obtained 15% GHG emissions reduction between 2010 and 2015; K-C North America reported 10% and the K-C Latin America Operations achieved 9.3%.

G4-SO3 Risks related to In Kimberly-Clark’s Code of Conduct, we discuss mechanisms Principle 10 corruption for reporting unlawful/unethical behavior. G4-SO4 Communications In 2015, we provided 30 minutes of Code of Conduct training to all K-C Principle 10 and training on employees. Team Leaders participated in 60 minutes of Code of Conduct anti-corruption training. The 2015 Code of Conduct training did not specifically call out Human Rights as a topic within the 2015 course; however, as part of the annual Code of Conduct training, all employees were required to certify that they had read the Code of Conduct and agreed to comply with it. The Code of Conduct specifically addresses Human Rights (page 10 of the Code of Conduct). It is the policy of Kimberly-Clark to conduct business in compliance with all anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.

(DNV GL) was commissioned by Kimberly-Clark Corporation to conduct independent assurance of its 2015 Global Sustainability Report (‘the Report’), as published on the company’s website at http://www.kimberly-clark.com/sustainability Our assurance engagement was planned and carried out in accordance with the DNV GL Protocol for Verification of Sustainability Reporting, VeriSustain™. We evaluated the report for adherence to the VeriSustain™ Principles (‘the Principles’) of stakeholder inclusiveness, materiality, responsiveness, completeness, neutrality, and reliability. We evaluated the performance data using the reliability principle. It was agreed with Kimberly-Clark that the performance data in scope were: Energy, Water, and Waste as well as any applicable claims in the Report relating to that data. Data and information relating to greenhouse gas emissions are subject to a separate assurance process and are not included in the scope of our work. We understand that the reported financial data and information are based on data from Kimberly-Clark’s Annual Report and Accounts 2015, which are subject to a separate independent audit process. The review of financial data taken from the Annual Report and Accounts is not within the scope of our work. We planned and performed our work to obtain the evidence we considered necessary to provide a basis for our assurance opinion. We are providing a limited level of assurance. A ‘reasonable level’ of assurance would have required additional work at the headquarters and site level to gain further evidence to support the basis of our assurance opinion. We followed the procedures as outlined in the VeriSustain protocol to complete the project. We used the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Quality of Information Principles (Balance, Clarity, Accuracy, Reliability, Timeliness and Comparability) as criteria for evaluating performance information, together with KimberlyClark’s data protocols for how the data are measured, recorded and reported. The verification of energy, waste generation and water use assertions were verified to a limited level of assurance and the organizational boundaries are all global sites under Kimberly-Clark’s operational control. All data were verified for the period between 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2015. Responsibilities of Kimberly-Clark Corporation and of the Assurance Providers Kimberly-Clark has sole responsibility for preparation of the Report. DNV GL, in performing our assurance work, is responsible to Kimberly-Clark’s management. Our statement, however, represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform all stakeholders including Kimberly-Clark. DNV GL was not involved in the preparation of any part of the Report except for this Assurance Statement. This is our seventh year of providing assurance for Kimberly-Clark. We adopt a balanced approach towards all stakeholders when performing our evaluation. DNV GL’s assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the client to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith. DNV GL expressly disclaims any liability or co-responsibility for any decision a person or an entity may make based on this Assurance Statement. Our team included: Tom Gosselin, Stephanie Alderson, and Kim Bach Vu. 51 Kimberly-Clark 2015 GRI Report Independent Assurance Statement (CONTINUED) Basis of our opinion Our work was designed to gather evidence with the objective of providing assurance as defined by VeriSustain™. We undertook the following activities: –– Review of current sustainability issues that could affect Kimberly-Clark and are of interest to stakeholders; –– Review of Kimberly-Clark’s approach to stakeholder engagement and recent outputs; –– Review of information provided to us by Kimberly-Clark on its reporting and management processes relating to the Principles; –– We conducted in-person and phone interviews at the corporate headquarters in Roswell, GA with a selection of senior executives and managers based in Roswell, GA; Neenah, WI; Irving, TX; Sao Paulo, Brazil; and Singapore who are responsible for areas of management and stakeholder relationships covered by the Report. The objective of these discussions was to understand top level commitment and strategy related to corporate responsibility and Kimberly-Clark’s governance arrangements, stakeholder engagement activity, management priorities, and systems; –– We assessed documentation and evidence that supported and substantiated claims made in the Report; –– We interviewed internal auditors responsible for internal data verification, reviewed their work processes and approach, and discussed specific competencies related to data verification; –– We reviewed the specified data collated at the corporate level, including that gathered by other parties, and statements made in the Report. We interviewed managers responsible for internal data validation, reviewed their work processes, and undertook sample-based audits of the processes for generating, gathering, and managing the quantitative and qualitative sustainability data; –– We reviewed information systems to support reporting on energy use, waste generated and water use, including processes for collecting, processing, consolidation and report data and information; systems and processes that ensure the accuracy of data and information; design and maintenance of the information system; and systems and processes that support the information system. – In addition, we: – Examined data and information to support the reported energy use, waste generate and water use assertions; – Evaluated whether the evidence and data are sufficient to support our opinion and Kimberly Clark’s assertions. –– We provided feedback on a draft of the Report based on our assurance scope. Opinion On the basis of the work conducted, nothing came to our attention to suggest that the Report does not properly describe Kimberly-Clark’s adherence to the Principles. In terms of reliability of the performance data, nothing came to our attention to suggest that these data have not been properly collated from information reported at the operational level, nor that the assumptions used were not appropriate. 52 Kimberly-Clark 2015 GRI Report Independent Assurance Statement (CONTINUED) Observations Without affecting our assurance opinion, we also provide the following observations. Stakeholder Inclusiveness: the participation of stakeholders in developing and achieving an accountable and strategic response to sustainability. Kimberly-Clark is active in sustainability and demonstrates commitment to driving social, environmental, and economic improvement throughout its business operations and value chain. This is evident through collaborative efforts such as participation in membership industry organizations that work to address sustainability topics associated with Kimberly-Clark’s most material issues. Kimberly-Clark strives to embed a culture of stakeholder engagement at all levels of the organization and has established internal Sustainability Business Partners with the purpose of embedding sustainability into business unit goals and gaining consensus across the regions that they operate in. In our review, we found that there were several examples of the company working with stakeholders to reduce environmental impact and to increase positive social impacts. Kimberly-Clark has increased its work with its global supply chain through its standards, supplier summits, risk assessments, and corrective actions to support continuous improvement. External stakeholders were also demonstrably involved in setting the Kimberly-Clark Sustainability 2022 science-based goals. While Kimberly-Clark included key internal and external stakeholders in their materiality assessment, in future assessments, we recommend that the company should expand the scope of this assessment to include other stakeholders that can provide a unique perspective, such as regional social impact partners, and those that represent Kimberly-Clark’s growth in emerging markets. Materiality: identification of those issues which are necessary for stakeholders to make informed judgments concerning the organization and its impacts. Kimberly-Clark used the most recent sustainability materiality assessment exercise conducted in 2015 to confirm the topics covered in the report. The report addresses the most material environmental and social issues of concern to its external stakeholders and their estimated impact on the company’s business. External stakeholders were invited to be surveyed for the purposes of the materiality exercise, with additional external perspectives provided by the Sustainability Advisory Board. During this process, stakeholders were asked how each material topic could impact future business. We recommend that future reports should provide examples of these business impacts, whether these are risks or opportunities, and how they can be measured. The materiality assessment could also be further enhanced by seeking clarification that identified material issues reflect the challenges, daily efforts and resources that internal stakeholders dedicated to their areas of expertise during the reporting period. Future reports would benefit from that further level of detail in order to highlight the relative importance of specific sub-issues within the identified material topics, such as ‘free, prior and informed consent.’ Responsiveness: the extent to which the organization responds to stakeholder issues Stakeholder ideas and concerns influence decision-making throughout the organization. This is particularly evident through innovative and collaborative initiatives addressing global sustainability challenges and throughout the company’s value chain under the Sustainability 2022 goals. Kimberly-Clark is driving a supply chain and sourcing strategy that considers the risks for each commodity or category and helps decision-making based on responsible sourcing, social and environmental compliance, and water scarcity. This proactive risk-based approach also informs product design, material content, fiber policy and country-specific social standards. The company’s focus on supply chain is supported by the governance structure of sustainability reporting to the Board through the Chief Supply Chain Officer. The Global Sustainability Report is intended as a consumer-facing report and is accessible to multiple stakeholder groups. With the increasing reliability and availability of internal sustainability data, we recommend that Kimberly-Clark should consider supplementing the report with enhanced online technical detail, and could increase the frequency of performance reporting beyond the annual cycle. 53 Kimberly-Clark 2015 GRI Report Independent Assurance Statement (CONTINUED) Completeness: how much of all the information that has been identified as material to the organization and its stakeholders is reported Kimberly-Clark’s reporting of performance including the disclosure of data is comprehensive. Restatements are provided to clarify deviations or clarifications and historical data is provided to allow comparability and for stakeholders to view the company’s performance against its stated objectives. Where performance measurement deviates from the usual scope, such as labor indicators that are based on a subset of the workforce, we recommend that the report should provide contextual information to inform the reader. Neutrality: the extent to which a report provides a balanced account of the organization’s performance, delivered in a neutrality tone The tone in the Report is considered neutral with no intent to unduly influence the reader. The report equally shares successes as well as challenges. For example, the report outlines the socially-focused performance goal that Kimberly-Clark narrowly missed in the reporting year. Through our review, we found that the performance indicators are disclosed and presented in an unbiased manner without any intent to influence the reader. Reliability: the accuracy and comparability of information presented in the Report, as well as the quality of underlying data management systems Sustainability 2015 goals and performance are generally presented in a clear manner. For the data within the scope of our assurance engagement, we found that minimal technical errors have been identified based on the sampling conducted by internal audit at the corporate level and reviewed by DNV GL. Kimberly-Clark has a robust data management platform that reduces the risk of data inaccuracies. DNV GL Business Assurance U.S.A., Inc.
