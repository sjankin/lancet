Long lasting solar cells: Solar cells make no noise at all and there are no moving parts in a solar cell which makes them long lasting and requiring very little maintenance. 3. Renewable Source: Solar energy is a renewable source of energy and will continue to produce electricity for as long as the sun exists. 4. Easy Installation: Solar panels are easy to install and do not require any wires, cords or power sources. Unlike wind and geothermal power stations which require them to be tied with drilling machines, solar panels do not require them and can be installed on the rooftops which means no new space is 25 needed.

The ASD is a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges. More exactly, Lyreco decided to work with “Teacher Boonchoo’s House” which is the school for 100 Autistic children living and studying in the Thai cities of Plutaluang, Sattaheep, ChonBITA Pathways PremisES february 2015 buri.

Lyreco employees – April 2015 In 2015, Lyreco has engaged working with BITA Pathways which is a social enterprise company. “Social enterprises are businesses that trade to tackle social problems, improve communities, people’s life chances, or the environment. They make their money from selling goods and services in the open market, but they reinvest their profits back into the business or the local community. And so when they profit, society profits.” BITA Pathways makes a difference by creating opportunities for people experiencing mental health issues. BITA Pathways provides packing services to Lyreco by placing together various products into a comfort pack and the repacking security tags into the sizes the customers require. The partnership started in February 2015 and we are now looking to expand the collaboration to other services. 36 Sustainable Development Report 2015/2016 SOCIAL Actions community When a child goes to school a Nation grows!
