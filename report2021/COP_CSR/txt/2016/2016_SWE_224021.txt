Sustainability in all areas It is not possible today to run a successful company that has long-term goals without making sustainability an integral part of every decision. In order to ensure that there is a long-term perspective to our work, we have established sustainability goals that extend to 2030 and are not only linked to our material sustainability aspects but also are in line with the UN’s new sustainability targets. The measures and improvements that we are implementing in the area of sustainability start with our goals and then are rolled out throughout the entire operations thanks to JM’s management system. JM supports UN’s Global Compact and its principles regarding human rights, labor law, the environment and anti-corruption. During 2015 we established a Sustainability Council, which Uniform processes create results will be responsible for the coordination of this important work We can see clearly that our initiative in structured project and consists of myself, the other members of executive mandevelopment, which aims to create uniform components and agement and our head of sustainability. processes, has generated results.

We aim to understand how driving forces such as urbanization and demographics influence customers, and which requirements and needs are important to both current and future customers. BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND MACRO Customer needs 5 Our customers’ surroundings influence their needs. JM is to be the customer’s first choice when buying a new home on our markets. We focus on the customer’s needs. Doing so gives JM one of its most important competitive advantages. In order to assume a leading position, we must be quick to recognize and understand how people live and work. From a slightly longer term perspective, the most important societal changes include urbanization, the aging population and a firmer focus on the environment and sustainability. Trends that influence demand: • Demographic changes, an aging population and a large generation of young people entering the housing market • The urbanization trend is strong and it is expected to remain strong. People are seeking freedom of choice and diversity • Urban areas and commuting distances are growing, which makes new housing markets attractive • New technology generates new opportunities and makes Kvarnholmen at the entrance to Stockholm´s harbor. old solutions obsolete • Financial development; continued growth of real disposable income, and the population is more inclined to put a larger genuine – products that allude to a sense of security in the past. portion of income into housing, thus placing higher demands When it comes to housing and the local community, JM plays on freedom of choice, quality and accessibility an important role as a long-term and established player.

The construction industry is responsible for a significant part of society’s consumption of energy and materials, and as a homebuilder, we carry a heavy responsibility with respect to the environment for future generations. JM’s environmental priorities, the areas in which JM impacts the environment most and that are the focus of our environmental initiatives, are: • Energy use • Building materials’ impact on the environment • Building waste management • Emissions from construction machinery and transports • Management of soil contamination. How we work The Group’s quality and environment department is responsible for coordination, development and support in environmental initiatives. We are continuously conducting different development projects and after they are evaluated the improvements are then introduced in all of JM’s production. Environmental responsibility in JM’s projects lies with the line organization and is supported by regional quality and environmental coordinators. Profitable environmental program For JM, its environmental program is a matter of good business and profitability both in the short-term and the long-term. It is about taking on acute environmental projects and being entire life cycle. At the same time, project development work responsible for tomorrow’s environmental issues.

During the year, environmental work between JM Sweden and JM Norway became more integrated, and this project will continue during 2016. Examples of the areas encompassed by this project are the environmental assessment of goods and the sustainability assessment of suppliers. In Norway, we energy label all new buildings on the basis of Norwegian regulations that were introduced on July 1, 2010. Energy labeling is expected to influence the attractiveness and competitiveness of JM’s residential units. Low energy buildings in JM Norway have been implemented as the standard in all projects started since March 2012. They are designed to use at least 25 percent less energy for heating than required by law, and are distinguished by a well-insulated climate shell that is combined with balanced ventilation and a requirement to recover over 80 percent of heat. For approximately half of the apartment buildings, the heating and hot water are generally based on district heating. Estimated delivered energy for heating is 70–80 kWh per square meter and year. If the heating is based on geothermal heating, the estimated delivered energy for heating is 40–45 kWh per square meter and year. A heat pump is installed in single-family homes that transfers surplus heat from ventilation to hot water and airborne heating, combined with electric heaters. Estimated delivered energy for heating is 45–50 kWh per square meter and year. Action is being taken to reduce the amount of waste by focusing on planning, logistics and prudent management of waste during transport and storage. Standardized building methods have resulted in increased utilization of prefabricated and ready-made (dimensioned) materials. Steps have also been taken to improve waste sorting at the worksites.

Even if the increased reporting has had an unfavorable impact on the statistics, we are pleased to see that our internal audits of the work environment are showing an improvement at our construction sites. The two most common near-accidents during the year were being hit by falling or flying objects and same-level falls. The most common accidents at our construction sites were contact with sharp objects and same-level falls.

J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 SUPPLIERS 48 Sustainability A holistic approach to purchasing. Corporate Purchasing is responsible for the Group’s framework agreements. The supplier base consists of manufacturers, wholesalers, contractors and consultants. The majority of suppliers are based in Sweden, but the percentage of suppliers outside Sweden is steadily growing. Purchasing process Sustainable supplier chains JM must purchase the right materials and services from profesAs an important actor in the urban planning sector, JM’s operasional suppliers at the lowest total cost.

JM has therefore created a process to ensure that its operations have access to sustainable supplier chains. A cornerstone Development of this work is JM’s Supplier Code of Conduct, which has been Several projects are under way to develop and further streamprepared to ensure that suppliers share our fundamental valline our purchasing process, and in 2015 JM implemented ues.

The selection is based on criteria for risk factors, which in turn is based on, for example, geographic location, industry, structure of the supplier chain and companies in the manufacturing chain. The analysis consists of two parts, the first of which is based on compliance with JM’s agreement provisions and in particular the Code of Conduct. These evaluations are then followed up with on-site audits in selected factories. If any deficiencies are identified during the factory visit, the manufacturer must prepare plans for corrective measures that it must fulfill in order to continue to be a supplier in JM’s supplier chain. In some cases, the follow-up has resulted in JM stopping delivery of materials from a factory. J M A N N U A L R E P O R T 2 0 1 5 BUSINESS ETHICS 50 Sustainability Responsible decisions at all levels. In this year’s materiality analysis, business ethics was identified as a significant sustainability aspect. The basis for our approach to ethics for many years has been JM’s ethical guidelines. There is a Code of Conduct for employees that supplements JM’s ethical guidelines. The aim of the Code of Conduct is to ensure that JM employees are making the right decisions in their day-to-day activities and provide guidance in ethical issues. The Code of Conduct clarifies the values we believe in at JM. Ethical issues do not always have an obvious solution. Therefore, JM also established an Ethical Council several years ago that consists of members of the company’s management team. JM also has an incident reporting system that allows employees and external stakeholders to anonymously report suspected serious irregularities or abuses. A game about our values called “Right from me” is used by managers Competing on equal terms in order to help employees learn about JM’s Code of Conduct. JM believes it is very important that the company makes ethically correct decisions since such behavior strengthens JM’s credibility and competitiveness. In order for JM’s business the business has less interaction with other actors regarding operations to be both profitable and ethical, we have develproject-specific business arrangements. The most important oped controlled and transparent decision-making procedures business arrangements are the acquisition of land, purchasing that are applied to all business transactions. agreements and the sale of residential units.

One of the ways that we do this that all transactions are reviewed by multiple decision-makers is by providing a product that is important for society and also before the transaction is finalized, JM has created a solid basis focuses on quality and the environment.
