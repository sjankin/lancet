Joint ownership of industries with well-known 10 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2015 brands such as Kungsörnen, Start and Finn Crisp is a strength that provides stability and creates pride. Developments within Lantmännen Energy have been positive during the year, mainly due to Lantmännen Agroetanol. One of the reasons is that a growing share of our ethanol is sold in the German market, where demand for Lantmännen’s sustainable ethanol has continued to increase as a result of new policy instruments that reward greenhouse gas performance, which is in sharp contrast to the Swedish system. It is shameful that Swedish politicians fail to see the opportunities that Swedish agriculture can offer, and not even in the wake of the climate meeting in Paris is there any recognition of ethanol’s contribution to a fossil-free transport sector. Lantmännen has a well-balanced portfolio and this can to some extent balance business cycles, weather and politics, which are some of our most important external factors. Many factors worked in our direction in 2015, and with the professional commitment of our management we are able to present very good results. The strong financial position and positive growth in the agriculture operations mean that we can increase our dividend level. The Board has therefore decided to increase the refund and final price adjustment to 2 percent on trade with Lantmännen Lantbruk and retain a refund of 0.5 percent for the machinery operations. The Board also proposes that the AGM adopt a contribution dividend of 9 percent and a contribution issue of MSEK 50. Lantmännen’s good results and strong financial position show that the cooperative form of enterprise has all the conditions for both profitability and efficiency. During the year, a decision was made to modernize the Economic Associations Act, which is very positive. The update includes simplified decisionmaking processes and additional funding opportunities. There is an obvious link between a clear strategy, well-functioning management, strong corporate governance and good results. Our unique combination of a long-term approach, the natural connection to sustainable development, a processing industry that can link to origin and responsibility and a genuine commitment from owners and employees has proved very successful. This is where Lantmännen fulfills its mission – to contribute to the profitability of its owners’ farms and optimize the return on their capital in the association. I would like to conclude by thanking all employees of Lantmännen. Competent, responsible and committed employees and managers are one of our most important resources. The fact that our President & CEO Per Olof Nyman is a leader who knows the different operations well, inspires and takes the time is a great asset in a company like ours. Together we create thriving farming! Klockrike, February 2016 Bengt-Olov Gunnarson Chairman, Lantmännen Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2015 11 President’s overview 2015 has in many ways been a unique year for Lantmännen, and efforts within the framework of our long-term strategy, Strategy 2020, have produced good effects. Lantmännen’s operating income for 2015, after net financial items and adjusted for items affecting comparability, is the best we have ever achieved: MSEK 1,246 compared with MSEK 740 the previous year. Even including non-recurring items, the result is still at a historically high level.

Particular improvements were noted production efficiency measures, new innovative customer offerin the Agriculture and Energy Sectors, with the businesses ings and the acquisition of Vaasan, as well as continuing improved earnings for Lantmännen Unibake’s international operations. Lantmännen Real Estate has performed well during the year. The improved earnings are from current operations and property development projects. Major step forward in Strategy 2020 implementation While the results for 2015 are among Lantmännen’s strongest ever, we have also strategically positioned Lantmännen to continue to achieve profitable growth for our businesses. Profitable growth in the framework of Strategy 2020 will be a focus area again in 2016. We have taken major steps forward in several areas, and it is particularly heartening to have regained our position as one of the most customer-oriented and cost-effective agricultural Lantmännen’s President & CEO Per Olof Nyman in conversation with Board enterprises. In the grain value chain, our new joint grain unit Member Ulf Gundemark during a field trip in the port of Klaipeda, Lithuania. has further strengthened our platform for the future. 12 Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2015 “ Further development of the agri­business is important to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability of our owners’ farms. The Vaasan acquisition, which is the largest transaction Lantmännen has ever conducted, is another milestone in our development and an important part of Strategy 2020. The integration of Vaasan’s operations into Lantmännen Cerealia and Lantmännen Unibake has proceeded very well. With Vaasan’s and Lantmännen’s combined resources and expertise, we have created an even stronger food operation in the grain value chain in the Baltic Sea region, and a good platform for exports to other important markets. We shall continue to expand our operations in 2016, also in strategic export markets. We maintain a strong focus on innovation in the form of new products and new efficient ways of working within the Group, and we do so through more frequent exchanges between businesses in the grain value chain. We shall also offer better opportunities to take advantage of information through new technology in order to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability of our owners’ farms. A Lantmännen in constant development Our biennial group-wide employee survey was conducted at the end of 2015. The response rate was the highest ever: 90 percent of all our employees in 22 countries responded to the survey, giving us a good basis to continue developing our workplaces in the right direction. Lantmännen’s updated Code of Conduct was launched during the year, and is a development of the 2008 Code. Concrete initiatives to reduce Lantmännen’s carbon footprint are conducted continuously in our operations, partly through ongoing energy and resource efficiency measures and partly in the form of new sustainable and profitable business such as exports of climate-friendly ethanol to Germany. The launch of Kungsörnen’s new “Vänligare vete”, which is wheat flour produced with up to 20 percent less climate impact, is a clear example of how farmers and our food industry can make a big difference together. I would like to extend my thanks to all employees, customers, owners, suppliers and other partners for a good cooperation during the year. It has been a historically good year for Lantmännen, and we carry a strong momentum with us into the new year. Lantmännen’s continued ambition is to be a leading player in the grain value chain from field to fork in the Baltic Sea region, thereby contributing to thriving Swedish farming. We have taken several steps in that direction during the year, and I look forward to continuing to lead this work.

Lantmännen’s Annual Report 2015 15 Owner value for over 100 years Lantmännen’s assignment is to contribute to the profitability of its owners’ farms and optimize the return on their capital in the association. As business partners and owners of Lantmännen, they share the Group’s profit through dividends. Owner value Where are earnings created? Lantmännen consists of farming operations and extensive commercial and industrial activities including mills, bakeries and machinery operations. Most of the earnings are generated in the industrial activities. It is clear to see the advantages to Lantmännen of integration along the value chain and supplementing the agriculture-related operations with industrial activities. In this way, owners share in a higher margin and growth further along the value chain and in other industrial activities. The generated earnings are distributed to the members according to Lantmännen’s dividend policy. Refunds and final price adjustments are based on earnings from contribution-based agriculture operations. Contribution dividends and contribution issues are primarily based on earnings from operations that are not contribution-based, such as food, energy, property and some areas of the machinery business. Dividend policy The principles for dividends are set out in the dividend policy adopted by the Board. It is the Group Board’s aim for Lantmännen to generate regular and stable dividends for its owners over time in the form of refunds and final price adjustments, contribution dividends and contribution issues. The Group Board’s overall intention is that the dividend level will be adjusted to reflect factors such as financial position, earnings, cash flow, strategic investment needs and expected profitability. A member since 2001 will have had a share in dividends of SEK 4 billion from Lantmännen. How are earnings distributed? Refunds and final price adjustments are paid in proportion to the members’ business with the agriculture operations. The Board has decided to increase the refund and final Lantmännen has distributed more than price adjustment on trade with Lantmännen Lantbruk Sweden SEK 4 billion to its members since the merger by 0.5 percent to 2.0 (1.5) percent.
