Labor Principles Principle 3: Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; Principle 4: the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor; Principle 5: the effective abolition of child labor; and Principle 6: the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. Assessment, Policy, and Goals Steel Technologies fosters high ethical values and expects the same of all its employees. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct (“Code”) requires all employees to treat co-workers, customers, and themselves with dignity and respect. The Company relies upon each employee to incorporate these values into their everyday actions while employed by Steel Technologies. Steel Technologies’ international subsidiaries, Steel Technologies de México, S.A. de C.V. (“Steel Tech Mexico”) and STC Steel Technologies Canada LTD. (“Steel Tech Canada”), also implement a form of the Company’s Code, which is intended to preserve the human rights of the Company’s employees located outside the United States. Steel Technologies employs a large labor force, and we highly value each employee’s safety and rights as a laborer. The Company and its subsidiaries are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace to every employee and ensuring compliance with the labor laws of each and every country in which we operate. It is our belief and policy that conflicts between employees and management can be satisfactorily resolved through honest and frank discussions in an atmosphere of mutual trust, respect, and cooperation. Steel Technologies supports the right of all employees to work in an environment free of discrimination and harassment. Discrimination or harassment on the basis of age, race, color, religion, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, military status, pregnancy, national origin, genetic information or veteran status is strictly prohibited and is not tolerated in the workplace. In the coming year, Steel Technologies will strive to Page | 3 identify any issues that may exist, constantly improve its existing policies, and improve on the implementation of policies and procedures that even more fully incorporate the Global Compact Principles into our daily operations. Implementation • Our Code specifically endorses that it is our policy to abide by the following laws that serve to prevent discrimination: Civil Rights Act of 1964, Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Act of 1974, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008. • The Company has a range of Human Resources policies that reflect Steel Technologies’ proactive stance on human rights, including our Equal Opportunity Employer Policy. • Steel Technologies supports and adheres to the requirements of the Family Medical Leave Act, which provides qualified employees leave opportunities to aid in medical care of themselves or family members. Further, the Company provides eligible employees with leave opportunities beyond those required by law. • The Company provides eligible employees the ability to earn and accrue paid vacation days. • Steel Technologies provides eligible employees with a 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan to help provide financial security for its employees in the future and alleviate the economic encumbrances that may impede retirement. • As part of Steel Technologies’ mission, we will not knowingly or intentionally do business with any country, regime, or entity in which we are aware of human rights abuses. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a Code of Human Rights reporting statement codifying the Company’s determination that forced labor is prohibited and not acceptable in its supply chain. • Pursuant to Steel Technologies’ commitment to avoiding human rights abuses, in 2013 the Company implemented a Conflict Minerals reporting system ensuring that Steel Technologies’ suppliers are in compliance with section 1502 of the DoddFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), and reporting this information on to our customers. The purpose of the Act is to ensure that minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are not incorporated in any respect into the products we sell. • In 2015, Steel Technologies furthered its commitment to Conflict Minerals reporting by enhancing Company-wide processes to further improve internal and external reporting in order to better manage and comply with the Act. Page | 4 • To protect Steel Technologies’ employees, travel policies, protocols and protective measures have been implemented to ensure the safety of our people traveling across the globe. • To aid in adherence to Steel Technologies’ policies, we provide an independent third-party service for employees to anonymously report human and labor rights violations. The Company believes this service encourages “whistleblowers” to come forward without fear of retribution. • To enhance the safety of our employees, Steel Technologies has trained 231 employees to date in First Aid, CPR, and Automated External Defibrillator use, with the goal that at least two (2) of these individuals will be working each shift in each facility. • Steel Tech Canada employs individuals trained in First Aid and safety as required under Canada’s Occupational Health and Safety Act. • All Steel Technologies plants have designated storm shelters for employee safety during extreme weather events. These shelters allow for quick access and significant protection against severe storms. The shelters were designated as storm shelters with employee protection in mind and possess qualities to withstand severe weather. In addition, Steel Technologies provides weather radios at all facilities which monitor severe weather and provide any necessary severe weather updates. Steel Technologies’ corporate office has designated safe areas within the building. • In addition to Steel Technologies’ corporate-wide safety committee, each facility has its own safety committee comprised of salaried and hourly employees who discuss safety hazards and analyze safety compliance. • To ensure that appropriate safety measures are followed in our facilities, Steel Technologies uses a system of ongoing internal audits whereby Safety Associates monitor compliance with relevant safety standards during on-site reviews. • In the event a safety issue is raised, Steel Technologies employs a thorough investigative procedure which includes an analysis of the root cause of the issue and identifies corrective and preventive measures that can be taken. This information is then shared electronically and through plant–level presentations throughout the Company to help prevent future incidents in other plants and offices. • Steel Technologies has a safety rewards program in place. Under this program, employees may earn points to be redeemed in a reward catalog by taking proactive measures toward increasing safety, such as leading pre-shift safety huddles and reporting safety concerns. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a Contractor Safety Program for all onsite contractors to ensure the highest safety standards are followed in both Canada and the United States. Steel Technologies requires contractors to be properly certified in OSHA safety procedures and maintain the proper environmental permits to Page | 5 maintain environmentally safe work areas. This program ensures contractors at our facilities operate in a safe manner and follow all environmental regulations. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a Safety Management System in both Canada and the United States, which follows the Occupational Health and Safety Assessment Series, an internationally recognized safety standard developed by leading trade and international standards bodies to enable organizations to systematically control Occupational Health and Safety risks. This System compiles our safety data to assist with hazard identification, assessing risks and helping determine how to control these risks, and allowing for better occupational safety management at all of our facilities. Every facility within the Steel Technologies network has access to this data to help compare and contrast safety practices with the goal of achieving best practices Company-wide. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a behavior-based safety program, which involves a system of trained peer observation in monitoring and correcting safety concerns with feedback. These sessions are then tracked to identify improvement or areas of concern. This safety program focuses on eliminating or minimizing hazards and coaching employees to avoid unsafe acts. • Steel Technologies follows an annual training calendar to instruct and review a range of safety topics so employees are more informed and better protected from potential work dangers. • Steel Tech Mexico recently installed environmentally friendly Eco Pickled Surface (“EPS”) equipment that leaves steel scale-free, remarkably clean, and rust resistant with no need for a protective oil coating. EPS technology provides a safer and cleaner workplace for employees because there are no hazardous chemicals or byproducts involved (i.e. hydrochloric acid). • Steel Technologies’ wellness program facilitates at least two wellness challenges a year in an effort to improve the overall health of its employees. In 2015, the Company implemented a Fit Bit competition to promote healthier lifestyles. Additionally, the Company implemented a Healthy New You weight loss challenge and a WaterWorks competition to promote weight loss and water intake, respectively. • The Company participated in the “Eat Smart, Move More, Weigh Less” initiative, a national weight loss challenge, where participating employees obtained a chance to win a free one-month gym membership. • The Steel Technologies corporate office has ergonomic desk chairs and computer monitors, areas for comfortable employee seating away from desks and offices, and an outdoor area to improve employees’ quality of work-life. The corporate office also has designated Mother’s Rooms for nursing mothers to use safely and privately. Page | 6 Measurement of Outcomes • Steel Technologies and its subsidiaries comply with all applicable laws and regulations that are relevant to human rights and labor. Steel Technologies’ suppliers have certified to the Company that they do not source Conflict Minerals in the materials they supply to us. • Steel Technologies not only abides by all Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) regulations, but the Company goes beyond its legal requirements by implementing additional safety measures, policies, and procedures that provide its employees with as safe of a working environment as reasonably possible. • Steel Technologies operates in the steel and metal work industry, which has in the past been male dominated. In recent years, the Company has made efforts to increase its female employee population, and in 2015, the Company has increased the number of female employees in leadership positions. We continue to strive toward the creation of a diverse workplace in all of our facilities. • As part of its diversity efforts, Steel Technologies increased its employee diversity in the last year, and continues to strive for diversity on a daily basis. Specifically, as compared to 2014, the Company’s Hispanic/Latino and African American Male population both increased in 2015. • The Company’s OSHA recordable incident rate has been routinely below the industry average provided by the North American Industry Classification System. In 2015, the OSHA incident rate was 3.5. • Steel Technologies engaged 215 employees to participate in its 2015 Fit Bit competition. This competition returned an average of 52,000 steps per week in the corporate office and 101,000 steps per week in the plants. • In 2015, the Company engaged 119 participants in its Healthy New You weight loss challenge and 137 participants in its WaterWorks challenge. • Because of the Company’s dedication to wellness, in early 2016 the American Heart Association awarded Steel Technologies with the status of a Gold Level Fit-Friendly Worksite, which is the highest level of Fit-Friendly Worksite recognition. • Steel Technologies has utilized a HUMAN Healthy Vending Machine to provide healthier snacking options for its employees. In addition, the provider of the Healthy Vending Machine donates 10% of proceeds towards preventing child hunger. • In 2015, The Steel Technologies Foundation donated a total of $120,990 to 74 organizations supporting humane causes. Page | 7 Environmental Principles Principle 7: Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8: undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility; and Principle 9: encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Assessment, Policy, and Goals Steel Technologies understands that operating our facilities has an impact on the environment, and we are focused on minimizing our carbon footprint as much as reasonably possible. The Company has established responsible environmental policies for our operations across North America, and we comply with all environmental laws and regulations set by the countries in which we operate. Steel Technologies supports domestic and international efforts to conserve energy and natural resources while pursuing appropriate economic development. As a part of its commitment to environmentally responsible actions, Steel Tech Mexico has invested in EPS technology as an alternative method for steel pickling. Pickling is a value-added service that has traditionally been performed using caustic acids. EPS technology continuously reuses a mixture of steel grit and water to return a better product without the use of acid, while simultaneously reducing imperfections in the end product, and ultimately the potential for waste. Further, the removed scale and depleted grit can be recycled for other industrial purposes. A further benefit of EPS technology is that it eliminates the need for the disposal of hydrochloric acid. Steel Technologies also has incorporated more environmentally friendly practices in its U.S. facilities, which include more advanced measures for steel scrap recycling as well as a solution to recycle chemicals used in steel processing. As Steel Technologies expands its operations, our goal is to continue to utilize cleaner and more environmentally friendly techniques, policies, and procedures. Implementation • Steel Technologies employs a scrap metal recycling program in which 100% of our unused scrap metal is melted down and repurposed by raw steel mills. Both Steel Tech Canada and Steel Tech Mexico have scrap metal recycling programs that mirror Steel Technologies’ program in the U.S. • In compliance with applicable law, every Steel Technologies facility in the U.S. has Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plans, and thirteen (13) facilities have Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans. Page | 8 • In 2015, Steel Technologies consolidated its corporate headquarters and support offices into a new corporate office building (the “Building”), which received a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification. The LEED certification was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council and is a set of systems for design, construction, maintenance, and operation of green buildings. LEED’s purpose is to help building owners and occupants to be environmentally responsible and utilize resources efficiently to promote clean energy. • The Building received its highest LEED score on Indoor Environmental Air Quality, as it contains a sophisticated HVAC system designed to reduce utility costs by managing the system every fifteen minutes in order to ensure optimum energy efficiency and the ability to pinpoint problems that can be quickly rectified. Digital thermostats also aid in efficiency through automatic responses to changing temperatures. • The Building is especially energy efficient with high performance glass and mesh blinds that maintain indoor temperatures while also letting in more natural light. Additionally, the Building has a white roof to reflect sunlight and minimize the Urban Heat Island Effect. • In addition, by consolidating Steel Technologies’ corporate headquarters with its two main support offices, Steel Technologies is producing less waste and allowing for the more efficient utilization of resources. • Steel Technologies has implemented a recycling program for all of its employees in the Building. This program institutes fully commingled recycling where both paper fibers and containers are able to be mixed together, which allows for more convenient and effective recycling. Each employee is able to separate trash from recycling through special waste bins at his or her own desk. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a LEED reporting statement for our customers, which confirms certain raw material suppliers of Steel Technologies comply with LEED recycled content percentages. • Steel Technologies is in compliance with the European Union regulation “Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH),” which ensures a high level of protection for human health and the environment from harmful chemicals. Steel Technologies consistently reviews the chemicals used in our facilities to determine whether any REACH chemicals are being utilized and communicates this information to our customers. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a REACH reporting statement for our customers, which states that the Company’s steel products imported in the European Union do not require either registration or notification under the REACH Regulation. • Steel Technologies is in compliance with the Directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Page | 9 2002/95/EC (“RoHS”), recast as 2011/65/EU (“RoHS 2”), which restricts the use of hazardous materials in the manufacture of electronic and electrical equipment. • In 2015, Steel Technologies implemented a RoHS reporting statement for our customers, which states that to the best of our knowledge, no products the Company manufactures exceed the concentration limits of the restricted substances set forth under RoHS/RoHS 2. • All unused computer equipment is either donated to local high schools or is otherwise responsibly recycled. Steel Technologies recycles laptop and computer hardware (excluding hard drives) through a specialized technology recycling company. • Steel Technologies’ company cell phones are recycled through mobile buyback and recycling programs. • Recently we have implemented a Bring Your Own Device policy as part of our mission to reduce the production of electronic device waste within the Company. This policy allows Steel Technologies to reduce the number of duplicate company and personal electronic devices and thereby reduces our carbon footprint. • Steel Technologies has implemented motion sensitive lighting in several of its offices as part of our commitment to reduce energy use in our facilities. Steel Technologies uses LED light bulbs in our plants and offices in order to consume less energy and increase the lifespan of the light bulbs we use. Specifically, the Building utilizes LED light bulbs throughout its suites, hallways, and exterior walls. All replaced light bulbs are recycled responsibly. • Steel Technologies is thoughtful in its efforts to reduce waste in acquiring and maintaining furnishings for our various facilities. In moving to the new Building, the Company recycled or reassigned furniture as necessary. • Steel Technologies works to reduce the printing of unnecessary paper copies where possible. Steel Technologies also uses a document recycling company to shred and recycle printed documents that are no longer being used. • In-house cleaning personnel have committed to using environmentally friendly methods of cleaning and pest control in the Building. They use only biodegradable, non-harmful cleaning products and separate recycling from trash. • Several of the Company’s facilities implement their own unique recycling programs which include items such as paper, cardboard, batteries, and wood pallets. • Steel Tech Mexico utilizes EPS technology to reduce the use of hazardous chemicals, decrease the amount of floor space required for operations, and produce steel that requires less oil. • Steel Technologies’ facility in Ghent, Kentucky has established a system to recycle Ferrous Chloride, a chemical used in the processing of steel. In 2015, the facility began safely transporting Ferrous Chloride waste to an end-user for use in the field Page | 10 of water treatment. Additionally, the Ghent facility utilizes a car crusher to crush scrap steel in an effort to expedite the recycling and melting processes at the mills. Measurement of Outcomes • In order to promote nature preservation, The Steel Technologies Foundation pledged $50,000 over five years to The Parklands of Floyds Fork, a project linking 100 miles of nature trails. • Steel Technologies recycled 131,421 gross tons of scrap steel in 2014, and 116,960 gross tons of scrap steel in 2015. • Steel Tech Canada recycled 6,518 gross tons of scrap steel in 2014, and 14,676 gross tons of scrap steel in 2015. • Steel Tech Mexico recycled 15,310 gross tons of scrap steel in 2014, and 19,139 gross tons of scrap steel in 2015. • In 2015, Steel Technologies’ Ghent, Kentucky plant recycled approximately 200,000 gallons of Ferrous Chloride per month. Anti-Corruption Principles Principle 10: Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. Assessment, Policy, and Goals Steel Technologies is committed to high ethical standards, and we require that all employees understand and abide by these principles. The Company has trained many of its employees on compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and routinely trains its employees Company-wide on preventing corruption in its operations. Steel Technologies’ goal for the coming year is our continued strict compliance with all applicable domestic and international anti-corruption laws. Implementation • Steel Technologies’ Code requires compliance with the FCPA, anti-fraud laws, conflicts of interest disclosures, insider trading laws, and whistleblower protection. • The Company annually trains its employees on compliance with Steel Technologies’ Code as well as other legal and ethical requirements. Recently we have updated our FCPA training materials to make the training more user-friendly to our employees. We now provide a web-based training module which contains informative slides and quizzes which test the employees’ retention of the important information. Steel Technologies employees must attain a passing score in order to successfully complete the training. Page | 11 • Steel Technologies has substantially developed an Import/Export Manual in order to further support its compliance with federal and international law and provide for the safe shipment of Steel Technologies’ products into and out of the United States. Steel Technologies complies with all applicable global tariff programs, and the Import/Export Manual supports our compliance efforts even as laws and regulations become more complex and ever-changing. • Steel Technologies remains in the process of implementing a Company-wide program to further align itself with the standards of the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT). C-TPAT seeks to safeguard global trade from terrorists while maintaining the economic health of the industry. • Our International Commerce Department periodically checks our shipping records against the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security’s Denied Party List, which is comprised of individuals and entities that have been denied export privileges. • Steel Technologies encourages employees to report any potentially corrupt activities to an independent third party hotline (which may be done anonymously) as described in the Employee Handbook. • Steel Technologies is committed to fully training its employees to prevent acts of corruption, extortion and bribery. Measurement of Outcomes • Steel Technologies and its subsidiaries abide by the laws of each country in which we operate. • The Company fervently cooperates with all requests for information from authorities regarding these matters. • Senior management, officers, and a significant number of employees at Steel Technologies have received training focused solely on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption measures the Company endorses. The Company conducts periodic training of its employees, including Steel Technologies employees in Canada and Mexico, to further its commitment to prevent corruption in its operations. Page | 12
