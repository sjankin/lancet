GENERAL INFORMATION I.1. Oetker Collection strategy The Oetker Collection is a collection of exceptional hotel establishments. Being part of the Oetker Collection produces a standardised framework which defines a vision, values and responsibility principles that are shared by all establishments. Our business model is very simple and yet extremely demanding: provide our guests with a flawless service in a refined backdrop and ensure that their stay is an experience they will look back on with pleasure. This guest status is a creed that is expressed everywhere, in particular through: The Oetker Collection Constitution which embodies the importance attached to guests: Our local or international guests are our top priorities. We strive to satisfy their every desire. We do our utmost to anticipate their expectations and fulfil them to the best of our ability with a meticulous attention to detail. As far as we are concerned, “high touch” outweighs “high tech”. The 6 values that are geared towards guest satisfaction and expected of the staff are authenticity, reliability, joy, subtlety, humility and creativity. The quality program “ENCORE” TQM is focused on total guest satisfaction. Frank Marrenbach, CEO 5 We are aware of the fact that our guests are not only consumers but also citizens who are concerned about the well-being of the planet. Certain of them are deeply committed to defending environmental and social causes. We believe that being part of the Oetker Collections should be synonymous with a respect for persons and nature. The value we share with our guests brings us closer. Our commitment in favour of Social Responsibility which contributes to Sustainable Development extends beyond a simple stance: It is directly related to our business model It is a strategic lever It is an instrument to drive change It is distributed to all the operational and functional departments which are on the front line (a dedicated CSR structure providing the driving force and playing an expert and coordinating role) It is understood and embraced by all employees Our membership of the Global Compact is a major element of our commitment. We have thus joined the community of organisations which support this exemplary initiative and we have committed in particular to bring our strategy, governance and decision-making processes into line with the principles of the Global Compact. These principles are consistent with our values and the seven social responsibility principles of the ISO 26000 which we also refer to: accountability, transparency, ethical behaviour, respect for stakeholder interests, respect for the rule of law, respect for international norms of behaviour and respect for human rights. Julie Poirot, under the responsibility of Philippe Perd, is in charge of implementing our CSR strategy within the Oetker Collection. A report will be prepared on this implementation to comply with the requirements of the Global Compact which will also take into account the recommendations of the Global Reporting Initiative version 4 and the European Directive on Non-financial Reporting. The Oetker Collection has chosen to honour its social, societal and environmental commitment by adhering to the Global Compact and by reporting on the progress accomplished by the establishments of the Collection each year. It has also chosen to be assisted by the English association, “CONSIDERATE HOTELIERS”, which is specialised in helping hoteliers in this sustainable development approach. I.2.

Determining the issues In order to have a better understanding of Social Responsibility issues as they are applied to establishments such as those of the Oetker Collection, we asked the CSR France firm to carry out an assessment in 2013. This assessment covered the 7 core subjects of the ISO 26000 international standard which lays down the scope of Social Responsibility for an organisation. The analysis focused on the hotels of the Cap-Eden-Roc and Château Saint-Martin & Spa The 36 subject areas listed by the ISO 26000 were reviewed. 6 additional subject areas were reviewed with regard to governance (Afnor X 30-031 benchmark document). The assessment used by the CSR France firm followed the logic of the PDCA (continuous improvement: Plan-Do-Check-Act) and analysed both the relevance of the policies in place and the extent of the implementation and communication on initiatives and results. Out of the 35 fields of actions which were deemed to be relevant, the findings of CSR France were the following: The assessment focused on median levels No field was found to be at level 1, which means that the social responsibility issue has been taken into account The commitment was not found to be conclusive on more than a third of the fields of action The assessment highlighted the following:  “The establishments are clearly committed to social responsibility objectives that are linked to their core business which prioritised the interests of guests”  Abundant, internal communication gives a good visibility of the organisation’s strategic directions for employees. On the other hand, external communication (on CSR) lags behind. 10  A very good level of implementation of its preferred subjects (training, skills development …) ensures that the human capital is of a very high standard.  Business processes are described and assessed regularly using effective tools.  The architecture and processes attached to monitoring the ethics of operations must be improved to ensure a conclusive surveillance of the main risks generated by the activity.  The owners, who are the sole stakeholders represented on the Board, are satisfied with governance even though it can be improved from a SR point of view.  Certain issues (safety, remuneration, environment, suppliers, region …) are only partially dealt with despite the fact that they are potential risk carriers.  The challenge for the organisation is to draw up a unique, harmonised SR policy which is sufficiently flexible to take into account different historical, social, geographical and capitalistic contexts.  One improvement (on a governance level) concerned the involvement of the stakeholders. The assessment referred to a relation / cooperation with the stakeholders which could be strengthened by measures that:  identify the priority stakeholders regarding the impacts of the decisions and activities of the organisation, the risks and opportunities linked to these stakeholders and to the form of dialogue to be favoured depending on the stakeholder (transactional array ranging from simple information to the co-construction of solutions, and including consultation, cooperation …)  understand their interests depending on the subjects in question (chain of value, region, professional sector, etc.);  include these interests in decisions with possible arbitration.» 11 1.4. Involvement of the stakeholders We thus launched a major project in 2014 with the aim of drawing up a map of our stakeholders: Our stakeholders can be classed into 9 categories: PUBLIC AUTHORITIES & COMPLIANCE PARTNERS Social bodies Service partners Tax bodies SHAREHOLDERS Regulatory bodies Representatives Oetker Collection Oetker partner hotels Safety commission EMPLOYEES Relais & Châteaux Certification Administrative staff COMMUNITIES, CIVIL SOCIETY & NGOs Green Globe Accommodation staff Red Cross association MEDIA & COMMUNICATION Dining staff The Aquanautes association VIP Press (Gala, Figaro …) Technical staff Planète Urgence association Generic press (Innovation SPA, Nice RV) Sensitive members Various local associations TV Future employees Neighbours PR agencies GUESTS & CONSUMERS NATURA 2000 Internet social networks Resident guests External guests SUPPLIERS Shows & exhibitions Prospective guests Partner suppliers Vocational training schools Key account suppliers Trade unions 12 Local suppliers We have established dialogue priorities with the stakeholders: 13 I.5. Overview of our report This report mainly focuses on the policies, managerial practices and performances obtained in two reference hotels: the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc and the Château Saint-Martin & Spa which are today the pilot establishments of our sustainable development approach. The approach is in the process of being implemented in other establishments but this report will present significant initiatives which have already been undertaken in these establishments. Based on the GRI4 guidelines, this report indicates: 1) the G4 general standard disclosures corresponding to the Core option (the essential criteria) 2) the specific standard disclosures and at least one indicator linked to material aspects of each of the four GC key issues 3) the specific standard disclosures and at least one indicator linked to any other aspect that we consider to be material 14 I.6.

In addition to an official communication of the financial statements, efforts are made to communicate with other stakeholders, staff, guests, The major project on the stakeholders, the adhesion to the Global suppliers and authorities. Compact and the preparation of our first CSR report have provided the first clear improvements on these issues. 15 Communication on sustainable development – Governance At the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, awareness on environmental issues is very strong and is based on sustainable development training courses which are attended by all employees. In 2014, 158 persons received trained on various subjects such as: Waste sorting Eco-gestures at work Use of eco-labelled products Eco-conduct During the induction meeting, the CSR policy is presented to all seasonal staff. In the afternoon, the seasonal staff is able to visit the stands (CSR, HR and quality) in groups of 20. The environmental policy and the Sustainable Development Management Plan are available on the Intranet. Below are the results of the CSR questions in the anonymous social climate questionnaire which is filled in each year by employees in order to voice their opinions on life in the company, the Opinion Survey: 16 Follow-up on Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc: GOVERNANCE Awareness-raising among our employees: extended to 90% of employees in 2015 Overall objective: score of 4 for the CSR questions in 2015 DATE Objective OF YEAR Question Score Objective Difference Average OBJECTIVE MET? met?

Ethics and integrity Our Social Responsibility commitment is, by definition, placed within the scope of ethics. All our behaviour must reflect this requirement which can be seen in particular by: Compliance with the rules and regulations in force in the countries in which our hotels operate. Compliance with the international standards of behaviour that are promoted by lawful international institutions (UN, ILO, OECD …). Regarding more specifically the business ethics section, the CSR France assessment highlighted several strong points: Significant progress in the transparency of transactions. Ban on marketing an archaeological relic or object. Ban on guests marketing products in the hotels. A commitment on compliance with social and environmental norms by the subcontractors. Search for a balanced and long-term relation with its suppliers and subcontractors is favoured. Respect for property rights. Nevertheless, our policy was found to be insufficiently formalised as there was no reporting of the actions to demonstrate the level of commitment and the anti-corruption system was partial. Several actions have allowed for these shortcomings to be remedied. 18 I.8.

In the social section of the Charter, it lays the emphasis on the following points: ban on moral and sexual harassment, right to the respect of the human dignity, refusal of any form of discrimination (relating to recruitment, to the manner in which they are treated and included in the team, 29 career prospects, training and communication, and equal opportunities). The internal rules set forth provisions concerning harassment and means of prevention exist (for example, the room maids work in tandem). Various other methods have been implemented: Traceability of recruitment interviews, panels of recruiters (systematic involvement of a member of HR), partnership with Handi’job in the recognition of workers with a disability, integration of trainees and employees who are made available from ESATs [Establishments and Services that provide Assistance through Work], preparation each year of a gender comparative analysis, action plan on gender equality at the workplace which was signed on 30 April 2012, action plan in favour of employing elderly employees which was signed on 30 January 2012, and an action plan on generation contracts which is currently being prepared. All the figures below concern the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc: 30 II.2.b. Favour an optimum quality of life and support social dialogue Quality of life and remuneration The company’s wish is to comply with, and even exceed, the regulatory provisions of the classification grid of the Hotels, Cafés and Restaurants (HCR) national collective agreement and to comply with the average salaries paid in similar, local establishments. The remuneration policy is based on the statutes, the type of contract and seniority. It includes a fixed monthly salary or based on the turnover of the hotel, benefits which are related to the hotel industry such as food and accommodation advantages, a 13th month of salary, bonuses at the end of the season, bonuses that are linked to quantitative and qualitative objectives, and profit sharing. To make the life of our employees at work easier, the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc has committed to numerous points such as: A major internal training plan which is available to all employees who are interested, A company restaurant: providing balanced, healthy meals for employees at a cost of €3.52. An additional collective scheme for healthcare expenses, with ¾ of the contribution being paid by the company, along with an insurance scheme, a Company Savings Plan and a group pension plan (PERCO). A partnership with 'Loisirs Soleil Events'. This partnership enables employees to benefit from preferential rates on sports activities, museums, events and cinemas in the PACA region, as well as in France and abroad. Health and safety at work Particular attention is paid to health and safety. A unique and very comprehensive risk assessment document has been drawn up and no health or safety problem whatsoever has required a regulatory intervention over the past 12 months. The Communal Safety Commission has always issued favourable opinions. 31 Social dialogue Sommaire Exécutif Hótel du Cap Eden Roc Ensemble All Questions Catégories Classé par Moyenne du plus haut au plus bas 2011 Sondage d'opinion auprès des employés CATÉGORIES MOYE NNE Moyenne 3.71 Prestation de services/qualité Mon supérieur 4.11 3.94 An anonymous Opinion Survey on the social climate is filled in each year by the employees so that they Ressources humaines 3.77 Participation D'Aperçu Culture, ambiance et satisfaction 3.73 261 Participants Travail d’équipe Rémunération et avantages Direction de l’hôtel 3.69 3.65 3.60 can voice their opinions on life in the company.

Awards and gifts are given to the staff: employee of the month and year (QASE), long-service award, gifts on the birth of a child, retirement gifts and gifts at Christmas. Expression meetings are organised to favour social dialogue. These meetings are open to all employees and give them an opportunity to meet the Managing Director and the Human Resources Manager. Lasting for about 2 hours, they allow for upward communication by answering employees’ question. The participation rate is increasing each year (see table below). We are hoping for a participation rate of 15% in 2016. 33 34 II.2.c.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT Control our consumption and protect our environment Objectives 2015:  To reduce our consumption of water and energy to 2% in summer and 5% in winter.  To include energy eco-efficiency in our new equipment and works Our activity has an impact on the environment through: the consumption of materials, the modification of local ecosystems and the different types of pollution discharged into the biosphere. Our responsibility is first of all to abide by all the progress in regulations and exceed them were possible. Compliance with regulations is monitored with the assistance of external experts: an environmental expert company prepared a report on compliance in 2012 and put forward recommendations concerning safety and the ICPE (Installation Classified for the Protection of the Environment) approach, a law firm, with expertise in environmental law, draws up a report on the new texts which apply to the establishments each quarter. II.3.a. Through innovation reduce our consumption of resources The sustainable use of resources Energy and water consumption is under control. The consumption and related costs are available in real time on the account of the Netseenergy remote reading tool. This tool also allows for the load curves to be analysed per day, week, month, year … and per sector and allows for leaks to be pinpointed. An energy advisor gives advice on consumption and warns us in particular if there is overconsumption. Below are consumptions for the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc: 39 40 Thanks to this daily monitoring, we can note that we have reduced our water consumption by nearly 30 % between 2011 and 2014. Indeed, we were able to pinpoint various water leaks, repair them and thus save approximately 15,000 m3, in other words €30,000 by repairing them. We have reduced our water consumption since 2010 by installing:  aerators: 85 taps are equipped with aerators out of 198  double-flush toilets: 168 double-flush toilets out of 203  16 rain gages. We also note an improvement in our management of water consumption during winter unoccupancy. 41 With regard to electricity, we note that our consumption increased between 2013 and 2015. This is due to the fact that we completely renovated the hotel over a period of three years and certain installations that used gas were replaced by ones using electricity. Conversely, we see a clear improvement in consumption management during our winter closure period compared with previous years. This can clearly be seen in the reduction of gas by nearly 5 %. 42 43 The following actions have allowed for our electricity consumption to be reduced since 2010:  The installation of low energy lamps and LED: 703 LED out of 5,692 lighting points  The Hotel closure plan during 6 months in the winter (October to April),  Staff training on summer/winter eco-gestures,  Our computer equipment is mainly comprised of equipment with the Energy Star environmental certification. Energy-intensive equipment is systematically replaced at the end of its life with Energy Star labelled equipment. In 2015, we installed 52 presence detectors in 2015 in two car parks in order to avoid unnecessary lighting in the day. In addition, 120 50-watt bulbs were replaced by 6-Watt LED bulbs in the seaside changing rooms. As far as this project is concerned, we recorded a drop in consumption of 22,800kw, in other words a saving of €3,200 over the 6 months of the season. During the 2015-2016 low season, the whole of the staff building was renovated incorporating the regulations on energy eco-efficiency. We called upon a specialised firm to study the installation of photovoltaic panels on the roofs along with other innovative systems. In 2016, we plan to equip our third guest car park with LED lighting and presence detectors, representing 100 light points. In addition, our administrative offices and kitchens will be equipped with LED panels. The whole of the staff building will be renovated during the winter of 2015-2016 incorporating the regulations on energy eco-efficiency. 44 II.3.b. Understand, protect and restore the biodiversity that surrounds us Protection of the environment and rehabilitation of natural habitats The Hotel du Cap Eden-Roc property, which is situated on the Cap d'Antibes, covers approximately 8 hectares of land and includes Mediterranean species of trees including one hundred Aleppo pines, forty umbrella pines and thirty-three olive trees. The main alley of the Hotel du Cap leads to the coast, providing a breathtaking view of the Mediterranean Sea and the Lérins Islands. This area is known for its rich biodiversity and is classed as a Natura 2000 zone (site FR9301573 Bay and Cap d'Antibes, Lérins Islands ). The Hotel du Cap is also located between several marine ZNIEFF (Natural Zone of Ecological Interest for marine Fauna and Flora) sites: Type I ZNIEFF Golfe Juan and anse du crouton and Pointe du crouton , Type II ZNIEFF from the Cap d'Antibes to the pointe Bacon and Golfe Juan and anse du Crouton . 45 46 Feedback on the Bird Protection League inventory campaign The Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, situated on a unique site between a natural zone and an urbanised zone, can act as a feeding or reproduction haven for various taxons. This area is also located on a bird migration route and can be used by them as a stop-over site. Species listed on the Natura 2000 site may be found here. However, the well-maintained surrounding gardens limit the long-term installation of biodiversity. In view of its geographical location in peri-urban settings bordering a Natura 2000 zone, the Hotel du CapEden-Roc presents major challenges. Some appropriate adjustments together with the implementation of management measures would favour nature in this peri-urban backdrop while at the same respecting the Hotel’s role to welcome guests and meet their expectations: Maintaining islets of wild grass Maintaining hedges, trees and shrubs which are favourable to the fauna Install nesting boxes and homes Fight against invasive vegetation Limit plant treatments to a minimum, even biological ones Favour the installation of insects (constructed habitats for insects (insect hotels), deadwood and ponds) Favour ecological corridors for the passage of mammals (passage through fencing for small fauna, etc.) Train the technical agents 47 This feedback allowed us to implement specific actions in 2015, such as: The installation of an insect hotel near the Kid’s club to increase the awareness of our guests’ children on biodiversity. This installation will be followed by training sessions with naturalists from the Bird Protection League. The installation of wooden signs explaining our biodiversity protection actions to our guests and the sustainable management of our gardens. 48 II.3.c. Apply the regulations and strive to limit any type of pollution Waste We started waste sorting at Hotel du Cap-EdenRoc in 2010 and our aim was to increase sorted waste by 5% between 2010 and 2015. The actual figure is much higher (see table opposite). We collect plastic caps for the association Les Bouchons d’Amour and corks for the France Cancer association. We also collect the unused flip-flops and slippers of our guests for the Red Cross. We also keep sheets of paper that have only been printed on one side so that our printer can make writing pads that are then redistributed in the various departments. The majority of our bottles are returnable and our local farmers use crates for their deliveries which they take back on the next delivery. In accordance with the regulations on biowaste, we will set up a compost production system for the 2016 season. To do this, we will develop an area in the garden with compost bins for food preparation waste (peelings) from the kitchen and shredded green waste from our park. 49 Mitigation of climate change We carry out an Assessment of our Emissions of Greenhouse Gases internally. Thus, the emissions of GHG for guest transport represent 68 % of the Greenhouse Gases of the Hotel du Cap. We can see that the highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, excluding guest transport, is energy consumption and in particular gas. Supplier-related travel is calculated using a representative panel of suppliers (30%). Employee-related travel is significant since this is calculated based on our three hotels in the South of France: Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc Château Saint-Martin & Spa L’Apogée Courchevel. 50 Main emissions tCO2e 2014 tCO2e 2015 Gap tCO2e Home to job transport (car) 231,0 729,0 497,9 Hdcer – CSM (car) 14,7 17,1 2,5 Plane 99,5 153,8 54,3 Professional transport TRANSPORTS Car 0,8 0,3 -0,6 Train 0,024 0,0 0,0 Supplier transport 119,2 219,3 100,0 Guest transport 4 257,0 3498,1 -758,9 Sub-total 4722,3 4617,6 -104,8 Electricity 225,7 229,1 3,4 Gas 286,4 257,1 -29,4 ENERGY Propan 0,0 0,0 0,0 CONSUMPTION Butan 0,0 0,0 0,0 Fuel 13,3 32,5 19,2 Sub-total 525,4 518,6 -6,8 REFRIGERANT R410A 0,0 11,3 11,3 FLUIDS Sub-total 0,0 11,3 11,3 Total 5247,7 5147,5 -100,2 We can see that, from 2014 to 2015, our greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 100.2 tCO2e. This was mainly due to a decrease in guest travel, as the average length of stay increased.

SOCIETAL COMMITMENT Guarantee a service of an exceptional quality and increase the awareness of our guests on social responsibility Objectives 2015:  To ensure that at least 10% of our total purchases are sustainable purchases, with 30% of our cleaning products bearing the eco label  To get to know the expectations of our guests with regard to CSR II. 4. a. Guarantee an impeccable service and purchasing policy through fair operating practices Fight against corruption We have prepared a Code of Ethical Business Conduct for the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, the Château Saint-Martin & Spa and L’Apogée Courchevel which lays down the Oetker Collection’s commitments in the field of duty-based ethics. It reflects our historical values as they are expressed in the 7 values of the Oetker Collection and the Ethical Charter of the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, the Château Saint-Martin & Spa and L’Apogée Courchevel. All our actions must be guided by reliability, confidence and fairness requirements. We should endeavour to meet or exceed the regulatory requirements in force, fulfil our commitments and avoid conflicts of interest. We commit to produce accurate internal information and to protect the confidentiality and security of this information. We undertake to communicate openly both internally and externally. 54 The aim of these commitments is not only to ensure that our practices comply with the law and the regulations in force but also to earn and maintain the trust of our guests, our shareholders, our employees, our suppliers and other partners in the long term. The purchasing department and all buyers are aware of the problem of corruption with regard to suppliers. The Executive Committee of the three hotels regularly reviews the anti-corruption polices in order to monitor and improve the results. We prepared a Responsible Purchasing Policy in 2011 focusing on the good practices to be implemented. It was updated in 2014:  A joint commitment with our suppliers  Ensure that the programming of orders is relevant  Implement reasonable payment deadlines that comply with theLME (French Act on the Modernisation of the Economy)  Avoid unfair practices and clauses  Promote local sourcing (And limit pollution)  Integrate environmental and social criteria  Fight against discrimination and respect employees The goal of this policy is to guide our employees in their purchasing procedures. It is comprised of clearly defined objectives. This policy will be reviewed in the near future and, where applicable, will be adjusted to take into account the recommendations of the NF X50-135 standard on responsible purchasing that has been published by the Afnor and the work in progress of the ISO to prepare an international standard on responsible purchasing. We have consequently modified certain purchases since this Charter was drawn up in 2011, such as: the printer paper comes from recycled materials, the fitted carpet is ecological, the maintenance products bear an ecolabel, the shower gels in the rooms are organic and respect the health and the environment … 55 Promotion of social responsibility in the value chain Our sustainable development approach is part of a partnership with our suppliers which respects people and the environment. As a consequence, we have asked them to sign a sustainable and responsible purchasing charter which focuses on the following major issues:  A joint commitment,  Eco-friendly purchases,  Limiting pollution,  Favouring the social aspect. Our targeted supplier represents 60 % of our expenses and we classify purchases by typology to define the sustainable part of purchase compared with all of purchases, see below. Objectives 2016:  To ensure that at least 10% of our targeted purchase types are sustainable purchases, with 30% of our cleaning products bearing the eco label  To send the CSR questionnaire to 80% of our suppliers  To have 40% of suppliers sign the responsible purchasing charter (in terms of expenses) 56 Quality The Oetker Collection has a total quality management system (TQM) which is implemented in all hotels. The TQM/Encore takes into consideration all the hotel’s activities in terms of guests and employee orientation and is not only present in our minds but reflected in our everyday work. The TQM/Encore is not a model but an ongoing desire to improve ourselves. The key principles of the TQM/Encore philosophy are: Quality is based on the guests Quality is obtained by the employees of all departments at all levels Quality is not a goal but an endless process Quality does not only refer to products but to services too Quality requires dynamic behaviour and must be worked on constantly UPS (Unsolved Problems & Solutions) is an Intranet tool which deals with our guests’ complaints. The goal of this application is to produce and maintain a simple and effective system which traces complaints and solves them in the best way and as quickly as possible. Quality is a top priority in our hotels. As a consequence, a quality system exists called Leading Quality Assurance (LQA). LQA is specialised in carrying out quality assurance checks, comparative analyses and training departments in the luxury hotel sector, thereby allowing guests to monitor and improve their operational performance. This has resulted in three audits by a mysterious guest, internal tests and action plans with each head of department are monitored throughout the season to ensure compliance. 2014 Results Château Saint-Martin & Spa: 91.90 % 2014 Results – Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc: 88,90 % 2015 Objective of 92 % for each Hotel 57 In addition, each guest is given a satisfaction questionnaire the day before they leave including three questions which allow the hotel to prepare internal satisfaction statistics each month. Results of the guest satisfaction surveys on 3 points: HOSPITALITY CARE – REQUESTS: Château Saint-Martin & Spa: 87% Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc : 91% We are looking to ascertain the percentage of guests who think that we go beyond their expectations and to achieve this, a questionnaire is given to each guest the day before they leave. Consumers’ health and safety We have taken out insurance policies and have instruments to protect our guests while they stay in our hotels. As far as food hygiene is concerned, our kitchen department has adopted the HACCP system which is a food safety control programme. As a consequence, laboratory tests on preparations are carried out once a month to avoid any risk. Kitchen inspection visits by external bodies are also carried out each month. The temperatures of the freezers and refrigerators are monitored several times a day and recorded. As required in the regulations, we carry out tests on the water of our network for legionellosis so that there is no contamination whatsoever. All our equipment has maintenance contracts and is managed by external companies. We provide our guests with exemplary confidentiality to protect their privacy and any information that might concern them. To achieve this, we have implemented an anti-spam policy, each employment contract contains a confidentiality clause and each computer is protected by its user’s own code. 58 II. 4. b. Encourage our guests to contribute to our vision of a sustainable future Education and awareness raising Guests are informed about our responsibility policy through various media:  Written When guests arrive in their room, they are given a card called the “Jewels of our Heritage” which informs them of the visits available in the region and, overleaf, a map of our hotel with the possibility of enjoying a guided tour on the botanical, cultural and historical aspects of the hotel and anecdotes. A double page on our environmental policy is available in the Room Directory of each room. Press releases giving information on new CSR developments are drawn up and distributed to our press agencies and journalists to be widely disseminated in the press. Every year, our marketing team informs the sale representative offices in the world of our KSP: Key Selling Points. This is a list of strengths that the Hotel has to underline in order to market itself better. The list includes the words 'Certified Green Globe since 2013'. We are proud of this certification and ask our sales representatives to draw attention to this in their respective markets. 59  Web In the booking confirmation emails there is a reference to the fact that the transport used by our guests has an impact on greenhouse gases and we provide a link to a website to offset these emissions. Our certifications appear after our email signatures: Green Globe and Tripadvisor Eco-Leader. The Green Globe certification and the Eco-leaders logo can be seen in the welcoming text on the home page of our hotels’ websites. The Facebook accounts of our hotels publish news on sustainable development once a month and a Facebook account on the CSR department of the 3 hotels has just been created.  Oral When preparing the invoice, we inform our guests that the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc donates €1 per room in favour of a marine environment association: the Aquanautes. Our guests are then given the possibility of making a donation to protect biodiversity. Building on this partnership with the association les Aquanautes, we have organised guided tours of the Espace du Littoral et de la Mer (Coastal and Sea Centre) which is just next to the Kid’s Club at the Hotel. This has raised the awareness of our guests’ children on the importance of protecting the Mediterranean.  Events and experiences . Guests are transported in electric vehicles around the establishment. 60 Honey from our sponsorship of an association Un toit pour les abeilles (A roof for bees) is available during the breakfast buffet. We place a 'Giving Bag' in each room. Guests are encouraged to use this for any clothes or shoes that they do not wish to take back with them in their luggage. The Hotel agrees to give these donations to a local charity, namely the Red Cross. Project for 2016 We wish to offer our guests the opportunity to contribute to the protection of Mediterranean fauna and flora by making a donation that will be given in full to our partners: the association 'Pour une planète bleue' and our neighbour, l'Espace Mer et Littoral. In return, our guests can take a plush turtle home with them (minimum value €15). This cuddly toy represents the 'caretta caretta' loggerhead sea turtle, which is typical of the Mediterranean. It was created in collaboration with the aforementioned partners. 61 Guarantee a service of an exceptional quality and increase the awareness of our guests on social responsibility ACTION CONDUCTED ACTION CONDUCTED Provide information on our CSR policy Ethical Charter and CSR survey Making the CSR report available in the rooms on Sending the CSR Charter and touchscreen tablets questionnaire to our most important Offering our guests the opportunity to make a suppliers: those that represent 70% of our social contribution through the ‘giving bag’ expenditure 62 Guarantee a service of an exceptional quality and raise the awareness of our guests on social responsibility More than 92% 2016 Improvement objectives LQA 63%  Extending our sustainable purchasing analysis to the Food & Beverage Of our office products are procurement category. sustainable Less than 5  Following up on donations to our partner associations through the turtle project.

As a consequence, we monitor the location of the suppliers with which we work. 64 65 The Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc has prepared a book entitled “The Craftsmen of Paradise” with interviews of its faithful employees and exceptional partners. Here are some excerpts about local suppliers: Vineyards of the Abbey of Lérins If there is one remarkable wine on the wine list of the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc it is the wine produced by the monks of the Abbey of Lérins. This small island situated at less than one kilometre from the tip of the Croisette in Cannes offers a breathtaking view from Monaco to Saint Tropez. We can understand why a fortified monastery was built there to protect the monks from the Saracens in 1050. An anecdote: in the guestbook of the Abbey, there is an evocation written by Paul Claudel dated 10 April 1936. He wrote, “Lérins is like a short prayer, in the middle of the eternity that surrounds it on every side”. 66 What you like the most about your work: our ethical concept of the work and product to be prepared has guided and boosted our commitment to quality and fair trade. The satisfaction of a job well done in all its aspects ensures that we obtain a top-quality product with the consumer in mind. The most difficult: the question we ask ourselves is this one: how do we introduce our monastic production in the market economy? The latter is at first sight not at all compatible with the values that underpin the lives we devote to God. How should we react to the competition which is very often aggressive from consumer society and the exploitation of a monk’s image in a shocking manner by advertising? At the Abbey of Lérins, we have chosen to answer these questions by respect and openness to what we are, and to the value of our products. Work clothes: alb and blue apron The most magical moment or feeling that a customer has enabled you to experience: undoubtedly the simple pleasure of an anonymous buyer. […] Your motto: Peace and joy1 1 “The Craftsmen of Paradise”, Preface by Philippe Perd, Texts by François Simon, Photographs by Jean-Michel Sordello, March 2009, Assouline Publishers, P. 112 67 Aimé Pellegrin’s vegetables For the past fifteen years, this market gardener from Grasse has got up at dawn to deliver the vegetables covered in morning dew to the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc. He lovingly watches over them from the corner of his eye, takes care of their appearance, helps them to develop and picks them at the right time. An anecdote: (it is also my pride…) I was discovered in another restaurant. When the Chef of the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc tasted my asparaguses by chance, he immediately contacted us to deliver some to him … What you like the most about your work: watching the vegetables grow. The most difficult: undoubtedly knowing how to handle the produce and manage parasitic insects without disturbing the healthy life of the vegetables. The indispensable tool: there isn’t only one! You need a great deal of equipment and a lot of hard work to grow our vegetables. Working clothes: shorts, t-shirt and bare feet in the summer! 68 The most magical moment or feeling that a customer has enabled you to experience: without a doubt knowing that American cinema stars eat my asparaguses! A gift you would like to offer: a basket of vegetables that have just been picked for my friends. Your motto: Work as hard as possible to have good produce2» At the end of the 2015 season, we organised a cocktail party inviting our closest partners to celebrate our collaboration together. Our Head Chef invited his trusted local suppliers, our partner associations were also represented Croix Rouge France Cancer, Pacôme… along with our environmental project partners. The evening was so successful that we have decided to organise the same event next season. Objective 2016: To increase the percentage of local suppliers to 50% in terms of purchase volume. 2 “The Craftsmen of Paradise”, Preface by Philippe Perd, Texts by François Simon, Photographs by Jean-Michel Sordello, March 2009, Assouline Publishers, P. 130 69 II.4.d. Commit alongside our partners in sustainable projects that are linked to the values we defend At the end of each year, the Management of the Hotel du Cap makes a financial donation to several local associations such as: the Red Cross, the League against Cancer, the Williams Music association, the Retirement Home of Antibes, the Corporation of Sailors of Antibes, the Union of Fishermen of Antibes … 70 In December 2015, our Pastry Chef prepared Yule logs and chocolate bards for the Red Cross Christmas Day at the Retirement Home of the Coteaux d’Antibes. The goal of this event was the mixture of generations with children from the Red Cross and elderly people who lived in the retirement home. The Head Chef and the sustainable development coordinator contributed to the event by providing the logs and chocolate bars and by serving them. Since 2013, we have entered into a partnership with the association Planète Urgence, which is a Recognised Public Interest association. Its goal is to support and foster self-sufficiency among the populations, and protect the environment by sharing knowledge, training or technical support in favour of project leaders around the world. In August 2015, our CSR Manager travelled to Zimbabwe to take part in a biodiversity project. On 29 September 2015, the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc took part in the Cote d’Azur Inter-Hotel Raid with the association Team Nature. Attached to the human nature of this initiative, the organisers also give priority to ecological aspects. Car pooling, recycled products and raising the awareness of the participants on environmental protection marked the mindset of this day. In addition, to an annual contribution made by Team Nature to the GoodPlanet Foundation which was founded and chaired by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, a reforestation action with the National Forestry Office, which was also a partner of this Raid, is planned as follows: one team registered = one tree planted. 71 We also donate our used textiles to the associaton Pacôme: 72 Within the framework of a solidarity leave, the Human Resources Manager of the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, Château SaintMartin & Spa and L’Apogée Courchevel made a most amazing encounter. Valérie Monnier went on solidarity leave in partnership with the French association, Planète Urgences, to Togo in 2014 where she met Eli Apodo, Director of the Young Humanitarian Aid Missionaries association. The goal of this association is to help persons suffering from HIV to have access to complete health check-ups. During her mission, Valérie witnessed the importance of the health role played by the JMAH within her community. She was also able to see that due to a lack of means, the beneficial action of the association was limited. As a consequence, when she returned to France and as a representative of the JMAH association in France, she suggested that the Hotel du CapEden-Roc should create a partnership in collaboration with Eli Apodo, the Director of the association. A donation of €5,000 was thus granted to the JMAH association to set up a community-based pharmacy for AIDS victims. The link with our hotel was established because the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc hosts the prestigious AmFar (American Foundation for AIDS Research) event each year. This is one of the most important American foundations in the world in financing prevention and medical research against AIDS. Founded in 1985 by the actress Elizabeth Taylor and having the researchers Mathilde Krim and Michael Gottlieb as its founding presidents, it supports and finances more than 2,000 research teams worldwide with more than 360 million dollars of aid over the past 25 years. Consequently, working for such a project is linked to the values we defend. 73 This contribution was renewed in 2015 allowing this very dynamic association to pursue new actions: Two large posters have been positioned at strategic points in Lomé. The objective is to contribute to reducing the transmission of HIV/STIs and unwanted teenage pregnancies through an awareness-raising poster campaign. In addition, awareness-raising campaigns have been organised to remind the public of these issues and how they can be prevented. World Aids Day, on 1 December, when the struggle against this disease is recognised on an international level, was commemorated this year in Togo. As part of this drive, JMAH has initiated an HIV AIDS testing campaign using a mobile strategy to test drug users and dealers at fixed and mobile locations mobilisation at CMS Kodjioviakope and Lomé polyclinic health centre. This campaign began from Monday 30 November to Friday 4 December 2015 on 4 sites. Awareness-raising sessions have also been organised in schools. Following the results of the latest MICS survey in 2010, confirming a teenage pregnancy rate of 17.3% in Togo, JMAH, whose vocation is to help all young people to realise their potential, decided to contribute its expertise to a 3-day awareness-raising campaign in rural and peri-urban locations, offering family planning and STI management services in secondary schools. 4 school complexes were chosen to benefit from this project. 74 COMMITMENT4 Take part in the social, cultural and economic development of the regions in which we operate ACTION CONDUCTED ACTION CONDUCTED Favour local suppliers and Renew our partnerships products The hotel continues to get involved in Favouring local producers and their various projects which are linked to its products means favouring the local region and concern the protection of economy and creating a social the biodiversity, and social and cultural network, as well as enhancing our aspects. region. 75 COMMITMENT4 Take part in the social, cultural and economic development of the regions in which we operate 97% €5,000 2016 Improvement objectives  Reduce the percentage of our international partners Of French suppliers 61% Paid each year to the JMAH association in Togo  Undertake a genuine sports, of which are local suppliers cultural and humanitarian sponsorship  Highlight our local partners on 1320 kilos our guests’ television channel Of fabric recovered and donated to humanitarian associations 76 77
