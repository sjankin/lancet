These changes had a direct impact on the results, as follows:  For all 4 Measurement KPIs, sites had to respond “yes” to one mandatory question vs. one out of 4 last year.  Two questions ( Use of concentrated chemicals and the Use of dispensing equipment for chemicals) have been transferred from Heightened Awareness and Behavior in Water to Equipment and Processes part in Non Organic Waste part; which resulted in a decrease in the first indicator and an increase in the second one. 14 – An explanation of the INDICATORS – Site Survey Actions to improve employee and consumer awareness Awareness and and the use of existing equipment. These actions are generally within Sodexo’s control and raising the Behavior awareness of our employees can have a big impact. + Actions that are included in this section will generally require some prior agreement with the client. They may Equipment and require some small adjustments to existing equipment or Processes processes, an energy audit, or some more significant investment in new equipment. + Measure the impact of our activity on the environment. Measurement = Program Our commitments to reduce our impact require a combination of all three steps. 15 – Fiscal 2015 Site Survey – Global Coverage Participating Countries Non participating countries 53 countries representing 97% of Fiscal 2015 On Site Services revenues 16 Annual Site Survey – Group Key Figures 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 49% 67% 55% 68% 70% 84% Participation rate Participating 10830 8462 11058 10611 9656 10246 sites Listed sites 22175 15207 16193 15264 14329 12190 Participating countries 52 48 56 43 52 53 Languages 11 18 22 24 24 24 17 Participation rate per Group Global Segments Segment for FY15 Listed Segments sites Corporate Services 5782 Health Care & Seniors 3166 Schools 1415 74% 97% Universities 795 Energy & Resources 486 Government & Agencies 430 79% Sports & Leisure 116 96% 86% 89% 86% 18 – Participation Fiscal 2015: Participation rate rate per Group Global per Group Segments Global Region Listed sites Cesam (including Brazil) 100% 854 DACH 99% 372 97% 1111 UK&Ireland 96% 445 Nordics 95% 796 APAC MED 94% 1050 C&E Europe 93% 489 Noram 89% 3708 Group 84% 12190 Africa-Mena-CAS 81% 64 Benelux 76% 1157 France 51% 2144 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 19 – Central & South Americas (with Brazil) – Country Survey  Coverage rate Key Figures Our Business Units across Central & South Americas Sodexo On-Site Services BRAZIL BRAZIL Services in 1 Participated Country Did not participate 20 – Evolution of the Participation Rate: Brazil 2000 100% 100% 1800 1600 75% 1400 61% 1200 52% 50% 1000 50% 42% 800 1794 600 730 367 25% 548 335 400 581 303 640 1527 168 168 200 3% 45 0 0% 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Listed Sites Participating Sites Participation Rate 21 Fiscal Participation 2015:Participation rate per Group Rate Global Segments per segment – Brazil 70 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 63 56 75% 49 43 43 42 35 35 35 50% 28 21 25% 14 61 61 7 7 8 8 7 5 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 0 0% Educaçaõ Saude Corporate II On Shore Corporate I Corporate III Corporate IV Off Shore Corporate V FM Listed Sites Participating Sites Participation Rate 22 – FISCAL 2015 Indicator Analysis BRAZIL presentation 23 – FISCAL 2015 Better Tomorrow Plan Management 24 – Better Tomorrow Plan Management  % of Group revenues of countries having one or more Key Figures ISO 9001 certification Our Business Units across Central & South Americas Fiscal 2015 Group 93.0% Fiscal 2015 Cesam Incl.
