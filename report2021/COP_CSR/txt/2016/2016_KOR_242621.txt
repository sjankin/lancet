This situation leads to a dumping in handling charges and deterioration of business conditions. Our competitors are focusing on expanding port infrastructures, building port facilities, and improving services to meet vessel enlargement. Meanwhile, global leading shipping companies have been organizing carrier alliances to reduce costs. Currently, four global leading alliances of 2M, O3, G6, and CKYHE in which 16 out of 20 world’s largest shipping companies are attending are leading the industry. These alliances account for around 80% of capacity and exert a significant impact on the international port industry. In addition, many global shipping companies have introduced mega-sized vessels to improve efficiency. While the largest-sized vessel was 4,000 TEU in the mid-1900s, 20,000 TEU vessels, which are five times bigger than previous models, are currently being ordered. According to analysis regarding the trend in super-sized containerships, it is expected that the number of vessels exceeding 10,000 TEU will increase to 355 by 2016, which will represent 22% of the total capacity in the market.

Interview As a corporation managing and operating Busan Port, BPA supports sustainable growth of Busan Port. It is expanding its business scope by operating cruises and the Ship Chandling Center and rebuilding the old port through North Port redevelopment project. As it is expected that about 70% of cargoes is handled at Busan New Port, we will create added value by reforming and redeveloping the functions of North Port to address the growth imbalance between Busan New Port and North Port. BPA also seeks measures to realize mutual growth with local communities in operating cruises and the Ship Chandling Center and will continuously introduce eco-friendly energy sources such as LNG to the operation of infrastructure.

BPA has also a joint logistics system for tenant companies at the center to foster the ship articles business. Busan accounts for 70% of the entire domestic ship articles industry. To globalize Korea’s ship articles industry, BPA has made great efforts such as joining the International Ship Suppliers and Services Association, holding ship supply-related international seminars, and developing the unique brand of ship supplies at Busan Port. Creating a Ship Repair Complex BPA is creating a ship repair complex where ship repair can be carried out for entering and departing vessels beyond just the function of Busan New Port focusing on container handling. Busan New Port, located at the main trunk route in Northeast Asia, is experiencing increasing needs for ship repair services backed by the enlargement of vessels and increasing calls. As of 2010, the size of the global ship repair market reached around USD 20 billion and sales of global ship repair yards has also been increasing. Upon the completion of a large ship repair complex to treat over 30,000 tons of vessels, it is expected to contribute greatly to generating high added value for Busan Port.

To realize this strategy, BPA is making concerted efforts to secure cargo handling, and prevention of marine pollution by vessels. As requests for the eco-friendly energy sources, reduce GHG emissions, and create water-friendly environmental responsibility of port operators and global shipping companies are and resource-recycling ports. By being the first to adopt the ESI in Asia, BPA is on the rise, global leading ports are accelerating the replacement of energy sources encouraging autonomous environmental pollution reduction activities in operating with alternative and eco-friendly energy to secure competitiveness. It is the time for vessels. Busan Port to take proactive measures such as shifting to eco-friendly energy and reducing GHG emissions to become an eco-friendly port. Interview It is critical for each port to establish the green port policy tailored for their conditions and characteristics. As for Busan Port, the implementation of an independent green port policy may have a negative impact on raising competitiveness because it needs to compete with neighboring ports in Japan and China as a port centered on transshipment. Since environmental elements are recognized as expenses and regulations, reasonable incentives are necessary to encourage companies to voluntarily participate in the green port policy, as well as carry out technical development. Timing is also another important issue. The E-RTGC project at Busan Port is a great example of this. When operators had difficulties due to an increase in oil prices, BPA took the lead in replacing energy source of RTGC with electricity by rapidly developing technologies, conducting pilot projects, asking for support from the government. As a result, 92 RTGCs are using electricity as the main energy source, reducing KRW 10 billion worth energy cost and 27,000 tons of CO2. It also unleashed the expansion of e-RTGC system internally and externally. BPA’s Green Port strategy will be accelerated when relevant policies and regulations are established at the right time.

Water pollution is mainly caused by ballast water from vessels, as well as oil leaks by maritime accidents. Air pollution happens due to sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds in exhaust gas from vessels. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has regulated pollutants from vessels to preserve and manage the deteriorating marine environment. The ministry has reinforced the necessary regulations and improved unreasonable regulations with the “Marine Environment Management Act” as part of the implementation of the international convention to prevent marine pollution. For handling air pollution, ozone layerdepleting substances, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur oxides are included as management targets. Water pollution is managed by preventing oil discharge from vessels and waste management.

Interview Most human error-accidents at Busan Port are caused by equipment. As these accidents are often a result of not complying with safety regulations, it was necessary to make a standardized manual to integrate different safety regulations of each operator. In 2014, BPA reformed the safety standard manual for Busan Port and carried out standardization for safety standards related to terminal work. This is significant in that the corporation secured the safety of employees working at the terminal and presented a standardized criteria for the safety management of port facilities. I hope that BPA lays the foundation for more systematic safety management by controlling data and operating a safety-related organization and advisory group, reinforces support for safety management by receiving advice from experts and conducting education on benchmarking cases, and vitalizes communication channels to collect opinions on safety.
