Correction During a partial supervisory review the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) has found that the consolidated financial statements for 2014 for Tryg A/S were insufficient as these statements do not provide sufficient information on goodwill and the impairment test made for this purpose. It has no effect on profit for the year, total assets, liabilities or shareholders' equity in the 2014 Annual Report nor in the 2015 interim and annual reports. The lack of information required in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets, covers all primary assumptions to which the calculation of the future cash flow is most sensitive, the method used to set these assumptions and information on the growth rate used in the terminal period. On the basis of the DFSA's partial supervisory review, Tryg has chosen to include the required information for 2015 and 2014 in the note on intangible asset, including goodwill, in the 2015 Annual Report. Trademarks and customer relations As at 31 December 2015, management performed a test of the carrying amounts of trademarks and customer relations as an integral part of the Moderna goodwill test. The impairment test of the acquired agricultural portfolio is based on renewal and retention rates, which are on the expected level. The test did not indicate any impairment. | Contents – Financial statements Annual report 2015 | Tryg A/S | 70 Notes 12 Property, plant and equipment External experts were involved in valuing the Owner-occupied Assets under owner-occupied properties.

The purchase price is final. In connection with the acquisitions, a sum was paid which exceeds the fair value of the identifiable acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. This positive balance is mainly attributable to expected synergies between the activities in the acquired enterprises and the Group’s existing activities, future growth opportunities as well as the staff of the acquired enterprises. These synergies have not been recognised separately from goodwill as they are not separately identifiable. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The enterprises are included in premium income and in the results for the year with an insignificant amount due to the short ownership period and the Management believes that these pro forma figures reflect the Group’s earnings level after the acquisition of the enterprises and that the amounts may therefore form the basis for comparisons in subsequent financial years. | Contents – Financial statements Annual report 2015 | Tryg A/S | 83 Notes DKKm DKKm 28 Related parties (continued) 28 Related parties (continued) Specification of remuneration The members of the Supervisory Board in Tryg A/S are paid with a fixed remuneration and are not Number of Basis Variable covered by the incentive schemes. 2015 persons salary salary Pension Total a) Supervisory Board 13 6 0 0 6 The Executive Management is paid a fixed remuneration and pension.
