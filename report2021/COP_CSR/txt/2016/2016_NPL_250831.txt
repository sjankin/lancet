Global Compact Asia Lotus Holdings Pvt. Ltd Nepal Company Phone: Exemplary practice from Nepal 977-1-5000071 977-1-5000273 e-mail: info@lotusholdings.com URL: www.lotusholdings.com From the CEO’s Desk Fifteen months after the disastrous earthquake that hit Nepal, reconstruction is yet to be completed. The government relief effort to spend the USD 4.5 Billion that has come in as special aid to help the aftermath of the catastrophe has still not started. We are doing what we can, and we have urged everyone to do what one can. Lotus Holdings donated, raised capital, and resources to mainly reconstruct damaged schools that we are responsible for. We are happy to say that all of the 2000+ children that we support are back to school in full swing. As an effort to boost income of the local, Lotus Holdings has also started initiatives to set up a “carpet village” in Sindupalchowk, Nepal – a location most affected by the quake north-east of Kathmandu. The idea of this program is to setup a center to produce and sell raw materials to the carpet companies owned and run by Lotus Holdings. We realize that efforts like these are rather miniscule when looked at in an individual level, but if the business community can collaborate the run programs like this that is complementing their core business – I believe we can collectively solve or mitigate many problems our society at large faces.

At inception, LH’s aim was to provide incubation and support to its sister companies to promote responsible and ethical business practices.

Challenges The instability of the government and the failure to draft the new constitution after the end of the monarchy has been causing a general slowdown in Nepal’s economy. The challenge is increased by the ever growing double digit inflation and the global economic crisis that has significantly decreased export sales throughout the country. With such problems, increase in CSR activities have been limited, but Lotus Holdings has not decreased its ongoing CSR activities to cut costs. The recent earthquake in Nepal has brought about fresh challenges in the country. LH with it’s associate companies carried over various relief mission in various parts of the country and now through its philantrophic wing has pledge support in building schools that got damaged in the quake. Impacts and Benefits Due to the initiatives undertaken by the organization, it is now a more responsible organization geared towards not only raising its productivity but also contributing to the society through local Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Staff morale has heightened and the company’s productivity has increased. The image of the company, a leader in adopting CSR in the country, has improved noticeably. Future Plan The organization will continue to raise awareness, enhance skills and knowledge of its employees. Our previous strategy to establish an investment fund has been realized. Lotus Holdings is now even aggressively looking for opportunities to explore into new sectors to invest. Pursuing a dream of a self-reliant, socially and economically developed society, Lotus Holdings believes in business with ethics. This has been the driving force behind the company and as it continues to grow into this millennium, it will remain in the business of helping people achieve these dreams.
