Since the announcement of our previous mid-range management plan, global demand for Corp construction and mining equipment has entered an adjustment phase centering on emerging countries, resulting in a drastic change Comp from our business environment of three years ago. Nevertheless, we have made no change in our assumption that we can expect that our market will grow in the long range. We are continuing the same basic strategies of ÒGrowth strategies based on innovation,Ó Koma ÒGrowth strategies of existing businesses,Ó and ÒStructural reforms designed to reinforce the business foundation,Ó while reviewing Code specific initiatives, redefining them as needed, and implementing them. Risk We also recognize the importance of reinforcing ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) efforts in order for us to ensure our longCSR term growth and of the indispensable need for us to aggressively promote those efforts. While we have conventionally emphasized ESG efforts, we are going to intensify those efforts as one of the targets of the new mid-range management plan. In the following, I would like to introduce some social issues which we reviewed while developing the mid-range management plan, and how we are going To vi need to d to respond to them. Adobe Ac Responding to the labor shortage of the construction industry and improving the safety and productivity of jobsite operations Japan's construction industry is facing a serious problem of a declining labor force today. At the same time, we see growing needs to improve the safety and productivity of construction and mining jobsite operations. To strengthen our ability to propose solutions to these tasks of customers, we are working to accelerate the development of our DANTOTSU (unique and unrivaled) products, services and solutions, as we also utilize open innovation, in order to fuel our growth based on innovation. As an example, we are deploying ÒSMARTCONSTRUCTIONÓ designed to achieve the Òfuture of construction jobsitesÓ. SMARTCONSTRUCTION automates surveying which is conventionally handled by surveyors and requires a considerable amount of time. Our intelligent Machine Control construction equipment enables operators with a small amount of experience to carry out work at high-precision levels. In addition to improving safety resulting from automation and labor saving, SMARTCONSTRUCTION enables customers to reduce costs, resulting from a shorter KOMATSU 3 construction REPORT CSR as period, well as2016 CO2 emissions. We will continue to advance the ÒvisualizationÓ of construction jobsite operations in order to provide total support for customers, as we foster this business as one of our need to d to respond to them.

We will continue to advance the ÒvisualizationÓ of construction jobsite operations in order to provide total support for customers, as we foster this business as one of our core businesses. Reducing CO2 emissions from our products in use by customers as well as in production While our products build social infrastructure, improving the lives of people, they also generate an environmental impact throughout their lifecycle, ranging from manufacturing and use to disassembly for recycling or disposal. We regard our DANTOTSU products and services, designed to help customers improve their environmental performance, as strategies of differentiation. We are also cutting down consumption of electricity at our production plants, dynamically improving productivity and leading to the reinforcement of our competitiveness. In terms of CO2 emissions throughout the life cycle of construction equipment, about 90% is emitted during use by customers. Accordingly, it is very clear and evident that we must focus our efforts on this stage. In addition to providing products with a high environmental performance, such as hybrid models, we are taking an approach to the customers' ways of using our machines by proposing fuel economy operations based on analyses of KOMTRAX (Komatsu Machine Tracking System) data. As a result, we are working to reduce CO2 emissions per work load by 25%*1 as the long-range target. With respect to the reduction of CO2 emissions in manufacturing, we have conventionally set up long-range targets. We are working for a reduction of 57%*2 in Japan and 32%*3 overseas by continuing the power consumption reduction program and making other efforts. Notes: *1: New equipment to be sold in 2025 as compared to new equipment sold in 2007. *2: The target figure in 2020 from 2000. *3: The target figure in 2020 from 2010. Promoting responses to diversity and a global management drive In terms of corporate governance, I am convinced that Komatsu needs to become a company where a diverse range of employees can demonstrate their talents to the fullest extent, while fair and high-transparency management is a must, of course. Concerning diversity, it is important to create workplaces where female employees can demonstrate their talents to the fullest extent, and we have set the target of increasing the ratio of female managers to 7% by April 2018, and 10% by April 2021. Furthermore, we introduced the Global Officer system in April, 2016. We have promoted the policy of assigning the posts of Presidents of overseas subsidiaries to local employees who have worked for Komatsu over the years and who have a thorough understanding of the respective local markets and business practices. As a result, many overseas subsidiaries are managed by them today. In the Global Officer system, presidents of major overseas subsidiaries have been assigned as Global Officers, and fourteen of them have been assigned as Executive Officers of Komatsu Ltd. so that they can participate in important management meetings of Komatsu Ltd. I believe their involvement in management of the Komatsu Group is very important to drive our globally consolidated management into the future. Komatsu maintains the basic management policy of commitment to Quality and Reliability to maximize its corporate value. Komatsu believes that its corporate value is the total sum of trust given to it by society and all its stakeholders. Under this policy, as we are looking into March 2019, the target year of the mid-range management plan, 2021, our 100th anniversary year, and beyond, we would like to make an innovative contribution to solving customers' problems as well as social problems through our business activities by becoming more acutely4aware ofKOMATSU CSR REPORT the importance of ESG2016 than before. and we have set the target of increasing the ratio of female managers to 7% by April 2018, and 10% by April 2021.

We are also going to fulfill our corporate responsibilities as a global company, as we aggressively get involved in the United Nations' Global Compact and other initiatives, such as WBCSD.

On-site Operational Safety Appr Providing a very safe product is a manufacturer's most basic responsibility. On top of meeting all of the latest international standards Our A and regulations, we deliver products with exceptional safety features that are unsurpassed by other competitors to our customers. Enha At the same time, our goal is to improve safety through innovation to such a level that we can help our customers realize on-site -Provi operations as they should be. Societ Deve Grow Socia Activ Ge Corp Comp Koma Code Risk CSR Komatsu introduced the ICT Bulldozer (2013) and ICT Hydraulic Excavator (2014) to the market that made possible automatic control of blades and buckets. No matter the level of experience of the operator, ICT construction equipment makes possible the high precision To vi need to d construction work of a skilled worker. As a result, supplementary workers needed in the past are no longer necessary and the guide Adobe Ac process which is done by people becomes unnecessary, saving labor on the work site and improving safety. The ultimate safety feature to be realized is the Automatic Operational System. At some major mines in Australia and Chile, the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) is in full-scale operation. This is the system where giant dump trucks automatically drive themselves, carrying over 300 tons of soil and minerals. Customers must pay most careful attention when they have several construction machinery and vehicles operating 24 hours in the harsh environment of mines. AHS is there to help with this process. The combination of the cutting edge technologies such as satellite communication and various radars and sensors creates a system that responds to the customer's diverse safety needs, and by continuing to work on further evolution of such safety systems, we are contributing to the realization of making our customers' on-site operational safety as it should be.

Contact and collision within blind spots is prevented by having a bird's eye view of the vehicle to check the surrounding area. ICT-Intensive Construction: Construction using the ICT Bulldozer When working on sloped surfaces (like dikes and rice fields that have hardened at an angle), operators do not have to operate the working function of the machine, and instead can concentrate on moving the position of the vehicle. Foreseeing slips that occur due to carrying too much soil, the machine works with the optimal volume of soil for efficient construction, to help minimize the burden on the operator. Supplementary workers that give instructions from near the construction equipment become unnecessary and the risk of accidents is reduced. Automatic Operation System: the Autonomous Haulage System (AHS) Fully automated transportation is realized by operating and managing dump trucks with various ICT functions installed from a centralized control room. The dump truck uses GPS to communicate its position and drives itself according to the course and speed information transmitted from the control room.

To vi need to d Adobe Ac Personnel System that Accurately Reflects Employee Abilities and Achievements Personnel systems in Japan are typically based on the assumption that employees will work for a single company for many years. Therefore, when designing a system, a company must keep in mind the degree to which continuous employment should be considered. Komatsu believes that personnel systems emphasizing length of service do not necessarily reflect employees' abilities and achievements fairly. Instead, Komatsu has always strived to accurately evaluate the performance of employees as individuals, incorporating employees' achievements and abilities into its personnel system as the basis for fair evaluations.

An evaluation committee has been established jointly with the labor union at each business unit to confirm that evaluations are conducted properly. Komatsu has provided individual feedback on evaluations to managers since 1998 and to non-managerial employees since 2001. The company has also set up a consultation office through which employees can express complaints and concerns.

But products like construction equipment are used in specific types of work sites, and in general many of the Adobe Ac customers and operators are men. This makes it more difficult to bring out the concept of gender diversity in such a way.

The thing that I most want is for Komatsu!s employees to think, ÒI am glad to be working for KomatsuÓ, not just from a financial standpoint but also from the aspect of general well-being. In order to achieve this, we have worked on various measures to support the work-life balance of employees and for fair employment. We want to be a company that can respond in a flexible way by not getting caught up in stereotypes but by taking into consideration social change and individual circumstances.

In order to pick up on the needs the needs that the customers that the customers themselves themselves haven!thaven!t yet realized and connect it to the next business idea, it is necessary to think differently think differently than before.

Ñ In order to increase the number of women in management, isn!t it necessary to have more initiatives than there have been so far? Urano: As mentioned before, once the ratio of women increases after addressing the issues in each job category, it will be necessary to make it possible for women to continue in their career even through life events such as marriage and child bearing. In order to do that, particularly in the present transitional period, we are holding training sessions for women who are one or two steps away from management level positions, to help them think about their career plan. Being given work with some responsibility often leads people to experience a lot of personal growth and find joy in their work. We are hoping that if women employees have such experiences before going through life events, it will motivate them to continue pursuing their careers. Aside from this, Komatsu has continued with other initiatives for diversity, such as actively promoting the ÒBusiness Creation CenterÓ (BCC) where persons with disabilities are employed as permanent staff to work at manufacturing sites and in the offices, as well as promoting the re-hiring of retired people to have them make good use of their cumulative experience. In society there are people who have various characteristics and conditions that cannot be lumped together. We are conscious that creating a work environment where the LGBT population can work comfortably is also an issue that must not be forgotten. We will continue to work on diversity as a way of being both a Ògood companyÓ and a Òstrong companyÓ. Promoting Women!s Careers Approach and Goals Komatsu is actively promoting various measures such as proactive employment and development of women as well as creating an environment where women can maintain a career after child bearing. With the 3 year mid-range management plan ÒTogether We Innovate GEMBA Worldwide: Growth Toward Our 100th Anniversary (2021) and BeyondÓ which started in April this year, we have set and begun working towards the goal of having a ratio of women in management of 7% by April 2018 and 10% by April 2021. Systems and Status in FY2015 From FY2015, as measures for the development of women employees, the CDP (Career Development Program) was fully implemented. This provides career plan training which includes thinking about future careers and ways of working, as well as discussing mid-term career goals with their supervisors. We are also working on creating an environment that makes it easier for women to work, such as introducing and establishing the system for working from home in FY2014 as a flexible way to work, and providing a childcare service at the KOMATSU Way Global Institute located in Komatsu City, Ishikawa Prefecture, so that employees who have children can participate. Also, in order to have female students searching for jobs to get well acquainted with Komatsu, we are being proactive in hiring activities for women such as discussion meetings for each job category, holding career and networking events in cooperation with outside groups and schools for women engineers. In terms of external recognition, Komatsu was selected again this year for the second time in a row as a Nadeshiko Brand company by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a listed company that excels in promoting career development for women.

Additionally, Komatsu is strengthening its Group-wide system for contacting employees during an emergency by introducing safety confirmation systems, broad-area wireless devices, and conducting regular training for safety reporting and communication. Conducting Compliance and Risk Audits As a part of its risk management activities, Komatsu has been conducting compliance and risk audits (CR audits) since FY2008. These cover areas not included in the J-SOX audits, which are conducted in accordance with the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan to evaluate internal controls related to financial reporting and identify potential compliance risks within the company, with a particular focus on confirming and evaluating the status of legal compliance. Our internal specialist team conducts the internal audits at Komatsu and its Japanese and overseas affiliates, as well as at sites operated by independently-owned distributors. The audited items are: 1. Safety; 2. Environment; 3. Labor; 4. Finance and Treasury; 5. Quality Assurance and Recall; 6. Vehicle Inspections and Specific Voluntary Inspections (inspections done on construction equipment, similar to vehicle inspections); 7. Export Control; 8. Information Security; and 9.

Strengthening Information Security Komatsu is developing an information security structure for the entire Group, placing the Information Security Committee at its center. As one sphere of this structure, the company distributes an Information Security Guidebook to all employees. In conjunction with this, it provides education and awareness-raising activities based on the Guidebook, with the belief that raising individual employee consciousness of information security is essential. The company is developing a structure to protect information from being falsified, leaked or lost, even in cases of negligence or outside intrusion. In addition, it is conducting information security audits to ensure that these measures are working effectively and to detect and address any problems. Human Right Management Issues Komatsu signed the United Nations Global Compact in 2008. In an effort to apply its major principles for protecting human rights, Komatsu with the help of external experts conducted a human rights risk assessment for all of its construction/mining equipment and forestry machinery businesses worldwide in 2014, referring to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The results showed that the degree of urgency for problems occurring is low, while the degree of effect if a problem does occur is moderate. They also pointed to the need for Komatsu to move beyond its current assessment efforts toward evaluating the activities of partner companies, such as parts suppliers and our network of distributors that provide products and services to our customers. In light of the results, we intend to continue implementing the necessary measures.

The case examples of improvement are shared within the companies of the group which is set up for lateral dissemination of information. In North America, Europe and China, there are Midori-kai organizations made up of Komatsu's major business partners. These chapters are making the most of the characteristics of their respective region in furthering their activities.

As a new initiative in FY2015, we held a CSR study group for young management. The study group for business partners held in February 2016. Using Komatsu!s CSR activities as an example, each company worked on the CSR Materiality identifying process for their own company. Management System Checking System for New Business Transactions and Agreements Komatsu uses a check sheet before it starts doing business with a new supplier, not only to confirm basic conditions related to quality, cost and delivery, but also to verify their efforts in environmental protection and employee education. To conduct a business transaction in accordance with the CSR Procurement Policy, our basic agreement includes clauses pertaining to environmental protection and compliance. Risk Management Prepared for Occurrence of Natural Disasters Komatsu is strengthening its risk management system for procurement. Since FY2012, we have conducted assessments in Japan so that we can quickly determine the status of partner companies in the event of a disaster such as an earthquake or tsunami, and be able to continue procurement activities without delay, to minimize the effect on production. We input the location and production content for each of the over 20,000 sites of all our partner companies to create a database for Òvisualization,Ó and assessed the degree of risk. In addition to considering prevention measures for each partner company that have higher levels of risk, the procurement staff will be able to consider risks from this aspect when considering new agreements, so that we can heighten the accuracy of the information. In the event of an emergency, we will dispatch security maintenance personnel from our plant to our partner companiesÑas we did following the Great East Japan EarthquakeÑto help support speedy production recovery. Policy and Actions Regarding Conflict 73 Minerals KOMATSU CSR REPORT 2016 Komatsu has adopted a policy of not using conflict minerals produced by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or its neighbors CSR Theme 3 Growing with Society In the event of an emergency, we will dispatch security maintenance personnel from our plant to our partner companiesÑas we did following the Great East Japan EarthquakeÑto help support speedy production recovery. Policy and Actions Regarding Conflict Minerals Komatsu has adopted a policy of not using conflict minerals produced by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) or its neighbors (Angola, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Southern Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia) from our corporate social responsibility perspective. During the regular meetings we hold with our suppliers at each Komatsu plant in Japan, we explained this policy as well as Komatsu's response to the conflict minerals issue and related requests to our suppliers. With the cooperation of suppliers, we conducted a countryof-origin survey to determine the location of origin of the conflict minerals we use. Looking ahead, we will continue taking steps to prevent the use of conflict minerals from the DRC and its neighbors and thereby restrict funding for military groups. We will immediately discontinue any use of conflict materials that we discover. Other Initiatives Awareness Campaign for CSR Procurement As an ongoing effort to raise awareness of CSR, Komatsu has been introducing CSR case studies since May 2011 through its bimonthly CSR newsletter on its website, which is available for all suppliers for the Komatsu Group in Japan. Procurement Education in Human Resource Development Komatsu conducts employee training at every level, from new employees to managers, in the forms of group learning and e-learning, with a strong emphasis on safety, the environment and compliance.
