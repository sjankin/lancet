CSR approach. 7 THE UN GLOBAL COMPACT Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects joined the UN Global Compact initiative in 2008. Global Compact is the world‘s largest voluntary CSR initiative and initiates and supports corporate operational and strategic focus on social responsibility. This important initiative was started in 2000 under the leadership of then Secretary General Kofi Annan. The overall goal is to actively commit companies to work to improve the major social, economic and environmental challenges that follow globalization. Global Compact has today grown to be an extensive international network of more than 12,000 signatories from over 170 countries. Global Compact‘s ten fundamental principles constitute the core of the stated objectives and cover four key focus areas: human rights, labour rights, environment, and anti-corruption.

We work in compliance with Danish legislation which meets international conventions on human rights. Malmö Live/Malmö/ Denmark 11 New charter supports CSR in the construction sector Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects joined the Danish Association for Responsible Construction in 2014. The objective of the association is to develop and promote social responsibility in the Danish property and construction sector based on a charter of six principles. 1. We systematically assess whether we are observing the principles of the Charter in the projects in which we are involved 2. We assess how collaboration partners and suppliers manage social responsibility 3. We establish dialogue with collaboration partners and stakeholders 4. We work for sustainable solutions 5. We have sound employment and working conditions 6. We demonstrate independence and anti-corruption practices By signing the charter Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects declares our support to the six principles. We believe that cross-disciplinary collaboration will only contribute to strengthen social responsibility within the building sector and will support and inspire good practice. Malmö Live/Malmö/ Denmark End Poverty 2016 Campaign/ Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects annually participates as business partner in the Danish NGO campaign The World’s Best News which is part of the Danish contribution to of the UN initiative End Poverty 2016 Campaign (supporting The UN Sustainable Development Goals). The official campaign day is marked at all SHL offices. As business partner we contribute by spreading the positive news both inside and outside the organization telling that the effort and support is making profound changes in the developing countries. Danida and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark financially support the Danish campaign, and the event is a unique collaboration between the UN, DANIDA, more than 100 Danish NGOs and 100 private sector companies.

National rules and regulations in force on the non-Danish office tions of any staff members through collective agreements and state imposed regulations sites are followed with rigor. 15 A democratic work place/ The well-being of staff members is highly valued by the organisation. Hence, dedicated committees are in place and the strategic management participates actively and cooperatively. The Health & Safety Committee take precautionary measures against any form of counterproductive physical and non-physical working conditions, including the prevention of any labour related accident. The Collaboration Committee ensures a positive working environment and engage in dialogue with union representative about organisational development and adjustment to foster employee commitment and retention. The Continuing Education Committee organises and administers the organisation’s strategic engagements in relation to staff member training and professional development. DOKK1/ Aarhus/ Denmark 16 Work environment/ individual development/ We communicate on general work conditions, benefits, rules and regulations in the SHL Staff Handbook, which we hand out when welcoming a new colleague alongside a well planned on-board program. A mandatory and planned Employee Development Dialogue / EDD are conducted annually for all staff members together with their manager. This comprehensive sessions are focusing on motivation, job satisfaction, continuing professional development and career development. The EDD results in Individual Development Plan/ IDP for each employee made in collaboration between the manager and the employee. Additionally, there is an annual salary negation for every employee. At all locations, Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects encourage the employees to participate in a wide range of social and professional development activities. The company loves to celebrate won competitions, birthdays and anniversaries by inviting to informal gatherings. The SHL Intranet monthly presents various activities to ensure a spirited social life, including knowledge sharing, lectures, courses, site visits and inspiring studytrips. To ensure assisted learning activities and ongoing professional and personal development for all employees, the Continuing Professional Development Committee frames an annual CPD plan for the majority of the assisted learning activities open for everyone. Learning activites are arranged by specific knowledge groups; GREEN/ BIM/ BUILD/ Project management. The CPD plan is supplemented by the many different individual learning activities, also funded by company means. 17 Work Place Assessment/ 2016/ The organisation administers a detailed employee survey, a so called Workplace Assessment/ WPA once every three years in order to monitor organisational development on physical working conditions as well as psychological working environment. In 2016 the WPA consisted of 64 questions in 10 categories. The categories was as different as physical working environment/ my daily work/development/ my manager and reputation. In the assessment, scores range from 0 to 100. At SHL a score above 70 is considered satisfactory. In 2016 the number of respondents was 81% and 7 out of 10 categories scored above 70. The categories reputation/ general well-being and on boarding had an impressive score above 80. Some important questions in the WPA related to job-satisfaction has recurred in the last three surveys, showing a positive steady increase in the categories reputation and general well-being. The Executive Board in collaboration with Health & Safety/ Collaboration Committee / Managers / HR identify the key focus areas to be handled and prioritized in continuation of the employee feedback. Hereafter, action is taken on different organizational levels. Non-discrimination/ Members of staff are the most valuable resource at Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects. We believe that diversity supports an innovative work environment with world class architecture as a result. The staff of employees today counts 20 different nationalities and a distribution of sex of 45 % women and 55%. We focus on competencies and skills at any recruitment and internal promotion within the organization. 18 Collective Agreement/ In the section below, we outline the basic rules and regulations of the collective agreement pertinent to safeguarding labour rights and we include additional activities designed by the organisation to stimulate a positive working environment, where work life and family life is well balanced. The Danish Labour Law and Collective Agreement for architects in Denmark provides the following benefits to safeguard employee interests. 1/ Fixed salary tiers regulated according to seniority + individually salary negotiations 2/ Pension scheme 3/ Working hours regulation and overtime compensation 4/ Favourable maternity and paternity leave 5/ Holiday regulations (31 days per annum) 6/ Continuing Professional Development (CPD) funding and shared learning activities 7/ Employee representation on several organisational boards (Health & Safety committee, Collaboration Committee and Continuing Professional Development Committee) 8/ Free union representative elections without management intervention Additionally, the organisation has chosen to offer extra health care insurances for almost all staff members. Responsible behaviour/ At Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architect responsible behavior is integrated both in our professional work and in our everyday work life. Standards are thoroughly described in the SHL Staff Handbook. 19 SHL DAYS 2016/ SHANGHAI At Schmidt Hammer Lassen, we have proud traditions when it comes to our annual gatherings, the SHL Days. In September, 150 staff members set out to meet at a four-day adventurous architectour to Shanghai, one of the world’s most fascinating and fastest growing cities, one of the biggest on Earth. We wanted to experience the unique atmosphere of Shanghai, where beauty and charm coexist with kitsch and commercialism. From the colonial architecture of the former French Concession to the forest of cranes and the neon-lighted high-rises stretching above the city, Shanghai is a city of paradox and change. From the air, waterfront and ground we explored traditional and new architecture by Chinese and international architects, among these, also selected projects by Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects. 20 GLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES ON ENVIRONMENT Principle 7/ Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges; Principle 8/ undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility, and; Principle 9/ encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies. Vaxjo City Library/ Vaxjo/ Sweden 21 Above all, sustainability is about responding to the basic needs of a client, which can be an individual, a commercial enterprise, a school or an entire community. In the final analysis, sustainability is about delivering design that functions successfully as a catalyst for positive change. In other words, we are talking about successful place-making: when it works, sustainable design can engender a sense of civic pride, a sense of identity. This is an extraordinary challenge for architects – it is at the very heart of what we do. The Green Manifesto/ Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects 22 A SUSTAINABLE AGENDA The Crystal/ Copenhagen/ Denmark 23 The Urban Mountain refurbishment project Certified green knowledge/ won 1st prize in the Nordic Built Challenge for At Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects, we commit to develop projects the innovative and sustainable new landmark and realise buildings based on a holistic concept of sustainability. We work in multifunctional teams with innovative solutions in integrated design profor Oslo/ Norway cesses. We do this in frameworks of various certification systems as well as project specific goal setting working closely together with our clients organisation. Our architectural staff counts in-house experts in the most important building certification systems, BREEAM International Assessors, LEED Accredited Professionals, DGNB International and DGNB Denmark Consultants and Cradle to Cradle trained professionals, offering certification processes and benchmarking for our clients projects. This enables us to evaluate the “green performance” of a building and give a profound understanding of the interaction of different sustainable parameters. The evaluations are used to seek for optimized green solutions during the design process and better building performances without compromising the ambition for high quality architecture. Knowledge sharing is fundamental in our practice and in the CPD strategy of the studio. The CPD strategy aids to raise the common level and understanding of holistic sustainability throughout all of SHL. An important knowledge sharing platform is our GREENgroup, where passionate employees exchange cutting edge knowledge of highly sustainable projects and green ideas. In close collaboration with the architecture schools and university colleges we engage with students in different ways as mentors and external examiners in mutual inspiration. We participate in network initiatives with the focus on implementation of green value management, sustainable reuse of existing building mass and sustainable city development. The specialized staff members of our studio provide public lectures and communicate on our experienced work. We have recently lectured at events organized by Nordic Innovation, Future Built, Building Green and soon at the upcoming BAU-messe in 2017. 24 Selected sustainable projects/ by Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects Sir Duncan Rice Library/Aberdeen/Scotland/ Office Building Buddinge/Copenhagen/Denmark/ BREEAM excellent Halifax Central Library/Halifax/Canada/ LEED Gold Certified DGNB Silver Certified Dokk1/Aarhus/Denmark/ Meets Danish class 2015 low Amazon Court Building/Prague/the Czech Republic/ The Crystal/Copenhagen/Denmark/Energy-consumption energy requirements DGNB Gold Certified reduction and best practice PV integrated facade design Urban Mountain/Oslo/Norway/Refurbishment project Green Valley/Shanghai/China/Office facilities with a high Groendalsvej/Aarhus/Denmark/First zero-energy office employing Cradle to Cradle principles and targeting a level of flexibility and low operating costs building in Denmark. BREEAM Outstanding certification 25 BIM/ Kolding Hospital/Kolding/Denmark 26 BUILDING INFORMATION MODELLING/ BIM/ Sustainability and Building Information Modelling/ BIM go hand in hand. Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects have been working with BIM for many years, and now execute all major projects with the use of BIM. Internally, BIM is used to develop and validate the designs of our buildings with the use of sustainable analysis and simulations, which allows us to optimize documentation of the project for construction. Externally, BIM is used on all project organization levels to communicate the design enabling a smoother decision making process. The result is an optimally coordinated process and collaboration and minimisation of errors. We facilitate the dialogue with clients and related stakeholders to clarify and define the scope of information and data which need to be successfully handed over on delivery of the project, for better and lower cost facility management. When environmental analysis and simulation tools are used from the earliest stages of a design process, projects can be designed to benefit from local environmental conditions such as site orientation, solar access and seasonal winds as well as support selection of the used materials. For the client, coming user and the community, this means a more sustainable, enduring and energy efficient building. 27 Building new knowledge/ Successful integration of new methods and technologies requires an extensive level of knowledge sharing. Therefore, the BIM management group engages in BIM Networks, BIM standard organisations and conferences, and also lectures at conferences and educational institutions. These activities are essential in order to build and share new knowledge – internally as well as externally. Schmidt Hammer Lassen is co-founder and member of the BIM7AA, a voluntary collaboration between seven Danish architectural practices in collaboration with the Aarhus School of Architecture. The purpose of BIM7AA is to develop and continuously optimise commonly developed BIM-tools, -methods and -processes with focus on interdisciplinary cooperation. New Knowledge Centre/ Molio Schmidt Hammer Lassen is also member of Molio, a new construction knowledge centre focusing on digital solutions and new technology. Molio is taking over the role as the buildingSMART network in Denmark and will also be the new buildingSMART Nordic Chapter partner and coordinate activities in Denmark. BIM is also one of the key cornerstones in the internal strategic continuing education plan. Additional BIM has its own internal taskforce and a separate internal budget as Schmidt Hammer Lassen acknowledges that being a first mover on this field requires constant research, a large professional network and education. Running evaluations of the BIM projects is part of these knowledge sharing initiatives.

Working internationally, the applied Quality Assurance standards need to be applicable to the multitude of projects, that we work on all over the world, as well as support the unique architectural quality. The quality assurance policy of the practice is described in detail in the SHL Quality Assurance Manual, and it has been prepared according to the following guidelines and standards: / Quality Control in Architectural Practices published by The Danish Association of Architectural Firms / The DS/ISO 9001 standard The SHL Quality Assurance Handbook is a process tool that includes guidelines and standards for planning, implementation and quality control. The Handbook is verified and updated on an ongoing basis. Halifax New Public Library/ Halifax/ Canada 29 BUSINESS ETHICS/ The independent international NGO, Transparency International was founded in 1993 and is now present in more than 100 countries. The organization annually publishes reports on corruption – and for many years Denmark has been placed as one of the world’s least corrupt countries. The result underlines the very high standards of Danish companies. We hold a reputation as a responsible and conscientious business partner and dissociate from corruption, extortion, and bribery in any form. The studio has never been involved in corruption or bribery and the company has worked out policy guidelines which are carefully described in the Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects staff handbook that are handed out to all employees on their first day at work. In this we state that: „Our business ethics are grounded on trustworthiness, honesty and transparency. Accordingly, employees at all levels must avoid letting financial and/or personal interests influence – or arouse suspicion of influencing – their work-related deciGLOBAL COMPACT PRINCIPLES sions or conflicting with the interests and ethics of the organisation. Moreover, we expect all employees to act in accordance with applicaON ANTI-CORRUPTION ble legislation.“ We support the UN Convention against Corruption and the UK Bribery Act. Principle 10/ Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. 30 WE SUPPORT/ THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS In 2015, leaders from 193 countries came together to commit to ending poverty, combating climate change, and fighting injustice by adopting a new set of 17 measurable Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At Schmidt Hammer Lassen, we have identified Development Goal no. 11 concerning “Sustainable cities and communities” that target future cities to be inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, as our primary focus area. 31 In 2015 Nordic Innovation published the book ”30 Sustainable Nordic buildings” featuring best practice examples based on the Nordic Built Charter principles. Schmidt Hammer Lassen’s highrise winning project in downtown Oslo, the Urban Mountain, will become another icon of the Norwegian capital and sets new standards for sustainability. 32 THE NORDIC BUILT CHARTER/ Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects have signed the Nordic Built Charter; committed to accelerate the development of sustainable building concepts initiated by the Nordic ministers for trade and industry. The Nordic Built Charter is a public declaration of the values, intentions and ambitions of a united Nordic building sector. It describes a holistic approach to the built environment – taking energy, climate, economy and people into account. The intention is that relevant actors from across Nordic borders and across the entire value chain of the building sector will commit to its ten principles. In short, The Nordic Built Charter gives the building sector a platform for cooperation and provides a common set of fundamentally Nordic and sustainable values, promoting a balanced and integrated societal development based on environmental, economic and social sustainability. The Nordic Built programme combines key Nordic strengths, provides attractive and effective arenas for collaboration and realizes concrete projects that demonstrate world-class scalable solutions. In 2012 the Nordic Built Challenge – a high profiled international architectural competition was organized by Nordic Innovation. The ambition were to create five lighthouse projects for the Nordic region, one in each country, demonstrating the solutions for sustainable refurbishment of the existing building stock, which the Nordic building industry is able to deliver. With the Urban Mountain refurbishment project Schmidt Hammer Lassen and team won 1st prize for the innovative and sustainable new landmark for the city of Oslo.

Partner architect/ Gottlieb Paludan Architects Structural Engineer/ Schlaich Bergermann Partners Visuals/ Beauty & the Bit 35 Shenzhen East Waste-to-Energy Plant/ Shenzhen/China In 2016, Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects in collaboration with Gottlieb Paludan Architects won the international competition to design the world’s largest waste to energy power plant in Shenzhen, China. Located on the outskirts of Shenzhen, the Shenzhen East Waste-to-Energy Plant will incinerate 5,000 tonnes of waste per day, generating 550 million kWh every year. With a population of 20 million, Shenzhen produces 15,000 tonnes of waste a day, a number that is increasing approximately 7% per year. To counteract this, Shenzhen Energy wishes to build a new plant that not only uses the most advanced technological processes in waste incineration but also act as a source of education for the citizens of the city. The proposal organizes the entire plant, including auxiliary buildings, into one circular building breaking the traditional rectangular layout of an industrial power plant. By proposing a clean circular form, the footprint of the plant reduces the amount of excavation required to build on the site. Public visitors are invited into the plant through a landscaped park, via an entrance bridge that rises between the stacks to an entrance lobby and visitor centre overlooking the plant machinery. An internal circular path and walkway circle the plant explaining each process, before leading up to a 1.5km panoramic public walkway on the roof overlooking the surrounding landscape and back towards the city. The roof is designed to be covered by up to 44,000m2 of photovoltaic panels, providing the opportunity for the plant to not only provide a cleaner way to deal with the city’s waste but also contribute to the renewable energy provision for the city. The plant is intended to showcase the Waste to Energy production as an important technical process that is geared to deal with both the issues of growing waste, but also the issue of finding new more environmentally friendly ways of generating electricity. At the same time, visitors can become informed on the challenge of the growing waste we produce every day and be educated on initiatives on how we can reduce our own amount of daily waste. Schmidt Hammer Lassen has built a reputation for bringing a strong Scandinavian design approach to large complex public projects in China. Detailed design work is due to begin during 2016, and the plant is scheduled to go live in 2020. 36 The Green Tower/ High-rise build as a sustainable community 37 With this project we wanted to explore, how high-rise build in timber can be organized as a sustainable community. Morten Schmidt, senior partner 38 The Green Tower/ sharing/ social/ living/ urban/ interaction/ community/ flexible/ green/ A new typology Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects have developed a new high-rise concept. The concept proposes a new typology for high rises. As oppose to the common method of designating fixed units for sale, this project proposes to design a structural framework for housing units, community facilities, and vegetation to be infilled at later stages. This approach creates the flexibility for a high-rise to serve multiple purpose through time. It is adaptable spatially, socially and economically. This type of building may serve as a green wall in the dense urban area at one point and then infilled by modular housings at a later stage. Modularity is a key factor in this typology. Prefabricated units can simplify the construction and allow units to be expand or reduced upon demand. Yet, the types of modules can be variable to create different spatial and social opportunities over time. Sustainable Housing/ Development of contemporary cities and urban environments is often operating on traditional and even outdated approaches for residential high-rise, designing towers that only address the demand for housing and utilizing obsoleted techniques, that organize family units into compact and isolated order. Over time, this type of housing can be prone to become a burden to our cities’ environmentally and socially and effect degrading of market value. It is crucial to develop a new housing typology that considers the whole environment for a sustainable lifestyle, Sustainable Housing solutions. The total environment for sustainable housing converges three key aspects: environment, community and building construction. 39 International Criminal Court/ The Hague/ Netherlands/ A landmark for peace and justice Architect/ Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects Client/The International Criminal Court (ICC) Area/ 54,000 m² / 1,200 workplaces Competition/ 2008-2010, first prize in restricted international competition Engineer/ Royal Haskoning Nederland B.V. and Esbensen Consulting Engineers AS Landscaping/ SLA Project management/ Brink Group Interior & Art/ Bosch & Fjord Contractor/ Courtys 40 International Criminal Court/ The Hague/ Netherlands In 2010, Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects won the prestigious architectural design competition for the new permanent premises of the ICC with an experienced interdisciplinary team of consultants. The design was selected for its understanding of the concept of transparency. The design also shows how democratic values upon which the Danish tradition for architecture rests, reflect in an international institution that is subject to some of the strictest security requirements in the world. Safety and openness In the design approach it has been paramount that the security measures, as much as possible, are an integrated part of the design. The public has easy and open access to the main entrance and the design of the landscape surrounding the building achieves a highly secure environment without the appearance of barbwire and high fences. The landscape The new ICC headquarters is located between the edge of the Hague city and the Meijendel Dune Landscape, which is a protected Natura 2000 area. One of the primary and most important aims of landscape architects SLA’s concept is to ‘reunite’ the site with this dune landscape. The primary idea has been to locate the complex as a cut in the landscape, establishing an interior that relates to the international collectivity of the ICC, and an exterior that entrenches the ICC to the local Dutch landscape and opens it to the public.

Bjarne Hammer, senior partner 41 International Criminal Court/ 42 The library/ A new generation of public buildings/ Public Library of the Year Award/ 2016 In 2016, the visionary hybrid library project, Dokk1 in Aarhus, Denmark, was announced winner of the Public Library of the Year Award at a prestigious ceremony during the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) congress in Columbus, Ohio. The international panel of judges recognised Dokk1 as a true library of the future, that embraces new digital developments, user demands, local culture, and a desire to accommodate diverse population groups within an open and functional architectural expression. The Dokk1 project also scooped an A+ Popular Choice Award in 2016 in the Library category. The event organized by Architizer brought together an eclectic mix of architects and designers from around the globe.

It is a place for exchanging knowledge and opportunities and a multicultural meeting point that will change people’s perception of the entire city“ The new library has already become a new vibrant hub and a connecting “hinge” that opens up to new experiences in the city of Aarhus. Kim Holst Jensen, senior partner The two open levels of the library are connected by the media ramp, which consists of five platforms dedicated to numerous activities: exhibitions, gaming, interactive workshops, reading and events. Combined with the literature and media sections, the media ramp offers a meandering path of activity through the building leading up to the children’s area on the top floor. A covered urban space The principal idea behind Dokk1 is a transparent covered urban space, designed as a polygonal slice that hovers above a glazed building resting on a podium with large sculptural stairs. The stairs fan out to street level and the new harbour promenade surrounding the building. The glass building is designed as an open urban space with 360-degree views of the water, harbour, forest and city. The building has no clear front or back, which is emphasised by the multiedged top slice that creates the impression of rotation and movement. The facade is made of expanded metal, the scale of the city and harbour is reflected in the design, which twists, breaks and turns. The concept of the façade design is an interaction with the height of the surrounding DOKK1/ buildings and the scale of the port with reference to large elements, such Aarhus/ Denmark/ as cranes and ships.

The intention is to develop the area with as little environmental impact as possible, for example by reducing energy consumption and using local energy sources such as geothermal heating, solar energy and wind power. Close proximity to City Tunnel and Central Station makes taking public transport easy. Green roofs absorb water, slow up runoff and promote biodiversity. Solar cells meet some of the building’s energy requirements. Food waste is collected and turned into biogas, and there are nesting boxes for kestrels on the roofs to help this bird of prey to live in a city environment. Malmö Live will be certified according to the international Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standard aiming for the highest level platinum in the assessment, which looks at factors like materials, indoor environment, design, and water use. The building also meets the category A standard of the Miljöbyggprogram Syd Green Construction Programme. 49 Green Valley/ Shanghai/ China/ Transformation as driver/ Lead design architect/Schmidt Hammer Lassen Architects Local architect/ECADI (East China Architecture and Design Institute) Client/Shanghai EXPO Construction Development Co.
