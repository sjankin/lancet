DEADLINE: December, 2015 Action concluded within the deadline In the Three-Year Strategic Plan – 2016 to 2018 – by FBB, we highlight its mission of improving people’s lives, fostering the socio-productive inclusion, sustainable development and the social Technologies, focused on the action of the five vectors: water, agro-ecology, agro-industry, solid waste and education. The participating audiences continue to be the less favored layers of the Brazilian population, with even greater highlight to youth and women, as they are segments more sensitive to social unbalances and more exposed to violence. It is also worth noticing the commitment signed by FBB of working aside with its creator – Banco do Brasil – in benefit of the social transformation and sustainable development of our Country. Within the scope of sustainability, likewise our Low Carbon Program, FBB expects to operate in actions related to reduction of the greenhouse effect gases emission and fighting of global warming, preservation of water resources and expansion of the synergy with the social businesses, with the challenge of implementing projects and diffusing and reusing social technologies in the sense of incrementing the socio-productive inclusion of the prioritized stakeholders. Another relevant point, which emphasizes our Public Spirit value, is the approach of FBB’s assumption, which confirms the commitment towards excellence in services and relationships with the stakeholders, raising of funds, alignment with strategic partners and with public policies as a way of maximizing the social investment and the coverage of the activities. FBB’s actions integrate the Sustainable Development Action Plan (PADS), the tool that supports BB’s Sustainable Development Integrated Action Plan, presenting opportunities for business accomplishment to the branches. Annual Report 2015 66 ACTION: To assess ways to internalize funds in FBB and new sources of public and private funds, analyzing, also, the feasibility of investing reimbursable funds. DEADLINE: December, 2015 Action concluded within the deadline The actions executed by our Foundation include: • Elaboration of proposal for amendment of Law 9.249/95, aiming at increasing the fiscal benefit for funds donator companies; • Beginning of the donations’ management through identification of the donators, receipts and declarations and beginning of the donations’ flow analysis; • Forwarding of the demand to the information technology team to build portal for the social investor that will enable facilitating the donations and enhancing the management; • Favorable legal opinion to perform reimbursable social investments in Equity Investment Fund (FIP); • Unfavorable legal opinion about the request for issuance of fiscal benefit declaration, referring to non-cash donations; • Topic addressed during the workshop with participation of our Entities Linked to Banco do Brasil (Brasilprev, BB Seguridade, BBTS, Cielo, BBAtivos, BB Consórcio) and internally intensified. ACTION: To carry through annual workshop among the business areas and FBB to enable identification of social Technologies that can be added to BB’s business, aiming at their replication, so that by gaining scale it may become a public policy, contributing for the development of greener and more inclusive economy. DEADLINE: December, 2015 Action concluded within the deadline We have conducted a workshop with the participation of representatives from many boards and Related Entities – Brasilprev, Cielo, BB Ativos, BB Seguridade, BB Consórcio, and BB Tecnologia. FBB presented its forms of action within the scope of Private Social Investment and the connection between the topics and its social technology base. After the discussion, we determined that the Boards and ELBBs will assess the possibility of using technologies that can add value to businesses related to its products and services. 67 Banco do Brasil Challenge 23 | To enhance the employees’ variable remuneration system, including that of the High Management, taking into account individual performance. ACTION: To develop initiatives to expand the percentage of employees whose remuneration is impacted by the individual performance assessment (administration by goals and multidimensional performance assessments). DEADLINE: Annual continuous action Action under continuous development In 2015, we started to consider as being the Rewarded Performance Program (PDG) audience also the employees that left the bank after expiration of the probation period. Today, 34,604 employees participate in the PDG, which uses the individual assessment of the performance as its indicator. Annual Report 2015 68 Challenge 24 | To increase the employees’ level of satisfaction. ACTION: To analyze the factors with the greatest contribution towards improvement of the employees’ satisfaction. To assess the feasibility of strengthening those factors and creating an action plan. DEADLINE: December, 2015 Action concluded within the deadline We present and disclose on a yearly basis in the Executive Summary, after the application of the research, the analysis of the factors that most contribute to increase satisfaction among employees. The research was revised in 2015, receiving new questions and topics – engagement, benefits and expansion of the training focus. The analysis showed that the “Organizational Engagement” dimension is the one better explaining the employees’ satisfaction. This diagnosis indicated a new perspective: the need to deepen studies on the engagement topic, develop a survey to replace the current one and provide more concrete data for the operation of the Personnel Management area. Hence, we do not consider as effective the option of developing action plans based on a survey that might be discontinued in 2016. ACTION: To improve the already existing actions and assess implementation of new ones to inhibit moral and/ or sexual harassment, dealing with the substantiated occurrences. DEADLINE: December, 2015 Action concluded within the deadline In order to enhance our actions, we launched the course Prevention and Fighting of Moral and Sexual Harassment. Our Internal Ombudsman also launched a new methodology to conduct the denouncements, the Restoration Mediation and provided the course mediation for conflicts resolution in the work environment, such as the moral harassment. Until December, 2015, 4,873 employees were trained. We held eight Itinerant Ombudsman events in the Regional Personnel Management Boards (Gepes) to promote the Internal Ombudsman as a channel to receive denouncements of any type of harassment as well as conflicts and ethic deviations at the work place. In addition, the topics Non-Violent Communication (CNV), Restoration Practices and Moral Harassment in the Employment Relation and the differences for the refutable socio-functional conduct and behavior, were the subject of two ordinary meetings of the State Committees for Ethics, that are comprised by the internal leaderships of each State, which facilitates its dissemination. 69 Banco do Brasil Challenge 26 | To maintain and expand the Bank’s role as an agent that induces the sustainable development through the financial inclusion and the social business (MPO, Fies, Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida (My House, My Life Program), BB Crédito Acessibilidade (Accessibility Credit), Pronaf, among others), integrating public programs and policies, partnerships with the private sector and BB’s sustainable development strategies (private social investment, volunteer work, digital inclusion, sustainable regional development, model of integrated operation in sustainable development and others). ACTION: To implement model of operations in sustainable development. DEADLINE: Six-monthly continuous action Action under continuous development We have started the phase of the Model of Integrated Operations in Sustainable Development, enabling validation of over 380 Sustainable Development Action Plans (PADS), which are generating business possibilities for the branches and contributing for compliance with BB’s Socioenvironmental Responsibility Policy. We also launched the course Sustainable Development in BB, attended by more than 300 employees until this instance. During the second half of 2015, we concluded the validation stage of the requisites referring to the first phase of the sustainable development project. We maintained expansion of the Model of Integrated Operations in Sustainable Development, providing validation of more than 1,300 PADS, which are generating business possibilities for the branches and contributing for compliance with BB’s Socioenvironmental Responsibility Policy. ACTION: To define the concept, for BB, of “financial inclusion” and to define indicators capable of measuring performance of the Bank’s activities, with monitoring and report to the High Management. DEADLINE: Six-monthly continuous action Action under continuous development Our goal is to adopt the same guidance provided by the Central Bank (Bacen) with respect to the concept of financial inclusion, but with an activity focused on banking, in order to meet the real needs of the population with this profile. According to Bacen, “...the financial inclusion is the process of effective access and use, by the population, of financial services adequate to their needs, contributing for improvement of their life quality”. Annual Report 2015 70 However, for us the concept of financial inclusion goes beyond the Bank’s operations. Our actions are aimed at promoting the banking in a manner that can be adequate to the customers’ needs, contributing to improve their life quality, in a sustainable way. The following are the proposed indicators: • Possession of Social Business – (MPO, Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida (My House, My Life Program), PRONAF, FIES, BB Crédito Acessibilidade (Accessibility Credit)) • Use of alternative channels • Products addressed for banking inclusion • Business with Cooperatives ACTION: To elaborate the integrated communication annual plan on BB’s results towards the sustainable development. DEADLINE: Six-monthly continuous action Action under continuous development We have approved elaboration of a PCI aimed for the Brazil Waters Program, in order to disclose the results accomplished by the Program and its connection with resolution of the problems that are evidenced in the current context related to water. For this year, due to budget contingency, the communication plan of the Brazil Waters Program, which result is presented in Action 36 of this Agenda 21, was prioritized and considered as an initiative aimed for disclosure of BB’s results towards the Sustainable Development. The PCI was implemented and all the actions for the first and second semesters were performed and monitored. This action will continue to be monitored with the same periodicity ACTION: To create an area in the UniBB portal with specific content for the audience of the sustainable development business, emphasizing the financial education. DEADLINE: December, 2015 Action concluded within the deadline We published in UniBB website a link with content related to Financial Education to the social business audience, which can be accessed by the address: www. unibb.com. br > Acesse aqui os cursos abertos > Educação Financeira. The content can also be accessed at the Bank’s website: www.bb.com.br > Educação Financeira. 71 Banco do Brasil DESPITE THE UNFAVORABLE MACROECONOMIC SCENARIO, OUR CONGLOMERATE HAD A POSITIVE RESULT DURING THE YEAR, Business REACHING A NET PROFIT Performance 28% ABOVE 2014 In 2015, the main characteristic of the macroecoThe unfavorable scenario did not prevent our nomic scenario was the disparity between the main Conglomerate from having a positive result during global economies evolution, which grew much less the year.
