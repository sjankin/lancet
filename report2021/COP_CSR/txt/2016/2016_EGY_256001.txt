Sustainability Report 2015 SEKEM Sustainability Report 2015 Dear Readers, Sustainable Development is always a challenge – in post-revolutionary Egypt, the past years were especially challenging for us. Still, in 2015 most of SEKEMs institutions performed well, which is an important driver, especially after the struggles we went through in the past five years. It is absolutely clear to us that there are obstacles that one cannot overcome alone. Although our ambitious and trusty co-workers build the basis for our community we could only make it with the support of a strong network of partners. It is not taken for granted that our partners remained with us during these difficult times and it was an unexpected gift that we could even gain a new and very strong partner and friend in 2015. With this support we could achieve important debt reductions in 2015 and develop a strategy on debt reduction and resilience for the years to come. We are aware of the many challenges we still have to overcome and we intent to face them as opportunities to become resillient. We started to rethink old practices and to steadily reinvent ourselves to continuously move towards sustainable development in all four dimensions. This report shows the support of our friends, networks and partners in each single dimension and we want to thankfully dedicate the Sustainability Report 2015 to all of them. Furthermore, I am happy that we can present this report in a more personal way as we took our SEKEM News next to our indicators, enabling us to serve you with an integrative and vital picture of our efforts in 2015.

One of ” Read More them was Ola Hussein, who is working in SEKEMs Medical Center since more than 9 years and benefits from the childcare institution. I wish the Egyptian society would value arts with all its types, just like it happens in SEKEM. I am sure it would have a great impact.” Hamada Shousha, Arts Professor at Heliopolis University Last but not least, like in the previous years, SEKEM continuous supported its co-workers with regular trainings and meetings in regards to different topics. Every sunday morning the employees of SEKEMs Head Office meet Dr. Ibrahim Abouleish, and sometimes guests from outside, to discuss SEKEMs vision, sustainable development or the current development in the world. Each meeting starts with a cultural performance and includes an holistic way of commenting. The staff of Heliopolis University has a similar meeting that is focusing more on pedagogics. 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013 5606 4831 1146 5913 2724 1063 4077 4743 7292 8894 10653 6669 Total hours Total hours Total hours Total hours provided provided in provided in Soft provided in in Cultural & Arts Vocational Training.

Likewise, SEKEMs contracted farmers that are located all over Egypt cultivating land with Biodynamic methods, receive regular trainings and continued education by introducing them to new techniques or offering cultural courses. In December, SEKEM farmers in Beheira received a comprehensive training regarding new advances Read More in biological pest control, bio fertilization and an innovative technique in clean ” energy extraction, a modern Biogas unit. I wouldn’t know that SEKEM is that huge unless I attended this orientation program and watched every single detail of it. I could also make new friendships with my colleagues from different departments.” Noha Hussein, SEKEM Co-Worker about her Orientation Days at SEKEM The continuous personal development strategy, which SEKEM is adopting within its holistic approach starts with the co-workers from the beginning of their engagement with SEKEM. Since 2015 new co-workers join a four-days orientation program in order to get to know SEKEMs activities, vision and mission. The newcomers receive lectures from the managers of each of SEKEMs companies and make their first artistic experiences with SEKEM for instance by doing eurythmy or painting courses.

We can build up the quality of soil, improve water use and build stronger community relations, but a sustainable way of financing these new models is also a priority. “ Helmy Abouleish During the past 38 years SEKEM reclaimed 1628 Feddan (approx. 683 hectares) desert land to vital living soil by using Organic and Biodynamic methods. Additionally, SEKEMs contracted farmers cultivate more than 4000 Feddan (approx. 1680 hectares) all over Egypt with sustainable Biodynamc agriculture. In a country like Egypt, that consists of more than 90% desert and is living in water scarcity, sustainable land reclamation has a fundamental meaning for the future. Even though most Egyptians don’t realize, they have not enough water to secure their food supply and are accordingly depending heavily on food imports. With the fast growing population of Egypt, this requires innovative solutions right away. 23 Ecology SEKEM Sustainability Report – 2015 In the past years, SEKEM did not reclaim additional land (according to the challenging times that Egypt went through since 2011) but could manage to keep the soil fertile. For its efforts in “revitalizing dry lands through biodynamic agriculture methods” and for combating desertification SEKEM received the Land for Life Award by the Read More United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in 2015. Since 38 years, SEKEM is committed to reclaiming desert land in a sustainable way by applying Biodynamic agriculture. This means that the whole farm is seen as a living organism. Animals take a fundamental part in a healthy farm circle and are crucial for biodynamic agriculture. In 2015 SEKEM could increase the number of animals and addressed the topic “how can we accompany the animals with dignity into the future?” at the 19th Demeter International Conference that was hosted by SEKEM. Read More Their manure is an important ingredient in the organic compost, which SEKEM is using instead of chemical fertilizer. The so-called “black gold of the desert” is rich of micro-organisms and keeps the soil fertile. This increases the water holding capacity and the microorganisms are essential to make nutrients available to plants.

MORE INFORMATION MORE INFORMATION 26 Ecology SEKEM Sustainability Report – 2015 SEKEM is strongly focusing on its water footprint as the United Nations predict that the water availability will even drop to below 500 cubic meters per year per capita in Egypt until 2025. This means that Egypt is heading to become completely water scare. Some of the SEKEM Farms use Nile water and others groundwater, according to the area where they are located. SEKEM is putting a lot of efforts in monitoring the water consumption, especially by inspecting the well water levels to only withdraw sustainable water amounts. SEKEM could decrease the usage of water for agriculture in the past year, which is an outcome of strong maintenance efforts and infrastructure improvements. The Power of the Egyptian Sun Not only the conscious dealing with water is important. Based on the Biodynamic approach of cultivation, SEKEM also constantly monitors its impact on air and energy. Hence, SEKEM fosters the implementation of renewable energies. In 2015, first successes could be achieved. On SEKEMs Farm in Wahat El Bahareya the so Read More far largest single solar-water pump was installed in 2015. The photovoltaic panels replace a diesel generator and are able to irrigate an area of 60 feddan (about 25 hectares) of date palms. To develop and monitor all ecological practice SEKEM engages a whole team that ” Chia and Quinoa may be very useful to Egypt’s agriculture as they require only small water amounts and in the same time increase the income of the local local farmers by exporting them to Europe where they are high requested at the the moment.“ LauraMack, Laura PhDcandidate Mack,PhD candidateconducting researchat conductingresearch atSEKEM SEKEM 27 Ecology SEKEM Sustainability Report – 2015 is committed to researches and studies on different ecological and agricultural topics: SEKEMs Department for Sustainable Development. One important research Read More that started in 2015 has been done in cooperation with the German University of Hohenheim and with the support of SEKEMs German partner company Davert. The currently very popular so-called “functional superfoods” Chia and Quinoa have Read More been cultivated in SEKEM with a special focus on water management. Both crops are dryand salt-tolerant and seem to be predestinated for desert farming. Additionally, various conferences and events took place in SEKEM or have been attended by SEKEM representatives to create awareness and enhance the current agricultural practices (for more details, see Societal Life). Organic Farming, the “Glo-cal Solution” Although SEKEM did not increase the reclaimed land in the past year another important outcome can be seen. Mohamed Berry, a young man that went already Read More to SEKEM School, worked later on different SEKEM Farms and was engaged to various ecological projects, says: “I am convinced that organic farming is our best chance to tackle many of the global and local challenges we are facing nowadays. I therefore call it the ‘Glo-cal’ solution, a combination of the two terms global and local. It is crucial to always consider both.” The fact that people become aware of the ecological challenges that Egypt is facing will help to reclaim more deserts for the future and spread the idea of Organic and Biodynamic agriculture approaches. ” We can start to reclaim more deserts for cultivation and the construction of plants – I am sure this is possible. More people should benefit from the blessings as we could.“ Mohamed same the same MohamedMansour, Mansour,SEKEM of SEKEMFarmer Farmer 28 Ecology SEKEM Sustainability Report – 2015 SEKEM Sustainability Report – 2015 INDICATORS Evaluation of SEKEMs performance in 2015 through the balance score card Target Evaluation I n the current review process of the Sustainability ECONOMY SOCIETAL CULTURAL ECOLOGY Life Life F lower, which forms the basis of the assessment framework, some performance aspects have been added or removed based on stakeholder request or 1 0 0 2 decision by management. 1 1 0 2 In the year 2015, we set ourselves 90 targets out of which we achieved 61%.
