In addition to that, we will during 2015 take some strategic actions:  Internal workshops on the use of social media in a professional role. The purpose is to identify and discuss issues related to this area and based on that reach a consensus on what may be considered appropriate.  A Workplace Committee has been formed with five members (management and staff), The mandate and purpose of the committee is to make sure that all employees’ issues related to the working environment is addressed. Issues may be of physical, organizational or psychosocial nature. Our ambition and goal for the year is to keep our record of no formal complaints or legal breaches in the area of Human Rights intact. Principle 3, 4, 5 and 6 – Labour  Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining (P3)  The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labour (P4);  The effective abolition of child labour (P5);  and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation (P6). 4C Strategies fully supports and adheres to the strict laws (of Sweden and UK) pertaining to the freedom of association and labour practices, and actively works to promote equality at the workplace. Our actions during 2015 are to continue the work of pro-actively striving for a gender balance in the recruitment, retention and promotion of employees. Actions supporting this includes equal salaries for equal jobs, offering favorable terms for maternity and paternity leave, and providing a working environment that is tailored for both men and women. The Workplace Committee mentioned above also serves an important instrument in this context.
