Every year the Board and the Executive review our strategy and the key material issues that need to be addressed if we are to achieve them. We use key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our performance. We identi√Äed the following key issues that we need TOWARDS 1 to address in our quest to achieve operational excellence: > Achieve zero harm > Optimise volumes OPERATIONAL > Reduce unit costs > Labour stability EXCELLENCE > Meet Mining Charter commitments ARS We believe that building √Åexibility into our business will increase 2 STRATEGIC P its sustainability and support productivity improvements.

Our approach to risk appetite and risk tolerances RBPlat‚Äôs Board has ultimate responsibility for risk management including the development of our risk appetite and the setting and monitoring of risk tolerances. King III recommends that the Board determines the levels of risk tolerance and the risk levels that it has the ability to tolerate versus the risks that it is willing to take. Our risk appetite statement is designed to ensure the RBPlat Group includes risk factors in any major strategic or tactical decision and the compatibility of a course of action with our risk appetite is always questioned. The table which follows indicates that the key indicators that can prevent us from achieving our business plan are operational ef√Äciency, which includes safety and operating costs, and the basket price. RBPlat‚Äôs risk appetite and tolerances were established in 2015, in line with our risk appetite policy and framework by means of a pilot project. We interviewed the relevant members of the Executive Committee and key members of senior management and reviewed external data. From this process we established key risk indicators as well as tolerance limits and set our overall risk appetite. RBPlat‚Äôs prudent approach to √Änancial and risk management was applied to their establishment. Following the pilot project the limits were tested in the second half of 2015 to ensure that they had been set at the correct levels.

The plan is monitored quarterly by the Audit and Risk Committee. This is our third year of implementing our ERM framework and policy during which we have tracked its maturity in line with our overall business maturity. We set ourselves the goal of reaching an Optimised level of risk management maturity by 2015, which we have achieved. 19 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 RBPlat‚Äôs risk management maturity journey ‚Äî taking risk management to the next level Maximise earnings potential 0DVWHU\ Earnings stability > Proactive risk/return Optimised ‚Äî moving framework WRZDUGV0DVWHU\ > Dynamic risk-taking > Optimising > Risk appetite and investments Progressive tolerance framework > Evaluating value > Risk-based decisioncreating investments ERM maturity > Control processes making > Risk decomposition and risk system > Measuring risk Emerging > Consistent risk adjusted reporting performance > Loss > Identi√Äcation of > Linking risk and Basic prevention accountability return for risks > Risk aggregation > Silo approach and integration to risk management 2010 2013 2014 2015 2016 ‚Äî 2018 The way forward The risk landscape changed signi√Äcantly in 2015 and we see the next three years being very different from the past three years. In this changing environment our approach to risk management will, in addition to qualitative risk measures, also incorporate quantitative measures. This process will guide the business in long term decision-making and its day-to-day responses that ensure that we are √Åexible enough to respond to emerging risks. The risk appetite and tolerance dashboard will become a strategic tool to link strategy, risk, performance and reward. A new risk management strategy will be developed in 2016 covering 2016 ‚Äî 2018 in line with the business strategy. New developments in international risk standards, as well as King IV principles, will be taken into account. 20 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 Our capitals are represented by the $ following icons: Financial Manufactured Human Intellectual Social and Natural capital capital capital capital Relationship capital capital Key material issues that have the potential to signi√Äcantly affect our performance Our approach workshops and interviews, following a change in focus as the ranking of Details of our materiality process, a change in economic conditions the risks and opportunities facing which was extended this year to we revisited these issues with the us had changed.

Merensky tonnes milled reduced by 2% to 1 874kt, while UG2 tonnes milled increased by 4% to 587kt. This resulted in the percentage of UG2 tonnes milled increasing marginally to 24% from 23% in 2014. The reduction in total milled volume and the increase in UG2 contribution were directly related to mining volumes. BRPM concentrator recoveries were in line with expectations given the reduction in head grade and toll concentrating was within contractual limits. The 1% reduction in milled volumes and 4% reduction in built-up head grade yielded a 5% reduction in 4E and platinum ounce production, with 278koz (4E) and 180koz platinum metals being produced in concentrate. Completion of the 250ktpm upgrade of the concentrator that was scheduled to take place during 2015 was deferred to the √Ärst quarter of 2016.

At year-end our working cost labour complement at BRPM had marginally decreased by 16 employees to 6 256 compared with 6 272 in 2014. The decrease in working cost labour is due to labour restructuring initiatives during the second half of the year. Capital labour decreased by 1 602 to 999 as a result of the slowing down of construction activities at Styldrift I and the Phase III Merensky replacement project. Stoping crews at BRPM achieved 321m2/crew, which re√Åects a decrease of 8% year-on-year.

The reduction in built-up head grade is directly attributable to the high percentage of on-reef development at Styldrift I (related to workshop infrastructure in 2016), which Styldrift I will contribute to our overall production. Total JV capital expenditure for 2016, including escalation and contingencies, is forecast at around R1.3 billion, the key driver being the Styldrift capital construction programme. SIB capital expenditure is forecast at between 4% and 5% of operating expenditure. We believe that the decisions we made in 2015 were prudent and that the ensuing actions we are taking will allow us to make steady progress towards achieving our strategy during 2016.

Our efforts have been supported by our comprehensive well-established safety systems, processes, procedures, training and audit programmes (systems and design). Our total injury frequency rate (TIFR), LTIFR and SIFR improved 9.4%, 22.8% and 54.1%, respectively, year-on-year. We also achieved improvements of 35%, 59% and 75% for these respective frequency rates since taking over operational control in 2010. Despite our success in reducing these key safety measurements, leadership and behavioural maturity remain a continued source of risk to our business in terms of preventing serious and fatal accidents. During 2015 we tragically lost √Äve employees to fatal accidents at our operations: Mr Amelio Paquete, who was a winch operator employed by JIC, a contractor operating at BRPM, was fatally injured when he was trapped during a fall of ground incident in a stope panel, at BRPM‚Äôs North shaft on 8 January 2015. 0U$OEHUWR-RVH0XFKDQJD an Aveng contract employee, employed as an equipping assistant at Styldrift I, was fatally injured in a shaft-related incident on 21 April 2015. 0U.D\DOHWKX6LGXPR a winch operator employed by contractor RMS, was fatally injured when he was struck by a scraper rope during scraping operations at BRPM‚Äôs South shaft on 3 July 2015.

Risk management Safety risk assessments are conducted as required by the Mine Health and Safety Act (MHSA) and form part of our enterprise risk management. We use this process to: > reduce risks > conduct ongoing research into what causes unsafe behaviour > provide safety coaching, training and development for both supervisors and their teams. Safety transformation ‚Äî creating a resilient safety culture Current status We currently have two operations at different stages of safety maturity: BRPM, which is a mature well-established operation, and Styldrift I, our growth project, which is currently under construction.

Our Board has overall responsibility and oversight for stakeholder relationships. It delegates some of this responsibility but remains responsible for certain relationships. Because of the importance of stakeholder engagement and responsiveness to RBPlat in 2015 it had the second highest residual risk ranking (in 2014 it was our highest ranking risk) and is recognised as one of our most material issues. The slight reduction in its risk ranking re√Åects the progress we have made with our stakeholder engagement and responsiveness during 2015. Our sustainability framework, which guides our approach to ensuring RBPlat‚Äôs sustainability, includes a stakeholder engagement framework, which provides the organisation with clear guidelines on identifying stakeholders and the engagement process ‚Äî of which we recognise listening is a key element ‚Äî and the need to respond timeously and honestly.

Located immediately south of the Pilanesberg Complex, the RBPlat operations are underlain by rocks of the Lower, Critical and Main Zones of the Rustenburg Layered Suite (RLS), apart from a very small portion of the northern boundary area where rocks of the Pilanesberg Complex occur. The two primary economically favourable stratigraphic horizons of the Western Bushveld Complex, the Merensky Reef and the UG2 Reef, are being exploited by the RBPlat mining operations on the farms of Boschkoppie 104 JQ, Styldrift 90 JQ and Frischgewaagd 96 JQ. Both reef horizons are enriched with base metal sulphides and PGMs of which the Merensky Reef historically has been the most important platinum producing layer in the Western Bushveld Complex. The PGMs consist of platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), iridium (Ir), rhodium (Rh), osmium (Os) and ruthenium (Ru). Also extracted are copper (Cu), nickel (Ni) and gold (Au). RBPlat mineral resource summary RBPlat has a 67% attributable to interest in the BRPM JV Mineral resource that comprises the Merensky and UG2 reefs which underlie the properties of Boschkoppie 104 JQ and Styldrift 90 JQ, and speci√Äc portions of Frischgewaagd 96 JQ. The attributable resources and reserves as at 31 December 2015 are summarised in Table 1 and Table 2. Figure 1 :estern Bushveld Igneous Comple[ and relative location of RBPlat¬∑s operations Total Merensky and UG2 inclusive mineral resources attributable to RBPlat amounts to 241.79Mt with a 4E ounce content of 47.10Moz at a grade of 6.06g/t (4E). The Merensky Reef contributes 106.86Mt with a 4E ounce content of 25.01Moz at a grade of 7.28g/t. The UG2 mineral resource consists of 134.93Mt with a 4E ounce content of 22.09Moz at a grade of 5.09g/t. Reporting of the resources is in accordance with and compliant with the SAMREC Code. 119 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 Table 1: Inclusive mineral resources, RBPlat‚Äôs 67% attributable interest (31 December 2015) Tonnes 4E grade Contained 4E Resource (Mt) (g/t) (Moz) 5HHIW\SH FODVVL√ÄFDWLRQ 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Merensky All 106.86 108.29 7.28 7.38 25.01 25.70 UG2 All 134.93 134.83 5.09 5.11 22.09 22.13 Total 241.79 243.12 6.06 6.12 47.10 47.83 The prill split for the Merensky and UG2 reefs Merensky Reef UG2 Reef 64.59% Pt 59.13% Pt 26.79% Pd 29.32% Pd 4.36% Rh 10.99% Rh 4.26% Au 0.56% Au RBPlat mineral reserves summary Annual comparison indicates a stable inventory with no real change in the Merensky reserves after depletion. The Merensky Reef comprises 6.00Moz at a 4E grade of 4.41g/t. The Merensky mineral reserve tonnage decreased by 1.7% from 43.07Mt to 42.35Mt due to depletion, and the 4E ounces content decreased by 1.3% from 6.08Moz to 6.00Moz. The UG2 Reef comprises 4.84Moz at a 4E grade of 3.82g/t. The UG2 mineral reserves tonnage increased by 6% from 37.14Mt to 39.40Mt, and the 4E ounce content increased by 6% from 4.58Moz to 4.84Moz (Table 2). The increase in reserves after depletion is attributable to the inclusion of UG2 resources not previously converted to reserves. Reporting of the reserves is in accordance with and compliant with the SAMREC Code.

Presentation of the annual √Änancial statements At the AGM, the directors must, in terms of the MOI, the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements, present to shareholders the annual √Änancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015. 2. Election and re-election of directors (ordinary resolutions numbers 1 to 4) In accordance with the MOI and the JSE Listings Requirements, one third of the non-executive directors (being those longest in of√Äce at the date of the AGM) must retire by rotation and directors appointed by the Board during the year must at each AGM offer themselves for re-election and election, respectively. Ordinary resolutions 1 to 4 are proposed to re-elect the directors who retire as directors of the Company by rotation in accordance with the MOI and who, being eligible for re-election, offer themselves for re-election. A brief biography of the directors offering themselves for re-election is contained on page 36 of the integrated report and the Company‚Äôs website www.bafokengplatinum.co.za. The Board, with the assistance of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, has reviewed the composition and performance of the Board in accordance with corporate governance guidelines and transformation requirements and has recommended the re-election of the directors offering themselves for re-election. 3. Reappointment of the independent auditor (ordinary resolution number 5) Following a formal governance process, PricewaterhouseCoopers have agreed to their reappointment and as such the reappointment has been endorsed and is recommended by the Board as the independent external auditors in terms of the Company‚Äôs MOI and the Act. The Audit and Risk Committee of the Company has assessed the appointment process and independence of the external auditors and is satis√Äed that no governance guidelines have been breached and that they have complied with the provisions of the Act. A non-audit service policy is in place to ensure the independence of the external auditors is maintained. Ordinary resolution number 5 is therefore proposed to approve the appointment of PwC as the external auditors of the Company and to appoint Sizwe Masondo as the designated auditor of the Company. 137 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 4.

Ordinary resolutions numbered 6 to 9 are therefore proposed to re-elect Audit and Risk Committee members in terms of section 94(2) of the Act and the King Code. For further details regarding the Audit and Risk Committee, please refer to page 28 of this integrated report. A brief biography of the committee members offering themselves for election can be found on page 36 of the integrated report and the online integrated report. 5. General authority for directors to allot and issue ordinary shares (ordinary resolution number 10) In terms of the MOI, the Company is authorised to issue the shares speci√Äed in Schedule 1 of the MOI, provided that, if required by the Act or the JSE Listings Requirements, the Company may only issue unissued shares to shareholders of a particular class of shares, pro rata, to the shareholders‚Äô existing shareholding, unless any such shares were issued for an acquisition of assets. Ordinary resolution number 10 is proposed, to the extent required by the Act or the JSE Listings Requirements, to grant the Board the general authority to issue up to 5% (√Äve percent) of its shares on a non-pro rata basis (in addition to its authority to issue shares in terms of ordinary resolution number 10 and its existing authorities to issue shares under its employee share/option schemes) or to issue shares on a non-pro rata basis for an acquisition of assets). The authority will be subject to the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements. 6. Issue of shares for cash (ordinary resolution number 11) In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, a general authority for the directors to issue shares for cash requires shareholder approval. The directors also require approval in terms of the MOI to issue shares for cash on a non-pro rata basis. The existing authority granted by the shareholders at the previous AGM held on 14 April 2015 expires at the AGM to be held on Wednesday, 13 April 2016, unless renewed. The Board has decided to seek renewal of this authority in accordance with best practice. The authority will be subject to the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements. 7. Approval of remuneration policy (ordinary resolution number 12) In terms of the King III recommendations, shareholders should annually, through a non-binding advisory vote, endorse the Company‚Äôs remuneration policy at the AGM, allowing shareholders to express their views on the remuneration policies adopted and the implementation thereof. Ordinary resolution number 12 is proposed to consider and approve, by way of a non-binding advisory vote, the remuneration policy of the Company, as set out in the Remuneration report on pages 32 to 35 of the integrated report as recommended by King III. 138 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 Notice of Annual General Meeting continued 8. Approval of RBPlat harmonised employee incentive scheme rules (ordinary resolution number 13) The purpose of the new RBPlat harmonised employee incentive scheme rules (scheme rules) is to ensure that a uniform set of rules is applied by the Company to all underlying employee incentive schemes, being the share option scheme, the bonus share plan, the forfeitable share plan, the retention plan, the minimum shareholding scheme (which is subject to the approval of ordinary resolution number 13 by shareholders) and any other employee incentive scheme as may be introduced by the Board and which has been duly approved by shareholders and that the Board is given greater √Åexibility in establishing the criteria for granting and vesting of incentive awards in terms of the scheme rules that take into account the prevailing and/or changing market conditions. The scheme rules comply with the requirements of section 97 of the Act. A copy of the scheme rules will be tabled at the AGM and is available for inspection during normal business hours at the Company‚Äôs registered of√Äce or on the Company website (www.bafokengplatinum.co.za). Summary of the principal terms of the scheme rules Introduction The Board of Directors of the Company is recommending to shareholders to approve the scheme rules. The scheme rules will be known as the RBPlat employee incentive scheme rules. The underlying employee incentive schemes would be subject to the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be allotted and issued in terms of ordinary resolution number 14 also to be approved by shareholders. The objective of the underlying employee incentive schemes remains to drive longer-term focus on operational and business results, and to retain key operational employees for continuity and to maintain a stable environment. The scheme rules have been prepared in accordance with Schedule 14 of the JSE Listings Requirements and any amendments would also comply with the necessary requirements. The key features and salient terms of the scheme rules are set out below. Governance The Board, through the Remuneration and Nomination Committee (Remco), shall be responsible for the administration and participation of the underlying employee incentive schemes. Shares that may be allocated under any of the underlying employee incentive schemes would continue to be allocated from the authorised but unissued shares of the Company or purchased on the market to satisfy the requirements of the underlying employee incentive schemes, subject to the approval by shareholders of ordinary resolution numbers 13 and 14. Plan and individual limits The aggregate number of shares that may be allocated under the underlying employee incentive schemes, together with any other plan adopted by the Company, is 19 372 637 (nineteen million three hundred and seventy-two thousand six hundred and thirty-seven) and the maximum number of shares to be allocated to any one participant in respect of all unvested and unreleased shares allocated in terms of any of the underlying employee incentive schemes shall not exceed the individual limits stipulated in Annexure A of the scheme rules. The aggregate number of shares and the individual limits equate to 10% (ten percent) and 1% (one percent) of the issued share capital of the Company, respectively, as at 31 March 2016. The aforesaid number of shares that may be utilised for the scheme as a whole will be adjusted in such a manner as the Board may determine to be appropriate in the event of a subdivision or consolidation of shares in the capital of the Company. Furthermore, in the event of a capitalisation issue, as special dividend, a rights issue or reduction of capital the number of equity securities that may be utilised per participant will be adjusted in such a manner as the Board may determine to be appropriate. In making such determination, the Board shall ensure that a participant is entitled to receive the same proportion of the equity capital to which he was previously entitled. (OLJLELOLW\ Any qualifying employee in the full time employ of the companies within the Group as selected by Remco may participate in the underlying employee incentive schemes, as de√Äned in the scheme rules. Remco will establish the criteria for the grant of incentive awards (being an award of options, shares or cash in terms of a participation notice delivered to the employee) which criteria will be aligned with the strategic objectives of the Company, and shall include the aim of incentivising the participants for good performance, retaining critical skills for business continuity and contributing to the continued growth of the Company with a long-term horizon. 0HWKRGRISDUWLFLSDWLRQ Incentive awards under the underlying employee incentive schemes are made when Remco determines it to be appropriate, but will normally be made once in a √Änancial year, and are subject to Remco‚Äôs discretion. Under the scheme rules, vesting dates will be aligned with a longer-term focus but will not exceed a seven-year period per vesting of incentive awards. Vesting of incentive awards will be conditional upon achievement of performance conditions and/or such criteria as determined by the Board. 139 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 Incentive awards may be subject to reduction or forfeiture if the performance criteria are not met. The performance targets will be determined by the Board to create direct alignment with the shareholder expectations and the Company strategy. If the employment of a participant terminates as a result of a no-fault termination (for example, as a result of illness, retirement, dismissal for operational requirements, the undertaking of which he is a part ceasing to be part of the Group etc), then the vesting dates shall be accelerated to the date upon which the participant ceases to be a qualifying employee and, except where the Board directs otherwise, any unexercised incentive award will become exercisable immediately. In the event of the death of an employee the vesting dates are accelerated and his heirs or executors will receive an amount equal to the value of the incentive award. If the employment of a participant with any member of the Group terminates before the vesting date of any tranche/portion/whole of the incentive award for any reason other than those stipulated above, then the incentive award shall immediately be forfeited by the participant, unless the Board decides otherwise. General provisions No consideration shall be payable by the participant to receive an incentive award or on the vesting of such award, except when exercising options at the option price under the share option scheme. Any additional allotted scheme shares and any shares awarded to participation in any scheme adopted by the Company from time to time, which are not subsequently issued to the identi√Äed participant/s for example as a result of forfeiture, will revert back to the scheme. Scheme shares held by or under any of the underlying employee incentive schemes shall not have their votes at general or annual general meetings of the Company taken into account for the purposes of resolutions proposed in terms of the Listings Requirements nor for purposes of determining categorisations as detailed in Section 9 of the Listings Requirements. Adjustments may be made to the rights of participants if the Company undertakes or undergoes a subdivision or consolidation rights offer, a bonus or capitalisation issue or reduction of capital, in terms of the scheme rules. Adjustments must be determined to be fair and reasonable to participants by Remco and the Company‚Äôs auditors. The auditors must con√Ärm to the JSE that such adjustments have been made in accordance with the provisions of the scheme in terms of the Listings Requirements. In the event of a change in control of the Company, Remco may accelerate the vesting dates to a date upon which the offer becomes unconditional. Shares issued as consideration for an acquisition, the issue of shares for cash and the issue of shares for a vendor consideration placing will not be regarded as a circumstance requiring adjustment. A summary of adjustment made in accordance with the provisions of the scheme rules in respect of shares must be reported in the annual √Änancial statements of the Group in the year during which the adjustments are undertaken. A participant's incentive award will have full shareholding rights, including voting and dividend rights, only after the shares awarded have vested, or in the case of an option, the option has been exercised by the participant and the incentive award have been registered in the participant's name. Upon liquidation of the Company, the liquidator of the Company shall have the discretion to accelerate the relevant vesting dates to a date determined by the liquidator and to issue or purchase an incentive award in accordance with the vesting rules of the underlying employee incentive scheme. Amendments to certain signi√Äcant elements of the scheme rules are subject to shareholder approval by a 75% (seventy √Äve percent) majority. 9. Approval of scheme shares (ordinary resolution number 14) Shareholders at the AGM held on 17 April 2013 had previously approved that 9 932 884 (nine million nine hundred and thirty-two thousand eight hundred and eighty-four) ordinary shares 6% (six percent) of issued share capital at the time) be set aside for purposes of all RBPlat employee share incentive schemes, excluding any broadbased empowerment schemes. Following the increase in the ordinary issued share capital since the rights offer and accelerated bookbuild in 2014, the Company wishes to increase the number of shares which may be issued in terms of the employee share schemes (and presuming that ordinary resolution number 14 is adopted) to 11 623 582 (eleven million six hundred and twenty-three thousand √Äve hundred and eighty-two) ordinary shares which remains at 6% (six percent) of the issued share capital as at 31 December 2015 being 193 726 374 (one hundred and ninety-three million seven hundred and twenty-six thousand three hundred and seventy-four) ordinary shares. 140 Royal Bafokeng Platinum Integrated Report 2015 Notice of Annual General Meeting continued The reserved shares would allow the Company √Åexibility to allocate such additional number of shares to such share schemes as deemed √Ät and appropriate in terms of the scheme rules. In terms of the JSE Listings Requirements, any increase in the number of shares which may be issued under a company‚Äôs employee share or incentive schemes must be approved by at least 75% of the votes cast by all securities holders present or represented by proxy at the AGM. 10. Financial assistance to related and inter-related parties (special resolution number 1) In terms of section 45 of the Act, shareholders are required to approve, by way of a special resolution, any director or related or inter-related party loans. Given that such √Änancial assistance exists between the companies within the Group and may be required in future, shareholders are requested to consider and grant such general authority, which shall be renewed every 2 (two) years. The purpose of this special resolution is to grant the directors of the Company the authority to authorise the Company to provide direct or indirect √Änancial assistance as contemplated in section 45 of the Act to any one or more related or inter-related companies within the Group. 11. General authority to repurchase shares (special resolution number 2) The effect of special resolution number 2 and the reason for this resolution is to grant the Company or any of its subsidiaries a general approval in terms of the MOI, the Act and the JSE Listings Requirements, to acquire the Company‚Äôs shares, which general approval shall be valid until the earlier of such next AGM of the Company or its variation or revocation of such general authority by special resolution at any subsequent general meeting of the Company, provided that the general authority shall not extend beyond 15 (√Äfteen) months from the date of this AGM. The directors are of the opinion that it would be in the best interests of the Company to approve this general authority and thereby allow the Company or any of its subsidiaries to be in a position to repurchase the securities issued by the Company through the order book of the JSE, should the market conditions, tax dispensation and price justify such an action. 12. Non-executive directors‚Äô fees (special resolution number 3) In terms of King III and the Act, the shareholders of the Company are required to approve by special resolution the fees to be paid to non-executive directors. Please see the Remuneration report on page 65 for additional information on non-executive director fees. The Board believes that the proposed fees are competitive enough and will enable the Company to retain and attract people of the calibre required to make a meaningful contribution to the Company, having regard to the appropriate capability, skills and experience required. The Board, on the recommendation of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee, recommends to shareholders that these fees be approved. Statutory disclosure Proxies In terms of section 58 of the Act, a shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM is entitled to appoint a proxy or two or more proxies to attend, participate in and vote at the meeting in place of the shareholder.
