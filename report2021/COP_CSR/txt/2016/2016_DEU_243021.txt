In this context VS has with its membership of the UNGC set itself one climate goal: to reduce its CO2 emissions in relation to sales by 2015 by 30%.

Thereafter a period of so-called secondary labor market access applies. During this period, refugees can only take on work if there is no suitable candidate with a German or EU passport for this job. This is monitored by the responsible Aliens Oﬃce (Ausländerbehörde) and employment agency. Persons entitled to political asylum and recognized refugees also receive a work permit along with their residence permit. There are further statutory provisions in place: Refugees may not be placed with temporary employment agencies in the ﬁrst four years of their residence in Germany and may not be employed for dumping wages. Therefore, refugees are by no means “cheap competition” to the native workforce. For VS this means that refugees are placed in the appropriate wage group in accordance with the currently valid wage and salary table.

In addition, a modern consumption-dependent plant automation facility was built which among other things controls the cogeneration unit in such a way that the total amount of electricity generated by the cogeneration unit is consumed by VS and not fed into the external public power grid. This automation facility is supplemented by a building services management system module which can control heat consumers in accordance with demand.

The slight increase in CO2 emissions compared with the previous year instead of a further reduction to the VS climate goal of 37.8 t CO2 per 1 million euros sales can be attributed above all to the fact that a new assembly works (works 6 + hall 6) was commissioned, but the cogeneration unit only started running in October with the result that the effect of a more favorable CO2 balance of gas in relation to electricity is not yet showing for the period under review of one whole year.
