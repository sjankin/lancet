In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication. Sincerely yours, Bernard Deryckere 2. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIONS Human Rights  Alpro has its own Code of Ethics which is trained and complied with in the whole organization. Any complaints or concerns are reported through the usual hierarchical escalation or via local hotlines (per country).  Alpro also has a company-specific Ethical Charter based on the ten principles of United Nations Global Compact. This covers all ethical issues concerning people (labor circumstances, workers' health and housing, child labor) planet and performance. All our suppliers are requested to sign the Charter. Alpro’s Ethical Charter is checked at supplier’s level during regular or ad hoc quality audit visits on site.  Alpro also favors long term relationships with farmers around the globe. This gives these farmers a measure of stability, also protecting them from the negative consequences of a single crop failure.  All our soybeans (main ingredient) are ProTerra certified. Proterra certification is a label for ecologically sustainable, social responsible and non-GMO sourced soybeans, based on the Basel criteria and developed by the World Wildlife Fund and COP Switzerland. The ProTerra standard is audited and certified on a yearly basis by an independent Accredited Certification Body.  Alpro is conducting feasibility studies and gap analysis’s to examine the possibility to expand sustainable, independent certification (ProTerra or other standard) to other strategic crops, such as almonds, coconuts and rice. Labour  Alpro complies with applicable laws on labour, and we assure the same for our suppliers through the Ethical Charter. Our Code of Ethics includes the elimination of discrimination. We have work councils or equivalents in place in all our different entities. All employees comply with the labour regulations. Furthermore we have specific HR related policies, shared and trained within organization.  Alpro pays great attention to the safety, health and well-being of every employee (e.g. ergonomics,...). Thorough trainings, attention to safety, various sports initiatives, “quit smoking” and nutrition advice... strengthen Alpro’s DNA in sustainability.  Alpro has a Committee for Safety and Health and Welfare of the Staff that is being informed by the Prevention advisor about the yearly Action Plan for Security, with monthly monitoring of safety measures and strict reporting of all accidents (including root cause analysis, prevention measures, etc. ..)  We have a “Healthy Alpro team” that organizes sportingand health activities for our employees.  Extralegal benefits are offered through group insurance for retirement / disability / death, accidents besides additional / alternative forms of remuneration such as bonus plans, meal vouchers, company cars, expenses, etc.  Trainings and coaching on different levels are made available for our employees. Environment Please use the box below to describe actions your company has taken in the area of environment. Examples include:  Alpro has published a new SD Report in 2015; presenting our new Sustainable Strategy 2020. We have built a strong strategic portfolio of SD projects in three essential domains: healthy food, sustainable food and profitable growth. Under these 3 pillars we have created goals for several important focus points, such as energy & carbon, water, sustainable sourcing,… Achieving these goals will make an active contribution to several of the Sustainable Development Goals.  For Alpro, the biggest opportunity in having a real impact on sustainable development, it’s influencing consumers to make more sustainable food choices. Simply by adding low-impact plant-based variety to their diet, consumers can significantly reduce their ecological footprint (‘climate positive approach’). This is why Alpro is also actively promoting a healthy plant-based diet.  WWF and Alpro have created a long-term, multi-program and strategic partnership around the huge societal challenge of the transition to healthier and more sustainable food system. This is linked to the core mission of both WWF and Alpro. It is implemented through different programs in Belgium and in the UK, based on two big schemes: Energy & Climate and Sustainable Diets. o Energy & Climate  WWF Climate Savers (BE & International): a programme that seeks to transform businesses into leaders of the low-carbon economy. Alpro, as one of the 1st food and beverages companies worldwide to join the programme, has committed to set science-based targets for carbon. o Sustainable diets  Sustainable Food Strategy WWF-Belgium: A joint seminar, “The Food Challenge: sustainability on our plates”, was a first important step in the development of this strategy.  Green Ambassadors (UK): Working on sustainable food in schools, empowering the younger generation.  Plant-Based Coalition (UK): Organising a multi-stakeholder platform on research, communication and advocacy about plant-based eating.  Alpro has effective emergency procedures to prevent and deal with industrial accidents affecting humans and the environment. Anti-Corruption Please use the box below to describe actions your company has taken to fight corruption. Examples include:  Alpro has its own Code of Ethics which is trained and complied with in the whole organization with specific attention for the UK Bribery Act.  The FCPA (Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (United States)) is applicable for Alpro as a part of the WhiteWave Foods Company.  All key leaders within Alpro have to fill in a compliant questionnaire as well as all distributors. Furthermore we organize traininging of key leaders and management team.  Alpro also has a company-specific Ethical Charter based on the ten principles of United Nations Global Compact. This also covers anti-corruption. 3. MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES  Management level: o We have KPI’s in place through Balanced Scorecards on management level for people, planet and profit indicators (accidents, safety and voluntary leaves, CO2, waste, water…) with yearly review. o Our books and accounts are subjected to statutory external audit annually. These audits are used as one of the methods of identifying any suspicious payments which could be related to bribery or corrupt behavior.
