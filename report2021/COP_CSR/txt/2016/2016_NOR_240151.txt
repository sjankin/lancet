We conduct a materiality analysis to prioritize reporting on aspects that are material to us and our stakeholders, communicate Cermaq’s sustainability impact, and to select indicators for more frequent follow-up. Our starting point is to report on topics where we have the largest impact and where stakeholder request for information is high. Determining materiality In deﬁning material interests, Cermaq identiﬁes its economic, social and environmental impacts and identiﬁes the aspects that have the greatest inﬂuence on stakeholder assessment and decisions. The aspects identiﬁed as material both to Cermaq and to Cermaq’s stakeholders provide the basis for the selection of indicators that we measure our performance against. A part of the process is furthermore to identify material indicators that should have targets – for measuring and improving performance over time. These form the basis of our sustainability reporting and the results are presented in our integrated annual report. The materiality assessment is subject to an annual review by our sustainability functional team to ensure that we report on material aspects and measure our performance against the right indicators. At certain intervals, we perform a thorough stakeholder analysis to inform our materiality assessment process. In 2014, all business units were involved in a revisit of the matrix to assess the material aspects in our operations. An internal review was conducted and feedback included from external stakeholders based on meetings, dialogue, public debate and public reports in the regions in which the Group operates. In 2013, Cermaq invited all its external stakeholders (e.g. shareholders, NGOs, local communities, media, and analysts) to participate in a survey and perform a ranking of 32 sustainability aspects. The stakeholder https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/materiality-analisys 1/4 CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 3 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Materiality Analysis response is incorporated in the materiality analysis below. As a part of the implementation of Cermaq’s new strategy starting in 2016, the sustainability strategy will be developed to further support the business strategy. Materiality will continue to be a central aspect going forward. The indicators for the aspects with signiﬁcant impact from an internal perspective should be subject to quarterly follow-up of progress when relevant. MATERIALITY ANALYSIS 2015: CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 4 https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/materiality-analisys 2/4 Signiﬁcance of impact: Cermaq's assessment of signiﬁcant economic, environmental and social impact from its operations Importance to stakeholders: Topics that substantially inﬂuence the assessment and decisions by stakeholder groups related to Cermaq's operations From the ﬁgure it can be seen that some of the topcis most important to Cermaq are also material to our stakeholders. We are reporting on indicators within all these topics, and Cermaq has in addition developed industry speciﬁc indicators relevant for our ﬁsh farming operations. Our stakeholder survey showed that some aspects are ranked as very important to some stakeholders. For some of these aspects, where we have available data, we are publishing information to meet the request or concerns of these speciﬁc stakeholder groups. It is Cermaq’s ambition that its integrated annual report will enhance transparency and the constructive dialogue between Cermaq and its stakeholders. RESPONSIBILITY A draft of the materiality analysis is provided by the administration each year in tight cooperation and dialogue with operating companies in the diﬀerent regions. The analysis is prepared by Cermaq’s Sustainability Functional Team, with representatives from each region within relevant disciplines. The materiality analysis is subject to ﬁnal approval from the Central Management team. The operational responsibility for ensuring sustainable business practice ultimately lies with the Managing Director for each of the operations owned by Cermaq. The Board of Directors holds the overall responsibility to ensure that necessary systems and procedures are in place. FOLLOW-UP OF PERFORMANCE Monitoring and follow-up of sustainability performance is conducted at both local and corporate levels. A set of sustainability KPIs are reported and evaluated monthly by the Central Management team. Each quarter, the Local and Central Management as well as the Board of Directors receive a comprehensive sustainability report and assess the organization’s sustainability performance. For the material indicators, Cermaq has set yearly targets and the performance is evaluated in accordance with established risk management procedures. Corrective actions are taken for indicators which deviate from the set targets. https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/materiality-analisys 3/4 CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 5 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Materiality Analysis Material aspects The following aspects are evaluated as the most important: Customer Health and Safety, Occupational Health and Safety (OHS), Fish health and welfare, Sea lice management, Medicine use, Fish escape prevention, Sustainable feed ingredients, Local communities, Economic performance, Biodiversity, Management standards, Feed sourcing & supplier assessment, Benthic impact in sea, Anti-corruption and Compliance. These topics are explained in further detail in the Management Approach. We also report on additional aspects to meet the request for information from some stakeholder groups. These aspects are: Market presence, Energy, Emissions, Product and services, Training and education, Indigenous rights, Child labor and Human rights assessment. Aspect boundaries ASPECT BOUNDARIES WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION All the material aspects listed above as material are material to the whole organization except for Cermaq Group AS that is not involved in ﬁsh farming in an operational way. Other aspects where we report on selected indicators: Human rights assessment is relevant mainly to our Chilean operations and this is the only area that has been raised as a concern from speciﬁc stakeholders. The same is the case for the indicator Minimum wage level (Market presence) where concerns have been raised in earlier years about the wage level at processing plants in Chile. ASPECT BOUNDARIES OUTSIDE THE ORGANIZATION The following material aspects are material outside the organization: Sustainable Feed Ingredients, Biodiversity, Local Communities, Anti-corruption, Occupational Health and Safety, Customer Health and Safety, Feed Sourcing and Supplier Assessment, and Compliance. The aspects are material for suppliers in all the regions we operate. As explained above, we report on additional aspects to meet the request for information from some stakeholder groups. The indicators selected within these aspects are also material outside the organization: Market presence, Energy, Emissions, Product and services, Training and education, Indigenous rights, Child labor and Human rights assessment. CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 6 https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/materiality-analisys 4/4 Stakeholder dialogue Our stakeholders show strong interest in Cermaq's sustainability performance. We remain open to dialogue with stakeholders who are directly involved with or impacted by our industry or who constructively engage in seeking industry improvements. Stakeholder engagement activities are carried out both at local and the corporate level in Cermaq, and our aim is to engage in constructive dialogue based on respect and transparency. Approach to stakeholder engagement Identiﬁcation of stakeholders for engagement Cermaq’s approach to stakeholder engagement is to concentrate on entities or individuals that can reasonably be expected to be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the organization’s activities, products, and/or services; and whose actions can reasonably be expected to aﬀect the ability of the organization to successfully implement its strategies and achieve its objectives. Stakeholders may have rights under national laws as well as under international conventions. Important international conventions related to indigenous rights are ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Other central conventions include the eight ILO core conventions of the Declaration of Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights, including the right to freedom of association, collective bargaining and human rights. https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/stakeholders-annual-report 1/7 CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 7 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Stakeholder dialogue Our approach to stakeholder engagement Dialogue with employees is continuous, through well-established local management structures and practices. Employee relations are comprehensibly regulated by law and agreement in the countries in which Cermaq operates. Cermaq applies one set of standards and values across its operations. The competence, engagement and eﬀorts of all employees are crucial to the success of Cermaq’s business. Cermaq’s relations with its employees and unions are described in more detail in G4 10-12. Customers include seafood wholesalers, processors and retailers in the main salmon markets. The sales organization in each local Cermaq company works directly with their customer in export markets. Transparent reporting is a useful instrument in Cermaq’s customer relations. Dialogue with customers is based in Cermaq’s ambition to be a preferred supplier for its customer. Regulators and politicians are stakeholders at the local, regional and national levels who deﬁne the framework conditions for the industry. Cermaq believes transparent dialogue is a prerequisite for arriving at good and balanced decisions. Cermaq actively reaches out to authorities and is always meeting requests for dialogue or information. The company will continue to prioritise the dialogue with authorities and politicians, in all the countries Cermaq operates, describing the performance of and challenges to the industry. Local communities are important to ensure acceptance for Cermaq’s local operations, support for future growth and recruitment of employees. Cermaq contributes to local activity and employment and is a reliable partner for the local communities in which it operates. Dialogues with local communities are addressed mainly through the local stakeholder groups described above. Suppliers include our main feed supplier EWOS, which is as of 2015, the most important supplier in terms of total value of purchase. Following the sale of EWOS, Cermaq is building internal competence as feed purchaser. In 2015, Cermaq launched a Supplier Code of Conduct and a policy for feed suppliers stating detailed sustainability requirements. Other main suppliers include suppliers of technical equipment and transport as well as local suppliers of goods and services. The local Cermaq companies maintain contact with their suppliers with frequency adapted to the needs. The NGO community is diverse and Cermaq is selectively concentrating on those NGOs that seek constructive improvements in the industry. This includes wide groups of environmental organisations, labour organisation and NGOs dedicated to other relevant topics. Cermaq reaches out to these groups when arranging sustainability seminars, take direct contact for regular updates and when speciﬁc events occur. NGOs can provide positive input giving the company a broader perspective and Insight.

The First Nations of British Columbia, Canada, have special titles and rights under Canadian laws and legislation. It is important for the Group to be aware of potential challenges its operations might represent, and Cermaq acknowledges First Nations as important stakeholders. Cermaq has participated in several conferences on First Nation relations. The main priority has been Ahousath First Nation with whom Cermaq has a protocol agreement and also dialogue with other First Nations in the territories in which the company operates. Mutually beneﬁcial agreements with indigenous people in BC, Canada is a strong foundation for Cermaq’s operations in areas where indigenous peoples’ rights are aﬀected by its operations. In Chile, Cermaq is engaged in several activities with indigenous groups. One example is Liquiñe, Panguipulli, in the region of Los Rios, where Cermaq Chile has conducted skills training sessions to support the participants in ﬁnding employment, improving small business or changing their line of work. Cermaq sees industry associations necessary for ensuring the framework conditions for the aquaculture industry. Thus, Cermaq is actively participating in the industry association, normally represented by senior executives in the board of the association. In 2015, Cermaq’s CEO was co-chair of the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI), and Cermaq had representation in the board of Salmon Chile, BCSFA (Canada), CAIA (Canada), and Sjømat Norge (Norwegian Seafood Federation). Although Cermaq now is 100 percent owned by Mitsubishi Corporation, Cermaq still deﬁnes providers of capital a stakeholder group. Financial institutions also approach Cermaq on topics related to speciﬁc sustainability concerns, and Cermaq strives to meet the needs for information and clariﬁcation. As in previous years, Cermaq submitted a report in 2015 to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), providing information on Cermaq's carbon emissions and the assessment of climate change risks and opportunities. Key topics Key topics in our stakeholder dialogue Stakeholder dialogue which takes place in both structured and unstructured ways plays an important role in our reporting. In addition to our owner, our key stakeholder groups include customers, employees, regulators and politicians, local communities, suppliers, NGOs, unions, indigenous peoples, and industry associations. Some key topics discussed in our stakeholder dialogue in 2015 are presented below.

Canada also posts information about our operations and on e.g. sea lice, wildlife interactions and any ﬁsh escapes on products its website to ensure easy access and transparency. Local Local community Social acceptance of aquaculture is important to Cermaq communities concern about Canada. This acceptance varies in the communities where we aquaculture impacts operate and needs to improve. Cermaq Canada is continually ﬁnding better ways to connect with our stakeholders. One of these ways is by supporting community activities. In 2015 we further increased our sponsorships which focused on sports teams, health fundraiser events, educational development, and ocean sciences.

A central element in Cermaq’s management approach is the risk assessment of sustainability challenges and opportunities to the business provided in the Cermaq Materiality Matrix. What is seen as material for Cermaq covers various aspects: external drivers, resources used by the company, our strategy and business model, how Cermaq impacts the environment and society, and the ﬁnancial input and output of the organization. The interconnection and interdependency between the resources used by the company and its relationships with its stakeholders, is critical to Cermaq’s value creation. Consequently our report aims to present the impact of the ﬁnancial aspects on the non-ﬁnancial aspects and vice versa. For each material topic presented, the materiality of each topic for the company is described together with the view of our stakeholders and, how each topic is managed and an evaluation of the management approach. Cermaq has company and industry speciﬁc indicators in place in addition to the GRI aspects. Our approach https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/management-approach 1/21 CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 14 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Management Approach Cermaq has company and industry speciﬁc indicators in place in addition to the GRI aspects. Our approach to both categories of topics is presented below. Economic aspects ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WHY IT IS MATERIAL This topic is material to Cermaq since Cermaq's purpose is to create value for its owner, employees and society in general through sustainable aquaculture. Economic performance is the foundation for the ﬁnancing of the company as well as for being an attractive employer and responsible community partner. Cermaq's Core Values constitute guidelines for desired attitudes on individual, company and group level, to achieve long term value creation. A sound economic performance is a premise for reaching our goals and contributing to sustainable aquaculture on a long term basis. WHAT WE DO Cermaq’s strategy lays the basis for the company’s value creation and long term performance. The Board of Directors has set Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for the economic performance, and monthly ﬁnancial reports are presented to the Board of Directors. Also the bonus systems for senior management and for all employees include economic performance of the Company. Reﬂecting a new business context for Cermaq, in 2015, a new strategy was developed which will enter into force from 2016. Our management systems including the KPIs will be revised in the coming year to incorporate the new strategic direction. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE The annual report is the primary source for information about our economic performance, where the results are presented in the annual accounts and the Board’s assessment of the results is presented in the Board of Directors report. The annual report is available online on Cermaq’s web site. As a fully owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corporation since 2014, Cermaq is not a listed company.

Treatment against sea lice may also impact other organisms in the sea. All diseases in farmed ﬁsh originate from wild ﬁsh and may cause mortality. In the wild, these pathogens are less likely to cause illness as the wild salmon is far less concentrated. Some disease can be treated with medicine, but disease caused by viruses cannot be treated with medicine and in some rare cases, may require harvest of the stock. WHAT WE DO Fish health depends highly on ﬁsh welfare. Keeping the ﬁsh in good condition, in a favourable location, is therefore a key element in Cermaq´s preventive ﬁsh health management. In our operations, we pay great attention to water quality, vaccines, genetics, stress reducing practices (including mapping of stress levels), bio-security, diagnostics, area management, nutrition, and monitoring of pathogens to be able to foresee and avoid outbreaks. As a part of Cermaq’s preventive ﬁsh health strategy, Cermaq may perform ﬁsh cullings when certain pathogens have been detected. In the countries where Cermaq operates the regulations are founded on the framework Aquatic Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Biological knowledge is essential and a core component of our strategy is to carry out research within ﬁsh health and ﬁsh welfare. The Cermaq Fish Health Team consists of ﬁsh health experts and scientists in Norway, Chile and Canada. The team targets ﬁsh welfare and health improvements throughout the production cycle in all three operating regions. Good animal health with no medicine is the optimal situation, and preventive ﬁsh health is Cermaq’s main focus area. Cermaq has developed an antibiotic policy emphasizing a sustainable use of antibiotics. Antibiotics are used only when strictly needed and only upon approval by an authorized veterinarian. Antibiotics listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as critically important for human medicine is not used in our operations. Cermaq is engaged in developing vaccines against SRS, the bacterial disease that is the main reason for use of antibiotics in Chilean ﬁsh farming. All treatments against sea lice is done after protocol and with an evaluation of the eﬃciency of the treatment. Bath treatments can pose a risk situation for escapes and the company performs training on empty pens to ensure that such operations can be managed successfully. In addition to implementing ﬁsh health measures in our own operations, a key success factor is industry cooperation. Through our membership in Global Salmon Initiative and our strategy of entering into Area Management Agreements with other farmers, Cermaq is committed to cooperate and coordinate activities related to all aspects of ﬁsh health and animal welfare. The responsibility for ﬁsh health and ﬁsh welfare is placed with the operational management and is an integral part of daily operations and management. Yearly targets are in place for key indicators such as mortality, sea lice levels and medicine use, and are followed up by local and central management as well as the Board of Directors on a monthly or quarterly basis. An improvement target on morality performance is included in the bonus system for Cermaq employees.

Potential transferCermaq | Management Approach of pathogens from farmed to wild salmon has not been detected, and is a diﬃcult area of research. Farming has an impact on the ﬁsh types used for feed. However, this is not necessarily a threat to the species or the biodiversity. Responsible management of ﬁshery stocks is important for sustainable ﬁsh farming and a central issue for the industry. An increasing share of the ﬁsh feed comes from agriculture, where the impacts on biodiversity mainly is found on species in the vicinity of farm land and in areas of new farm land. Marine proteins and oils are limited resources and hence soy is increasingly used in ﬁsh feed instead of ﬁshmeal. To mitigate risks related to the sustainable use of forests, the soy used in the feed supply chain should come from certiﬁed sources. As an example, Cermaq’s main feed supplier EWOS requires certiﬁcation through ProTerra or Round Table on Sustainable Soy (RTRS) from their soy producers in Brazil, and as a minimum, the raw materials must meet the requirements in the FEFAC Soy Sourcing Guidelines. These standards shall ensure that the soy production does not involve clearing land in vulnerable ecological areas. Fish farming impacts the ﬂora and fauna in the near vicinity of the sea farms. The impact varies depending on a suit of factors such as currents, depth, and type of sea bed. Fallowing of sites after the production cycle ensures that temporary impacts on biodiversity can be reversed. Impact on predators, especially sea mammals and birds, is a concern among some stakeholders. WHAT WE DO Cermaq monitors the benthic impacts of ﬁsh farming, and ensure that requirements for fallowing and/or benthic status are met. Our main feed supplier EWOS has a sourcing practice aiming to ensure that the ﬁsh used in the feed comes from stocks that are not overexploited. In 2014, Cermaq developed a supplier policy that includes requirements for all our suppliers, and in 2015 a code of conduct speciﬁcally for feed suppliers was developed with concrete sustainability requirements. In Norway, Cermaq has been granted green licenses, based on technology and operating principles to reduce the risk of escapes and sea lice. In our operations we seek to deter predators with measures that are not harmful e.g. through selective use of acoustic deterrent devices or predator nets. Impact on wildlife, including birds and mammals, is monitored and reported. As member of the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI), Cermaq has plans in place for certiﬁcation in accordance with the Aquaculture Stewardship Certiﬁcation Standard (ASC) for its farming operations. In 2015, four of our farms in Chile and two farms in Canada received ASC certiﬁcation, and two more sites received certiﬁcation in Chile and one in Norway in January 2016. The coming year a number of our farms are expected to achieve certiﬁcations in line with our GSI commitment. Cermaq is also engaged in local community projects e.g. monitoring the impact from farmed salmon on wild salmon and enhancing the management of wild salmon. In Cermaq, the responsibility for impacts on biodiversity is placed with the operational management and is an integral part of daily operations and management.

Throughout 2015, Cermaq has worked closely with its main feed supplier EWOS on these issues. EWOS has a supplier code of conduct, deﬁning the principles for their purchase of raw materials and requirements to their suppliers. Towards the end of 2015, Cermaq has entered into agreements with other feed suppliers and a feed supplier policy has been developed communicating requirements to e.g. feed ingredients and the feed production process. As a member of the Global Salmon Initiative, Cermaq has set ambitious targets for Aquaculture Stewardship Certiﬁcation (ASC) for its farming operations by 2020, which includes sustainable feed requirements. In 2015, we obtained six certiﬁcations across our global operations. Maximizing the ﬁsh production from the feed is also important for sustainability. The feed use, the feed factor, is monitored continuously and reported as a Key Performance Indicators each month. Cermaq does not use GMO crops as ingredients in the feed in our production in Norway, whereas this is not a requirement in Canada and Chile. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Cermaq’s cooperation with our main feed supplier EWOS is strong and good. In 2015, Cermaq also entered into agreements with Biomar and Skretting, suppliers with established sustainability practices in line with Cermaq expectations. Cermaq has engaged more directly in the feed supply e.g. through the establishment of a Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014 and a speciﬁc policy for feed suppliers in 2015. Cermaq will continue to seek collaboration with its feed suppliers on strengthening sustainability performance. Whereas the focus has been mainly on the marine raw materials in the feed, the increasing share of agricultural ingredients indicates a higher focus on this topic in the coming years. Performance indicator for 2015: EWOS 8 Raw material ingredients COMPLIANCE WHY IT IS MATERIAL Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is material to Cermaq and is a premise for long term value creation. Cermaq's strategy is to cultivate the oceans to produce food for people at the same time as we maintain the future productivity of the same oceans. To meet our strategy, we must at all times be compliant with strict environmental regulations. CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 21 WHAT WE DO https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/management-approach 8/21 compliant with strict environmental regulations. 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Management Approach WHAT WE DO https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/management-approach 8/21 Cermaq’s target is full compliance with environmental laws and regulations. On a monthly basis, all Cermaq operating companies are required to report any pending and closed non-compliances. Non-compliances are reported to the local and central management as well as the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Salmon farming is highly regulated in all regions in which we operate and detailed routines and procedures are in place to ensure that we meet laws and regulations. The responsibility for non-compliances is placed with the operational management. All major acquisitions are subject to due diligence processes, ensuring that any investments will be able to fulﬁl Cermaq’s requirements to compliance, ethical standards and other criteria. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Strengthening our routines and procedures is always an area of improvement and we will continue our eﬀorts in 2016. Performance indicators for 2015: EN 27 Extent of impact mitigation of environmental impacts of products and services EN 29 Monetary value of signiﬁcant ﬁnes and total number of non-monetary sanctions for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations ENERGY Although considered important, energy is not seen as one of the most important aspects in Cermaq’s materiality analysis. One reason is that energy used in salmon farming is signiﬁcantly lower compared to other type of food production such as beef, pork and chicken. In salmon farming, for instance, we do not need to use energy to provide heating for the animals. Salmon adapts to the water temperature. However, some stakeholders are requesting information about energy use since climate change is an important global challenge. To meet these concerns Cermaq reports on relevant indicators where we have available data. Cermaq also reports to the Carbon Disclosure project (CDP). Performance indicators for 2015: EN 3 Energy consumption within the organisation EN 4 Energy consumption outside of the organization EN 5 Energy intensity EN 6 Reduction of energy consumption CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 22 https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/management-approach 9/21 EMISSIONS It is estimated that food production accounts for 25 percent of the global emissions of greenhouse gasses[1]. Consequently what type of food is produced may have an impact on global warming. The results from scientiﬁc studies show that farmed ﬁsh has a relatively low carbon footprint compared to for example beef and pork. Emissions is therefore not considered an area where Cermaq has a signiﬁcant impact, but where ﬁsh farming is rather a part of the solution. Some of our stakeholders are requesting information about our emissions since climate change is an important global challenge. Following the Paris 2015 agreement, energy use and emissions is furthermore considered a central area of interest to an increasing number of stakeholders. Cermaq therefore reports on energy use and emissions indicators where we have available data for 2015. In addition Cermaq reports to the Carbon Disclosure project (CDP).

Non-compliances related to fraud or corruption is subject to criminal laws and regulations and compliance is of great importance to Cermaq. Corruption exists in many forms, and any responsible company needs to be aware of the challenges and take the relevant actions and precautions. Cermaq is located in countries that all score low on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index. However, this does not imply that corruption and bribery does not exist in these countries. Furthermore, we are exposed to other markets that rank high on the corruption index in the supply chain and in our sales markets. WHAT WE DO Transparency about organisational ownership, management and operations is regarded as important to combat corruption. Cermaq reports openly on results in its annual accounts and on operational performance, management and governance on our web site. Guidelines for preventing corruption and enhancing our ethical standards are described in the Cermaq Ethical and Corporate Responsibility guidelines which include instruction of use and access to our Whistle Blower hotline. The responsibility for compliance with applicable laws and regulations is placed with the operational management. In addition, Cermaq has a central legal function that can be consulted by operational management. Guidelines for preventing corruption and enhancing our ethical standards are described in our Ethical and Corporate responsibility guidelines. In 2015, web based anti-corruption training was introduced which will continue in 2016. Participation is decided taking a risk based approach in each operating Company. All major acquisitions are subject to due diligence processes, ensuring that investments will be able to fulﬁl Cermaq’s requirements to compliance, ethical standards and other criteria. In 2013, Transparency International in Norway conducted a survey on the communication of organisational structure, openness about anti-corruption programmes and degree of country-by-country ﬁnancial and organisational data among the 50 largest Norwegian listed companies . Cermaq which was a listed company at that time was ranked as number three in this survey. Although Cermaq is no longer a listed company in Norway, our eﬀorts in managing ethical and corruption risks continue. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Anti-corruption training is ongoing and further needs will be evaluated based on the results and feedback. Policies and procedures are in place to mitigate risks and the anti-corruption work is continuously followed up by Cermaq’s Legal department in cooperation with our operating companies.

Our operations are located in numerous local communities, farming in common waters and dependent on well-functioning relations and partnerships. There are strong and diverse views on salmon farming, and although many local stakeholders are positive to opportunities provided by ﬁsh farming operations, some parts of local communities and some groups in society are advocating against ﬁsh farming. Cermaq recognizes that the Group must demonstrate its respect for the communities and the environment in which it operates. Establishing good relationships based on mutual understanding with the communities where we operate and with stakeholder groups aﬀected by our activities is very important. WHAT WE DO Dialogue, transparency and public sustainability reporting are some of the tools used to demonstrate the quality of our operations. Cermaq’s local managers have a key role in engaging in dialogue and activities with local communities to develop and maintain a strong and positive relation. Cermaq’s management team and Board review any local community complaints in connection with our activities. Complaints reported are typically issues related to transportation, emissions, and smell from some operations. These are followed up by establishing e.g. noise reducing equipment at our facilities and ensuring that any deviations from our procedures are closed. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Cermaq will contribute to local activity and employment and will be a reliable partner for the local communities in which the Group operates. Any material complaint related to the Group’s operations is taken seriously and receives management attention. Cermaq works actively to ensure that our procedures are complied with and that any issues of concern around our sites are managed before there is a reason for a complaint. We reduced the number of complaints from seven in 2013 to ﬁve in 2014. In 2015 we had six complaints in total. We will continue to focus on this important aspect.

INDIGENOUS RIGHTS Although not considered a material aspect on a Group level, Cermaq has a clear goal of fully respecting indigenous rights and working towards achieving good local community relationships. In Canada, our relationship with First Nations communities is of particular importance to our vision of sustainable aquaculture and we strive to develop social, economic, and cultural relationships that are mutually beneﬁcial. Cermaq continued its work in 2015 in managing sustainable ﬁsh aquaculture business in the Aboriginal territories in which we operate in British Columbia. Our goal is to develop partnerships and protocols with First Nations in these areas. Cermaq has signed a protocol with Ahousaht First Nation and our aim is to enter into similar agreements with all Aboriginal groups in whose territory we operate. These protocols will provide beneﬁts for the Aboriginal groups and provide stability for our operations. Cermaq Canada has developed ten principles of First Nations relations which is available on the Cermaq website under Social Sustainability. In Chile, indigenous peoples like Mapuche are present in regions where we operate and many employees from indigenous groups are employed at our facilities. Performance indicator for 2015: HR 8 Total number of incidents of violations involving rights of indigenous peoples and actions taken CHILD LABOUR Cermaq is located in regulated labour markets where child labour is not considered a common challenge, hence child labour is not seen as one of the most important aspects in the materiality analysis. However, because the use of child labour is a very serious crime, and information is requested from some stakeholders, we report on any identiﬁed risks of child labour in our operations or with our suppliers. Performance indicator for 2015: HR5 Operations and suppliers identiﬁed as having signiﬁcant risk for incidents of child labour, and measures taken to contribute to the eﬀective abolition of child Labour CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 26 HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT HUMAN RIGHTS ASSESSMENT 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Management Approach Management of human rights risks in all Cermaq operations and in our supply chain is a priority. Although https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/management-approach 13/21 not considered a material aspect, human rights issues are an integrated part in our local community work, ongoing stakeholder dialogue and risk management processes. In 2015, Cermaq strengthen our work in this area through the establishment of a Supplier Code of Conduct which poses requirements to our suppliers in adherence to internationally recognized human rights. The Supplier Code of Conduct is available on the Cermaq website. This work will build on two external human rights assessments conducted by Cermaq Chile in 2013. In 2016, we will strengthen our work on human rights by conducting case studies and participating in human rights due diligence training organized by the Norwegian OECD contact point. Performance indicator for 2015: HR 9 Total number and percentage of operations that have been subject to human rights reviews or impact assessments COMPLIANCE WHY IT IS MATERIAL Compliance with social laws and regulations is material to Cermaq and critical to our social license to operate. Cermaq’s aim is full compliance with laws and regulations in our areas of operation. WHAT WE DO Cermaq’s operating companies are required to report any pending non-compliances and cases closed on a monthly basis. Any material non-compliances are reported to local and central management as well as the Board of Directors. The regulatory regime varies signiﬁcantly between our countries of operation, and the management of this aspect is hence adjusted to the requirements of each area of operation. The responsibility for non-compliances is placed with the operational management. In addition, Cermaq has a central legal function that can be consulted by operational management. Guidelines for preventing corruption and enhancing our ethical standards are described in our Ethical and Corporate responsibility guidelines. All major acquisitions are subject to due diligence processes, ensuring that investments will be able to fulﬁl Cermaq’s requirements to social compliance, ethical standards and other criteria. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Strengthening our routines and procedures to ensure strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations is always a high priority.

To support management, Cermaq has established an OHS cross border team with regular meetings that seek to share best practices and be a driver for improvements in all regions. Our long term target is zero injuries. In addition we have yearly targets in place for key indicators such as absence rate, Lost time injury rate (LTIR) and Injury frequency rate (TRI) that are followed up by local and central management as well as the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Improvement targets on OHS performance were included in the bonus system for Cermaq employees also in 2015. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE The Lost time injury rate was followed up on a quarterly basis until 2014. Based on previous unsatisfying results, central management increased the reporting frequency to monthly reporting of progress in 2014 and required the implementation of safety measures and training in the diﬀerent regions. This led to greatly improved results in 2014 and the improvement continued in 2015.

Product health and safety impacts are central for consumers and society at large, as all food including farmed ﬁsh may contain undesired substances. Any undesired substances in farmed ﬁsh are typically coming from the feed, mainly ﬁsh oil, but also from agricultural ingredients in the feed. There are also hygienic and sanitary challenges in the processing of ﬁsh and during transport and supply all the way to the ﬁnal consumer which requires adherence to strict quality standards. WHAT WE DO Food production is highly regulated in all regions where we operate. Whereas the food authorities are deﬁning regulations to ensure food safety, Cermaq's operating companies have incorporated management systems with procedures to ensure that all regulations are adhered to. In addition, Cermaq has developed own principles and policies to ensure that Cermaq’s products are of high quality and set strict sustainability standards, e.g. as described in the Cermaq Sustainability Principles. Cermaq works continuously to adhere to strict food safety regulations and to supply safe, healthy and nutritious food to our consumers. Cermaq’s companies have modern traceability systems in place to cover ﬁrst tier traceability. All operating companies are required to be certiﬁed according to the ISO 22000 standard where hazard analysis and critical control points (HAACP) is an integral part. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE On the basis of our management systems, Cermaq works continuously to ensure that we meet the highest standards of product quality and food safety. Our systems shall ensure that all our products supplied to our customers are safe and sustainably produced. Cermaq works to further improve performance and build trust by committing to ASC certiﬁcation of a number of sites by 2020. In addition, our standards will be assessed and renewed with the implementation of the new Cermaq strategy from 2016.

The greatest risk exposures include challenges to ﬁsh health, food safety, production related constraints, and the health, environment and safety of the group's employees and contracting parties. Having robust management systems in place serves to enhance performance and mitigate operational risks in our daily operations, and is hence considered material to Cermaq. WHAT WE DO The group has a policy stipulating that systematic management of operational risk is to be established through management systems that are certiﬁed according to international standards. The standards make requirements with respect to management responsibility, structure, reporting and allocation of responsibility in the organization, regular risk assessment and action plans for on-going improvement, internal and external communication, and the establishment of procedures and operational Controls. The group has deﬁned the most important areas as being Quality (ISO 9001), Environment (ISO 14001), Food Safety (ISO 22000) and Occupational Health and Safety (OHSAS 18001). In all regions these management standards shall be in place and re-certiﬁcation is a management responsibility. In addition to the above standards, additional standards are in place to meet local demand from customers, e.g. Global GAP in Norway; Best Agricultural Practices (BAP) in Canada, Global GAP and BAP in Chile, and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC) in all regions. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Evaluation of which management systems are best suited for our business is a continuous process. As part of Cermaq’s Global Salmon Initiative (GSI) engagement, we committed ourselves in 2013 to work towards achieving certiﬁcation of the ambitious Aquaculture Stewardship Council standard (ASC) on our sites by 2020. At the end of 2015, Cermaq Canada has certiﬁed two sites and Cermaq Chile has certiﬁed four sites in accordance with the ASC standard. Cermaq Norway is expecting three certiﬁed sites in early 2016. Cermaq was the ﬁrst company in Chile to achieve ASC certiﬁcation in 2014.

The Code of Conduct speciﬁes expectations to suppliers on environmental and social aspects such as anti-corruption, human rights, labor rights and external environment. In addition, Cermaq developed a Policy for feed suppliers in 2015, specifying requirements and expectations of particular importance for ensuring a sustainable feed supply from feed Companies. Throughout 2015, Cermaq has worked closely with its main feed supplier EWOS on these issues. EWOS has a supplier code of conduct, deﬁning the principles for their purchase of raw materials and requirements to their suppliers. Towards the end of 2015, Cermaq entered into agreements with other feed suppliers where environmental and social expectations in the Supplier Code of Conduct have been a part of the negotiations. As a member of the Global Salmon Initiative, Cermaq has set ambitious targets for Aquaculture Stewardship Certiﬁcation (ASC) for its farming operations by 2020, which includes sustainable feed requirements. In 2015, we obtained six certiﬁed farms in Chile and Canada while three more is expected in Norway in the beginning of 2016. Maximizing the ﬁsh production from the feed is also important for sustainability. The feed use, the feed factor, is monitored continuously and reported as a Key Performance Indicators each month. ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE Cermaq’s cooperation with our main feed supplier EWOS is strong and good, and we are in the process of developing relations with new feed suppliers. Following the sale of EWOS in 2013, Cermaq has engaged more directly in the feed supply e.g. through the establishment of a Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014 and the policy for feed suppliers in 2015. Whereas the focus has been mainly on the marine raw materials in the feed, the increasing share of agricultural ingredients indicates a higher focus on this topic in the coming years.

We measure our performance against these principles and seek continuous improvement. Cermaq reports on topics that have been found material for our operations and to our stakeholders. How we deﬁne our material topics is described in further detail in our Materiality Analysis. We use the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework to identify speciﬁc indicators to report on for each material topic, and these are presented under GRI indicators on this page, categorized in Economic, Environmental and Social aspects. In addition, we have developed a separate set of material indicators which are made speciﬁcally for our industry and our operations. These can be found on this page under Cermaq indicators . Here you will ﬁnd Fish Health, Environmental, Economical, Social and Compliance information of our operations in Norway, Chile and Canada. Cermaq Indicators CEQ 1 FISH MORTALITY Fish mortality is a key measure to evaluate ﬁsh health in production. To monitor ﬁsh mortality, a 12 months rolling rate was introduced in 2012. The rate measures mortality for the last 12 months as a proportion of an estimated number of ﬁsh in sea the last month (adjusted for harvest and mortalities). The beneﬁt of a 12-month rolling rate is that seasonal variations are eliminated. The indicator is a more precise measure and a better “steering wheel” for management. Reduction in mortality is a key target in Cermaq and mortality is deﬁned as a Key Performance Indicator. This means that it is reported monthly to the Central Management team and the Board of Directors. The 12 months rolling ﬁsh mortality for Atlantic salmon was 6,3 percent of ﬁsh in sea at the end of December 2015 for the Cermaq Group, compared with 6.8 percent at the end of 2014. Cermaq Chile achieved a signiﬁcant reduction in mortalities compared with 2014 and had the lowest mortality rate within the Group this year (6,0 percent), largely due to a continued and focused eﬀort on ﬁsh health management. Cermaq Norway had 6,2 percent ﬁsh mortality and Cermaq Canada 7,2 percent. https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/sustainability-indicators 1/38 CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 35 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Sustainability Indicators Fish Mortality (Atlantic salmon) 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 Cermaq Canada Cermaq Chile Cermaq Norway Cermaq Group 2014 2015 In addition to Atlantic salmon, Cermaq Chile is farming Coho salmon and Rainbow trout. At year-end 2015, the 12 month rolling mortality rate for Coho increased to 8,5 percent (from 6,5 percent in 2014) mainly due to challenging biological conditions including SRS. The mortality rate for Rainbow trout was signiﬁcantly reduced from 10,6 percent in 2014 to 2,5 percent this year. Cullings as a result of disease epidemics are not included in the 12-month rolling rate. In 2015, no cullings were reported in Cermaq Group. The stocking density is compliant with national regulations which are 25 kg/m3 in Norway and 17 kg/m3 in Chile. Canada does not have a regulatory limit, however Cermaq Canada’s normal stocking density is 20 kg/m3. CEQ 2 SEA LICE Controlling sea lice levels is a high priority in all regions where Cermaq operates because high levels of sea lice negatively impact the immune systems of farmed ﬁsh. It is also a priority to keep lice levels low to ensure there is no potential risk of negatively impacting wild salmon stocks. Lice occur naturally in the marine environment. There are two species of lice that aﬀect farmed salmon: Caligus sp. and Lepeophtheirus salmonis . Caligus in general is not host-speciﬁc and infects a wide range of marine ﬁsh species such as herring, Atlantic cod and Zaithe, as well as salmonids. There are diﬀerent subspecies of Caligus that dominate in each region: Caligus elongatus in Norway, Caligus clemminsi in Paciﬁc Canada, and Caligus rogercresseyi , in Chile. L. salmonis, on the other hand, is speciﬁc to salmonids. It has several life stages: (1) free swimming larvae in the water column, followed by (2) stages that attaches to the host when they encounter a ﬁsh typically the skin, ﬁns, the gills and (3) ﬁnally developing into movable stages of adult and mature lice on the ﬁsh that can produce new progeny. Both species lives oﬀ the mucus, skin and blood of their ﬁsh host, and consequently irritate infected ﬁsh. Heavy infestation by either lice species may result in stress and reduced immune competence, making the ﬁsh more susceptible to other infections. Therefore, eﬀective lice-management is a very important measure in preventive ﬁsh health work, and is a pre-requisite for sustainable aquaculture. Sea lice counts Cermaq Chile In Cermaq Chile the status of Caligus for Atlantic salmon and Trout has improved since the peak in April 2013. For Coho salmon, adult sealice are not a challenge to the same degree as for Atlantic and Trout and the level has remained low in 2015.

Screening programs for monitoring relevant pathogens, vaccines, functional feeds, stress mapping, more restrictive use of antibiotics, improving water quality, and more knowledge are key elements in our approach to ensure better ﬁsh health and welfare. This has given us more tools to better forecast disease events and knowledge to lower the risk of disease outbreaks. Antibiotics used In Norway, antibiotics use decreased in 2015 and remains low. In Canada, mouth rot is the primary cause of mortality in newly entered smolt sites and antibiotics are the main tool to combat this disease at present. Towards the end of 2015, increased treatments with antibiotics were necessary also to treat Piscirickettsia in Cermaq Canada, a situation that is expected to improve in the beginning of 2016. In Cermaq Chile, the use of antibiotics continued to increase in 2015 as a result of the increasing number of SRS disease outbreaks in the industry (Piscirickettsia salmonis). One of the priorities of Cermaq’s global research team is to ﬁnd alternative methods to ﬁght the disease, among other measures a more eﬀective SRS vaccine. It is Cermaq’s policy to restrict the use of antibiotics as far as necessary, and only use it when strictly needed, and never as a preventive measure.

Oral Emamectin treatment remains eﬀective. Bath treatment has not yet been approved for general use, and are consequently not used in Canada. The use of in feed treatments remained low in Cermaq Chile. Bath treatments also decreased in Chile in 2015, although it increased towards the end of the year due to a higher lice load. Cermaq Norway increased the use of baths the past year to reduce lice counts. The increase in bath treatments is mainly due to a more challenging sea lice situation in the second half of the year, particularly in Finnmark. Increasing sea lice resistance to treatment is a concern and alternative methods are tested. In-feed treatments have proven to be less eﬀective in Norway with minimal use as a result. Cermaq has policies and procedures in place to ensure that all treatments are conducted in accordance with local regulations and area management plans.

CEQ 5 VACCINATION PROGRAM Our experiences from the ISA crisis in Chile resulted in more systematic work with preventive ﬁsh health measures in all three countries. Screening programs for monitoring relevant pathogens, vaccines, stress mapping, more restrictive use of antibiotic, improving water quality and more knowledge are key elements in our approach to ensure better ﬁsh health and welfare. This has given us more tools to better forecast disease events and knowledge to lower the risk for disease outbreaks. As an integral part of our preventive health measures vaccines are used, when they are assessed as eﬀective for the species in the speciﬁc region. Examples of diseases we vaccinate against are IPN, Vibriosis, ISA, Furunculosis, SRS, IHN and Enteric Red Mouth Disease.

Such agreements are tailored to the local situation and, typically, may include agreement on fallowing and sea lice management strategies, vaccination programs, containment and contingency plans, recapture management plans and disease control strategies in farmed and wild ﬁsheries. Area management is crucial for eﬀective, preventive management. In 2015, all Cermaq sites were engaged in area management agreements or located in areas fully controlled by Cermaq. CEQ 7 ESCAPES Escapes are treated as serious incidents with attention from management and Board of Directors. After three incidents of escape in Chile in 2013, Chile started to monitor the entire network installation by use of ROV (remotely operated vehicle). In addition, investments and initiatives were made to reduce the risk of new incidents; e.g. double nets. The work to prevent escapes is a priority and continues in all regions. In 2015, there were two minor incidents of ﬁsh escapes in Cermaq Canada, each leading to one ﬁsh escaping during handling. In Chile, two incidents led to the escape of a total of 6844 ﬁsh. One escape incident was related to a sea lice bath treatment and the other was due to a sea lion attack causing a hole in the net, leading to the escape of 6767 ﬁsh. In Norway, 500 ﬁsh of an estimated average weight of 50 grams were lost and could not be accounted for when a tank on land bursted in July. It is likely that most of this ﬁsh did not escape in the ocean, but was lost due to predators and between rocks on land. However, the incident was still reported as an escape to the authorities as a precautionary matter. In Norway, Cermaq has introduced DNA traceability for its smolt production, enabling to determine with certainty whether an escaped salmon is farmed by Cermaq or another company. The ﬁrst smolt of this kind was transferred to sea in 2015.

In total, six community complaints were reported in 2015, compared to ﬁve in total in 2014. One complaint was registered in Canada concerning noise, which was settled quickly. In Norway, there were a total of ﬁve complaints, of which one concerned noise, two were related to environmental issues and two involved concerns about visual pollution regarding the installation of new smolt tanks. The complaints were all followed up on and solved. E.g. the smolt tanks were painted to reduce reﬂection and visual impact on neighbors. To investigate the environmental complaints in Norway, an environmental impact assessment was conducted which found very good conditions. 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Sustainability Indicators CEQ 11 Summary of Local Community Complaint Incidents, by Type and by Operating Company 6.0 https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/sustainability-indicators 10/38 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 Cermaq Canada Cermaq Chile Cermaq Norway Cermaq Group 2014 2015 CEQ 12 WHISTLE BLOWING INCIDENTS In 2015, a total of ﬁve whistle blowing incidents were reported.

The greatest risk exposures include ﬁsh health, food safety, production related constraints, eﬀects of climate change, environmental changes, and the health and safety of the group's employees and contracting parties. The group has a policy stating that systematic management of operational risk shall be established through management systems which are certiﬁed in accordance with international standards. The standards impose requirements with respect to management responsibility, structure, reporting and allocation of responsibility in the organisation, regular risk assessment and action plans for ongoing improvement, internal and external communication, and the establishment of procedures and operational controls. The group has deﬁned the most important areas as being Quality (ISO 9001), Environment (ISO 14001), Food safety (ISO 22000) and Occupational Health and Safety (OHSAS 18001). All operating companies are required to have all standards in place and re-certiﬁcation is a management responsibility.

In addition, Cermaq Chile had four certiﬁed sites in accordance with the Aquaculture Stewardship Council standard (ASC) in 2015 with two more obtained in January 2016. In addition to the ISO and OHSAS standards, all harvest sites in Cermaq Canada are in the process of being certiﬁed to Best Aquaculture Practices Standard. With two ASC certiﬁcations obtained in 2015, Cermaq Canada was the ﬁrst salmon farming company in Canada to have multiple farms certiﬁed to the ASC standard, and the second company in Canada to earn this prestigious certiﬁcation. In addition, all sites in the Toﬁno area (more than half of total production) are certiﬁed to the Aboriginal Aquaculture Association’s Aboriginal Principles for Sustainable Aquaculture standards.

EWOS 8 RAW MATERIAL INGREDIENTS EWOS was Cermaq's main feed supplier in 2015, hence this indicator is based on EWOS data. Forage ﬁshery dependency is a challenge for a growing ﬁsh farming industry. In recent years, EWOS has lowered the marine content in its feed and the research into 'marine independence' provides the knowledge for further signiﬁcant reduction in the future if necessary. In addition, the use of ﬁsh trimmings and by-products has increased considerably. The speciﬁc content of marine ingredients in EWOS feed varies depending on price and availability of alternative raw materials. In 2015, the marine index for EWOS decreased to 27.2 percent from 30.5 percent in 2014.

Farmed salmon is well-known to be very eﬃcient in their conversion of forage ﬁsh and seafood by-products into healthy and nutritious farmed salmon. In 2015, we estimate that EWOS used 0.83 times marine protein (1.01 in 2014 and 1.01 in 2013) than protein produced by salmon farmers. For marine oil, EWOS used less oil (0.74) than produced by farmers. For comparison EWOS used 0.79 units of oil in 2014 and 0.77 units in 2013. Estimated Marine Nutrient Ratios Notes: The ﬁgures are ex.

This may have consequences for the safety of employees, ﬁsh escapes and insurance COSTs. In Cermaq’s operations, extreme weather such as storms and currents are experienced in all regions quite regularly. Norway experienced a hurricane in February 2015 which resulted in signiﬁcant material damage (the hurricane “Ole”). In British Columbia, challenging environmental conditions were experienced in the past summer caused by prolonged periods without rain and rising seawater temperatures. Impacts on feed ingredients Weather changes could impact the availability and price of raw materials (both marine and terrestrial) for feed produced which means higher feed costs for salmon farmers. Risks related to change in mean (average) temperature Warmer water could aﬀect aquaculture in temperate zones, making it impossible to farm some species. The Marine Climate Change Impacts Partnership (MCCIP) publishes information about risks connected to warmer water temperatures, such as an increase in disease-causing pathogens. Risks related to ocean acidiﬁcation Ocean acidiﬁcation due to increased levels of CO2 poses a risk to marine life, and may aﬀect e.g. the environmental conditions for salmon production and the availability of marine ingredients in the salmon feed. Opportunities related to change in mean (average) temperature Increasing sea water temperatures could enhance the growing conditions for salmon farming, allowing for faster growth rates and reduced production costs. A report from MCCIP explains opportunities connected to growth and type of species cultivated. Rising sea water temperatures could increase growth rates for some ﬁsh species (e.g. Atlantic Salmon), and new species could be cultivated (e.g. Sea Brass and Bream). Changes in sea water temperatures could allow for new salmonid farming sites located farther north than before. Financial implications of the physical risks and opportunities Financial implications related to physical risks are increased ﬁsh mortality, physical destruction of aquaculture facilities, loss of stock, spread of disease, and increased feed costs. Changes in sea water surface temperatures could impact the conditions for ﬁsh farming. In extreme cases, higher sea water temperatures may cause physiological stress to ﬁsh, reduce seawater oxygen levels and cause harmful algae blooms that all have negative ﬁnancial impacts. Increased water temperatures may also lead to increased sea lice load and hence higher treatment costs. Challenges in the feed supply chain due to climate related issues may lead to lower availability of feed and increased COSTs. Higher temperatures in some regions could mean faster growth, which results in decreased production costs for our ﬁsh farming operations. However, because the optimal water temperature for growing salmon is 12 to 14 degrees, if temperatures rise above 15 degrees, growing conditions become suboptimal and can increase risk of diseases, prompt algal blooms and lead to longer production cycles. How we manage the physical risks and opportunities Risks connected with extreme weather events are mitigated through applying site-speciﬁc risk assessments for elements such as weather patterns and temperatures, and implementing speciﬁc protocols and climate change adaptation measures. Changes to sea water surface temperatures are in some ways mitigated by the geographic diversity of Cermaq's operations. Evaluating further expansion potential is a part of the management’s yearly strategic process reviews. REGULATORY RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES Emission reporting obligations There is a general trend towards regulation related to carbon footprint disclosure at point of sale. This may aﬀect all products marketed in the EU. Carbon taxes CO2 regulations and increased tax on fossil based fuel and energy represent a risk of higher operational costs. CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 51 https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/sustainability-indicators 16/38 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Sustainability Indicators General environmental regulations Changes in environmental regulations may pose a risk, such as emissions regulations for production sites, increased taxation on energy and fuel and increased reporting demand. General environmental regulation opportunities Any new regulations are an opportunity if the organization is well prepared. Immediate compliance can be a competitive advantage. Financial implications of the regulatory risks and opportunities: Cermaq expects ﬁnancial implications on two levels: increased operational costs and resources for reporting and labelling purposes; and possible inability to comply with new legislation. Ultimately this could interfere with the access to international markets for our products. Investment in time and eﬀorts to comply with new regulations and follow-up and reporting procedures are ﬁnancial implications of pursuing the opportunities. How we manage the regulatory risks and opportunities: Cermaq Chile has developed a tool for measuring the carbon footprint of salmon products and has since 2009 onwards been able to determine the carbon footprint of its products. Based upon the information obtained it may be possible to: Label salmon products with the carbon footprint Decide upon active strategies for managing the carbon footprint of salmon products in the future, and minimize GHG emissions wherever possible Cermaq’s sustainability functional team discusses new regulations and initiatives and their impact on our business. Compliance with regulations is followed up in the quarterly sustainability reporting process.

This provides the most accurate measure of the energy eﬃciency within the organization. However, some of the energy use is ﬁxed and does not vary with production (e.g. housing facilities at sea sites and energy used in administrative buildings and processing plants). This means that in years with fewer ﬁsh in the sea the energy consumption per ton of production will be inﬂuenced in a negative way by the ﬁxed consumption. The energy use increased from 3.6 GJ per ton produced (Live Weight) in 2014 to 4,4 GJ in 2015.

EN 11 OPERATIONAL SITES OWNED, LEASED, MANAGED IN, OR ADJACENT TO PROTECTED AREAS AND AREAS OF HIGH BIODIVERSITY VALUE OUTSIDE PROTECTED AREAS Cermaq does not operate any sites in any protected areas as deﬁned by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) or National legislation. In Chile, the nearest protected area is Alacalufes National Reserve, which is approximately 40 kilometers South West of Cermaq operations. Marine sites are also located near the Las Guaitecas National Reserve. In Norway, the nearest protected area is Saltstraumen, where we have one site located approximately 70 kilometers away, which is not a part of the same fjord system. In Canada, the government has classiﬁed protected areas as Federal, Provincial parks or Ecological reserves. In British Colombia there is siting criteria that dictates where Cermaq can operate and no sites are allowed in these areas. EN 12 DESCRIPTION OF SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS OF ACTIVITIES, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES ON BIODIVERSITY IN PROTECTED AREAS AND AREAS OF HIGH BIODIVERSITY VALUE OUTSIDE PROTECTED AREAS Cermaq recognizes the potential for ﬁsh farming operations to impact biodiversity, either directly or indirectly. Biodiversity impacts were examined in the BioScience paper “Aquaculture Production and Biodiversity Conservation”(2009) by Professor James S. Diana, assessing the status and trends in seafood production and the positive and negative impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity conservation. Diana's ranking of negative aquaculture impacts included the following top 5 in order of decreasing importance as threats to biodiversity. These are still considered highly relevant which is why Cermaq in its annual report provides data on each risk. PERCEIVED BIODIVERSITY IMPACT AREA CONNECTIVITY WITH CERMAQ’S REPORTING 1. Escapement of aquatic crops and their potential hazard as Details about ﬁsh escapes are provided under CEQ 7. Escapes are invasive species treated as serious incidents with attention from management and Board of Directors. The work to prevent escapes is a high priority in all regions where Cermaq operates.

The relationships among eﬄuents, eutrophication of water The areas impacted are mainly the areas where we have operations bodies, and changes in the fauna of receiving waters and marine environments surrounding our sites. All Cermaq operations are expected to comply with local and national environmental regulations related to eﬄuents and waste. To reduce the impact on biodiversity and environmental footprint on our sites, all our operations fully respect the fallow periods deﬁned 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Sustainability Indicators in regulations. We regularly monitor the state of the sea ﬂoor at all https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/sustainability-indicators our farm sites and perform benthic impact assessments. This is to 23/38 make sure ﬁsh feces and feed pellets which can build up below farm pens are having a minimal impact, and to allow the sea ﬂoor to recover and avoid any longer term or irreversible impacts. Cermaq reports non-compliances with environmental regulations under EN 29, Fallow time under CEQ 3 and Area Management Agreements under CEQ 6. To reduce the level of anti-foulants used, Cermaq Canada continues trials of alternative methods, including metal nets and “brass nets”. In Chile stainless steel nets have been introduced. Cermaq Norway has been testing Econets made of plastic (PET monoﬁlament). No use of antifouling (Cu) is required for these nets. 3. Conversion of sensitive land areas such as mangroves and Increased use of vegetable raw material used in ﬁsh feed may have wetlands, as well as water use an impact on land use. Cemaq developed a Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014 and a Feed Supplier Code of Conduct in 2015, and the use of certiﬁed and traceable raw materials is important elements in supplier requirements going forward. 4. Other resource use, such as ﬁsh meal and its concomitant The use of marine resources for the production of ﬁsh feed are overexploitation of ﬁsh stocks covered more speciﬁcally under EWOS 8. EWOS, the main supplier of feed to Cermaq, has in recent years, through its Marine Independence Program, signiﬁcantly reduced its proportional use of ﬁsh meal and ﬁsh oil in salmon feeds. In addition, the use of ﬁsh trimmings in ﬁsh meal is increasing. 5. Disease or parasite transfer from captive to wild stocks Wild stocks are naturally infected with lice and lice are transferred from wild to captive ﬁsh. However, if not managed properly, sea lice levels on salmon farms could pose a risk to passing wild salmon stocks. Cermaq is transparent in its reporting of sea lice counts (see indicator CEQ 2), whilst CEQ 4 connects this with the use of medicines for the control of disease and parasites. Cermaq has a strong focus on minimizing the use of medical /chemical treatments and has taken a preventative approach to ﬁsh health. Both oral, chemical and biological treatments are implemented in our strategy for handling the problem. In Cermaq Chile, a strategy to reduce the impact of diseases is vaccination, which depends on the species and disease present. In 2015, double vaccination against SRS was performed and a new strategy for the use of antibiotics introduced, including earlier treatment. In 2015, Cermaq Norway has continued to apply new non-chemical preventive measures against sea lice such as lice skirts and lump ﬁsh on some sites. Both methods show promising results and will be scaled up in 2016.

The Norwegian lobster is no longer a red listed species. In Canada, the following red listed species have habitats in our area of operations: North American otter, conservation status Least Concern (LC) Steller sea lion, conservation status Near threatened (NT) In Canada, Cermaq uses predator nets at all farms throughout the production cycle to deter marine mammals. In Canada, farming companies are also required to report immediately to Fisheries & Oceans Canada (DFO) the culling of any marine mammal at the farm. In British Columbia, the industry is not having a negative impact on the populations of marine mammals. Resident harbor seal populations continue to grow and there is a trend of increasing numbers of migrating Californian sea lions moving up from the United States. Reports also show that the Stellar sea lion population is also growing.

EN 18 GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS INTENSITY Cermaq is reporting an intensity measurement based upon “tons of CO₂e per ton of ﬁsh produced (LWE) . This is a relevant ratio for our industry. Both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions are included in the ratio. As can be seen below, the CO₂ emissions per ton of ﬁsh produced increased somewhat from 2014 to 2015, partly due to a reduction in production. Further details about energy consumption can be found in the indicators EN 3 and EN 5. 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 Intensity: kg of CO2e per tonne of ﬁsh 282 258 259 212 205 217 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Sustainability Indicators produced (LW) Note: Biofuel is included in calculations previous to 2015. https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/sustainability-indicators 26/38 EN 27 EXTENT OF IMPACT MITIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Cermaq requires all its operations to be certiﬁed in accordance with the ISO14001 Environmental management standard. This shall help ensure that any local negative environmental impacts are identiﬁed and managed, in a systematic way, for continuous improvement. We seek improvements in our work to mitigate any negative environmental impacts of our products and services. Examples of impact and initiatives are presented below: Materials use Signiﬁcant resources used in our production processes are raw material ingredients for feed production, smolt for ﬁsh farming and packaging materials (feed-bags, ﬁsh boxes and cardboard). Indicator EWOS 8 explains how our main feed supplier EWOS manages the use of marine ingredients in ﬁsh feed. Water use Salmon farming relies upon the availability of clean water but is generally not an industry with high water consumption. In cases where water is used for salmon farming operations, it is as a rule discharged within quality parameters set by the local authority. Cermaq does not have company-wide environmental goals related to water use and we operate in areas where water is not a scarce factor. However, we report annually on water use to our owner Mitsubishi Corporation. Furthermore, water is an element of Cermaq Canada’s Carbon and Energy Management Program, program which is under consideration for wider use in Cermaq’s operations. Activities in 2015 include installation of new recycling technology at the freshwater site at the Forsan facility to signiﬁcantly reduce freshwater use in the production of smolt. Future energy-saving initiatives and projects are identiﬁed as part of the CEM program with metrics to be reported in the future. The water usage has not been considered a material aspect of ﬁsh feed production. However as water added in the production process and later dried it contributes to the energy usage in the production of feed and will be reported going forward. Emissions Cermaq reports GHG emissions under EN 15, EN 16, EN 17 and EN 18. Salmon farming is not a high emission sector compared to other types of protein food production (e.g. pork and beef). In 2015, a number of initaitives were conducted in Cermaq Group. Cermaq Canada is implementing the Carbon and Energy Management Program, conducting workshops on greenhouse gas emissions and energy awareness. Future energy-saving initiatives and projects identiﬁed as part of program with metrics to be reported in the future. In Cermaq Norway, a heat-exchange system has been put in place at the Forsan facility and low energy lighting (LED Light Emitting Diode). In Cermaq Chile, the use of solar panels (solar energy) for monitors of the automatic feeding system, staﬀ training in areas related to energy use, and installation of lights with motion sensor in processing plants. Eﬄuents and waste All Cermaq operations shall comply with local and national environmental regulations related to eﬄuents and waste handling.

HR 8 INCIDENTS OF VIOLATION OF RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND ACTIONS TAKEN During 2015, there were no reported incidents of violation involving the rights of indigenous peoples in the Cermaq Group. HR 9 OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEWS OR IMPACT ASSESSMENTS Cermaq is commited to ensuring human rights concerns in own operations and in our supply chain. Through the establishment of a Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014, the Group has expressed clear expectations that require adherence to internationally recognized human rights by our suppliers. The Code is available on our web page. In our Ethical and Corporate Responsibility Guidelines principles for human rights are addressed. Cermaq Chile participated in two external human rights assessments in 2013, one in region X and one in region XII. The results from these assessments can be found in our 2013 report. Work is ongoing to assess human rights risks in our operations and in 2016 we are participating in the Norwegian OECD Contact Point's workshops on human rights due diligence. In 2016 we will continue our eﬀorts in this area. PR 1 PRODUCT AND SERVICE CATEGORIES FOR WHICH HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS ARE ASSESSED 100 percent of Cermaq’s product categories are assessed for health and safety impact improvements. This is part of the ISO 22000 standard. Further details about Cermaq’s management standards are given in indicator CEQ 13 Management Standards. PR 2 NON-COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS CONCERNING HEALTH AND SAFETY IMPACTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES Cermaq works continously to ensure that our operations comply with or exceed requirements in local, national and international laws and regulations. If any non-compliances occur, for whatever reason, we take it seriously and investigate at the appropriate level to correct the issue before measures are taken to mitigate the risk of re-occurrence. Cermaq has comprehensive certiﬁcations and management systems in place to ensure that the highest standards are met and complied with.

In addition, there are 26 safety representatives elected on the basis of geography and department division. They all meet twice a year to evaluate and plan for new activities related to health and safety. The 26 safety representatives elect two persons (one per region) to represent them all and coordinate joint activities. The elected representatives are part of the joint health and safety committee (“Arbeidsmiljøutvalget”). Any topic from any of the safety representatives can be put on the agenda of Arbeidsmiljøutvalget. The elected safety representatives represent all employees. In addition to Arbeidsmiljøutvalget, Cermaq Norway has established a safety committee that meets every month to discuss and act on safety issues that require immediate attention. The two safety representatives are members in addition to management representatives. Cermaq Chile Safety committees exist in all places where there are more than 25 workers as required by law. At present, Cermaq Chile has 10 such committees: six related to fresh water, one in each of the three processing plants and one in the central Oﬃce. Committees consist of three elected employee representatives and three company representatives (from the diﬀerent operational areas). Typically, the managers represented are middle managers (e.g. fresh water manager). The committees agree on a working plan that includes safety inspections, accident investigations and training. The committees meet once a month. Most of the issues are resolved in the committee, but if needed, topics are raised to the Central Management team.

The current joint The current health and joint health and 30/38 safety committee has four employer representatives (East Coast Saltwater, West Coast Saltwater, Freshwater and Processing) and six employee representatives (East Coast Saltwater, West Coast Saltwater, East Coast oﬃce, West Coast oﬃce, Processing plant and Freshwater). This means that 100 percent of the employees are represented. Each representative serves for two years on the committee and can seek reelection or re-nomination. The Joint Health and Safety Committee meets once per month. The minutes of the meetings are circulated to all Cermaq Canada employees and are posted on bulletin boards at all locations. An Action Item Database is maintained by the committee to record and monitor tasks to be completed. A member of the management team attends each meeting as an observer and reports back in the monthly management meeting. In addition to the Joint Health and Safety Committee, monthly safety meetings are held at all facilities. LA 6 OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY PERFORMANCE All employees should be safe at work in Cermaq, and a number of measures have been taken to strengthen the attention on safety and risk reduction in our operations. Cermaq has had a high focus on safety in our operations, with visible results the past few years. In 2015, there were encouraging results in all our regions. In Cermaq Canada, we had 11 months consecutive with zero lost time injuries in 2015. In Cermaq Chile, the OHS performance continued to improve from 2014 and showed good results. OHS performance is also a high priority in Cermaq Norway, where a number of measures were introduced in 2015 to further improve results, including a Winter campaign to address particular issues related to seasonal challenges and rough weather conditions on sea sites. To reduce the number of diving accidents, several measures have been introduced in Cermaq Chile the past years which show promising results. Initiatives include investment in ROVs to monitor the nets and the testing of new predator nets of stainless steel to reduce the number of dives required. A training program was started in 2013 and is ongoing, with special attention to technical and practical diving issues and activities. In addition, assessment of diving skills and training is an ongoing activity that continued in 2015. CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 66 In 2015, the Group absence rate was 2,6 percent, and it remains very low throughout the group. The Lost Time Injury rate was 6 which is a decrease from 24 in 2013 and 10 in 2014. The Injury Frequency rate decreased from 51 in 2013 to 18 in 2014 and continued further down to To reduce the number of diving accidents, several measures have been introduced in Cermaq Chile the past years which show promising results.

Total work hours, which is the basis for the above calculations and Lost time injury rate, includes overtime related to workers working on sites (excluding management and administrative employees). LA 7 WORKERS WITH HIGH INCIDENCE OR HIGH RISK OF DISEASES RELATED TO THEIR OCCUPATION Cermaq employees are not considered to be exposed to any signiﬁcant risk related to diseases in any of the production units, but Cermaq has procedures and action plans in place in case of a serious incident. Chile reports that divers (in general) are at risk of osteonecrosis if safety instructions are not adhered to before, during and after the diving. Chile has intensiﬁed training of divers and their families since 2014, and has also reduced the need for dives due to investments in monitoring equipment and mortality extraction. LA 8 HEALTH AND SAFETY TOPICS COVERED IN FORMAL AGREEMENTS WITH TRADE UNIONS In Cermaq Norway, there are three collective agreements with Trade Unions in place and they all cover topics related to employee protection. Hence 100 percent of our collective agreements in Norway cover health and safety topics. In Cermaq Chile, comprehensive OHS measures are required by law. Hence, none of our Union agreements include health and safety topics since compliance with OHS laws and regulations is a requirement. In Cermaq Canada no workers are organized, hence there are no formal agreements with Trade Unions covering health and safety topics. LA 9 AVERAGE HOURS OF TRAINING Employees receive systematic training to build competence according to their own and the organization’s needs. In 2015 the training totaled 0.9 percent of total working time on average for all employees, compared to1 percent in 2014.

Fish farming is often located in remote coastal areas with limited employment opportunities. Our operations can provide long term working places and thus be an important contributor to local activities and employment. All our operations are subject to assessment of local community impacts, and we report community complaints on an annual basis. In 2015, we received six community complaints compared with ﬁve in total in 2014. Five of the complaints were related to our operations in Norway and one complaint was in Canada. All complaints were accommodated and solved to minimize any negative impact of our operations. Further details are provided under the indicator CEQ 11 Local community complaints. SO 3 OPERATIONS ASSESSED FOR RISKS OF CORRUPTION AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS IDENTIFIED Cermaq’s guidelines on preventing corruption are stated in the Cermaq Ethical and Corporate Responsibility Guidelines. The Guidelines build on Cermaq’s Core Values and Corporate Governance Principles, and provide all employees and other stakeholders with a clear understanding of what we stand for and the way we do business. The Guideline is distributed to all employees and is a part of a company-wide compliance program which include anti-corruption training. In the Fall of 2015, 240 employees across all Cermaq’s operating companies were selected to conduct anti-corruption training based on their positions being assessed to be the most exposed to corruption risk. This group of employees were asked to conduct online e-learning to increase own awareness and perform a self-assessment of corruption risks. This process will be concluded in 2016. Cermaq's operations in Canada, Chile and Norway have all been included in the risk analysis through processes conducted internally in each region, coordinated by the central Compliance department in Cermaq Group. No signiﬁcant risks related to corruption were identiﬁed in 2015. SO 4 COMMUNICATION AND TRAINING ON ANTI-CORRUPTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Cermaq’s ethical and corporate guidelines are available to all employees and governance body members, and are communicated to all new employees. The Guidelines prohibit any form of corruption. An e-learning anti-corruption training program was rolled out to management and employees in positions at risk in the majority of the operating companies in 2012. In 2015, a new e-learning program was developed, targeting employees in positions with high risk exposure. In total, 240 employees across all operating companies will undergo e-learning and self-assessment to increase own awareness and knowledge relating to corruption risks in 2015 and 2016. Anti-corruption expectations to Cermaq’s suppliers were also developed through the establishment of the Cermaq Supplier Code of Conduct in 2014, which is communicated on Cermaq’s website and to Cermaq’s suppliers. In 2015, 50 percent of managers and administrative employees in Cermaq Canada received anti-corruption training, in Cermaq Chile 24 percent received training and in Cermaq Norway 81 percent received training. In Cermaq ASA, 53 percent of managers and administrative employees received anti-corruption training. The training program continues in 2016. S0 5 CONFIRMED INCIDENTS OF CORRUPTION AND ACTIONS TAKEN There were no conﬁrmed incidents of corruption in Cermaq Group in 2015. FEED SUPPLIER SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT All Cermaq’s feed suppliers have been assessed taking into account environmental, labour, human rights and anti-corruption criteria as speciﬁed in Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct. EWOS’ main suppliers are ﬁsh meal and ﬁsh oil processing companies and other raw material providers, such as companies supplying e.g. soy proteins, rapeseed oil, wheat and wheat gluten. EWOS has developed a supplier policy and Code of Conduct based on the UN Global Compact 10 principles, the same principles that are the foundation of Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct. Raw material suppliers must sign a self-assessment form and EWOS performs regular supplier audits. In addition, EWOS supports and encourages suppliers of marine ingredients to qualify as certiﬁed IFFO Responsible Sourcing. This practice is in line with Cermaq’s expectations to feed suppliers laid out in our Supplier Code of Conduct and our Feed Supplier Policy. EWOS continued to be Cermaq’s main supplier of ﬁsh feed in 2015 in all Cermaq’s countries of operation. However, in November 2015, Cermaq Norway entered into agreement with one additional feed supplier. Environmental, social and governance criteria outlined in Cermaq’s Supplier Code of Conduct were evaluated entering into the new feed agreement. In addition, Cermaq’s Feed Supplier Code of Conduct speciﬁes more detailed sustainability requirements to new and existing feed suppliers. https://www-test.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/myconnect/cermaq/about-us/article-annual-reports/sustainability-indicators CERMAQ GROUP AS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 • 7034/38 9.5.2016 Cermaq | Sustainability Indicators EN 32, LA14, SO9, HR10 Screening of new feed suppliers All new feed suppliers to Cermaq in 2015 were screened using environmental criteria, human rights and labor practices criteria as well as criteria for impacts on society. EN33, LA15, SO10, HR11, EC9 Signiﬁcant actual and potential negative impacts in the supply chain and actions taken Cermaq is constantly working on developing its supply management practices, and acknowledge the complexity of our supply chain. In 2015, no signiﬁcant actual and potential negative impacts were identiﬁed in the supply chain concerning human rights impacts, labor practices or impact on society. Some key environmental issues within feed processing are to ensure that the raw materials used are not overexploited and that the ecological and carbon footprints are minimized. As our main feed supplier, we present EWOS indicators concerning marine and terrestrial raw material use under the indicator EWOS 8. Information about EWOS energy use is found in EN 4 and CO2 emissions in EN 17. More details can also be found in EWOS Sustainability Report. We will continue our work to identify and mitigate risks in our supply chain in 2016. One initiative is the development of a human rights due diligence case as a part of a program initiated by the OECD contact point in Norway, to be established in 2016.

G4-2 Description of key impacts, risks, and opportunities Cermaq's materiality analysis identiﬁes the sustainability topics that the management considers to be of greatest impact for the organization and of greatest concern to Cermaq’s stakeholders. These topics are incorporated into Cermaq’s annual risk assessment and reporting model. Cermaq’s approach is based upon a risk assessment process where management judges the probability of a risk to occur and the consequence of a potential risk (ﬁnancial impact as well as impact on reputation, health & safety, and external environment) for each material sustainability risk. The perceived risk exposure is then categorized into critical, signiﬁcant, and insigniﬁcant risk areas. The risks are subject to discussion and approval twice a year in Cermaq’s central management meetings and a risk analysis is presented to the Board of Directors also twice a year. An overview of the key risks, opportunities and impacts are described below including a description of mitigating activities, performance in 2015 on speciﬁc indicators and targets for 2016. A further description of the main processes in place to address these risks is described in the Management Approach. The risks presented below also reﬂect industry concerns as well as general sustainability trends that aﬀect Cermaq’s operations. In 2016, Cermaq has initiated a new strategy process where longer term sustainability goals and objectives will be established.

The Report is the responsibility of and has been approved by the management of Cermaq Group AS (“Cermaq”). Our responsibility is to draw a conclusion based on our review. We have based our work on the international standard ISAE 3000 “Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information”, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. The objective and scope of the engagement were agreed with the management of the company and included those subject matters on which we have concluded below. Based on an assessment of materiality and risks, our work included analytical procedures and interviews as well as a review on a sample basis of evidence supporting the subject matters. We have performed interviews with management responsible for the Report and for certain sustainability issues at corporate level. In our work we have focused in particular on the most material indicators including energy and greenhouse gas indicators and key indicators that Cermaq has developed and disclosed (CEQ Indicators), as well as indicators submitted to the Global Salmon Initiative (GSI). We believe that our work provides an appropriate basis for us to provide a conclusion with a limited level of assurance on the subject matters. In such an engagement, less assurance is obtained than would be the case had an audit-level engagement been performed. Conclusions Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention causing us not to believe that:  Cermaq has established procedures to identify, collect, compile and validate information for 2015 to be included in the Report, as described in the Report.  Information presented for 2015 is consistent with data accumulated as a result of these procedures and appropriately presented in the Report.  Cermaq applies a reporting practice for its sustainability reporting aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Reporting Guidelines (version G4) reporting principles.  The Report fulfils in accordance level Comprehensive according to the GRI guidelines.
