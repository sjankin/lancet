Delivering value matters more than delivering barrels. In 2015, MOL has proven that even under these circumstances our portfolio can generate substantial value, largely due to our very competitive direct production cost of ~7 USD/ bbl. Going forward, in 2016, we want to ensure that our business is self-funding at 35 USD/bbl. In order to achieve this, we have launched the New Upstream Program. Under the program umbrella we will continue our relentless production optimization efforts in CEE while simultaneously focusing much more on OPEX and CAPEX efficiency.

Further production growth is expected from field development efforts in the international portfolio (mainly UK, Russia, and Pakistan) 2) Implement a thorough efficiency program: Target OPEX spend reduction by USD 80-100 mn as compared to 2015 levels. This will result in a direct production cost at around USD 6-7/bbl 3) Reduce organic CAPEX to USD ~500-600mn (reduction of ~15-30% year-on-year), including a ~50% cut in Exploration CAPEX, with exploration efforts continue to focus on Norway, nearfield CEE and Pakistan 4) Limit Development CAPEX spending in CEE only on projects that are break-evening at or below USD 30/bbl Brent price. 45 Upstream UPSTREAM SUSTAINABILITY highlights 2015 Striving for risk management, people and business excellence in a continuously challenging environment Climate change GHG emissions Specific energy consumption mt CO2 equivalent kg/toe GJ/toe 1.0 250 2.5 0.8 200 2.0 0.6 150 1.5 0.4 100 1.0 0.2 50 0.5 0 0 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 GHG emission – Exploration & Production Energy consumption / production – total Exploration & Production GHG emission – unit of production – total E&P Energy consumption / production – 2011-2013 IOGP average GHG emission – unit of production – 2011-2014 IOGP average STRATEGIC GOAL: PERFORMANCE: Reduce CO2 intensity of  GHG intensity of E&P operations decreased by 25% compared to 2011 primarily due to reduced operations by 20% by end venting achieved with EOR project in Croatia of 2017 (in t CO2/tonnes of  Energy consumption in upstream operations increased mainly due overhaul in INA d.d. oil equivalent production and as a result of the EOR project WATER AND SPILLS Water withdrawal* Number and volume of spills (›1m 3) mn m3 m3/toe pieces m3 7 2.0 14 200 6 12 5 1.5 10 150 4 8 3 1.0 100 6 2 4 0.5 50 1 2 0 0 0 0 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Total water withdrawal – Exploration & Production Number of spills – Exploration and Production Water withdrawal / production – total Exploration & Production Volume of spills – total Exploration & Production * Excluding produced water STRATEGIC GOAL: PERFORMANCE:  Reduce total water  We continued to reduce total water withdrawal in our exploration & production operations withdrawals by 5%  Decrease in water withdrawal is primarily the result of a new cooling water circulation system in  Improve water MOL Plc. and water efficiency measures in Russia management techniques  The volume of hydrocarbon content of spills above 1 m 3 decreased to 4 m 3 in total, no major spills in water-stressed areas occurred in 2015 in contrast to 2014 RESERVES AND R&D 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Reserve Life Index (years) (SPE 2P) ** 13 15 15 16 14 Research & Development expenditure (HUF mn) 715 730 486 286 1,164 ** Contains INA total reserves.

Lower revenues are due to the combined effect of decreased annual capacity demands and the lower volume-driven revenues in line with lower transmission volumes and decreased turnover fee tariff which was partly compensated by the effect of significantly higher short-term capacity bookings. Domestic transmission volumes are slightly lower by 7% than base period figures mainly due to the lower level of injection volumes. Higher transit transmission revenues in line with favourable external environment Revenue from natural gas transit is HUF 21bn, increased by 8% compared to the base period. Favourable FX changes could overcompensate the negative effect of lower transit tariffs. Total transit transmission volumes were lower by 6% than prior year mainly The official cost review that began in 2013 was not finished in 2015, instead it will be replaced by a new cost review procedure in 2016. Thus in terms of regulation the regulatory cycle that began on 1 January 2010 is still in effect, the new price regulation cycle is expected to enter into force on 1 January 2017. OUTLOOK European dimensions The interests of FGSZ require a more efficient gas market which rests on several pillars to be established. Therefore, in the 10-year period between 2015 and 2024 it wishes to participate in comprehensive infrastructure developments at both Hungarian and international level to promote the creation of the domestic liquid gas market. The transformation of the gas market allows domestic consumers to access gas sources competing against each other in the region, and thus to optimise their purchasing portfolios in line with due to the lower transmission volumes to Romania and Ukraine, their possibilities. transit transmission volumes to Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina As the first step of the strategic investments, between 2006 were somewhat above base period figures. and 2010 FGSZ significantly increased its Eastern import capacity, in line with the development of the strategic Strict control of operating costs storage facility.

explanatory information 31 December 2015 1. GENERAL MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas Public Limited Company (hereinafter referred to as MOL Plc., MOL or the parent company) was incorporated on 1 October 1991 on the transformation of its legal predecessor, the Országos Kőolajés Gázipari Tröszt (OKGT). In accordance with the law on the transformation of unincorporated state-owned enterprises, the assets and liabilities of OKGT were revalued as at that date. MOL Plc. and its subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as the Group or MOL Group) are involved in the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and other gas products, refining, transportation and storage of crude oil and wholesale and retail marketing of crude oil products, production and sale of olefins and polyolefins. The number of the employees in the Group as of 31 December 2015 and 2014 was 25,959 and 27,499, respectively. The registered office address of the Company is 1117 – Budapest, Október huszonharmadika u. 18., Hungary. The shares of the Company are listed on the Budapest and the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Depositary Receipts (DRs) are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and are traded on London’s International Order Book and Over The Counter (OTC) market in the USA. 2.1 AUTHORIZATION, STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE AND BASIS OF PREPARATION i) Authorization and Statement of Compliance These consolidated financial statements have been approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 17 March 2016. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and all applicable IFRSs that have been adopted by the European Union (EU). IFRS comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Effective 1 January 2005, the change in the Hungarian Accounting Act allows the Group to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS that have been adopted by the EU. Currently, due to the endorsement process of the EU and the activities of the Group, there is no difference in the policies applied by the Group between IFRS and IFRS that have been adopted by the EU. Presentation of the financial statements complies with the requirements of the relevant standards. With respect to the conversion option embedded in the perpetual exchangeable capital securities issued in 2006, the revaluation difference arising on this option has been presented as a separate line item on the face of the statement of profit or loss. The management believes that by separating this non-cash item improves the transparency of the financial statements, since the gain or loss recognized thereon is not affected by the operations of the Group or any relevant factors of the external business environment influencing these operations. For further details on the conversion option see Note 17. ii) Basis of Preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRIC interpretations issued and effective on 31 December 2015. MOL Plc. prepares its statutory separate financial statements in accordance with the requirements of the accounting regulations contained in Law C of 2000 on Accounting (HAS). Some of the accounting principles prescribed in this law differs from IFRS. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements For the purposes of the application of the Historical Cost Convention, the consolidated financial statements treat the Company as having come into existence as of 1 October 1991, at the carrying values of assets and liabilities determined at that date, subject to the IFRS adjustments. The financial year is the same as the calendar year. iii) Principles of Consolidation Subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MOL Plc. and the subsidiaries that it controls. Control is evidenced when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with a company, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the company. Power over an entity means having existing rights to direct its relevant activities. The relevant activities of a company are those activities which significantly affects its returns. The acquisition method of accounting is used for acquired businesses by measuring assets and liabilities at their fair values upon acquisition, the date of which is determined with reference to the settlement date. Non-controlling interest is stated at the noncontrolling interest’s proportion of the fair values of net assets. The income and expenses of companies acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal. Intercompany balances and transactions, including intercompany profits and unrealised profits and losses – unless the losses indicate impairment of the related assets – are eliminated. The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. Non-controlling interests represent the profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are shown separately in the con­solidated statement of financial positions and the consolidated statement of profit or loss, respectively. For each business combination, non-controlling interest is stated either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the acquiree’s fair values of net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequently the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the initially recognised amount of those interests adjusted with the non-controlling interests’ share of changes in equity after the acquisition. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a negative balance. Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative in­terests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the company. Joint arrangements An arrangement is under joint control when the decisions about its relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing the control of the arrangements. Joint arrangements are divided into two types: joint operation and joint venture. The type of the arrangement should be determined by considering the rights and obligations of the parties arising from the arrangement in the normal course of business. If the Company has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement then the arrangement is qualified as a joint operation. The Company’s interest in a joint operation are accounted for by recognising its relative share of assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the arrangement, combining with similar items in the consolidated financial statements on a line-by-line basis. When the Group contributes or sells assets to the joint operation, based on the substance of the transaction gain or loss from the transaction is recognized only to the extent of other parties’ interest in the joint operation. When the Group purchases assets from the joint operation, the Group does not recognize its share of the profits of the joint operation from the transaction until it resells the assets to an independent party. If the Company has rights to the net assets of the arrangement then the arrangement is qualified as a joint venture. The Group’s investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Investment in a joint venture is recognised initially at cost and it should be subsequently adjusted for the post-acquisition changes in the share of the joint venture’s net asset. 121 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information The Group’s share from the profit or loss of the joint venture’s operation is included as a single line item in the statement of profit or loss. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture. Investments in associates The Group’s investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a joint venture. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is not amortised. The statement of profit or loss reflects the share of the results of operations of the associate. Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity. Profits and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate. The reporting dates of the associate and the Group are identical and the associate’s accounting policies conform to those used by the Group for like transactions and events in similar circumstances. Investments in associates are assessed to determine whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. If there is evidence of impairment the recoverable amount of the investment is determined to identify any impairment loss to be recognised. Where losses were made in previous years, an assessment of the factors is made to determine if any loss may be reversed. 2.2 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those applied in the previous financial years, apart from some minor modifications in the classification of certain items in the statement of financial position or the statement of profit or loss, none of which has resulted in a significant impact on the financial statements. Change in the presentation of non-hedging derivatives Fair value changes of derivatives economically hedging operating activities but not designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting programs should be recorded as other operating income/expense instead of financial income/expense both in the Individual Financial Statements of the Group entities and in the Consolidated Financial Statement of the Group. Prior period data has not been restated, since the effect proved to be insignificant (both by year and in total). Fair valuation gain of HUF 2.1 billion relating to derivatives economically hedging operating activities but not designated as hedging instruments in hedge accounting programs was recorded in Other operating income in 2015. Valuation of slow moving non-hydrocarbon inventories Based on the current year’s change in the accounting policy of the Group, impairment on slow moving non-hydrocarbon inventories like general maintenance, production, well-construction and other materials, should be recorded on a portfolio basis by estimating the future usage based on the historical pattern of consumption. One maintenance cycle with the length of 4 years should be examined and certain percentage of write-off should be accounted for those levels of inventories which exceed the level derived from historical consumption data. Due to the nature of inventories, reversal of impairment should take place only upon selling the product or when the business begins to consume the product. However, on a case by case basis, a reversal can be made in order to present a true and fair view, if the amount of the reversal of impairment is material by item or by inventory type. IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted in current year Following standards being applicable from 2015 or later has been applied by MOL Group already in 2014 with no significant effect on the financial statements of the Group: • I AS 19 – Employee Benefits – Amendment to clarify the way how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service • IFRIC 21 – Levies There were no further obligatory changes in IFRS, effective from 1 January 2015, which should have been adopted by the Group. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements 2.3 ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Please see the issued but not yet effective International Financial Reporting Standards in the Appendix I. 2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES i) Presentation Currency Based on the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances the functional currency of the parent company and the presentation currency of the Group have been determined to be the Hungarian Forint (HUF). ii) Business Combinations and Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. This involves assessing all assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification in accordance with the contractual terms and economic conditions and recognising identifiable assets (including previously unrecognized intangible assets) and liabilities (including contingent liabilities and excluding future restructuring) of the acquired business at fair value as at the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in statement of profit or loss as incurred. When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value as at the acquisition date and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit or loss. Contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are adjusted against the cost of acquisition, only if they qualify as period measurement adjustments and occur within 12 months from the acquisition date. All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are accounted for either in statement of profit or loss or as changes to other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is initially measured at cost being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. If the consideration transferred is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the acquiree, the fair valuation, as well as the cost of the business combination is re-assessed. Should the difference remain after such re-assessment, it is then recognised in statement of profit or loss as other income. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash generating units, or groups of cash generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the Group are assigned to those units or groups of units. Each unit or group of units to which the goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, and is not larger than a segment based on the Group’s reporting format determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit (or group of cash generating units) and part of the operation within that unit (or group) is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. When subsidiaries are sold, the difference between the selling price and the net assets plus cumulative translation differences and un-amortised goodwill is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. iii) Investments and Other Financial Assets Financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held to maturity investments, or available for sale financial assets, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognized initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs. The Group considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it. 123 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Purchases and sales of investments are recognized on settlement date which is the date when the asset is delivered to the counterparty. The Group’s financial assets are classified at the time of initial recognition depending on their nature and purpose. Financial assets include cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, loans and other receivables, quoted and unquoted financial instruments and derivative financial instruments. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading and financial assets designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit and loss. Financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. Derivatives, including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Gains or losses on investments held for trading are recognized as finance income or finance expense in the statement of profit or loss. Financial assets may be designated at initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss if the following criteria are met: (i) the designation eliminates or significantly reduces the inconsistent treatment that would otherwise arise from measuring the assets or recognising gains or losses on them on a different basis; or (ii) the assets are part of a group of financial assets which are managed and their performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy; or (iii) the financial asset contains an embedded derivative that would need to be separately recorded. Such financial assets are recorded as current, except for those instruments which are not due for settlement within 12 months from the balance sheet date and are not held with the primary purpose of being traded. In this case all payments on such instruments are classified as non-current. Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets which carry fixed or determinable payments, have fixed maturities and which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity. After initial measurement held to maturity investments are measured at amortised cost. This cost is computed as the amount initially recognized minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initially recognized amount and the maturity amount, less allowance for impairment. This calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums and discounts. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the investments are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. After initial measurement loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and includes fees that are an integral part of the effective interest rate and transaction costs. Gains and losses are recognized in the statement of profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process. Available-for-sale financial investments Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale or are not classified in any of the three preceding categories. After initial measurement, available for sale financial assets are measured at fair value with unrealised gains or losses being recognized as other comprehensive income in the fair valuation reserve. When the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recorded as other comprehensive income is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. After initial recognition available-for-sale financial assets are evaluated on the basis of existing market conditions and management intent to hold on to the investment in the foreseeable future. In rare circumstances when these conditions are no longer appropriate, the Group may choose to reclassify these financial assets to loans and receivables or held-to-maturity when this is in accordance with the applicable IFRS. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements Fair value For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date without any deduction for transaction costs. For investments where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined by reference to the current market value of another instrument which is substantially the same or is calculated based on the expected cash flows of the underlying net asset base of the investment. iv) Classification and Derecognition of Financial Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities carried on the consolidated balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents marketable securities, trade and other receivable and payable, long-term receivables, loans, borrowings, investments, and bonds receivable and payable. The accounting policies on recognition and measurement of these items are disclosed in the respective accounting policies found in this Note. Financial instruments (including compound financial instruments) are classified as assets, liabilities or equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement. Interest, dividends, gains, and losses relating to a financial instrument classified as a liability, are reported as expense or income as incurred. Distributions to holders of financial instruments classified as equity are charged directly to equity. In case of compound financial instruments the liability component is valued first, with the equity component being determined as a residual value. Financial instruments are offset when the Company has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends to settle either on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The derecognition of a financial asset takes place when the Group no longer controls the contractual rights that comprise the financial asset, which is normally the case when the instrument is sold, or all the cash flows attributable to the instrument are passed through to an independent third party. When the Group neither transfers nor retains all the risks and rewards of the financial asset and continues to control the transferred asset, it recognises its retained interest in the asset and a liability for the amounts it may have to pay. v) Derivative Financial Instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to net profit or loss for the year as finance income or expense. Fair value changes of derivatives not designated in any hedge relationship but economically hedging an operating activity shall be recorded among other operating result instead of financial result. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments. An embedded derivative is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if all of the following conditions are met: – the economic characteristics and the risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, – a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and – a hybrid (combined) instrument is not measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in current year net profit. vi) Hedging For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as – fair value hedges – cash-flow hedges or – hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. A hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment is accounted for as a cash-flow hedge. At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification 125 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are hedges of the Group’s exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the statement of profit or loss. For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged, the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to the statement of profit or loss. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment to carrying value is amortised through the statement of profit or loss over the remaining term to maturity. Any adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the statement of profit or loss. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. When an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are also recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation. Cash-flow hedges Cash-flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect the statement of profit or loss. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly as other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the statement of profit or loss when the hedged transaction affects the statement of profit or loss, such as when hedged finance income or finance expense is recognized or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts previously taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income are transferred to the statement of profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the statement of profit or loss. Hedges of a net investment Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is accounted for as part of the net investment, are accounted for in a way similar to cash-flow hedges. Gains or losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized as other comprehensive income while any gains or losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognized in the statement of profit or loss. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any such gains or losses recognized as other comprehensive income is transferred to the statement of profit or loss. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements vii) Impairment of Financial Assets The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. Impairment losses on a financial asset or group of financial assets are recognised only if there is an objective evidence of impairment due to a loss event and this loss event significantly impacts the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or group of financial assets. Assets carried at amortised cost If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future expected credit losses) discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition). The amount of the loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss. The Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, and individually or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant. If it is determined that no objective evidence of impairment exists for financial assets, whether significant or not, the asset is included in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and that group of financial assets is collectively assessed for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is or continues to be recognized are not included in a collective assessment of impairment. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed. Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. Available-for-sale financial investments If an available-for-sale asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principal payment and amortisation) and its current fair value, less any impairment loss previously recognized in the statement of profit or loss, is transferred from other comprehensive income to the statement of profit or loss. Impairment losses recognized on equity instruments classified as available for sale are not reversed; increases in their fair value after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Impairment losses recognized on debt instruments classified as available for sale are reversed through the statement of profit or loss; if the increase in fair value of the instrument can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized in the statement of profit or loss. viii) Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash includes cash on hand and cash at banks. Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with maturity less than three months from the date of acquisition and that are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. ix) Trade Receivables Receivables are stated at face value less provision for doubtful amounts. Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortized cost. A provision for impairment is made when there is objective evidence (such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor) that the Group will not be able to collect all of the amounts due under the original terms of the invoice. Impaired debts are derecognized when they are assessed as uncollectible. If collection of trade receivables is expected within the normal business cycle which is one year or less, they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets. x) Inventories Inventories, including work-in-progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after provision for slow-moving and obsolete items. Net realisable value is the selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of making the sale. Cost of purchased goods, including crude oil and purchased gas inventory, is determined primarily on the basis of weighted average cost. The acquisition cost of own produced inventory consists of direct materials, direct wages and the appropriate portion of production overhead expenses including royalty. Unrealisable inventory is fully written off. 127 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information xi) Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost (or the carrying value of the assets determined as of 1 October 1991) less accumulated depreciation, depletion and accumulated impairment loss. When assets are sold or retired, their cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and any gain or loss resulting from their disposal is included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss. The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use, such as borrowing costs. Estimated decommissioning and site restoration costs are capitalized upon initial recognition or, if decision on decommissioning is made subsequently, at the time of the decision. Changes in estimates thereof adjust the carrying amount of assets. Expenditures incurred after the property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhead costs (except from periodic maintenance costs), are normally charged to statement of profit or loss in the period in which the costs are incurred. Periodic maintenance costs are capitalized as a separate component of the related assets. Construction in progress represents plant and properties under construction and is stated at cost. This includes cost of construction, plant and equipment and other direct costs. Construction-in-progress is not depreciated until such time as the relevant asset is available for use. The policy for accounting for exploration and development costs of oil and gas reserves is described in xv) below. xii) Intangible Assets An intangible asset is recognised initially at cost. For intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the cost is the fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets are recognized if it is probable that the future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the enterprise; and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition, the cost model is applied to the class of intangible assets. The useful lives of these intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Amortisation is charged on assets with a finite useful life over the best estimate of their useful lives using the straight line method. The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed annually at each financial year-end. Intangible assets, excluding development costs, created within the business are not capitalized and expenditure is charged against income in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit level. Research costs are expensed as incurred. Development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured. Following the initial recognition of the development expenditure the cost model is applied requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Costs in development stage can not be amortized. The carrying value of development costs is reviewed for impairment annually when the asset is not yet in use or more frequently when an indicator of impairment arises during the reporting year indicating that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The policy for accounting for exploration and development costs of oil and gas reserves is described in xv) below. xiii) Depreciation, Depletion and Amortisation Depreciation of each component of an intangible asset and property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. Usual periods of useful lives for different types of property, plant and equipment are as follows: Software 3 – 5 years Buildings 10 – 50 years Refineries and chemicals manufacturing plants 4 –12 years Gas and oil storage and transmission equipment 7 – 50 years Petrol service stations 5 – 30 years Telecommunication and automatisation equipment 3 – 10 years Depletion and depreciation of production installations and transport systems for oil and gas is calculated for each individual field or field-dedicated transport system using the unit of production method, based on proved and developed commercially recoverable reserves. Recoverable reserves are reviewed on an annual basis prospectively. Transport systems used by several fields and other The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements assets are calculated on the basis of the expected useful life, using the straight-line method. Amortisation of leasehold improvements is provided using the straight-line method over the term of the respective lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever period is less. Periodic maintenance costs are depreciated until the next similar maintenance takes place. The useful life and depreciation methods are reviewed at least annually to ensure that the method and period of depreciation are consistent with the expected pattern of economic benefits from items of property, plant and equipment, and, if necessary, changes are accounted for in the current period. xiv) Impairment of Assets Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss for items of property, plant and equipment and intangibles carried at cost. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The fair value is the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction while value in use is the present value of estimated net future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not practicable, for the cash-generating unit. The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the impairment assumptions considered when the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset neither exceeds its recoverable amount, nor is higher than its carrying amount net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment, annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units), to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash-generating units) to which goodwill has been allocated, an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. The Group performs its annual impairment test of goodwill as at 31 December. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are monitored for impairment indicators throughout the year and are tested for impairment at least annually as of 31 December either individually or at the cash generating unit level, as appropriate. xv) Oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditures Oil and natural gas exploration and development expenditure is accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting. Licence and property acquisition costs Exploration and property acquisition costs are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of exploration. Each property is reviewed on an annual basis to confirm that drilling activity is planned and it is not impaired. If no future activity is planned, the remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Upon determination of economically recoverable reserves (‘proved reserves’ or ‘commercial reserves’), amortization ceases and the remaining costs are aggregated with exploration expenditure and held on a field-by-field basis as proved properties awaiting approval within intangible assets. If there are proved reserves of oil or natural gas and the development is approved internally, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment, among land and buildings. Exploration expenditure Geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against income as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs, delay rentals and payments made to contractors. If hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration expenditure is written off as a dry hole. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, which may include the drilling of further wells (exploration or exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells), are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be carried as an asset. All such carried costs are subject to technical, commercial and management review at least once a year to confirm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract 129 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information value from the discovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off. When proved reserves of oil and natural gas are determined and development is sanctioned, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment. Development expenditure Expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, and the drilling of development wells, including unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment. xvi) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings All loans and borrowings are initially recognized at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses are recognized in net in the statement of profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the amortisation process, except to the extent they are capitalized as borrowing costs. xvii) Provisions A provision is recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable (i.e. more likely than not) that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Group expects some or all of the provision to be reimbursed; the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is actually certain. Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. The amount of the provision is the present value of the risk adjusted expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation, determined using the estimated risk free interest rate as discount rate. Where discounting is used, the carrying amount of the provisions increases in each period to reflect the unwinding of the discount by the passage of time. This increase is recognized as interest expense. Provision for Redundancy The employees of the Group are eligible, immediately upon termination, for redundancy payment pursuant to the Hungarian law and the terms of the Collective Agreement between MOL and its employees. The amount of such a liability is recorded as a provision in the consolidated statement of financial positiond when the workforce reduction program is defined, announced and the conditions for its implementation are met. Provision for Environmental Expenditures Environmental expenditures that relate to current or future economic benefits are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future earnings are expensed. Liabilities for environmental costs are recognized when environmental assessments or clean-ups are probable and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated. Generally, the timing of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites. The amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required. Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure. Provision for Decommissioning The Group records a provision upon initial recognition for the present value of the estimated future cost of abandonment of oil and gas production facilities following the termination of production. The estimate is based upon current legislative requirements, technology and price levels. A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created. This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the facility or item of plant. Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding property, plant and equipment. Provision for Retirement Benefits The Group operates three long term defined benefit employee programmes. None of these schemes requires contribution to be made to separately administered funds. The cost of providing benefits under those plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized as other comprehensive income immediately. Past service costs, resulting from the introduction of, or changes to the defined benefit scheme are recognized as an expense immediately. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements xviii) Greenhouse gas emissions The Group receives free emission rights in Hungary, Croatia, Slovakia and Italy as a result of the European Emission Trading Schemes. The rights are received on an annual basis and in return the Group is required to remit rights equal to its actual emissions. The Group has adopted a net liability approach to the emission rights granted. A provision is only recognized when actual emissions exceed the emission rights granted and still held. Where emission rights are purchased from other parties, they are recorded at cost, and treated as a reimbursement right, whereby they are matched to the emission liabilities and remeasured to fair value. xix) Share-based payment transactions Certain employees (including directors and managers) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares (‘equity-settled transactions’). Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted. The fair value is determined by applying generally accepted option pricing models (usually by the binomial model). In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the parent company (‘market conditions’). The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award (‘vesting date’). The cumulative expense recognized for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Group at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. No expense is recognized for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied. Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognized as if the terms had not been modified. An additional expense is recognized for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification. Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognized for the award is recognized immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share. Cash-settled transactions The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair value at the grant date using the binomial model. This fair value is expensed over the vesting period with recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is remeasured at each balance sheet date up to and including the settlement date to fair value with changes therein recognized in the statement of profit or loss. xx) Leases The determination whether an arrangement contains or is a lease depends on the substance of the arrangement at inception date. If fulfilment of the arrangement depends on the use of a specific asset or conveys the right to use the asset, it is deemed to contain a lease element and is recorded accordingly. Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalized at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Capitalized leased assets are 131 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating a finance lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized over the lease term on the same bases as the lease income. Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense in the statement of profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. xxi) Government grants Government grants are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income over the years necessary to match the grant on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intended to compensate. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to the statement of profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments. xxii) Reserves Reserves shown in the consolidated financial statements do not represent the distributable reserves for dividend purposes. Reserves for dividend purposes are determined based on the company-only statutory earnings of MOL Plc. Translation reserves The translation reserve represents translation differences arising on consolidation of financial statements of foreign entities. Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of the company's net investment in a foreign entity are classified as other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements until the disposal of the net investment. Upon disposal of the corresponding assets, the cumulative revaluation or translation reserves are recognized as income or expenses in the same period in which the gain or loss on disposal is recognized. Fair valuation reserves The fair valuation reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of effective cash-flow hedges and available for sale financial instruments. Equity component of debt and difference in buy-back prices Equity component of compound debt instruments includes the residual amount of the proceeds from the issuance of the instrument above its liability component, which is determined as the present value of future cash payments associated with the instrument. The equity component of compound debt instruments is recognized when the Group becomes party to the instrument (see also iv). xxiii) Treasury Shares The nominal value of treasury shares held is deducted from registered share capital. Any difference between the nominal value and the acquisition price of treasury shares is recorded directly to share premium. xxiv) Dividends Dividends are recorded in the year in which they are approved by the shareholders. xxv) Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the enterprise and the amount of the revenue can be measured reliably. Sales are recognized net of sales taxes and discounts when delivery of goods or rendering of the service has taken place and transfer of risks and rewards has been completed. Having assessed the probability of receiving economic benefits from sales activities in Group’s operations in Kurdistan the management decided to recognise revenue on a cash basis on export sales in Kurdistan and recognise revenue on accrual basis for all other export and domestic sales. Interest is recognized on a time-proportionate basis that reflects the effective yield on the related asset. Dividends due are recognized when the shareholder's right to receive payment is established. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements xxvi) Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalized until the assets are ready for their intended use. Borrowing costs include interest charges and other costs incurred in connection with the borrowing of funds, including exchange differences arising from foreign currency borrowings used to finance these projects to the extent that they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs. xxvii) Income Taxes The income tax charge consists of current and deferred taxes. The current income tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of profit or loss because of items of income or expense that are never taxable or deductible or are taxable or deductible in other years. The Group’s current income tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting year. Deferred taxes are calculated using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the enterprise expects, at the balance sheet date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and tax losses when it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the deferred tax assets can be utilized, except: – where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and – in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences, except: – where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and – in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. At each balance sheet date, the Company re-assesses unrecognized deferred tax assets and the carrying amount of deferred tax assets. The Company recognises a previously unrecognized deferred tax asset to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. The Company conversely reduces the carrying amount of a deferred tax asset to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or the entire deferred tax asset to be utilised. Current tax and deferred tax are charged or credited directly to equity if the tax relates to items that are credited or charged, in the same or a different period, directly to equity, including an adjustment to the opening balance of reserves resulting from a change in accounting policy that is applied retrospectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities which relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. 133 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information xxviii) Sales taxes Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax (e.g. excise duty), except: – when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority (e.g. if the entity is not subject of sales tax), in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item, as applicable – receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the consolidated statement of financial position. xxix) Foreign Currency Transactions Foreign currency transactions are recorded in the reporting currency by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the reporting currency and the foreign currency at the date of the transaction. Exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded during the periods are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the period in which they arise. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Foreign exchange differences both on trade receivables and payables and on borrowings are recorded as finance income or expense. Foreign exchange differences on monetary items with a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income if settlement of these items is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future. Financial statements of foreign entities are translated at year-end exchange rates with respect to the statement of financial position and at the weighted average exchange rates for the year with respect to the statement of profit or loss. All resulting translation differences are included in the translation reserve in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognized in the statement of profit or loss. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognised, but they are not reclassified to statement of profit or loss. In case of a partial disposal of a subsidiary without any loss of control in the foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in statement of profit or loss. For all other disposals such as associates or jointly controlled entities not involving a change of accounting basis, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to statement of profit or loss. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. xxx) Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are calculated by decreasing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted with the after-tax amounts of preference dividends, differences arising on the settlement of preference shares, and other similar effects of preference shares classified as equity; and divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, after deduction of the average number of treasury shares held over the period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share is consistent with the calculation of basic earnings per share while giving effect to all dilutive potential ordinary shares that were outstanding during the period, that is: – the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shares is increased by the after-tax amount of dividends and interest recognized in the period in respect of the dilutive potential ordinary shares and adjusted for any other changes in income or expense that would result from the conversion of the dilutive potential ordinary shares. – the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding is increased by the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares which would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements xxxi) Segmental Disclosure For management purposes the Group is organised into three major operating business units: Upstream, Downstream, Gas Midstream. The business units are the basis upon which the Group reports its segment information to the management who is responsible for allocating business resources and assessing performance of the operating segments. xxxii) Contingencies Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements unless they are acquired in a business combination. They are disclosed in the Notes unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. A contingent asset is not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but disclosed when an inflow of economic benefits is probable. 2.5 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES Critical judgements in applying the accounting policies In the process of applying the accounting policies, which are described in note 2.3 above, management has made certain judgements that have significant effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements (apart from those involving estimates, which are dealt with below). These are detailed in the respective notes, however, the most significant judgements relate to the following: Scope of environmental and field abandonment provision The Group recognised significant amount of provisions in connection with its operations having environmental impact. Regulations, especially environmental legislation do not exactly specify the extent of remediation work required or the technology to be applied. Management uses its previous experience and its own interpretation of the respective legislation to determine the scope of environmental and field abandonment provisions. The amount of environmental provision is HUF 79,218 million and HUF 77,005 million, while field abandonment provision amounts to HUF 278,727 million and HUF 265,273 million as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 20). Application of Successful Efforts method of accounting for exploration and evaluation assets Management uses judgement when capitalized exploration and evaluation assets are reviewed to determine capability and con­tinuing intent of further development. Carrying amount of exploration and evaluation assets is HUF 136,376 million and HUF 260,994 million as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 4). Sources of estimate uncertainty The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the Notes thereto. Although these estimates are based on the management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates. These are detailed in the respective notes, however, the most significant estimates relate to the following: Calculation of the fair values of financial instruments Fair valuation of financial instruments (especially the conversion option embedded in the perpetual exchangeable capital securities issued by a special purpose entity, Magnolia Finance Ltd, see Note 17) is performed by reference to quoted market prices or, in absence thereof reflects the market’s or the management’s estimate of the future trend of key drivers of such values, including, but not limited to yield curves, foreign exchange and risk-free interest rates, and in case of the conversion option volatility of MOL share prices and dividend yield. In case of the conversion option embedded in MOL’s perpetual exchangeable capital securities, valuation was performed with reference to prices on the market of convertible instruments. Further information on financial risk management objectives and policies are detailed on Note 32 and further details of financial instruments are described in Note 33. Quantification and timing of environmental and field abandonment liabilities Management estimates the future cash outflow associated with environmental and decommissioning liabilities using comparative prices, analogies to previous similar work and other assumptions. Furthermore, the timing of these cash flows reflects managements’ current assessment of priorities, technical capabilities and urgency of such obligations. Both the amounts and the timing of 135 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information these future expenditures are reviewed annually, together with expectations on the rates used to discount these cash flows. Long-term nominal discount rates are expected to be between 3.5% and 4.5% (2014: 3.5%). Consequently, the carrying amount of these obligations (see Note 20 and in “Scope of environmental and field abandonment provision” paragraph above) is exposed to uncertainty. Impairment of non-current assets, including goodwill The impairment calculation requires an estimate of the recoverable amount of the cash generating units, that is, the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Value in use is usually determined on the basis of discounted estimated future net cash flows. The most significant variables in determining cash flows are discount rates, terminal values, the period for which cash flow projections are made, as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows, including commodity prices, operating expenses, future production profiles and the global and regional supply-demand equilibrium for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. The models and the assumptions used for impairment testing of Goodwill and Pro­perty, plant and equipment in current year can be found in more detail in notes 4 and 5, under Impairment paragraph, respectively. Availability of taxable income against which deferred tax assets can be recognized Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. The carrying value of such recognized deferred tax assets was HUF 86,272 million and HUF 140,879 million as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 30). Actuarial estimates applied for calculation of retirement benefit obligations The cost of defined benefit plans is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases and mortality or fluctuation rates. Due to the long-term nature of these plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Provision for long term employee benefit is HUF 21,666 million and HUF 23,184 million at 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively (see Note 20). Outcome of certain litigations MOL Group entities are parties to a number of litigations, proceedings and civil actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Management uses judgement when probability of future outflow of economic benefits is determined and estimations when the most likely outcome of these actions is assessed and provision is recognized on a consistent basis.

In 2014 the amount of write-off of capitalized expenses related to exploration activities qualified unsuccessful was HUF 9,046 million The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements in Hungary, in case of SK-1 well in Kazakhstan HUF 2,652 million and in case of Novomatjushkinskaya-103 and ZapadnoKedrovskaya-121 wells in Russia HUF 1,938 million. Transfers from exploration and evaluation assets represent expenditures which, upon determination of proved reserves of oil and natural gas are reclassified to property, plant and equipment (see Note 2.4 xv.). In addition to these exploration and evaluation assets, a further HUF 7,140 million and HUF 15,951 million exploration expenses were incurred in 2015 and 2014, respectively, which were not eligible for capitalization. Consistent with the successful effort method of accounting they were charged to various operating cost captions of the consolidated statement of profit or loss as incurred. Other research and development costs are less significant compared to exploration expenses. These research and development costs were HUF 1,794 million in 2015 and HUF 1,261 million in 2014. Goodwill Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that business combination. Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: 2015 2014 Net book value Net book value HUF million HUF million Downstream 35,068 35,099 – Roth Group 7,969 8,013 – Romanian retail network 4,545 4,612 – Croatian retail network 15,247 15,302 – Czech retail network 6,830 6,695 – MOL Petrochemicals 477 477 Upstream 2,019 3,289 – Rotary (former DrillTrans) 2,019 3,289 Total goodwill 37,087 38,388 Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the recoverable value of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit during its estimated remaining useful life and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates during the period. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs. The pre-tax weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rates used to discount the forecast cash flows reflecting risks specific to the Downstream segment and specific to the certain countries vary between 8.1% and 13.1% in current year. The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts. The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets of Retail segment approved by management for financial year 2016-2018 and extrapolates cash flows for the following years based on an estimated growth rates varying between 1 and 3.5 %. Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the CGUs subject to goodwill impairment test to materially exceed their recoverable amount. Based on the above assumptions, subsequent to impairment tests performed at the end of 2015, impairment was recognized on Goodwill only relating to the activities of Rotary, drilling subsidiary of INA d.d., in amount of HUF 1,263 million. 143 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Intangible assets with indefinite useful life In addition to goodwill, MOL Group has acquired the INA brand in 2009 which has an indefinite useful life, as it is perceived as a market leader with an extensive network of filling station. The Group does not intend to terminate this brand in the foreseeable future. The carrying amount of the INA brand was HUF 14,101 million and HUF 14,153 million as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively. 5.

Impairment, net of reversal Impairment test of Upstream International assets The impairment tests performed by MOL Group were performed using the following assumptions: – Determination of recoverable amount: as the assets which were impairment tested, are planned to be used on a long-term in the future, the recoverable amount is defined as their value in use. – Discount rates: the value in use calculations take into account the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The rate of return expected by the market is the return that investors would require if they chose an investment that would generate cash flows of the same amounts, timing and risk profile as those that the entity expects from the asset or CGU under review. It is estimated from current market transactions for similar assets or from the 'weighted average cost of capital' (WACC) of a listed entity that has a single asset or portfolio of assets that are similar in terms of service potential and risks to the asset under review. – The WACC used in the value in use models is calculated as the total of the WACC of Exploration & Production segment used in the 2016 Business Plans of MOL Group (8.1 %) plus Country Risk Premium of the related country. Based on the above, the WACC rates used for the impairment tests in 2015 were in the range from 8.1 % to 17.1 %. – Oil and gas price assumptions used in the value in use models used for impairment testing were the following: 40 to 60 USD / barrel for the years from 2016 to 2018 and the long term oil price assumed for the years after 2018 was 60 USD / barrel real. In 2015 impairment in the Upstream international portfolio was driven by: – worsening of economic environment and the substantial decrease in the oil and gas prices. Impairment on UK assets were HUF 218,168 million (assets within MOL Growest I. and II. Ltd.: HUF 167,102 million, assets within MOL Operations UK Ltd.: HUF 51,066 million), impairment on other international Upstream assets was HUF 13,107 million; – unsuccessful exploration activities in Akri-Bijeel block in Kurdistan (HUF 131,090 million), in the Ngosso block in Cameroon (HUF 25,633 million), and in case of other international Upstream assets (HUF 7,249 million); 145 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Impairment test on Upstream assets of INA Group In current year HUF 109,470 million impairment was recorded for Upstream assets in INA. Syria Based on multiple-scenario discounted cash-flow calculations the Group has recorded impairment in amount of HUF 18,610 million and HUF 50,429 million in Syria in 2015 and in 2014, respectively (of which HUF 18,610 million and HUF 50,327 million relates to PP&E). Other impairments within Upstream segment of INA Group Driven by the worsening of economic environment and the substantial decrease in the oil and gas prices further impairment in amount of HUF 72,486 million was also recorded in Upstream segment. Impairment of assets in Corporate and Other segment of INA Group Impairments were also recorded within INA Group in Corporate and Other segment in total amount of HUF 9,632 million.

The provision is made on the basis of assessments prepared by MOL’s internal environmental audit team. The amount of the provision has been determined on the basis of existing technology at current prices by calculating risk-weighted cash flows discounted using estimated risk-free real interest rates. The amount reported as at 31 December 2015 also includes a contingent liability of HUF 22,631 million recognized upon acquiring INA Group, representing its present environmental obligations and a further HUF 15,818 million environmental contingent liability regarding the acquisition of IES (see Note 34). Provision for Redundancy As part of continuing efficiency improvement projects, MOL Plc., SLOVNAFT a.s., INA d.d., IES SpA and other Group members decided to further optimize workforce. As the management is committed to these changes and the restructuring plan was communicated in detail to parties involved, the Group recognized a provision for the net present value of future redundancy payments and related tax and contribution. Relating to the restructuring of activities in Mantova, a provision for redundancy of HUF 9,145 million was recognised at IES in 2013 out of which HUF 4,867 million remained as of 31 December 2015. In 2015, a provision of HUF 9,804 million was made for redundancy program at INA in the statement of profit or loss. The closing balance of provision for redundancy is HUF 16,063 million and HUF 14,172 million as of 31 December 2015 and 2014, respectively. Provision for Field Abandonment Liabilities As of 31 December 2015 provision of HUF 278,727 million has been made for estimated total costs of plugging and abandoning wells upon termination of production. Approximately 5% of these costs are expected to be incurred between 2016 and 2020 and the remaining 95% between 2021 and 2065. The amount of the provision has been determined on the basis of management’s understanding of the respective legislation, calculated at current prices and discounted using estimated risk-free real interest rates. Activities related to field suspension, such as plugging and abandoning wells upon termination of production and remediation of the area are planned to be performed by hiring external resources. Based on the judgement of the management, there will be sufficient capacity available for these activities in the area. As required by IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment, the qualifying portion of the provision has been capitalized as a component of the underlying fields. Provision for Long-term Employee Benefits As of 31 December 2015 the Group has recognized a provision of HUF 21,666 million to cover its estimated obligation regarding future retirement and jubilee benefits payable to current employees expected to retire from group entities. These entities operate benefit schemes that provide lump sum benefit to all employees at the time of their retirement. MOL employees are entitled to 3 times of their final monthly salary regardless of the period of service, while MOL Petrolkémia Zrt. and SLOVNAFT provide a maximum of 2 and 7 months of final salary respectively, depending on the length of service period. In addition to the above mentioned benefits, in Hungary the retiring employees are entitled to the absence fee for their notice period – which lasts for 1-3 months depending on the length of the past service – which is determined by the Hungarian Labour Code. None of these plans have separately administered funds; therefore there are no plan assets. The amount of the provision has been determined using the projected unit credit method, based on financial and actuarial variables and assumptions that reflect relevant official statistical data which are in line with those incorporated in the business plan of the Group. Principal actuarial assumptions reflect an approximately 2% difference between the discount rate and the future salary increase. 167 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Present value of total long-term employee benefit obligation 23,184 17,664 at the beginning of the year Past service cost not accounted for at the beginning of the year Balance as of the beginning of the year 23,184 17,664 Acquisitions / (disposals) (72) Past service cost (666) 936 Current service cost 3,800 2,266 Interest costs 676 757 Provision used during the year (3,776) (1,021) Net actuarial (gain)/loss (1,614) 1,851 from which: Retirement benefit (see note 29) (1,624) 1,860 Jubilee benefit 10 (9) Exchange adjustment 134 731 Balance as at year end 21,666 23,184 Present value of total long-term employee benefit obligation at year end 21,666 23,184 The following table summarises the components of net benefit expense recognized in the statement of profit or loss as personnel expenses regarding provision for long-term employee retirement benefits: 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Current service cost 3,800 2,266 Net actuarial (gain)/loss 10 (9) Past service cost (666) 936 Net benefit expense (see note 26) 3,144 3,193 The following table summarises the main financial and actuarial variables and assumptions based on which the amount of retirement benefits were determined: 2015 2014 Discount rate in % 2.0 3.7 2.0 3.7 Average wage increase in % 0.0 2.0 0.0 2.0 Mortality index (male) 0.05 3.57 0.05 3.57 Mortality index (female) 0.02 1.53 0.02 1.53 Actuarial (gains) and losses comprised of the following items: Retirement benefits Jubilee benefits 2015 2014 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million HUF million HUF million Actuarial (gains) and losses arising from changes in demographic (849) (520) assumptions Actuarial (gains) and losses arising from changes in financial 86 189 (60) 26 assumptions Actuarial (gains) and losses arising from experience adjustments (861) 1,671 590 (35) Total actuarial (gains) and losses (1,624) 1,860 10 (9) The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements Legal and Other Provisions Legal and other provisions include provision for emission quotas, legal claims and for other future payment obligations.

Taxes, contributions payable mainly include mining royalty, contributions to social security, value added tax and excise tax. The liability from reimbursed mining royalty in 2014 HUF 35,226 million relates to the amount reimbursed by Hungarian Government following the annulation of resolution of European Commission. This mining tax had been paid by MOL in 2010. As the European Commission appealed against the annulation made by General Court of the European Court of Justice, the amount reimbursed was presented as other payables (revenue is not recognised in statement of profit or loss till 2015). Because of a final court decision, this payable was reversed in 2015, recorded as other income (see Note 25). 23.

Taxes and contributions in 2015 also decreased in connection with lower crude oil prices affecting mainly profit taxes payable by INA after its operations in the North-Adriatic, and also Russian export duties. Comparative figures (in 2014) also contain a non-recurring tax charge of HUF 4,737 million paid to Croatian Tax Authority by INA. 28.

The decreasing financial losses were partially offset by the result of fair valuation (roughly HUF 13.3 billion loss) of trading debt securities. Realised gain of HUF 3.9 billion was recorded on the redemption of securities in 2015. With regards the interest accruals, both the interest income and expense decreased in 2015 compared to the prior year.

INCOME TAXES Total applicable income taxes reported in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 2014 include the following components: 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Current corporate tax and industry income taxes (19,731) (17,273) Local trade tax and innovation fee (14,568) (13,238) Deferred taxes 12,442 25,127 Total income tax (expense) / benefit (21,857) (5,384) The Group’s current income taxes are determined on the basis of taxable statutory profit of the individual companies of the Group. 173 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Current corporate tax and industry income taxes The applicable corporate income tax rate on the taxable income of the companies of the Group operating in Hungary was 10% up to HUF 500 million tax base and 19% above in 2015 and in 2014, as well. Additional extra tax of 31% was applicable for certain Hungarian entities realizing profit from energy supplier activities since 1 January 2013. Applicable income tax rates in Slovakia and Croatia were 22% (2014: 22%) and 20% (2014: 20%), respectively. Italian income tax rate applicable in 2015 was 31.4%, being an aggregate of a corporate income tax of 27.5% (IRES), and local tax rate of 3.9% (in 2014 the total tax rate was 37.9%, being an aggregate of a corporate income tax of 27.5%, extra tax on energy sector of 6.5% and local tax rate of 3.9%). Extra tax of 6,5% (Robin tax) applied for the energy sector has been declared unconstitutional by the Italian Constitutional Court from 12 February 2015. Repeal of the tax was not retroactive. UK tax rate applicable for oil and gas companies in 2015 was 50%, being an aggregate of (ring fence) corporation tax of 30% and supplementary charge of 20% (reduced from 32 % in previous year). General (non ringe-fence) corporate tax was 20% from 1 April 2015 (21% until 31 March 2015). Enacted changes in tax rates are considered when calculating deferred tax assets and liabilities. Tax rates applicable for oil and gas companies in Norway consist of corporate income tax (27%) and resource rent tax (51%) both payable on net operating profits derived from extractive activities. Upstream companies in Norway may be refunded for the tax loss of exploration activities incurred for the year. Local trade tax Local trade tax represents a revenue-based tax for Hungarian entities, payable to local municipalities. Tax base is calculated by deducting material costs, cost of goods sold and remediated services from sales revenue. Tax rates vary between 1-2% dependent on the regulation of local governments where the entities carry on business activities.

Due to the fact that this gain increased the tax base of the assets, but has been eliminated in the consolidation, the increase in the future depreciation gives rise to a deferred tax asset; – the deferred tax effect of the retail filling station sale of MOL Plc. to MOL Kiskereskedelmi Ingatlan Kft. as of 31 December 2015 was HUF 6,792 million. Due to the fact that this gain increased the tax base of the assets, but has been eliminated in the consolidation, the increase in the future depreciation gives rise to a deferred tax asset; – the deferred tax effect of consolidation adjustments relating to MOL Plc. as of 31 December 2015 was (HUF 75,552 million) deferred tax liability. Significant tax losses arose in 2015 at INA and at MOL Plc. in amount of HUF 40,238 million and HUF 115,139 million, respectively. Due to change in tax legislation in Hungary, the unused tax losses existing up until 2014 can be used until 2025 and the tax losses generated from 2015 onwards can be utilized only within the upcoming 5 years. No deferred tax asset was recognized on the tax losses of MOL Plc. which arose in current year as the utilization of those tax losses on top of the existing tax losses within the next 5 years is reasonably not certain. Apart from that the UK subsidiaries acquired in 2014 possessed unused tax losses in 2014 which further increased in 2015, however the deferred tax asset on the tax loss carried forward of UK subsidiaries was derecognized in 2015 due to the uncertainty of its recoverability in the future. No deferred tax assets have been recognized in respect of tax losses elsewhere in the Group due to uncertainty of realisability. The total amount of such tax losses as at 31 December 2015 was HUF 493,345 million. From the unused tax losses as at 31 December 2015, HUF 589,609 million can be utilised after 5 years or has no expiry, while HUF 340,499 million can be utilized between 2016 and 2020. A numerical reconciliation between tax expense and the product of accounting profit multiplied by the applicable tax rates is as follows: 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Profit / (loss) before tax per consolidated statement of profit or loss (303,099) (45,482) Tax (expense) / income at the applicable tax rate (10%, 2014: 19%) 30,310 8,642 Tax allowance available 2,775 2,646 Surplus taxes and local trade tax (expense) / income (11,689) (12,058) Permanent differences 47,647 9,698 Effect of different tax rates at subsidiaries 32,550 17,739 Losses not recognized as a deferred tax asset (124,226) (60,394) Non-taxable income 463 5,617 Recognition of prior year tax losses carried forward 313 22,726 Total income tax (expense) / benefit at the effective income tax rate of (7%) (2014: (12%)) (21,857) (5,384) 31. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share are calculated by decreasing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders with the coupon paid to the owners of Perpetual Exchangeable Capital Securities and divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated considering the potentially dilutive effect of the conversion option embedded in the Perpetual Exchangeable Capital Securities in the number of outstanding shares and by excluding the fair valuation difference of the conversion option from the net income attributable to equity holders of the parent. Both in 2015 and 2014, the diluted earnings per share equals with the basic earnings per share as there is no dilutive effect on the earnings. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements Earnings per Income Weighted average share (HUF million) number of shares (HUF) Basic Earnings Per Share 2014 (3,499) 90,653,661 (39) Diluted Earnings Per Share 2014 (3,499) 90,653,661 (39) Basic Earnings Per Share 2015 (264,130) 91,813,076 (2,877) Diluted Earnings Per Share 2015 (264,130) 91,813,076 (2,877) 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders (256,554) 4,078 Coupon payment to holders of capital securities of Magnolia (-) (7,576) (7,577) Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for basic earnings per share (264,130) (3,499) Coupon payment to holders of capital securities of Magnolia (+) Fair value of conversion option Net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders for diluted earnings per share (264,130) (3,499) 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Weighted average number of ordinary shares for basic earnings per share 91,813,076 90,653,661 Effect of dilution – Weighted average number of conversion of perpetual exchangeable securities Adjusted weighted average number of ordinary shares for diluted earnings per share 91,813,076 90,653,661 32. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES As financial risk management is a centralized function in MOL Group, it is possible to integrate and measure all financial risks at group level in a model using Value at Risk approach. A quarterly Financial Risk Report is submitted to the senior management. As a general approach, risk management considers the business as a well-balanced integrated portfolio. MOL actively manages its commodity exposures for the following purposes only: – Corporate Level Objectives – maintenance of financial ratios and targeted financial results, protection against large cash transaction exposures etc., – Business Unit Objectives – To reduce the exposure of a Business Unit’s cash flow to market price fluctuations (e.g.: planned refinery shutdowns) MOL follows two different strategies based on the level of Net Gearing. In the two scenarios, Risk Management focuses on the followings: – In a High Gearing situation, the primary objective of risk management is to reduce the probability of breaching debt covenants, where a breach would seriously impair the company’s ability to fund its operations. – In Low Gearing status, the focus of risk management shall be directed more toward to the protection of shareholder value by maintaining discipline in CAPEX spending, ensuring risk-aware project selection. The Group is currently in Low Gearing status. As of 31 December 2015 the Net Debt / EBITDA was at 0.73 level while the Net Gearing was 20.6%. The derivative transaction the company may enter is under ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements and Hungarian law governed Dealing Master Agreement in the Hungarian Market. MOL Commodity Trading Limited was established with the purpose to centralize and manage the Group’s needs on oil and oil product derivatives, to optimize the Grouplevel CO2 quota position and to manage the procurement of electricity. In order to control market and credit risks, risk limits (VaR limits, counterparty limits, total commitment limit) are applied and monitored on a daily basis. 177 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Key Exposures Group Risk Management identifies and measures the key risk drivers and quantifies their impact on the Group’s operating results. MOL uses a bottom-up model for monitoring the key exposures. According to the model, the diesel crack spread, the crude oil price and gasoline crack spread have the biggest contribution to the cash-flow volatility. The cash-flow volatility implied by the FX rates, the other refined and petrochemical products are also significant. Commodity Price Risk Management MOL Group as an integrated oil and gas company is exposed to commodity price risk on both the purchasing side and the sales side. The main commodity risks stem from long crude oil position to the extent of its Group level production, long refinery margin position to the extent of the refined product volumes and long petrochemical margin position. MOL can enter into hedging transactions for the above mentioned Corporate Level Objectives and Business Unit Objectives purposes only. In 2015 MOL concluded short-term commodity swap transactions. These transactions are mainly dealt for inventory hedging purposes in order to mitigate the effects of the potential price movements during the non-business-as-usual refinery activities (e.g. turnarounds/ shutdowns), and they are also related to crude oil procurement and other trading possibilities. As of 31 December 2015 the fair value of open commodity derivative transactions designated as fair value hedge was receivable of HUF 9,991 million and payable of HUF 2,636 million (see Note 33). The fair value of accompanying firm commitments as hedged items under commodity derivative transaction designated as fair value hedges was a net payable of HUF 7,355 million. In 2014 and 2015 MOL concluded swap deals on a significant volume of crude oil purchases and ultra-low sulphur diesel sales forecasted for 2014 and 2015 with the economic purpose of capturing a favourable crack spread on this product. As of 31 December 2015 the fair value of open transactions designated as cash-flow hedge was a receivable of HUF 809 million with respect to crude oil swap (see Note 33) and a payable of HUF 1,416 million with respect to diesel swap (see Note 33), with a corresponding adjustment of the fair valuation reserve in other comprehensive income. Deals will be settled subsequent to each month in the next years. As of 31 December 2015 the fair value of open commodity derivative transactions not designated as hedges was receivable of HUF 14,367 million and payable of HUF 11,186 million (see Note 33). Foreign Currency Risk Management At group level, the Group has a net long USD, EUR, RON, and net short HUF, HRK, RUB operating cash-flow position from economic point of view. When MOL is in low gearing status, the Group follows the basic economic currency risk management principle that the currency mix of the debt portfolio should reflect the net operating cash-flow position of the Group (‘natural hedge’). The Group uses cross currency swaps and foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the foreign exchange exposures. As of 31 December 2015 and 2014 there were no open cross currency transactions. The fair value of foreign exchange options was net receivable of HUF 297 million as of 31 December 2015. There were no foreign exchange options in 2014. The Group decided to hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to the foreign exchange risk associated with one of the issued debt (Eurobond 2017), and also hedge the foreign exchange risk arising on the USD denominated net investments in foreign operations, with EUR/USD foreign exchange forwards. As of 31 December 2015 the fair value of foreign exchange forward transactions designated as hedging instrument in the above mentioned hedges was payable of HUF 6,723 million (see Note 33). The Group has two long-term international gas transit agreements (expiring in 2017 and 2023) under which consideration is calculated in SDR. The contractual provisions prescribing price calculation in SDR have been identified as a SDR/USD swap, being an embedded derivative under IAS 39, as the Group considers SDR price setting to be closely related to the underlying originally USD denominated contract. This derivative has been separated from the underlying contract and designated as a cash-flow hedge to the underlying gas transit contract. The fair value of the embedded SDR derivative is a net payable of HUF 3,212 million (HUF 2,602 million net of deferred tax) as of 31 December 2015 (see Note 21). The corresponding figure as of 31 December 2014 was HUF 1,710 million net payable (HUF 1,385 million net of deferred tax). The decrease in the fair value of this instrument has been recognized in other comprehensive income. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements INA has certain long-term contract on gas and crudeoil storage and transport which contain embedded derivatives as defined by IAS 39. These derivatives has been separated from the underlying contracts and designated as fair value hedge to the underlying gas and crude oil contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives is a payable of HUF 13 million as of 31 December 2015 (see Note 33). The corresponding figure was HUF 577 million payable as of 31 December 2014. As of 31 December 2015 the fair value of open foreign exchange forward transactions not designated in any hedge program was a net payable of HUF 7 million (see Note 33), while as of 2014 there were no open foreign exchange forward transactions. During 2014 the Group acquired Euro denominated sovereign securities in the notional amount of HUF 207,658 million. The transactions are in line with the risk management policy of the Group as significant part of the securities had maturity date in 2015 providing natural hedge for the EUR 750 million fixed rate bond matured in October 2015 (see Note 19 for details on Long-term debt). The Group held securities of HUF 62,205 million as part of natural hedge of liabilities as of 31 December 2015 (see Note 33). Hedge of net investments in foreign operations Certain facilities of the Group’s long-term debt (USD 522 million and EUR 478 million) has been designated as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge of foreign operations denominated in USD and EUR. These borrowings are used to hedge the Group’s exposure to the spot USD and EUR foreign exchange retranslation risk of these investments. Losses of HUF 12,708 million incurred on retranslating these borrowings are recorded in other comprehensive income to offset corresponding gains on translating the hedged net investments in foreign operations. The Group designated forward contracts (notional of USD 357 million) as well to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising on the USD denominated net investments in foreign operations (see Foreign Currency Risk Management section). Fair valuation losses of HUF 2,100 million were recorded in other comprehensive income to offset corresponding gains on translating the hedged net investments in foreign operations. Interest rate risk management As an energy company, MOL has limited interest rate exposure. The ratio of fix/floating interest debt is monitored by Group Risk Management and regularly reported to the Board of Directors. As result of the 750M EUR Bond maturity in 2015 the fixed portion of the total debt decreased significantly. The Group may use interest rate swaps to manage the relative level of its exposure to cash-flow interest rate risk associated with floating interest-bearing borrowings. As of 31 December 2015 and 2014, 58.2% and 63.7% of the Group’s debt was at fixed rates respectively. 179 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Sensitivity analysis for key exposures In line with the international benchmark, Group Risk Management prepares sensitivity analysis. According to the Financial Risk Management Model, the key sensitivities are the following: Effect on CCS-based* (Current Cost of Supply) operating profit 2015 2014 HUF billion HUF billion Brent crude oil price (change by +/10 USD/bbl ; with fixed crack spreads and petrochemical margin) Upstream +32.2 / -31.6 +23.9 / -25.0 Downstream -26.0 / +26.0 -19.0 / +19.0 Gas Midstream +2.6 / -2.6 +1.6 / -1.6 Exchange rates (change by +/15 HUF/USD; with fixed crack spreads) Upstream -0.2 / +0.3 +20.2 / -20.2 Downstream +17.8 / -17.8 +6.1 / -6.1 Gas Midstream +1.5 / -1.5 +1.6 / -1.6 Exchange rates (change by +/15 HUF/EUR; with fixed crack spreads / targeted petrochemical margin) Upstream +1.3 / -1.3 +0.2 / -0.1 Downstream +26.8 / -26.8 +25.3 / -25.3 Refinery margin (change by +/1 USD/bbl) Downstream +31.7 / -31.7 +26.8 / -26.8 Integrated petrochemical margin (change by +/10 EUR/t) Downstream +3.1 / -3.1 +2.4 / -2.4 *CCS-based operating profit and its calculation methodology is not regulated by IFRS The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements Other Exposures Credit risk The Group provides a variety of customers with products and services, none of whom, based on volume and creditworthiness, present significant credit risk. Customers are allocated to several segments in order to provide better transparency and to achieve more conscious diversification. The different characteristics of the segments support the mitigation of credit risk. For segments with higher risk profile the ratio of secured credit limits is also higher. Deposit, bank guarantee, letter of credit and lien are the most preferred types of security. As a result of being a major player in the East-Central European region, approximately 70% of our customers are situated in that region; nevertheless our customer portfolio is much diversified from geographical point of view. Group procedures ensure that sales are made to customers with appropriate credit history and do not exceed an acceptable credit exposure limit. Individual credit limits are calculated and defined after external and internal assessment of customers. Information on existing and possible customers is gathered from well-known and reliable Credit Agencies. Internal assessment shall be done on the basis of information obtained, where individual credit limits are calculated by pre-defined algorithms. The internal semi-automated assessment shall be considered as an international best practice with conservative credit management approach. In favour of diversified customer credit risk within the portfolio the Group is using credit insurance services. Sophisticated software solutions (SAP, CRM and Endur) ensure online monitoring of credit exposures, breach and expiry of credit limits and also overdue receivables. When such credit situations occur, shipments shall be blocked. Decisions on the unblocking of the shipments shall be made by authorized managers both on Financial and on Business side. The level of the Managerial decisions is regulated in Group policies. Liquidity risk The Group aims to manage liquidity risk by covering liquidity needs from bank deposits, other cash equivalents and from adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Besides, on operational level various cash pools throughout the group help to optimise liquidity surplus and need on a daily basis. The amount of undrawn major committed credit facilities as of 31 December 2015 consists of the following: HUF million Long-term loan facilities available (general corporate purpose) 869,393 Short-term facilities available 114,239 Total loan facilities available 983,632 The existing bank facilities ensure both sufficient level of liquidity and financial flexibility for the Group. 181 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities at 31 December 2015 and 2014 based on contractual undiscounted payments.

The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. Treasury share transactions (see Note 17) are also used for such purposes. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during 2015 and 2014 The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital plus net debt. 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Long-term debt 461,681 455,039 Short-term debt 205,981 507,116 Less: Cash and cash equivalents and securities 195,361 426,210 Net debt 472,301 535,945 Equity attributable to equity holders of the parent 1,456,769 1,749,745 Non-controlling interest 364,349 445,993 Total equity 1,821,118 2,195,738 Capital and net debt 2,293,419 2,731,683 Gearing ratio (%) 20.6% 19.6% 33.

The value of the equity share in JANAF d.d. was determined by reference to the market value of the shares as quoted on the Zagreb Stock Exchange as of 31 December 2015 – Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly commodity price transactions. For commodity derivative contracts the most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swapand option models which are based on marktomarket calculations. For valuing share option transactions and share swaps various option pricing techniques are used (binomial option pricing model, Monte Carlo simulation). The fair value of the euro dominated sovereign securities is evaluated by discounting the expected future cash flows. – Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data. 34. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Guarantees The total value of guarantees undertaken to parties outside the Group is HUF 91 million. Capital and Contractual Commitments The total value of capital commitments as of 31 December 2015 is HUF 37,139 million, from which HUF 12,116 million relates to capital and contractual commitments of INA and HUF 16,133 million relates to MOL Plc. Other significant amounts relate to the construction of the new petrochemical plants of Slovnaft and MOL Petrolkémia Zrt. (HUF 1,916 million and HUF 4,776 million, respectively). Gas Purchases Obligation, Take or Pay Contract From 1 November 2015 INA d.d. has concluded a flexible natural gas sales agreement with MET International A.G. until 1 April 2017. On 31 December 2015 the value of future liabilities until the termination of the contract was HRK 99 million.

Authority procedures, litigation General None of the litigations described below have any impact on the accompanying consolidated financial statements except as explicitly noted. MOL Group entities are parties to a number of civil actions arising in the ordinary course of business. Currently, no further litigation exists that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, assets, results or business of the Group. The value of litigation where members of the MOL Group act as defendant is HUF 31,148 million for which HUF 25,218 million provision has been made. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements Proceedings with respect to MOL Plc. CREDITOR procedures CREDITOR GAMA s.r.o. has submitted a compensation claim against MOL Plc. in connection with the acquisition of SLOVNAFT a.s. shares by MOL in the amount of cca. SKK 380 million (EUR 12.6 million) plus delay interest 14.75% p.a from 28 November 2007. The claim was dismissed by the court on first instance. The claimant has filed an appeal. CREDITOR BETA s.r.o. alleges that the buying offer of MOL in connection with the acquisition of SLOVNAFT a.s. shares was not approved by the Slovak financial authority (Úrad pre financny trh) and therefore it was not able to receive consideration for its shares for 213 days. It claims for compensation for damages suffered in connection with this delay (cca. EUR 3 million plus delay interest 10.48% p.a from 28 June 2007). The court delivered an interim judgement, MOL has filed an appeal against it. Paraffin cartel infringement The European Commission started an investigation in April 2005 based upon the alleged cartel activity of paraffin producers and traders in Europe. The decision adopted stated that the companies harmonized their commercial activities on the European paraffin market and participated in a continuous cartel infringement. In case of MOL the amount of fine was set in EUR 23.7 million which was paid by MOL in early 2009. Several former paraffin customers claimed their private damages before an English (2010) and a Dutch (2012) court. The cartelists have decided to make a settlement offer. In 2013 MOL procured payment of the settlement sum. The English procedure is closed. The Dutch procedure is still on-going. ICSID arbitration (MOL vs. Croatia) The MOL’s request for arbitration was filed with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes („ICSID”) on 26 November 2013 against the Government of the Republic of Croatia (the “GoC”) mainly due to the huge losses INA-INDUSTRIJA NAFTE, d.d. (“INA”) has suffered in the gas business as a consequence of the breach of the agreements of 2009 by the GoC. In 2014, the GoC filed preliminary jurisdictional objections and an alternative request but it has been rejected by the Tribunal which for MOL opened the possibility of submitting its detailed Statement of Claim on 14 August 2015. UNCITRAL arbitration (Croatia vs. MOL) On 17 January 2014, the Government of Croatia (the “GoC”) commenced this arbitration by alleging that the MOL had bribed Croatia’s former Prime Minister Mr. Ivo Sanader to gain management control over INA through amending the Shareholders Agreement and signing other agreements relating to INA’s operations. The GoC requests that the Tribunal issue a binding declaration nullifying the First Amendment to the Shareholders Agreement and the Gas Master Agreement and order that MOL pays damages caused by its conduct. MOL filed its Response in which it denied all claims put forward by the GoC and requested that the Tribunal dismiss all Claimant’s claims. The GoC’s representatives have submitted their Statement of Claim request in this same arbitration to which MOL responded with its detailed Statement of Defense. The Government responded with its Reply in 2015 while MOL answered to the newly raised allegations with its Rejoinder.” Hearings of the Permanent Court of Arbitration panel were held in 2015 with factual witnesses, experts and closing presentations from both sides. Hungarian Horizon Energy Ltd – MOL arbitration HHE initiated arbitration proceedings against MOL for the breach of the Joint Operating Agreement. HHE sent statement of claim on 25 November 2015. Statement of Defense is submitted. Final decision is awaited around late 2016/early 2017. HHE has not yet quantified its damages claim. Such claims will be quantified during the arbitration process by HHE once certain preliminary questions are clarified. CEOC-MOL arbitration MOL has received three notices of arbitration from CEOC Ltd. in relation to three Field Re-development Framework Agreements on 7 May 2015 CEOC submitted its detailed Statement of Claim in late November 2015 claiming USD ~47million. MOL submitted its complete Statement of Defense on 26 February 2015. The court hearings are scheduled for October 2016. Final decision is awaited around late 2016. 191 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Court proceedings at INA Group LJUBLJANSKA BANKA The claims of plaintiff LJUBLJANSKA BANKA, Ljubljana, Slovenia against INA, d.d. in amount of EUR 8 million have arisen from two contracts of 1982 on the use of short-term foreign currency loan abroad which were concluded between INARafinerija nafte Rijeka and Ljubljanska banka – Osnovna banka Zagreb. The outcome of the procedure is still uncertain due to the complexity of the legal matter (claims for altered default interest). The Supreme Court has not decided on review to this date, so no legal actions were taken in 2015. GWDF In the dispute initiated by GWDF Partnership Gesellschaft Bürgerlicher Rechts and GWDF Limited, Cyprus against INA-INDUSTRIJA NAFTE d.d. and INA-NAFTAPLIN International Exploration, Channel Islands, before the Commercial Court in Zagreb, the plaintiffs claim compensation for damage in the amount of cca EUR 8 million incurred due to ungrounded termination of negotiations. The outcome of the case is at the moment completely uncertain. Last hearing was held on 27 January 2016 on which the main hearing has been closed and the judgment will be rendered on 10 March 2016. SALBATRING ENERGIJA, Međunarodna trgovina, d.o.o. SALBATRING ENERGIJA, Međunarodna trgovina, d.o.o. (“SALBATRING”) initiated the arbitration procedure. INA received Salbatring’s full Statement of Claim on 20 June 2015 by which Salbatring is claiming the amount of USD 27,950,385 plus the interest and costs. INA submitted its Statement of Defence in November 2015 and arbitration procedure is now in documents production phase. EKOMEDIA d.o.o. In September 2012 INA entered into an agreement with company Ekomedia d.o.o. (“Ekomedia”). Ekomedia failed to regular­ly comply with its obligations. INA terminated the agreement with Ekomedia at the beginning of 2014. On 19 December 2014 Ekomedia filed lawsuit against INA. INA filed its official reply to such Ekomedia’s lawsuit and filed a counterclaim for the return of unjust enrichment and asked for the issuance of interim measure for prohibition of use of advertising boards. CONCESSIONS On 29 July 2011 the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Entrepreneurship (hereinafter: the Ministry) rendered three Decisions depriving INA of the license to explore hydrocarbons in exploration areas “Sava”, “Drava” and “North-West Croatia”. On 29 August 2011, INA filed three administrative lawsuits against the Ministry’s Decisions. The Administrative Court annulled the Ministry’s Decisions. On 10 November 2014, and on 20 February 2015 the Ministry adopted new Decisions in which it again deprived INA of the license to explore hydrocarbons in exploration areas “Sava” and “North-West Croatia” and “Drava”, with the same expla­nations. INA filed lawsuits against new Ministry Decisions but till now, the Administrative court did not reach any decision regarding INA’s new lawsuits. R.I.G.-TEHNIČKI SERVISI GRUPA d.o.o. c/a CROSCO R.I.G.-TEHNIČKI SERVISI GRUPA d.o.o. initiated lawsuit against CROSCO, naftni servisi d.o.o. (member of the INA Group, INA is a 100% shareholder) over a value equalling HRK 81,775,674 (cca EUR 10,500,000) with the interest running from 10 March 2010, for damages caused by non-payment of extra and unforeseen works and, to a minor extent, for damages due to loss of computer equipment (cca HRK 520,400/EUR 67,000 with the default interest). The last hearing was held on 27 March 2015. Hearing was postponed, due to the fact that Assembly of creditors (RIG bankruptcy procedure) was scheduled (9 April 2015). Proceedings with respect to MOL Romania Petroleum Products S.R.L. In 2012 the Romanian Competition Council’s Plenum has made a decision in relation with the alleged breach of the competition law by companies active in the fuels market. The alleged breach of antitrust regulations refers to the common withdrawal of the unleaded gasoline pre-mixed, called Eco Premium, from the Romanian fuel market, in 2008. MOL Romania has been fined with RON 80.3 million (i.e. approximately EUR 18.5 million). MOL Romania states that withdrawing ECO Premium from its fuels portfolio was an individual business decision and not the result of an anticompetitive agreement/concerted practice. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements The first degree court of law rejected MOL Romania claim against RCC decision. MOL Romania filed for second appeal (recourse) at the High Court of Justice. MOL Romania has also submitted an unconstitutionally exception, which was judged on 23 February 2016 and the court’s decision was postponed until 3 March 2016. In case the legal provision is declared unconstitutional, MOL will have the possibility to submit an annulment complaint against the Decision in the First Court. In case of admittance the whole trial will restart. On 1 July 2015 the High court of Justice partially admitted the recourse in the sense of reducing the fine with 25%. The Decision is definitive. Environmental liabilities MOL’s operations are subject to the risk of liability arising from environmental damage or pollution and the cost of any associated remedial work. MOL is currently responsible for significant remediation of past environmental damage relating to its operations. Accordingly, MOL has established a provision of HUF 79,218 million for the estimated cost as at 31 December 2015 for probable and quantifiable costs of rectifying past environmental damage (see Note 20). Although the management believes that these provisions are sufficient to satisfy such requirements to the extent that the related costs are reasonably estimable, future regulatory developments or differences between known environmental conditions and actual conditions could cause a revaluation of these estimates. In addition, some of the Group’s premises may be affected by contamination where the cost of rectification is currently not quantifiable or legal requirement to do so is not evident. The main case where such contingent liabilities may exist is the Tiszaújváros site, including both the facilities of MOL Petrolkémia Zrt. and MOL’s Tisza refinery, where the Group has identified potentially significant underground water and surface soil contamination. In accordance with the resolutions of the regional environmental authorities combined for MOL Petrolkémia Zrt. and MOL’s Tisza refinery, the Group is required to complete a detailed investigation and submit the results and technical specifications to the authorities. Based on these results the authorities are expected to specify a future environmental risk management plan and to bring a resolution requiring MOL Petrolkémia Zrt. and MOL to jointly perform this plan in order to manage the underground water contamination. The total amount of liabilities originating from this plan cannot be estimated currently, but it is not expected to exceed HUF 4 billion. Furthermore, the technology applied in oil and gas exploration and development activities by the Group’s Hungarian predecessor before 1976 (being the year when the act on environmental protection and hazardous waste has become effective) may give rise to future remediation of drilling mud produced. This waste material has been treated and disposed of in line with environmental regulations ruling at that time, however, subsequent changes in legal definitions may result in further re-location and remediation requirements. The existence of such obligation, and consequently the potential expenditure associated with it is dependent on the extent, volume and composition of drilling mud left behind at the numerous production sites, which cannot be estimated currently, but is not expected to exceed HUF 3-5 billion. Further to more detailed site investigations to be conducted in the future and the advancement of national legislation or authority practice, additional contingent liabilities may arise at the industrial park around Mantova refinery and the Croatian refineries, depots and retail sites which have been acquired in recent business combinations. As at 31 December 2015, on Group level the aggregate amount of environmental liabilities recorded on the statement of financial position was HUF 38.4 billion (HUF 37.7 billion at 31 December 2014). 35. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD MOL Plc. announced, that with the effective date of the 20 March 2016 MOL terminates the Swap Agreement concluded between MOL and Magnolia Ltd. (“Magnolia”) on the 20 March 2006 and exercises its call option right to purchase 6,007,479 pieces of MOL series “A” ordinary shares at market price set out in the agreement. Magnolia has decided to redeem its perpetual capital securities exchangeable for ordinary shares of MOL at the principal value of EUR 610 million with the effective date of the 20 March 2016. 193 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information 36.

Share-based payment plans The expense recognized for employee services received during the year is shown in the following table: 2015 2014 HUF million HUF million Expense arising from equity-settled share-based payment transactions 188 203 Expense / (reversal of expense) arising from cash-settled share-based payment 1,010 279 transactions Total expense / (reversal of expense) arising from share-based payment 1,198 482 transactions (see Note 26) The share-based payments are described below. The share-based payments serve as the management’s long term incentives as an important part of their total remuneration package. They ensure the interest of the top and senior management of MOL Group in the long-term increase of MOL share price and so they serve the strategic interest of the shareholders. The Long-term managerial incentive system employs two incentive systems in parallel: the Share Option Plan (an option based incentive) and the Performance Share Plan (based on a so called Comparative Share Price methodology). Share Option Incentive Schemes for management The Share Option Plan was launched in 2006 and renewed in 2013. The Share Option Plan is a call option to sell hypothetical MOL shares granted on a past strike price, at a spot price and so realize profit with the difference between these prices. The incentive has following characteristics: 1. Covers a five-year period starting annually, where periods are split into a two-year vesting period (it is not possible to exercise Share Options) and a three-year redeeming period. If unexercised, the Share Option lapses after 31 December of the redeeming period. 2. The grants are defined centrally in line with MOL job category 3. The payout is linked to individual short-term performance Share Option is calculated in Hungarian Forints and paid out in cash in local currency. The incentive is paid in the exercising period according to the declaration of exercising. The payout/earning is the difference between the exercise price and Strike Price for one Share Option, multiplied by the number of Share Options the manager is entitled to. As managerial remuneration package, from 2013 the managers, who are entitled to long-term incentives are eligible for a one-time payout annually, in case the Annual General Meeting of MOL Plc. decides on dividend payment in the given year. Payment of one manager is the value equal to the dividend payment per share multiplied by the Share Option unit numbers the manager is entitled to. The summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information are integral part of these consolidated financial statements Details of the share option rights granted during the year were as follows: Number of shares Weighted Number of shares Weighted in conversion average in conversion average option units exercise price option units exercise price 2015 2015 2014 2014 share HUF/share share HUF/share Outstanding at the beginning of the year 479,458 18,373 521,404 18,412 Granted during the year 213,973 12,209 119,422 14,984 Forfeited during the year (15,520) 18,543 (48,685) 19,156 Exercised during the year Expired during the year (111,727) 22,839 (112,683) 18,481 Outstanding at the end of the year 566,184 15,374 479,458 18,373 Exercisable at the end of the year 259,574 17,808 236,643 20,289 As required by IFRS 2, this share-based compensation is accounted for as cash-settled payments, expensing the fair value of the benefit as determined at vesting date during the vesting period. In 2015 expenses amounted to HUF 780 million (HUF 687 million revenue from reversal in 2014). Liabilities in respect of share-based payment plans amounted to HUF 885 million as at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: HUF 105 million), recorded in Other non-current liabilities and Other current liabilities. Fair value as of the statement of financial position date was calculated using the binomial option pricing model. The inputs to the model were as follows: 2015 2014 Weighted average exercise price (HUF / share) 15,374 18,373 Share price as of 31 December (HUF / share) 14,255 11,545 Expected volatility based on historical data 24.91% 28.57% Expected dividend yield 4.03% 5.65% Estimated maturity (years) 2.58 2.48 Risk free interest rate 1.78% 2.37% Performance Share Plan for top and senior management Other part of the Long-term Incentive Plan for the top and senior management is the Performance Share Plan that was introduced in 2013 replacing the previous Profit Sharing Plan. The Performance Share Plan is a three-year cash based programme using the Comparative Share Price methodology with following characteristics: – Programme starts each year on a rolling scheme with a three-year vesting period. Payments are due after the third year. – Target is the development of MOL’s share price compared to relevant and acknowledged regional and industry specific indicators (the CETOP20 and Dow Jones Emerging Market Titans Oil&Gas 30 Index). – Basis of the evaluation is the average difference in MOL’s year-on-year (12 months) share price performance in comparison to the benchmark indices during three years. – Payout rates are defined based on the over / underperformance of MOL share price. – The rate of incentive is influenced by the individual short-term performance. Expenses arising from the Performance Share Plan program amounted to HUF 230 million in 2015 (HUF 966 million in 2014). Liabilities in respect of the Performance Share Plan program amounted to HUF 1,194 million as at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: HUF 966 million) recorded in Other non-current liabilities and Other current liabilities. 197 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information Share Incentive scheme for the members of the Board of Directors According to resolution of the 2012 Annual General Meeting of the parent company, in case of the members of Board of Directors, the former profit sharing incentive programme had been replaced by a new, share-settled incentive scheme exclusively for the members of the Board of Directors ensuring their interest in the long-term increase of MOL share price. The members of the Board of Directors become entitled to defined annual amount of MOL shares based on the number of days spent in the position. 100 shares per month are granted to each director, the Chairman of the Board is entitled to an additional amount of 25 shares per month. If an executive director is in charge as a Chairman of the Board then this additional amount of shares should be granted to the non-executive Deputy Chairman. The new incentive system ensures the interest of the Board of Directors in the long-term increase of the MOL share price as 2/3 of the shares vested in the year are under transferring restriction for one year. According to IFRS 2, the incentive qualifies as an equity-settled share based scheme; therefore the fair value of the benefit should be expensed during the one year vesting period with a corresponding increase in the equity. The fair value of the benefit has been determined with reference to the average quoted price of MOL shares at the date of grant, which is the first trading day of the year. In 2015 and 2014 with respect of the share scheme programme, HUF 188 million and HUF 203 million has been recorded as an expense, respectively, parallel with the corresponding increase in the equity. Details of the share-settled incentive scheme during the year were as follows: 2015 2014 Number of shares vested 12,300 11,462 Share price at the date of grant (HUF / share) 11,313 14,488 The summary

Instruments: Classification and Measurement In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which reflects all phases of the financial instruments project and replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. The standard reduces categories of financial assets to those measured at amortized cost and those measured at fair value. The classification of financial instruments is made at initial recognition based on the results of business model test and cash flow characteristics test. 199 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Other Explanatory Information IFRS 9 contains an option to designate a financial asset as measured at fair value through statement of profit or loss if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency. The entity can make an irrevocable election at initial recognition to measure equity investments, which are not held for trading, at fair value through other comprehensive income with only dividend income recognized in statement of profit or loss. The standard introduces ‘expected credit loss’ impairment model for financial assets. IFRS 9 introduces a new hedge accounting model that is designed to be more closely aligned with how entities undertake risk management activities when hedging financial and non-financial risk exposures. It is expected that the adoption of IFRS 9 will have an effect on the classification and measurement of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, and on hedge accounting. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers IFRS 15 establishes a new five-step model that will apply to revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under IFRS 15 revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 provide a more structured approach to measuring and recognising revenue. The new revenue standard is applicable to all entities and will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under IFRS. Either a full or modified retrospective application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. IFRS 16 Leases In January 2016, the IASB issued the new standard for reporting of leases – IFRS 16 Leases, which replaces IAS 17, IFRIC 4, SIC-15 and SIC-27. In the case of the lessee, the new standard provides a single accounting model, and require recognition of assets and liabilities for all leases. Exceptions are leases contracted for less than 1 year, and leases with low value underlying assets. This removes the present distinction between finance and operative leases for lessee. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance similarly to IAS 17. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date. Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests The amendments to IFRS 11 require that a joint operator accounting for the acquisition of an interest in a joint operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business must apply the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combinations accounting. The amendments also clarify that a previously held interest in a joint operation is not remeasured on the acquisition of an additional interest in the same joint operation while joint control is retained. In addition, a scope exclusion has been added to IFRS 11 to specify that the amendments do not apply when the parties sharing joint control, including the reporting entity, are under common control of the same ultimate controlling party. The amendments apply to both the acquisition of the initial interest in a joint operation and the acquisition of any additional interests in the same joint operation and are prospectively effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. As the members of Group are parties in several joint operations and considering the Group’s active portfolio management, the financial statements could be impacted by these amendments. Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation The amendments clarify the principle in IAS 16 and IAS 38 that revenue reflects a pattern of economic benefits that are generated from operating a business (of which the asset is part) rather than the economic benefits that are consumed through use of the asset. As a result, a revenue-based method cannot be used to depreciate property, plant and equipment and may only be used in very limited circumstances to amortise intangible assets. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016. These amendments are not expected to have any impact to the Group given that the Group has not used a revenue-based method to depreciate its non-current assets.

CLIMATE CHANGE General aim: Manage risks and opportunities related to climate change ACHIEVEMENTS:   Energy efficiency projects, mainly in downstream operations, contributed significantly to avoiding CO2 emissions, 49 thousand tonnes CO2 saved compared to 2014  An additional 212 thousand tonnes of CO2 emissions avoided through EOR project in INA  MOL Group joined the Zero Routine Flaring Initiative of the World Bank, and also recorded a slight decrease in flaring in E&P   Jászberény Geothermal Exploration long-term testing preparations executed and on track   We have mapped cellulosic feedstock and conversion technologies for non-edible materials to assess the potential for non-foodbased renewable fuel production CHALLENGES:   Develop pathways to low-carbon energy carriers within MOL Group   Increase the share of low-carbon energy carriers in conventional fossil products Climate change is a major issue and is impacting the business environment of MOL Group. From a long-term perspective, it involves risks which must be prepared for or mitigated, and opportunities from which MOL can benefit. RISKS The management of climate change-related risks is part of the general risk management process of MOL Group. Risks are assessed based on a unified methodology and categorized according to severity and probability in heat maps at different organizational levels. The Board of Directors reviews risk responses and controls and defines mitigation activities on a regular basis. The Finance and Risk Management Committee (FRC) of the Board of Directors discusses risks and responsive measures to manage overall risk for MOL, including climate change-related risks. Climate change-related risks are often less clear than other financial, regulatory or operational risks. The following areas are considered to represent the most significant climate change-related risks to MOL Group for the time horizon leading up to 2030: biofuels, alternative infrastructure, vehicle efficiency and e-mobility. The financial impact of each of these is estimated to fall within the range of USD 5-150 million per year. Potential reform of the European Union’s emission trading scheme probably represents an even bigger financial risk. OPPORTUNITIES The Climate Change Package – a set of EU regulations – will have a significant impact on the long-term demand for fossil fuels and energy. Besides defining obligations, it also opens up new business opportunities in the area of “clean fuel/energy”. On the long term, customer preferences will shift towards more environmental friendly products, which will impact the industry. The following section of this report describes the activities MOL is initiating to create its future product portfolio and increase the energy efficiency of its operations. 1.1 FUTURE PRODUCT PORTFOLIO Related objectives: • “Maximize the share of low-carbon products and services” • “Start implementation of first geothermal project in Upstream” In 2015, MOL Group continued implementing activities related to developing and deploying technologies that reduce its GHG footprint. Refining Developments In 2015, MOL Group continued work which started in the previous year to evaluate the potential for increasing the share of low-carbon energy carriers in conventional fossil products. During the year, the EU updated regulations about biofuel blending (especially relating to non-edible and waste material streams) in line with our expectations. This will play an increasingly important role in the future. Emerging technologies are necessary for converting these feedstocks into advanced biofuels, and the successful integration of such new technologies or products into MOL Group’s existing supply chains remains a key challenge for the years to come. Non-food based renewable fuels To comply with the renewable energy targets for 2020 and beyond, and requirements relevant to indirect land use change (ILUC), several technological alternatives for processing GHG-efficient waste fats and oils were investigated. The main focus was on renewable diesel blending and production via hydrotreatment. The most promising options were examined using investment project plans. A decision about their implementation is expected during 2016 following the completion of a detailed technical and economic assessment. From a long-term perspective, we have started to map the potential of cellulosic feedstock and the technological options for its conversion. Exploration of feedstock supply potential in the core region of MOL Group will be completed during 2016. On the conversion technology side we are analysing different options for biofuel production such as fast pyrolysis, gasification and various biochemical technologies. Many relationships have been established with recognized experts and consultants, as well as emerging technology providers to support the evaluation of the related technological processes. A proposal for solutions and decisions is expected in 2016. Beyond investigating advanced biofuels, we have also paid special attention to monitoring trends relating to sustainable energy utilisation, such as efficient solutions for CO2 utilization and renewable energy production and storage. CO2 conversion & utilization Until recently, the main emerging solutions to the problem of CO2 emissions were limited to agricultural use or carbon capture and storage (CCS). Thinking ahead, MOL Group started to explore the field of CO2 conversion technologies which may decrease the CO2 footprint of the company. Areas investigated include the chemical bonding and modification of captured CO2 which can then be converted into valuable products such as methanol and formic acid, a variety of plastics, etc. Fuel economy Producing high quality fuels and also improving fuel economy was one of the primary goals of MOL Group in 2015. These innovative fuels provide economic benefits to our customers and also help avoid the emissions of significant amounts of carbon dioxide due to their improved combustion properties. Chemically-stabilized rubber bitumen The introduction to market of MOL’s environmentally-friendly grade of bitumen continued in 2015, with more than 400 tonnes sold last year. A recent study shows that the roads constructed from this product last 50% longer, have lower maintenance needs and emit 25-30% less carbon dioxide during their lifecycle compared to regular grades of bitumen. The study also emphasizes that rubber bitumen is not only of better quality than regular bitumen, but it is comparable to the premium grades of bitumen used in highway construction. Geothermal Developments MOL Group is committed to investing in the utilization of geothermal energy as a renewable energy source. In this area there is a clear opportunity for the knowledge and technological expertise that has been accumulated within the Group to be leveraged. Additionally, the geological potential of this energy source in Central-Eastern Europe is favourable. After winning a concession tender and signing a concession contract for the Jászberény Geothermal Exploration in H1 2014, CEGE Ltd initiated an exploration program. The official 2-year exploration period started in March 2015. In December 2015, MOL Plc. became the 100% owner of CEGE Ltd by acquiring all the CEGE Ltd. shares from its Australian partner, Black Rock Energy (formerly Green Rock Energy). 223 Notes on Sustainability Performance In 2015, CEGE Ltd. completed the following components of the program of work: • existing 3D seismic data about the area was purchased and re-evaluated • a magnetotelluric survey was undertaken and the results were interpreted • a production well was successfully drilled and a reservoir stimulation was initiated (successfully completed in January 2016) • construction of surface facilities has commenced The long-term well test is scheduled for H2 2016. Biofuel Sourcing MOL Group does not produce biofuels, but two of its companies (MOL Plc .and Slovnaft) have minority shares in joint ventures that are involved in the production of biodiesel. These companies operate independently from MOL Group and are considered financial investments. In 2015, MOL Plc. and Slovnaft a.s. purchased 450 million litres of biocomponents, similarly to previous years, for blending into petrol and diesel products. MOL Group uses both first and second generation biofuels. These are produced from certified biological sources and waste feedstock, including used cooking oil which is collected through the filling station network of MOL Group. The components of the biofuel purchased in 2015 comply with the requirements of the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED). MOL Group companies (MOL Plc., Slovnaft a.s. and INA d.d.) comply with the European ISSC certification system as distributors. ISSC certifies the entire supply chain of bio-based feedstocks and renewables to ensure the application of strict ecological and social sustainability standards, greenhouse gas emissions savings and traceability through the supply chain. 1.2. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND GHG EMISSIONS GHG emissions Related objective: • “Ensure all sites move up one decile from current positions in their sectoral CO2 benchmarks in Downstream” • “Reduce CO2 intensity of operations in Upstream by 30% by end of 2017 (in t CO2/toe)” In 2015, the total direct CO2 emissions of MOL Group amounted to 6.1 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. This is 5% more than in 2014, when emissions came to 5.79 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, but 15% lower compared to the 2010 baseline year (7.14 million tonnes). The single largest component of GHG emissions is carbon-dioxide (CO2), the emissions of which are shown in the chart below according to country. CO2 emissions by country (t) 8,000,000 7,000,000 6,000,000 5,000,000 4,000,000 3,000,000 2,000,000 1,000,000 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Hungary Slovakia Italy Other Croatia The overall increase in emissions is a result of several factors: • The largest contribution to the increase is the fact that the Duna Refinery Steam Boiler Ltd became consolidated and operated by MOL Group in 2015, thereby contributing to direct emissions from this year onwards. • At the same time, production (and hence emissions) at the refinery and petrochemicals units of Slovnaft returned to previous levels after major turnarounds in 2014. The increase was partially offset by several projects: • An energy-efficiency programme that resulted in a reduction of 49 thousand tonnes of CO2 in 2015 • A decrease in E&P venting in Croatia as a result of the Enhance Oil Recovery project (a reduction of 212 thousand tonnes). The project was commissioned in October 2014, while 2015 was the first full year of operation. This project involves applying one of the so-called tertiary methods of enhancing oil recovery (CO2 re-injection) to increase the quantity of recoverable oil and to permanently dispose of some of the CO2 that is produced.

We have been monitoring the GHG performance of our refining business since 2010 using the CONCAWE – Solomon CO2 intensity indicator (CWT – Complexity Weighted Tonnes). In a similar manner, for our petrochemical business we employ an indicator of the production of high value chemicals (HVC). These indicators are production-based and they take into account the complexity of the installations. For upstream business we monitor performance using the IOGP standard indicator – kg CO2/toe. The results presented below indicate a slight increase in carbon intensity (3.55%) for the refining sector compared to 2011, and a 3% increase for the petrochemicals sector (these variations are mainly due to turnarounds and a change in the calculation methodology for Croatian operations that entered into effect in 2014).

Such emissions are typically a result of the use of refinery products or natural gas by customers, or are generated by suppliers who provide services to MOL Group. MOL Group reports on scope 3 emissions in order to provide a context for its direct emissions, and to increase the transparency of its total footprint. 225 Notes on Sustainability Performance Scope 3 GHG emissions by origin (t CO2) [GRI EN17] Emitted by Source of emission 2012 2013 2014 2015 Customers Use of purchased refinery products (t CO2) 50,305,352 51,060,438 48,486,612 50,571,763 Use of purchased natural gas (own production) Customers 7,528,676 6,566,103 6,025,497 6,247,138 (t CO2) MOL Group Business trips (t CO2) 3,943 4,414 2,984 2,508 Production of crude oil (purchased from Suppliers 1,722,810 1,399,445 1,179,981 1,203,727 external sources) (t CO2) Total 59,560,780 59,030,400 55,695,074 58,025,136 Scope 3 emissions increased considerably in 2015 compared to 2014, mainly as the result of the increased volume of products sold to customers. Also, supplier-side GHG emissions increased as a result of increased crude processing. Although accounting for a small share of total MOL Group emissions, business trip-related CO2 emissions are also tracked and reported. These business travel related emissions decreased compared to 2014, and accounted for 2,508 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2015. Gas leakages (flaring and venting) Gas leakages described in this chapter cover losses that result from the flaring and venting of hydrocarbons during operations. Flaring refers to the controlled burning of unused hydrocarbons for technical or safety reasons. The gas flared in Exploration and Production is ‘associated petroleum gas’ (APG), while in Downstream flared gas is generated during the refining process and is flared for safety reasons. Oil and gas leakages are considered to be losses of valuable material that represent operational inefficiency. Flaring is important from both an environmental and an operational efficiency point of view. In recognition of the importance of this topic, MOL Group in 2015 decided to join the Zero Routine Flaring Initiative of the World Bank. The amount of gas flared during MOL Group’s activities is shown in the tables below: Flaring in E&P activities in 2015 (for which MOL Group is operator) [GRI OG6] Russia (BaiTex, KURDISTAN Flaring in Upstream MOL E&P INA E&P Pakistan MatyushkinsREGION OF Total activities in 2015 kaya Vertical) IRAQ Flared hydrocarbon 5,080 8,065 7,308 424 1,964 22,842 (tonnes) CO2 (tonnes) 10,850 22,072 21,230 1,373 8,690 64,215 In Exploration and Production the overall amount flared slightly decreased compared to previous years, albeit with significant differences by country. The most significant decrease occurred in Croatia where flaring was reduced by one third compared to the previous year. The reason is that increased quantities of hydrocarbons were burned in 2014 due to overhaul work and pipeline pigging, which did not occur in 2015. A decrease was also recorded for Russia due to reduced production from the Matyushkinskaya Vertical field. However, an increase was registered for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq due to increased activity, and for Pakistan, where a new gas processing facility (GPF) was commissioned, and due to several process events emergency safety flaring increased.

In Downstream, the amount flared increased slightly from 44,265 tonnes in 2014 to 46,808 tonnes in 2015. Flaring activities stopped in IES (Italy) due to the closure of refining operations, and decreased by 34% in Slovnaft due to the lower level of maintenance activity. However, flaring increased at all other operational sites, primarily due to increases in production in 2015 compared to previous years. Energy Efficiency Related objective: “Decrease downstream production energy consumption by min. 5% by end of 2014” MOL group’s core business, oil and gas production, is highly energy intensive. In 2015, under heavy market pressure on producing companies to thrive in an environment driven by low oil and gas prices, energy efficiency remained key to improving financial results and resilience. This, in turn, involved reducing GHG-emissions, which we continue to monitor and report on. MOL Group over-achieved its objective by reducing energy consumption in Downstream production by 19% (from 106 mn GJ in 2010 to 86 mn GJ in 2014). In 2015, one-off energy efficiency projects brought an estimated 49,000 tonnes of CO2 savings and also resulted in HUF 1.5 billion of financial savings for the year. Since 2011, annual reductions of 420,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions and HUF 14 billion in costs (approx.) have been achieved through group-wide efforts to reduce the energy consumption of Upstream and Downstream operations. In 2015, energy management systems were reinforced by the ISO 50001 certifications that were obtained for INA d.d, MOL Plc. and MOL Petrochemicals Plc., further deepening the integration and management of energy efficiency measures. From the projects implemented in 2015, improvements were mainly made through the Next Downstream Program (NxDSP), the grouplevel strategic framework of the Downstream division, showing how important group-level engagement is for steering such measures. Steam works were at the centre of attention, with steam network maintenance, a decrease in heat losses at INA and heat exchanger cleaning at MOL resulting in the avoidance of 15,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions. MOL Hungary further reduced its annual CO2 emissions by 18,000 tonnes with the installation of Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) measurement technology at the Duna Refinery which analyses flue gas from fired heaters and ensures that they operate in a more efficient and much safer, nearly maintenance-free way. In petrochemical operations, improving energy efficiency is the most effective way to reduce the company’s direct carbon footprint, as well as cut the company’s energy costs, since polyolefin production is also an energy-intensive process. The greatest savings from the operations of MOL Petrochemicals Plc. in 2015 were related to projects designed to reduce the amount of steam and electricity purchased from external sources. As a result, the projects are not accounted for in the figures above. In 2015, MOL Petrochemicals concluded the construction of the new Butadiene extraction unit. The unit will start producing a key component of synthetic rubber used in tires as of 2016. With the operation of this new unit, the CO2 emissions of the old units of MOL Petrochemicals will be reduced by 46,000t of CO2/year from 2016 onwards. The CO2 savings are achieved by substituting 61% of the natural gas used for heating with 5,900 tonnes of hydrogen released by the new unit. This reduction in emissions will not affect the overall emissions of MOL Petrochemicals and is not accounted for in the reported energy / CO2 savings for 2015. 227 Notes on Sustainability Performance Exploration and Production activities are responsible for less than 10% of overall group-level consumption, while Downstream operations, and (mainly) refinery and petrochemical production account for more than 90% of group-level energy consumption (including both direct and indirect energy sources). Besides pre-existing and already implemented projects, energy efficiency is also important in the case of research and development activities. An example of this is a new project which commenced in 2014 to replace traditional antistatic agents with another type with a higher melting point. In 2015, the laboratory phase of this project was in progress and will be continued into 2016. If the project is successful, it is expected to deliver energy savings per annum of 10,000 GJ (steam). In addition to the most important business-related activities, minor improvements are continuously being made at MOL’s other assets, such as the filling station network, office buildings and warehouses. All business lines have implemented projects to support the meeting of targets. Among these we can mention: • The refurbishment of some railway engines that are used in Hungarian operations has led to fuel savings of 8% and 60% lubricants. • Several energy efficiency-related initiatives that were implemented for various office buildings in Hungary have reduced CO2 emissions by 31.4 t per year (in 2015). • In recent years, our filling station network was equipped with a total of 4,000 LED bulbs. 2. ENVIRONMENT General aim: Reduce environmental footprint ACHIEVEMENTS:  Water withdrawals decreased significantly. However, this is primarily a result of lower demand for cooling water at energy production facilities  The waste recovery rate improved by 6% to 66% at a group level  The total volume of hydrocarbons in spills of above 1 m 3 decreased to 16.9 m 3 CHALLENGES:  Increases in air emissions both in the case of SO2 and NOx as a result of increases in fuel consumption instead of natural gas  Containment and further decrease in remediation liabilities across MOL Group  Decreases in water withdrawals do not follow energy efficiency and operational changes 2.1 AIR EMISSIONS Related objective: “Decrease VOC emissions by implementing the LDAR methodology” MOL Group operates a wide range of oil and gas technologies and equipment and the industry itself is considered to be a significant source of volatile organic compounds (VOC). Taking this into account, MOL Group defined the specific objective of measuring and reducing VOC emissions in 2010 and has since continuously implemented a group-wide leak detection and repair (LDAR) program, together with a programme for improving the monitoring and reporting of such emissions. The program has resulted in significant decreases of VOC over the past few years (at the individual site level) and in 2015 efforts continued with further improvements. For example, at our Hungarian logistics operations we created a comprehensive VOC emission inventory. The study took into account all the emissions from tanks and all fugitive emissions from leaking points, and, as a result, an ongoing program to reduce VOC emissions that arise from product handling has been put into place. At our Slovak refinery the LDAR programme has been operational since 1998. Since then, VOC emissions have been reduced by 60%. In 2015, 8 production units were surveyed. In addition to this, in 2015 1,000 tonnes of hydrocarbon were recovered by the vapour recovery unit. At the Italian site, the LDAR programme started in 2010, bringing significant benefits. For example, in 2015 VOC emissions were reduced by 69% as compared to 2014 (from 3.12 t/y in 2014 to 0.96 t/y in 2015), but this is also due to the site conversion programme. Although at the units which are covered by the LDAR programme VOC emissions have significantly decreased, overall MOL Group emissions increased in 2015 by 89% as compared to 2010, as we continue to extend the scope of VOC measurements across the group, as explained above. The industry is also a source of SO2, NOx, CO and Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and preventive measures have been taken to reduce the quantity of these as well. As a result of investments at production units, SO2 emissions were lower by 53% and NOx emissions by 34% in 2015 compared to the 2010 baseline emission year. However, on an annual basis there has been a significant increase in both. The primary reason for this is that some units switched over to using fuel oil rather than natural gas due to the low price of oil. PM emissions in 2015 were similar to those of 2010 (with a slight decrease of 2%), but a significant reduction was made compared to 2013 (36%). CO emissions have increased compared to the 2010 baseline by 44% but have decreased compared to 2013. The variation is mainly related to the result of the incorporation of air emission related data for Russian operations into group-level reporting in 2011, and air protection measures introduced at the same operations from 2012-2013. The CO emissions remain at almost the same level for the period 2014-2015. Total air emissions (excl.

MOL Group achieved its water-related targets. In 2015, MOL Group’s total water withdrawals amounted to 84.65 million m 3 , which represents a decrease of 8% compared to 2010 (91.96 million m 3). The reduction is attributable to the yearly change in production capacity that is based on market demand, the closure of the Italian site, as well as numerous water-saving initiatives that have been implemented over the last 6 years. 229 Notes on Sustainability Performance Total water withdrawals by source (thousand m 3) [GRI G4-EN8] Change Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2010-2015 (%)* Municipal Water Supplies or 3,523 3,478 2,839 2,682 2,177 12,295 249 Other Water Utilities Surface Water Withdrawals 43,812 42,095 44,155 50,218 46,929 39,231 (10) Ground Water Withdrawals 12,571 12,785 13,887 11,869 10,755 10,971 (13) Rainwater Collected and Stored 565 487 16 188 158 (72) Wastewater from Other Organizations 6,794 6,383 2,274 91 209 (97) Total fresh water withdrawals 67,267 65,230 63,173 64,769 60,140 62,866 (7) Non-fresh water withdrawals 24,700 30,700 33,589 29,749 33,990 21,790 (12) Total water withdrawals 91,967 95,930 96,762 94,518 94,130 84,655 (8) *Y2015 data are compared to the baseline year for our strategy: 2010 The significant variability in the quantities of Municipal Water or Other Water Utilities and Surface Water withdrawals between 2015 and previous years is explained by the 2 month shut-down of the surface water supply system at one of our Croatian refineries when municipal water was used instead. At the same time, less non-fresh water was used at the same facility as electricity was purchased from a third party. Accordingly, less cooling water was needed. Total water withdrawal by country 120 100 80 million m3 60 40 20 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Hungary Slovakia Italy Other Croatia In 2015, we continued to implement a variety of initiatives in order to keep the Group on track to improve its water withdrawal related targets: • At the Ivanic Grad facility in Croatia, we implemented a project to replace old pipes and install a modern valve system. The effect was an immediate decrease of more than 50% in water withdrawals for the site (before the replacement, monthly consumption was in the range of 2,000 m 3 , while after project implementation this dropped to approximately 900 m 3). • At the Hajdúszoboszló site in Hungary, a new closed cooling system was put into operation, saving considerable amounts of water (66% in 2014). In addition to these savings, surface water withdrawals from the Eastern Main Channel were reduced to zero at this site in 2015. • Due to the transformation project, a significant decrease of 26.2% (compared to 2014 data) for water withdrawals occurred at the Mantova site (from 1,207,521 m 3 in 2014 to 891,169 m 3 in 2015). Water discharges Compared to previous years, the total amount of water discharged continues to decrease. Amount of contaminants (tonnes) [GRI G4-EN22] Change Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2010-2015 (%)* Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) 75 57 73 63 95 38 (49) Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) 2,376 2,094 1,743 1,712 1,647 1,514 (36) Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) 582 568 419 417 471 307 (47) Solid Substances (SS) 1,055 1,038 688 609 873 765 (27) * Y2015 data are compared to the baseline year for our strategy: 2010 This decrease occurred due to the more efficient use of water resources and some technological improvement projects. For example, at the Slovakian refinery the quality of discharged water has constantly improved over the past few years which has led to lower environmental fees (60,000 euros less in 2015 than 2014), and at our Italian sites discharged water is now re-used for other purposes (e.g. in the firefighting system). The significantly lower TPH values are due to the conversion of the Italian site from a refinery into a logistics depot, a new wastewater treatment plant at the gas-processing facility in Pakistan, and a change in the method of sampling at our Croatian operations (based on new legal requirements). Efforts to improve the quality of discharge waters continue with the numerous projects started in 2015 such as a water recycling project at the Hungarian refinery, improved sewage systems at logistics sites in Pécs and Szajol and at the Rijeka Refinery. Produced water Significant quantities of produced water are managed by our exploration and production facilities. During 2015, over 11 million m 3 of water was produced (9.8 million m 3 in EU countries and 1.0 million m 3 in non-EU countries). In order to minimize MOL Group’s impact, the company aims to re-inject, whenever feasible, the produced water. Compared to 2014, the amount of produced water at our EU operations has remained almost constant (albeit has slightly increased), while in non-EU countries it has decreased due to smaller volumes of production. At our EU operations produced water is re-injected, and projects for making improvements are continuously being implemented. For example, in Croatia at the Struzec formation (a water pumping plant) a reconstruction project is ongoing with a view to increasing efficiency. In Pakistan (Makori West field) a water reinjection system with a capacity of 3,000 barrels per day continued to operate in 2015. A total of 1,200 barrels of produced water was re-injected, and the full capacity of the system will be reached in 2016. Quantity of produced water from Exploration & Production activities in 2015 (m 3) [GRI OG5] Non EU Total MOL EU Operations Operations Group Amount of produced water 9,833,135 1,015,306 10,848,441 Total amount of re-injected produced water 10,677,465 1,090,586 11,768,051 The proportion of re-injected water is higher than 100% because it covers the total amount re-injected. Water re-injection takes place at Exploration and Production sites to maintain underground pressure, and additional water is also injected to increase pressure. Water-stressed areas Water scarcity refers to either a lack of water (quantity) or a lack of access to good quality (safe) water. MOL Group considers water scarcity to be a major issue and as such has been taking measures to decrease the water demand of its operations. Only a minor part of our operations are in water-stressed areas. Our Central-Eastern European (CEE) exploration and production facilities are not located in water-scarce areas but we are continuously reducing our demand for water (see the water withdrawal reduction projects described above) and reducing water pollution. We have taken action to assess the situation in more depth with our international operations which, according to external studies (such as water availability maps from the World Resource Institute), are situated in water-scarce areas (e.g. Pakistan and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq). As a result, a detailed hydrological study of the Teri water basin (Pakistan) was carried out with the aim of assessing available water resources and the potential impact of our operations. The study concluded that, due to local circumstances, our operations are not disturbing the water balance, but as a precautionary measure we have taken steps to protect water sources. These measures include periodical analysis of the quality of ground water through monitoring wells, ongoing implementation of the Water Conservation Action Plan developed in 2014, and the use of treated effluent water for gardening purposes. 231 Notes on Sustainability Performance A study which was conducted at the end of 2014 addressed increasing water shortages and examined how to balance competition between industrial usage and the needs of local communities. By successfully assessing its water footprint, Kalegran B.V. (Kurdistan region of Iraq) has made a commitment to tackling the water shortage challenge and identifying innovative solutions for sustainable water management. Even though the Kurdistan region of Iraq has been identified as a water scarce area at the global scale, it was found that our operations in Akri Bijell block are not having a negative impact on water recharge patterns in the region. Nevertheless, several activities have been orchestrated in order to tackle access to water, as this was found to be one of the primary concerns of local communities. Since in 2015 MOL Group operations in Akri Bijell Block were suspended, no further activities were carried out after 2014. Unconventional Exploration and Production Unconventional exploration techniques such as fracking have revolutionised the energy industry but prompted environmental and community concern. One of the main concerns is that fracking uses huge amounts of water that must be transported to the fracking site at significant environmental cost. Another important concern is that potentially carcinogenic chemicals may escape and contaminate groundwater around the fracking site. The third and most important concern is that the fracking process can cause small earth tremors. MOL Group is not directly involved in unconventional exploration, but, realizing the sensitivity of the issue, has defined a set of environmental standards for responsibly undertaking limited fracking activities to enhance the production of conventional fields. These requirements encompass stakeholder concerns, water / land-use and protection, well-integrity, the use of chemicals and other risks which may be anticipated from specific risk studies. MOL and its subsidiary INA have successfully undertaken fracking on a few pre-existing wells during which all risks were managed during the entire life-cycle of the activities, from contracting to completion of the production wells. 2.3 WASTE MANAGEMENT, SPILLS AND SITE REMEDIATION Waste management Related objective: “Increase the proportion of recovered waste (remediation waste excl.) by 5% by the end of 2015 (baseline: 2010)” At MOL Group we are continuously seeking to decrease our environmental footprint by reducing the amount of waste we generate and developing treatment, recycling and recovery solutions. Due to the complexity of operations, our waste streams and types are also very diverse. The company’s operations produce a wide range of solid and liquid wastes (including oily sludge, waste chemicals and spent catalysts, etc.). The total amount of waste generated in 2015 increased by 62% compared to 2010. The trend was influenced by significant quantities of non-hazardous waste generated by large investment/demolition projects, as follows: • At our Hungarian operations, the total amount of waste increased by about 25% due to various construction/demolition projects, but compared to 2014, the amount recycled increased by 40%. • A similar situation occurred with the Slovakian refinery where the quantity of waste increased due to investment activities and the general revision of production units. Despite the overall increase in quantity, in 2015 the waste recovery rate improved at the MOL Group-level by 25% (compared to 2010) which means we outperformed in this regard.

These include the following: • The reverse osmosis equipment installed at the Slovakian Refinery has reduced waste from the waste water treatment plant by 3,500 tonnes. • Also in Slovakia during 2011 – 2015, 15,839 t of spent catalyst was produced, for which a disposal method was employed that ensured a 98.4% recycling rate. • The campaign for the collection of used household cooking oil (using the retail network in three countries – Slovakia, Hungary and Romania) continued in 2015. In Romania, 35 new service stations have entered the programme, and in Slovakia we have increased the number of collection point from 15 stations to 88. As a result, the total quantity of oil that was collected in Slovakia increased from 3 t in 2014 to 9 t in 2015, but there was a decrease in the quantity collected in Romania and Hungary. Accordingly, a total of 228.6 t of cooking oil was collected in 2015 which represents a decrease of about 30% compared with 2014 when 325.3 tonnes of used cooking oil were collected. • In Croatia, we have continued the writing-off process for various chemicals from exploration and production activities. As such, the quantity of hazardous waste that was produced remained at a high level. • In Pakistan, a total of 3,362 tonnes of oil-based mud was treated through a bioremediation process. Treated mud is re-used as a filling material for road construction. The Group’s environmental standards define its policy related to managing drilling mud and include regulations about mud selection, waste minimisation, recycling and responsible disposal. Data relevant to this topic are presented below.

In order to increase recollection, we further encouraged the recollection of these types of wastes in 2015. This waste is treated at our own waste management facilities, producing significant amounts of steam or the flux oil needed for bitumen production. From 2015 we started to centrally collect and report on the quantities of hazardous wastes that are exported/imported due to our operations. As for some of the waste streams there are no proper treatment facilities at the local level, limited amounts of very specific wastes (e.g. refinery catalysts/tank sludge) are exported for treatment to Germany or Austria. The total amount of hazardous waste exported for treatment reached 3,930 tonnes. 233 Notes on Sustainability Performance Spills MOL Group is aware of the impact that spills can have on the environment and communities, so taking spill prevention measures into account is a priority when we design and operate our facilities. Regular maintenance and inspection campaigns are conducted and emergency response plans are in place and are constantly updated for each of our sites. When we detect a spill, all the necessary measures are immediately taken to restore the pre-spill status of the affected areas. In 2015, a total of 6 spills to environment (of more than 1 m 3 hydrocarbon content) with a total hydrocarbon volume of 16.9 m 3 were recorded across MOL Group. This number does not include spills related to road accidents that happened off-site. This represents an increase in number compared to the 5 spills registered in 2014. On the other hand, there has been a significant reduction in terms of total hydrocarbon losses compared to the 193.5 m 3 registered in 2014. The main reason for this decrease is that in 2014 there were 2 major spills at our Croatian operations with a total hydrocarbon spillage of 170 m 3 . In 2015, there were no such major events. The two largest spills were recorded at our Croatian and Slovak operational sites. The first one, a spill of 6m 3 , happened on the section of the crude pipeline that links the Sisak Refinery and Janaf and was due to corrosion, while the second spill (4.9 m 3) happened due to an operational failure inside the Slovnaft Refinery. The other 4 spills were of a volume of between 1 2 m 3 and were due to corrosion (2), mechanical failure (1) and an attempt at theft (1). All the spills are considered to have had limited environmental impact and affected no communities. The total cost of remediation activities for all 6 spills was 93,490 euros. MOL Group did not operate any off-shore installations in 2015 (MOL Group only participated in offshore exploration or production activities through joint ventures as non-operating member). However, MOL Group still aims to ensure that measures are in place to protect marine ecosystems in the vicinity of operations that are located near the coast (e.g. in Croatia at the Rijeka Refinery or the UK’s North Sea). Remediation A group-wide remediation programme that addresses historical pollution continued to be implemented in 2015. During the year remediation work was carried out at 187 locations at our Hungarian operations, while at 12 sites work was concluded (this may be compared with baseline year of 2011 when remediation work was concluded for a total of 32 sites). In 2015, approximately HUF 1,191.6 million (USD 4.26 million) was spent on the management of environmental damage. At Slovak operational sites, remediation programmes continued at 6 locations – 4 logistic sites and 2 retail stations. At one of the logistics sites, the remediation works were successfully concluded and post-monitoring activities have now started. Total spending on remediation programmes in 2015 was HUF 47 million (USD 0.17 million) compared with HUF 732 million (USD 2.48 million) in 2014. At Rijeka Refinery, remediation work has been carried out on an ongoing basis since 1993. The remediation programme is designed to achieve three objectives: protect the sea and the coastal area, continuously eliminate historical pollution from underground sources, and monitor on a daily basis underground pollution (in 2015, 5 new monitoring wells were installed in high-risk areas). Remediation-related costs at our Croatian operations in 2015 were HUF 744.79 million (USD 2.66 million). Remediation projects continued being implemented at Italian operations too. In 2015, a total of HUF 124 million (USD 0.44 million) was planned for remediation work, but only HUF 76.99 million (USD 0.27 million) was spent as one of the projects did not start due to external factors. The pump and treat hydraulic protection system at the Mantova site has been optimized in order to ensure enhanced protection of the most sensitive areas. Concerning international exploration and production sites, over 21 ha of land in Russia was restored to its original state at the Matyushkinskaya Vertical fields and 37 ha in Baitex. Also, 25 drilling mud pits were eliminated from the Baitex field. Remediation and environmental liabilities are of particular importance when operational sites are abandoned. MOL Group focuses on optimizing operations that also affect its own assets. In 2015, no major site was abandoned. Moreover, in international exploration and production areas no operational sites were opened or closed. 2.4 BIODIVERSITY Related objective: “Implement Biodiversity Action Plans for all critical operation sites” MOL Group recognizes that it must operate safely and responsibly in order to protect the natural environment and local communities. Hence, we apply stringent standards to help reduce any impacts our operations may have, particularly in critical habitats which are areas that are rich in biodiversity or under protection. We conduct biodiversity-related studies (as part of environmental impact assessments) for any new major projects or large expansions to existing operations. MOL Group’s exposure to biodiversity risks is not very significant. In 2014, a group-wide assessment was conducted to identify potentially sensitive areas which should be the focus of future efforts. In total, 162 sites were surveyed. According to the survey, only 8 sites are in biodiversity-critical areas (6 Upstream and 2 Downstream), while 35 Upstream operations are located close to or within Natura 2000 sites (European nature conservation areas). Two of the Upstream operations are situated in water-stressed areas (see chapter on Water management) while one can be found in a water-protected landscape. In continuation of the 2014 efforts to map all our operations that are close to or in protected areas, in 2015 we developed biodiversity action plans for all exploration and production sites that are awarded this status. Working with biodiversity experts and local communities to protect biodiversity was also a focus of work during 2015: • In Hungary we developed awareness-raising projects in partnership with the Őrségi National Park, Hortobágy National Park, Kiskunsági National Park and the Körös-Maros National Park. Activities included printing various brochures and participating in various events, etc. • In Slovakia we continued to collaborate with SOS Bird Life Slovakia, and we jointly implemented a habitat management program on Samorin Bird Island (on the Danube River). Almost 40 employees from Slovnaft helped professional environmentalists from SOS Bird Life Slovakia to clean the island and prepare the area for nesting birds. This bird island is home to the largest colony of Mediterranean Gulls in Central Europe (over 250 breeding pairs), and the island’s surrounding is the most important wintering site in Central Europe for several duck species. • In Pakistan, we have continued to cooperate with the Margala Hills National Park Administration and more than 1,000 large-size plants have been planted. Additionally, in TAL block 100 artificial bird nests and salt licks for wildlife have been installed. 2.5 HSE COMPLIANCE In 2015, MOL Group paid penalties for Health, Safety and Environment-related breaches of rules in 11 cases, resulting in total penalties of HUF 21.0 million (USD 75.1 thousand). The largest single penalty (HUF 11 mn) was given to INA d.d. due to non-compliance with waste management regulations and administration during site reconstruction. The Russian subsidiary Matyuskinskaya Vertical was charged HUF 6.8mn for burning associated petroleum gas. Other penalties involved minor costs and are in most cases related to administrative issues such as incorrect site documentation. 235 Notes on Sustainability Performance 3. HEALTH AND SAFETY General aim: Ensure operational HSE excellence ACHIEVEMENTS:   In 2015, all of MOL Group’s maintenance single service companies obtained the internationally-acclaimed Safety Checklist Contractors (SCC) certificate   The number of serious (Tier1) process safety events decreased by 25% compared to 2014   No lost-time injury was recorded during 1.5 and 2.4 million man-hours worked during construction projects for the Butadiene Extraction Unit of MOL Petrochemicals Plc. (former TVK) and LDPE-4 Unit at Slovnaft Refinery (respectively) CHALLENGES:   Multiple contractor fatalities occurred in international upstream operation in Pakistan   Need to decrease road safety incidents  Identify a sufficient number of SCC-certified contractors for all high HSE risk activities   Avoid slips & trips: the primary cause of personal injury 3.1 PERSONAL SAFETY Workforce Safety performance Related objective: “Implement programs that aim for zero incidents” Our objective is to be in the top quartile of Oil and Gas companies in terms of our safety performance by 2020. In 2015, we recorded the lowest-ever number of personal injuries among our employees and contractors combined, both in terms of Lost-time (100) and Non-Lost-time (39) injuries (excluding first-aid cases). Regarding additional indicators, MOL Group started applying the Total recordable injury rate (TRIR) in 2014 as a key leading indicator of personal safety for own and contracted personnel in order to aggregate any workplace injury that needed medical attention (this indicator also includes non-lost-time injuries and thus is wider in scope than the LTIF, described below). This year the number of TRIs for our own and contracted personnel dropped by almost 14%, thus the TRIR for the entire group’s own and contracted activities combined shows a slight improvement (1.44) compared to last year’s performance (1.50), and our Downstream and Upstream businesses performed better than both the IOGP and CONCAWE 2014 industry average. The other important indicator of our safety performance is the frequency of lost-time injuries (LTIF). In terms of our own staff LTIF, the continuous improvements we have made (since 2010) are coming to a halt, as in 2015 INA Group registered a significant increase in their frequency, while MOL Group’s LTIF performance slightly increased from last year resulting in more than 25% increase in MOL Group’s overall performance.

MOL Group own staff LTIF (including filling station staff) by countries in 2015 Other E&P Countries Hungary Slovakia Croatia Europe International 2015 0.94 0.33 2.2 1.24 0 In parallel, we regret to report the sad loss of one of our own and five of our contractors’ employees. These unfortunate incidents resulted in an increase in MOL Group’s Fatal Accident Rate (FAR) to 6.23, which is higher than the IOGP (1.03) and CONCAWE (1.38) benchmark figures. In 2015, all work-related fatalities which occurred were related to road transportation activities, and all contractor fatalities occurred in relation to hazardous material (HAZMAT) road transportation (including shipping, loading and unloading activities). In October 2015, a serious incident occurred at MOL Group’s Pakistani operations when four contractor employees suffered serious burn injuries and later lost their lives after hospitalization. A gas vapour explosion occurred while a road tanker (browser) was being loaded at one of the well sites where simultaneous operations (construction, test production with liquid HAZMAT loading and transportation) were in progress. The subsequent investigation ascertained that several MOL Group international and local technical and HSE standards and Life Saving Rules had been violated. This incident resulted in a meticulous assessment of the entire local OpCo’s (MOL Pakistan) management systems. Workforce Safety Programs The heart of MOL Group’s safety program is called Life Saving Rules (LSR). This is an industry-standard program which focuses on the most important safety rules, the violation of which is likely to result in serious injury or fatality. In 2015, to make compliance with the Life Saving Rules easier, we launched various safety programs at MOL Group companies and operating companies such as Fall protection, Lock-out/Tag-out (LOTO), Stop card and Job safety analysis (JSA) with Last-minute risk assessment (LMRA), with multi-year implementation. After a thorough analysis of all the incidents which resulted in personal injury at MOL Group, we initiated a group-wide campaign and local pilot project on the risks of “slips, trips & falls (at the same height)” hazards for both administrative (office) and operational staff under the slogan “Various sites, same hazards”. Site inspections continued in 2015 with a view to verifying our own workers’ HSE commitment and safe operating practices. We identified a number of violations of Life Saving Rules and some non-compliance issues (other than LSR) and instigated different consequences for rule-breakers. MOL Group launched an HSE Leadership Engagement Program in four countries in which we operate, starting with an anonymous assessment of the safety cultures of both management and shop-floor (blue-collar) workers. This was continued with HSE Leadership Engagement training for the TOP150 managers and leaders of MOL Group in order to develop and improve HSE culture and leadership. Important achievements at MOL Group operational sites include the following: At Slovnaft Refinery the LDPE-4 construction project was completed in Q4 2015. During project implementation an average of 500 (and at peak times, 900) workers from 11 countries were on site at the same time. More than 2.4 million working man-hours were recorded (of which more than 1.2 million hours in 2015) with zero lost-time injuries (LTI). In 2015 during construction of the new Butadiene Extraction Unit of MOL Petrochemicals Plc. total man-hours worked nearly reached 1.5 million with no LTI. At the peak of project implementation 600 personnel were working on the construction installing a total of 12,000 tonnes of concrete, 2,100 tonnes of (reinforcing) steel and 18,000 metres of pipes. Road Safety In 2015, the high number of road accidents (both personal and HAZMAT transportation; 110 vs. 106, respectively) was a major issue, even though the distance driven dropped by more than 7 percent. All MOL Group own employees (1) and contractor (5) fatalities occurred in connection with road transportation (including the shipping, loading and unloading of HAZMAT). In 2015, MOL Group launched a comprehensive Road Safety Program for own and contractor employees. The program focused on two major areas: 1) road transportation, and 2) personal cars. The Road Transportation Program involved light and heavy duty vehicles, including hazardous materials, with a focus on safe truck driving via Truck Drivers’ Safety Fundamentals. 237 Notes on Sustainability Performance The Employees’ Road Safety program is endorsed by a high-level MOL Group manager who suffered a serious road accident in 2014. This program was developed for personal drivers and entails defensive driving training – the training is compulsory for frequent drivers, and optionally available to all drivers who use cars for business purposes. Apart from the fatal accidents, MOL Pakistan significantly decreased the number of HAZMAT road transportation accidents from 20 to 9, with no off-site fatalities. This was due to special measures such as a strict check-list-based inspection of tankers, and implementation of a Logistics Management System (LMS) via a newly established Logistics department. MOL Plc. prepared its first Highway Code e-learning training and mandatory exam for individuals who drive cars for company purposes. The aim of the new online training is to keep MOL employees updated about current regulations and safe driving practices. INA’s Road Safety Program continued in 2015 with a focus on training personnel and extending the program to other INA subsidiaries. A number of INA and STSI employees were trained in practical safe driving. A safety inspection system for vehicles for personal transportation and minibuses dedicated to emergency response and evacuation was introduced at Kalegran in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The GPS tracking of fleet vehicles started in 2015 at IES with the aim of monitoring the driving behaviour of each driver. In May 2015, sales representatives and executive employees participated in a road safety training event organized at the Bonora international circuit. MOL Serbia organized a Road Safety Campaign which involved distributing flyers at service stations during the high traffic season in the summer with tips about safe driving. Additionally, MOL Serbia, in co-operation with authorities, organized an activity called “Every step safe and easy” in the “Little Prince” day-care centre for a total of 134 children. Since 2010 there have been significant improvements in road accident rates (the number of road accidents per 1 million driven kilometres) of other means of transportation at both INA Group and MOL Group. In 2015, however, INA witnessed a slight increase in this indicator, while MOL Group performance continued to improve on a yearly basis. Contractor Safety Related objective: • “Improve contractor HSE management program” • “Introduce comprehensive supplier risk assessment and have prequalification for at least 80% of the critical suppliers in each subsidiary” Given the nature of the industry, one of the most significant challenges in the supply chain is to manage the health, safety and environment (HSE)-related risks of the investment and maintenance works performed by contractor companies. Accordingly, MOL Group applies the same standards to contractors as it does for its own operations. In 2015, the lost-time injury frequency of our contractors improved. In total, we recorded 21 contractor lost-time and 13 non-lost-time injuries which both are 46% lower than for the previous year. However, this LTI number includes the above-mentioned fatalities, as well. Key controls for improving the HSE performance of our contractors include prequalification audits, a detailed HSE Appendix for contracts, compulsory 24/7 HSE supervision by the main contractor in case of large complex projects, a HSE Plan, Job Safety Analysis for critical works, strict enforcement of Life Saving Rules, regular site inspections, and post evaluation of HSE performance. To minimize risks through the entire value chain, only two levels of subcontractors are allowed. Consideration of HSE starts as early as the stage of selection of suppliers. In 2015, the following steps were undertaken: • Development of a new, comprehensive and integrated vendor management solution (a platform for financial, legal, ethics and HSE pre-screening and initial risk assessment) • During the technical evaluation of bids, companies with a high post-evaluation score and specific HSE certificates could obtain extra points (worth up to 5%). • In the future it is planned that only companies with an SCC/VCA certificate (Safety Checklist for Contractors) will be contracted for high HSE risk activities in all European, on-shore operations. To demonstrate their commitment to live up to this requirement, by the end of 2015 all maintenance single service companies of MOL Group (Petrolszolg Kft. in Hungary, SMaO in Slovakia and STSI in Croatia, altogether employing ca. 2,200 employees) obtained this certificate. SCC is a safety framework that focuses on the risks and challenges of contractor work and also includes an employee certification scheme (in Hungary 750 workers and supervisors attended a 2-day training event). • I n 2015, a total of 348 contracts for high HSE risk activities (with a total value of EUR 587 mn) were signed and 348 companies were audited for prequalification to make sure they comply with the technical and HSE requirements of projects. • As part of the strategic sustainability plan, in Hungary a total of 3 supplier sustainability audits were conducted. The companies which were visited agreed to implement corrective activities that go beyond the field of HSE. Number of HSE supplier pre-qualification audits by significant regions in 2015 [GRI G4-LA14 G4-EN32] Number of HSE supplier E&P Hungary Slovakia Croatia Italy Total pre-qualification audits INTERNATIONAL 2015 187 21 11 5 124 348 During the completion of a project, several measures are applied to minimize the risk of any HSE incidents: • Supplier Forums are organised to inform contractors about actual topics and prepare them for upcoming projects such as refinery turnarounds. • MOL Group internal regulation requires each main contractor to guarantee 24/7 HSE supervision during work (in the case of high-risk, complex projects). • Every on-site contractor is obliged to participate in basic HSE induction training and pass a test once a year. At the group level, a total of 10,659 site inspections were performed to manage the HSE performance of contractors. In the case of almost 2,000 audits in which instances of non-compliances were found, corrective activities were initiated and penalties were imposed, where applicable. In 29 cases workers were banned from the site, and in 131 cases written warnings were sent out. In 2015, no contracts were terminated because of HSE breaches. Safety programs have been implemented for contractors as well, including Job Safety Analysis, Stop Card system and/or the Last Minute Risk Assessment. In Slovnaft, a new system was launched which means that near misses, unsafe acts and conditions can now be reported in SMS format through an easy-to-remember phone number. 3.2 HEALTH PROTECTION AND PROMOTION Occupational Health Related objective: “Implement programs to ensure a healthy workplace” In 2015, similarly to previous years, no occupational illnesses were recorded across the entire MOL Group. Having a healthy workplace is critical to MOL Group’s success. We aim to operate a number of local programs in order to protect employees’ health, to ensure that appropriate medical responses and treatment are given, to manage stress and to encourage employees to lead a healthy lifestyle by minding their work-life balance. In addition, in 2015 MOL Group became a signatory party to the Safe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene at the Workplace (WASH) initiative and hence pledges to provide access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene at the workplace at an appropriate standard for all employees at all premises. In 2015, a comprehensive health protection and promotion gap analysis was conducted across MOL Group operations. The scope of the analysis included industrial hygiene risk assessment, fitness-for-duty medical evaluations, medical emergency processes, ergonomics and rehabilitation in order to estimate pre-existing gaps and to facilitate the design of action plans for their elimination through a process of harmonization. In general, annual fitness-for-duty medical evaluations are based on the above workplace risk assessment and are therefore even stricter than the relevant country regulations. We have intensified our efforts to introduce measures to completely eliminate even the possibility that employees are exposed to carcinogenic chemicals. For example, a comprehensive prevention strategy was implemented at the Danube Refinery. Our cytogenetic program – a leading monitoring program in the Oil and Gas industry – also continued to be implemented at MOL Plc. A total of 110 employees were examined. 239 Notes on Sustainability Performance Regular biological monitoring continued for MOL Plc. operational unit workers, for Slovnaft risk category 3 Employees (who are at risk of carcinogenic compound exposure during daily activities), and for 198 employees at Petrolszolg Ltd. 1 overexposure was found in the latter group. During 2015, INA d.d. (Croatia) sent 130 employees with different medical statuses (employed at different positions) to a ten-day Medically Programmed Active Vacation (MPAV) at SPA TOPUSKO which is renowned for the beneficial effects of its thermal water. Qualitative health risk assessments were carried out through the Special assessment of work place environment framework in Russia and in the Central Processing Facility (CPF) and Gas Processing Facility (GPF) in Pakistan. No staff with potential occupational diseases were identified. Additional ambient air sampling for Hydrocarbons (BTEX), noise and vibration monitoring was carried out at potential sites for different MOL Group operations. A stress Management Campaign was simultaneously launched at the Branch Office and at CPF of MOL Pakistan in 2015. Workplace Health Promotion At MOL Plc. (Hungary) more than 7,100 employees participated approximately 21,000 times in different Workplace Health Promotion programs in 2015, especially at medical screenings, movement-based activities and vaccinations. At Petrolszolg mobile massage and gym projects continued with a total of nearly 1,900 visits. 78 employees of MOL Plc. participated in the 30th Budapest Wizzair Half-marathon, while 27 employees from MOL Slovenia participated in the 3 biggest marathon events in Slovenia (Radenci, Maribor and Ljubljana). Their registration fee was covered by the STEP program for the first time. At INA (Croatia) the aim of the “Running challenge of the 21st century” campaign was to promote and educate employees about the positive effects of sporting activities on human health, and to encourage them and their families to stay active. All INA employees have access to the “Ask our Doctors“ service which enables them to send questions related to occupational health matters and health in general to contracted company occupational medicine specialists, or to arrange a personal visit. A preventive Health Care Programme was launched at the branch office (BO), as well as at CPF/GPF of MOL Pakistan where awareness-raising sessions were held at both locations. Selected employees were evaluated for GCT (Glucose, Triglycerides and Cholesterol), BMI, Blood Pressure and Vitamin D levels. At BaiTex in Russia, all employees are encouraged and supported to engage in sporting activity such as playing volleyball (men) or visiting the ice palace and gym (women). BaiTex's volleyball team participated in the ‘Festival of Working Sport’ in Buguruslan. 3.3 PROCESS SAFETY AND RISK ASSESSMENT Process Safety Management Related objectives: “Strengthen facility safety, improve rating in benchmarks” The main goal of process safety management (PSM) is to establish and operate an efficient management system which ensures the prevention of technology-related process incidents and protects people, assets and environment against harm. Implementation of the Process Safety Management system in MOL Group started in 2006. Our PSM-related goal is to continuously decrease the number and severity of process incidents and be in the top 25 percentile of CONCAWE and IOGP benchmarks. In 2015, there were 41 TIER1-2 Process Safety Events (PSEs) at MOL Group which is a decrease of 4 events compared to 2014. Although the number of events was lower than previous years, the consequences of these events were more severe than they have ever been in MOL Group’s history. Number of TIER 1-2 process safety events in MOL Group companies in 2015 [GRI G4-LA14] 2015 Process Safety Events HUNGARY SLOVAKIA CROATIA UPSTREAM MOL Group ITALY (IES) (PSE) (MOL+TVK) (SLOVNAFT) (INA) INTERNATIONAL PSE TIER 1 9 2 1 4 0 2 PSE TIER 2 32 17 8 4 0 3 PSE TIER 1+2 41 19 9 8 0 5 The financial cost to MOL Group of TIER 1 process safety events was approximately 9 mn USD in 2015 – of which indirect losses due to business interruptions represent 90% of the cost. The MOL Group TIER 1-2 process safety events trend is shown in the following chart: *Note: TIER 1 category events are more serious from a consequence point-of-view than TIER 2 category events. Categorization is based on API RP 754. MOL Group TIER 1-2 PSE trend 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 2013 2014 2015 TIER1 TIER2 Top Management commitment especially that of MOL Group’s CEO towards PSM, was demonstrated during PSM implementation status visits at 3 locations (MOL and Slovnaft Production, INA Croatia). In 2014, we started the tradition of organizing an annual PSM best practice sharing workshop. In 2015, this workshop was held in October. It was a great opportunity to share and understand good/best practices in process safety from Downstream and Upstream business sectors, as well as from the non-MOL Group invitee, Česka Rafinerska (Czech Republic). The efficiency and level of PSM system implementation is continuously monitored and measured. To measure the level of implementation we use PSM Cross audits (based on an annual audit plan) where implementation of selected PSM elements are compared with predefined audit questionnaires. In 2015, there were 17 cross audits and the overall evaluation of PSM implementation shows an improvement, especially in Process Safety Information, Management of Change and Emergency Planning and Response elements. For these elements the scores were over 90%. Implementation of all elements requires a systematic approach and continuous effort to keep the system functional. Besides internal audits, in 2015 an external company (AON Risk Solutions) also performed 2 external assessments of implemented safety related processes and technical solutions. One of the assessments was done at MOL Petrochemicals site in Hungary. The result of the assessment was a risk rating which categorized the risks analysed as ‘Standard’ compared to similar facilities elsewhere in the world. Local implementation of PSM-related programs was continuously followed-up at the Group PSM Forum, where businesses had to report on local activities. In 2015, the main focus was placed on Mechanical Integrity by launching the UPTIME program. UPTIME is designed to increase reliability and significantly reduce the number of unplanned shutdowns in Downstream. The importance of the project was proved by the UPTIME survey which shows that employees are strongly engaged with the program. 241 Notes on Sustainability Performance Significant improvements were also made with regard to the Management of Change process, especially in MOL Plc. and Slovnaft, and in Fire Hazard Analysis which was prepared or updated in MOL, Slovnaft and MOL Pakistan. Emergency response and crisis management Emergency and crisis preparedness has clear business relevance to the Oil and Gas industry, and improving and maintaining emergency response capabilities is crucially important. In 2015, MOL Group initiated several new projects to increase the emergency and crisis response capabilities of MOL Group in 2015. Accordingly, we increased the involvement of all affected and interested business and functional stakeholders by reviewing their roles in potential crisis situations. In parallel, we raised awareness of process preparation. We also deeply examined events which represent a potential threat to MOL Group operations. FER Fire Brigade and Service Ltd. (a MOL Hungary Subsidiary) organized the 8th International Conference for Fire Brigades in the High Hazard Industry in Budapest. This conference is organized every second year and offers a great chance for international professionals to explore the latest developments in this field. 4. HUMAN CAPITAL General aim: “Building capability and enhancing organizational performance at times of turbulent change” ACHIEVEMENTS:  Group E&P and Group HR implemented a Technical Career Ladder (TCL) across the E&P community in 2015 and allocated 940 petro-technical professionals (PTPs) to 7 TCL levels through 14 Job Families  MOL Group won the Getenergy 2015 Award in the category of ‘Education Partnership’ for partnering with the University of Engineering & Technology (UET) of Peshawar  MOL Group won Workforce Optimas Awards in the category of Global Outlook for a change in the compensation and benefits model in MOL Pakistan that efficiently reduced staff turnover  MOL Group’s Intensity leadership program developed 489 leaders and attained an overall course satisfaction rate of 83%  186 graduates joined MOL Group as Growww 2015 program participants in 11 countries, with 36% of positions offered to women, which is above the industry’s gender split average CHALLENGES:  A scarcity of mid-level careers on the market is shrinking the available skills pool  Increasing speed of change, industry downturns and market volatility affect the talent pool 4.1 ATTRACTING EMPLOYEES Related objectives: • “ Talent acquisition approach tailored to attracting young professionals with geosciences and engineering background in order to secure talent pipeline for Exploration & Production” • “Implement programs to ensure early engagement of the young generation who are seeking a way into the Oil and Gas industry” The entire Oil and Gas industry is in the middle of a human resources transition. The scarcity of mid-level careers on the market combined with a high percent of retirees has shrunk the available skill pool. Furthermore, the appearance of Generation Y on the global labour market means that employers must meet different expectations. MOL Group has built a talent acquisition and recruitment strategy to attract and hire talented graduates to fill technical and managerial positions from the bottom-up. The pillars of MOL Group’s talent acquisition strategy are the secondary school programs Junior Freshhh and MyMentor, Freshhh and the UPPP international student competitions and the graduate recruitment and development program Growww. The secondary school programs support the early engagement of the young generation in natural sciences. The Freshhh program promotes the attractiveness and complexity of the Oil and Gas industry and the overall international activities of MOL Group. UPPP is the dedicated Exploration & Production international talent acquisition program of the company. The best performing students have the chance to start their careers at MOL Group via the newly established 18-month UPPP Technical Placement Program. This program offers state-of-the-art talent development including business and technical curricula, MOL Group HQ exposure and on-site experience in the E&P operations of MOL Group. The Growww graduate recruitment and development program, launched in 2007, provides graduates with a unique opportunity to start their career in a global company and to build work experience through training, on-the-job assignments and mentoring from the best professionals in various Oil and Gas disciplines in an intercultural working environment. Further to the programs mentioned earlier, MOL Group is investing heavily into its social media strategy and presence to appear as an attractive and desired employer on the global market. MOL Group’s programs and efforts are increasingly internationally recognized. In 2015, the company won 3 prestigious international awards related to its talent acquisition programs: • HR Distinction Award in Employer Branding • Getenergy Awards 2015 (Education Partnership category) • Global HR award at HRO Today Europe Forum (1st place in Innovation in HR Technology) Educational Partnerships Secondary schools To start attracting and engaging young talents at an early stage in the Oil and Gas industry, and to encourage them to choose a STEM-based (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) long-term career path, MOL Group companies maintain close, ongoing contact with secondary grammar schools and vocational schools. In 2015, the ‘MyMentor’ program continued and 12 professors were selected out of 560 nominations in Hungary, Croatia and Slovakia. Junior Freshhh was launched for the second time in Croatia, the third time in Slovakia and for the sixth time in Hungary. A total of almost 1,200 teams registered from the 3 countries of Hungary, Croatia and Slovakia in 2015. MOL Group companies also maintain partnerships with relevant vocational schools to ensure that blue-collar talent continues to flow. University concept and partnerships MOL Group is committed to helping maintain the long-term talent pipeline. As a result, the company nurtures and seeks out strategic partnerships with universities and faculties from relevant fields. For example, MOL Group instigated a successful collaboration between MOL Pakistan and the University of Engineering & Technology (UET) Peshawar, which is the largest engineering university in the province in which MOL Pakistan operates. To date, the university has provided MOL Pakistan with nearly 70 graduate engineers, thus helping to meet growing business needs and playing its role as a true strategic partner. Through this partnership, MOL Group won the Getenergy 2015 Award in the category of education partnership announced on June 15th in London. MOL, INA and Slovnaft have an ongoing, long-term cooperation with local universities that provide Oil and Gas-industry relevant education, and MOL Group sponsors international student associations (e.g. BEST) and professional events that are organized for students. Talent acquisition programs Freshhh is MOL Group’s innovative online university student competition that targets potential future MOL Group employees from across the globe. The most talented students have the opportunity to secure direct entry into MOL Group’s Growww graduate selection process. Since the competition started in 2007, more than 20,000 students have participated. In 2015, a record number (2,210) of three-member teams from 70 countries have applied to enter the competition. In 2015, 1,114 three-member teams applied for the UPPP talent acquisition program from 45 countries, ranging from the UK and Central Europe to the Middle East. Based on an evaluation by the jury, the top three teams won a total of 25,000 euros. From the 2014 competition, 9 young talents started their careers in the 18-month UPPP EDU Technical Placement Program during 2015 and received a best-in-class professional and business education to ensure their rapid development. In terms of the Growww programme in 2015, 186 new Growwwers joined MOL Group in 25 companies from 11 countries. The proportion of female Growwwers is 36%, which is well above MOL Group’s and the industry’s gender split average. More than 1,700 graduates have joined MOL Group through the Growww program since 2007. 243 Notes on Sustainability Performance 4.2 RETAINING AND REWARDING EMPLOYEES Related objective: • “Boost pay for performance culture of MOL Group by providing a competitive and motivational reward scheme that encourages outstanding business results” • “Integrated Annual People Cycle incorporates performance and career management, resulting in a structured approach to development and succession planning” In 2015, the market environment was globally less favourable in the Oil and Gas industry. As a result, MOL Group’s total headcount decreased by 6% compared to 2014. However, this decrease is the result of a series of long-term activities which were undertaken in line with business objectives. The major reasons for the decline include the ongoing optimization program at INA Group and its subsidiaries, changes in the operating models of retail service stations on selected markets, the outsourcing of transactional activities in support functions and a change in the scope of consolidated companies. Competitive compensation MOL Group compensation schemes are designed to reinforce a merit-based culture by clearly motivating employees to continuously raise the performance bar for great results. MOL Group aligns and harmonizes compensation across the Group in companies with similar business profiles by applying tailored remuneration strategies, taking into consideration the local company’s available financial resources and market position. To implement the above-described principles, MOL Group uses the international Total Remuneration approach which involves structuring major compensation elements, including the Annual Base Salary, Shortand Long Term Incentives and Benefits that together represent MOL Group's compensation strategy. The cornerstone of the compensation and benefits architecture is the international HAY job systematisation methodology. Since 2014, when single and transparent group-level job evaluation methodology and grading guidelines were introduced, MOL Group has created a consistent job systematization and compensation structure through which companies apply the same remuneration principles. By end of 2015, MOL Group had achieved 100% HAY coverage at its companies.

Group-level compensation policies are transparent and are published in group and local regulations that are made accessible to all employees. Company-level rules are also defined by Collective Agreements (CA). Short and long term incentives The strategy behind MOL Group remuneration is to incentivise employees through a combination of short-term and long-term initiatives. The aim of the MOL Short Term Incentive system is to focus participants on achieving challenging financial, operational and individual performance goals which reflect the delivery of key annual business priorities within the framework of MOL Group’s longterm strategy. The purpose of the Long Term Incentive system is to drive and reward the delivery of sustainable value creation and to ensure that there is complete alignment between MOL Group senior & top management and the strategic interests of shareholders. The Long Term Incentive system consists of two elements: a Stock Option Plan and a Performance Share Plan. Employee wellbeing and benefits MOL Group cares for a constantly changing and diverse, multigenerational workforce whose benefit and wellbeing needs are being met through a wide range of programs, benefits and initiatives that affect the most important dimensions of their lives, including health & wellbeing, financial wellbeing, workplace environment and social care. Investments in employee wellbeing are contributing to keeping employees engaged, helping them reach their full potential, and keeping them productive and innovative. To ensure that there is a wide range of health & wellbeing options to choose from, MOL Group increases the value of its Total Remuneration using competitive benefit schemes. When basic benefit elements are defined, local legislation, the tax environment and competitiveness on local markets are evaluated, together with overall group-level consistency. Besides local benefit and wellbeing programs, MOL Group covers employees with life and accident insurance in more than 50 companies, providing one-off payments to employees in the case of ‘term life’ and accidental events, with 24 hour worldwide coverage. Annual People Cycle (APC) The Annual People Cycle programme at MOL Group aims to foster a culture of high-performance and ensure that individual targets are aligned with the group’s strategic goals. The process covers performance management and career and development planning and ensures that these are planned and executed in a more accurate, credible, fair, consistent and transparent way. In 2015, the process was thoroughly reviewed, further streamlined and simplified in order to ensure tighter alignment with business needs and adaptability to a changing environment. By introducing the mid-year review step in 2015, the cycle has become an on-going process of target setting and target achievement review and adjustment, when needed, to reflect the changing environment and needs, development, discussions and receipt of feedback. This process facilitates an effective conversation about performance that is critical for organizations in order for them to be able to rapidly react and adapt to changing business requirements. Through the introduction of the new Annual People Cycle IT platform, managers now save 45% of the time they formerly spent administrating the process and can use this time implementing the high-quality program and providing feedback on an ongoing basis. MOL’s Managerial Performance Management System aligns three target elements and their evaluation: corporate, divisional and individual targets. Besides key financial indicators, sustainable development, health, safety, environment and HR-related targets are also considered and are consistently cascaded down the organisation from top management to lower managerial levels. Our Employee Performance Management System (EPMS) ties corporate targets to individual performance through a differentiated employee bonus pay-out, in line with the outcomes of performance evaluation. MOL Group is working to extend EPMS, with the goal of covering all of the companies within the Group. 245 Notes on Sustainability Performance Career Management system (CMS) & Development processes enable the organization to develop and retain identified talent. During People Review Meetings, talent is reviewed and development plans and career paths are defined. As part of improving the process at MOL Plc., in 9 operational companies (covering cca. 1,000 employees), a technical system has been rolled out which further supports high-quality process accomplishment. At INA, after the first EPMS cycle based on business needs and feedback the process was revised and adjustments made with effect from 1st January 2016 in order to ensure enhanced business results and the existence of an appropriate incentive system. As of 2016, the EPMS process has been implemented at 5 additional companies (covering cca. 1,600 employees).

We deploy biannually an employee engagement survey (the Roundtable Survey) in most of our companies within MOL Group and many of our locations worldwide. Between two survey cycles we also conduct a ‘Pulse Check’ with several focus groups in order to evaluate the overall success of the action plans and to define additional opportunities for improvement. In 2015, we reduced the number of questions by almost 50% and we now provide the option to respond to the survey using different methods, from an online version to mobile phones. Approximately 50 companies participated in the survey from 16 countries across the Group. The overall group response rate was 80%; a significant increase of 18% compared to the overall response rate for the previous survey cycle. Employee engagement survey results (%) Employee Engagement Results 2008 2010 2012/13 2015 Coverage 90 90 96 85 Response rate 50 64 62 80 Engagement level 67 70 47* 45 * The engagement methodology changed in 2012 due to the engagement of a new service provider. As a result, the engagement data in the table do not show the trend for engagement from 2010 to 2012 since the basis of calculation is different. Compared to 2010 results, the difference is a 2% point decrease. Employee engagement decreased by 2 percentage points in the 2015 survey, which is due to, among others, organisational changes prompted by volatile market conditions at the time of the survey, even if response rate was particularly high (80%). At a regional level there are many activities being implemented to increase the overall level of engagement. Some of the best practices are described below. At MOL Plc. the MOL Hungary Program was one of the first steps we undertook to establish the basis of a common language in order to contribute to employee engagement, to increase the credibility of management and to support employee well-being. As the result of the MOL Leadership Codex, 4 focus areas were defined that measure managers’ leadership skills and ways of working. The Leadership Codex included 20 workshops for managers (about 200 participants), 25 shift leader workshops (about 250 participants), and 360-degree evaluations of managers. During 2015, INA focused on developing champions as change agents. As a result, the Leading Positive Organizational Change program was launched. This is an initiative for empowering champions with the skills they need to prepare the process of change, to implement change and to motivate and manage people during the change process. Also, several team workshops were organized in order to increase employee participation in action plan design by using a specific methodological process of team/individual change management. After the workshops, action plans were created and implemented during 2015. 4.3 DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN CAPITAL Related objectives: “Build leadership capabilities, fill technical competency development gaps and have a global leadership competency framework” To respond to the increasing speed of change and inevitable market volatility, MOL Group adapts its people development practices in order to remain agile and stay ahead of the change curve.

In 2015, MOL Group rolled out mission-critical global people development programs to support the strategic transformation of MOL Group. These learning interventions focused on two subjects:  trengthening technical capabilities. To meet the Oil and Gas industrial challenges of the 21st century, professionals at all 1. S levels need to acquire fresh sets of skills. 2. Building leadership capabilities. Besides equipping the current leaders with the necessary new skill sets, MOL Group is building its next generation of global leaders via its unique talent programs 247 Notes on Sustainability Performance Technical capacity building MOL Group HR has identified ways to manage human resources through industry downturns and market volatility in a way that mitigates risks to personnel and enhances organizational strength and performance over time. To clarify roles, work and key competence requirements in most critical technical jobs, MOL Group has introduced and is continuously expanding its Technical Competency Management system. The system defines competency expectations according to job roles. It grants access to training in line with the outcomes of competency assessments and tracks progress against learning objectives. To build sustainable internal capabilities and transfer knowledge in critical roles, MOL Group introduced a Technical Career Ladder in its E&P business for core petrotechnical jobs for the first time in 2015. MOL Group has also created a targeted highimpact learning program for its petrotechnical early-career talent pool to accelerate their development. Employees enrolled in Technical Competency Measurement (number of people) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Exploration & Production 630 650 750 850 1,100 Downstream 230 500 750 950 950 HSE 30 30 300 300 Total 860 1,180 1,530 2,100 2,350 E&P HR Workstream Further to the above, in June 2014 E&P and HR started a Technical Capability Building program to provide every petro-technical employee with a structured career path and a targeted development program. After the design phase in 2014, the focus in 2015 was on implementation across the E&P community. The different elements of the program have been developed and implemented with the involvement of the technical E&P community, the most important achievements for 2015 being: • Determining 4 Disciplines and 14 Job Families • Defining 7 clear and consistent Technical Career Ladder (TCL) levels • Developing 34 competence models and learning curricula during more than 150 workshops and 50 SMEs • Allocating 940 petro-technical professionals (PTPs) a Technical Career Ladder (through completion of technical selfand cross-assessments) • Starting the Mentor Program and nominating 36 Mentors for 106 Mentees • Involving 33 UPPPers and Growwwers in the UPPP EDU program The three most significant, tangible achievements are related to: • The reallocation of cca. 106 PTPs to the appropriate level of their career ladder • Assigning to each PTP a tailor-made two-year Individual Development Plan • Approval of the 2016-2017 technical training budget The implementation period for the E&P HR Workstream finished in 2015; from now on all these activities will be part of the annual cycle and a component of regular work. Leadership development MOL Group maintains its focus on its leadership population in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to achieve the group’s business objectives and secure its future, even in extreme market conditions. After the success of LEAD I. (MOL’s leadership education program for the Group’s top talents), we launched a second generation of LEAD in 2015 in partnership with the regionally acknowledged Cotrugli School of Business (Croatia) and the globally-renowned Thunderbird Global School of Management (USA). LEAD is organized around three nested leadership talent pools. LEAD I. proved to be of great assistance in strengthening the Group’s management. 47% of the participants were promoted within 2 years of the start of the program. MOL Group’s modular leadership development program, INTENSITY (run in co-operation with Management Centre Europe (MCE), the largest provider of talent development programs in Europe and the Middle East) has proven to be successful based on the first year’s experience. During the first year (2015) MOL Group developed 489 leaders and successors in the program through 48 courses, and attained an overall course satisfaction rate of 83%. As a reward for this achievement, INTENSITY won the Leadership Excellence Award for ‘Best Use of Classroom Training’ offered by HR.com based on feedback from INTENSITY participants. Downstream division-specific programs HOST Program: MOL Group decided to better utilise its continuously developing service station network across the CEE region. MOL Group Retail wanted to do this by differentiating itself significantly from its traditional fuel retail competition. To this end, Retail defined its strategy in 2014 and created a fundamentally new concept that puts the customer experience at the forefront. The “Attendant to HOST” Programme targets cultural change and the transition of staff behaviour from inward-looking to more customer-focused. After the tendering procedure, the procurement process will be closed in Q1 2016 when we plan to launch the next phase of the project with an external partner. PIMS Academy 2015: in co-operation with the Hungarian University of Pannonia, MOL Group re-launched an accredited postgraduate course in September 2015. The program (organized every second year) helps educate specialists to be able to deal with the complex challenges of Oil and Gas supply chain business activities by providing them with solid knowledge about professional, market-leading software. Production Rotation: MOL Group's Production Rotation Program is a great opportunity for experts working at DS Production sites across the Group to work & learn for 1-2 months at a site other than their current workplace. In 2015, nearly 30 employees participated in the programme. 4.4 COMMITMENT TO FAIR EMPLOYMENT Related objective: “Enhance responsible employer practices to ensure the engagement and diversity of the workforce” Employee relations MOL Group is supportive of the freedom of association and collective bargaining, and is committed to continuously improving social dialogue. In 2015, according to a weighted-average calculation based on data provided by MOL’s European Work Council, more than half of all employees were represented by trade unions in companies where such representation is possible (94.9% of all employees). Trade unions and collective bargaining agreements (%) [GRI G4-11] 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Employees covered by trade unions 95 95 96 94 95 Employees covered by collective 95 92 90 89 92 bargaining agreements One example of such employee representation is the New Europe Program which was extended in 2015 for the period 2016-2020. This agreement between MOL Group and the European Works Council has been in place since 2006, providing a framework for the key activities that contribute to the sustainable and responsible operating of MOL Group. The Program focuses on six areas (Social Dialogue, Talent Acquisition and Management, Capability Development, Reward and Recognition, Diversity and Inclusion, Health Protection and Promotion, Occupational and Process Safety), and, in line with the key directions elaborated for each area, it defines measures which should be implemented for the benefit of employees between 2016 and 2020. The European Works Council represents employees at the group level. The European Works Council contains members from all major subsidiaries. Employee representatives (one third of all members) on MOL’s supervisory board are delegated by MOL Plc’s Works Council. 249 Notes on Sustainability Performance At MOL Plc. (Hungary) employee representatives are invited to Collective Agreement (CA) negotiations, professional discussions about CA-related issues and a process of commenting related to the activities of employer and works councils meetings (on a monthly basis). In 2015, a total of 51 sessions took place with the objective of promoting information-sharing. Further to this, 35 meetings took place which involved discussions and/or negotiation about specific topics. The Works Council (WC) of INA, Plc. in Croatia was established in 2011 and has 25 members. The employer engages in ongoing dialogue with the Works Council in the following areas: consultation, presentation of company business plans, participation in employee assemblies organized by the Works Council (2 assemblies were held in 2015) and the provision of support to facilitate Works Council operations and trade union (TU) activities in accordance with the law and the collective agreements. 22 meetings were held with social partners (WC & TUs). 15 meetings with TUs which resulted in agreement about 2 social clauses for workers were held. All INA employees have the chance to join a trade union. At INA, Plc. 5 trade unions are active: the Oil Industries Trade Union INAŠ, the Oil Industry Union SING, the Autonomous Trade Union of Workers in Energy, Chemistry and Non-Metal Industry of Croatia – EKN, the Croatian Drivers’ Trade Union – SHV, and the New Solidarity Trade Union – SNS. 34 meetings were held between Slovnaft (Slovakia) and trade union representatives in 2015. Slovnaft undertakes to respect the right of any employee to be a member of a trade union. The topic of the health and safety of employees is an integral part of the agreements and discussions which are held with trade unions. More examples from different MOL Group companies can be found in subchapter Health Protection and Promotion above. Diversity and inclusion Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) is an important pillar and key driver of MOL Group’s overall Human Capital platform and is crucial for sustaining the strength of international growth. MOL Group’s Diversity & Inclusion vision is to build a stronger company by fostering an inclusive culture that leverages diversity as a competitive advantage. With strong support across the business, MOL Group is committed to promoting a culture of diversity and to creating an environment that allows the global workforce of diverse backgrounds, experiences and perspectives to contribute to collaboratively achieving results without boundaries. MOL Group fosters equal opportunities for all employees and job applicants, irrespective of race, colour, religion, gender, national origin or age. MOL Group’s Diversity & Inclusion strategy addresses 3 key elements: internationalization, the retention of young talents and knowledge transfer between generations. Internationalization is clearly visible at MOL Group’s HQ, where 14% of all employees (representing 29 nationalities), are nonHungarian. Moreover, more than 280 employees are working on international assignments. Meanwhile, the proportion of female Growww program participants is at around 36%. To support the second pillar of the diversity strategy, the MOL Group Diversity employee value proposition was created to attract and retain young talent (Generation Y). One significant achievement is the Flexible Working Arrangements Program that was launched to improve business efficiency and leverage productivity and individual innovation while promoting employees’ worklife balance through the provision of flexible working opportunities. Part-time employment is also increasing. The technical career ladder for the E&P workforce was also introduced, as described in the section on Development above. Part-time employment at MOL Group 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Part-time employees (number of people) 191 261 293 263 282 380 Proportion of part-time employees to total 0.59% 0.83% 0.99% 0.91% 1.03% 1.46% workforce (%) MOL’s Women Leadership Network was initiated to strengthen the communication, collaboration and professional networking of MOL’s female leaders, and to promote knowledge transfer between different generations. Approximately 60 female leaders across MOL Group participated in a group-level event dedicated to this network in July 2015. To further support our Diversity & Inclusion strategy, a comprehensive framework was developed to help generate new initiatives on an ongoing basis during 2015 and 2016. Preparations had already commenced in 2015 for creating employee networks such as the D&I Champions Network and Employee Resource Groups (for example, the Young Employee Network, and the Multicultural Network, etc.) to bring people together. Also, a brand new program – FEMMe: the Female Engineers MOL Program Me was initiated to address the key challenges which women face in the Oil and Gas industry. In 2015, INA partnered with MAMFORCE to pursue certification in the Mamforce basic standard. This standard is awarded to organizations that recognize the needs of their employees and that manage to organize work and working environment while respecting the principle of maintaining a balance between a professional and private life, along with the equal growth and development of each employee. MOL Group is committed to ensuring equal opportunities in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and reward processes for all employees. In Hungary, the employee representation bodies and the Company signed MOL Plc.’s 3rd Equal Opportunity Plan in 2015 (for the period 20152017). Equal Opportunity Plans with similar content have been also signed and made public by our affiliate companies MOL Petrochemicals and Petrolszolg Ltd. In terms of rehabilitation procedures, MOL Group pays special attention to employees whose ability to work has changed and those with disabilities. If the ability to work any of MOL’s employees is reduced, then the Company will always investigate further employment options. MOL operates a rehabilitation committee to support this process. On the one hand, MOL has assessed the positions at MOL Plc. which can be filled by employees with disabilities. Additionally, new recruitment channels for employees with disabilities have been identified and can now be used. On the other hand, we also track the number of employees with a reduced working capability to be able to provide better opportunities for these employees. Since legal definitions of reduced work capability vary by country, we use our own internal definition. Our aim is to be able to provide employment for everyone, which is a challenging goal in an industry where employees often do heavy physical work. In 2015, 545 people with reduced work capability were employed throughout MOL Group, which represents 2.3% compared to total headcount. At MOL Plc. 12 disabled people were employed in 2015, which resulted in HUF 9.8 million savings on the rehabilitation contribution the company would have to pay otherwise. 5. COMMUNITIES General aim: Enhance trust and credibility among stakeholders ACHIEVEMENTS:  In 2015, MOL Group supported social investment projects with 0.27% of its EBITDA, or 1.9 billion HUF in absolute terms (excluding leveraged donations derived from tax-base decreasing donation instruments)  8 0% of MOL Group member companies had issued Local Operative Regulations about social engagement by the end of 2015  The London Benchmarking Group (LBG) social investment measurement model was deployed in international upstream operations CHALLENGES:  Managing community concerns and introducing local grievance management systems to an increasing number of sites  Establishing a long-term strategy together with local communities and not-for-profit organizations in operational areas outside Europe 5.1 COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS Related objectives: • “Develop a group-level social engagement plan” • “All countries to have an annually updated social engagement plan, implementing key pillars of engagement” By 2015, we had managed to deploy our social engagement plan to 80% of all companies within MOL Group. Most of the countries where MOL Group operates are now covered. 251 Notes on Sustainability Performance Community engagement Community engagement is all about hearing the voice of communities which live in the vicinity of operational areas, understanding their needs, social and environmental concerns and priorities and forming partnerships that increase the prosperity and sustainability of the communities, as well as support the reliable business operations of the company. MOL Group and its member companies engage with local stakeholders in several different ways. The most common is through sitelevel relationships, public hearings and joint activities. General operation-related concerns are usually related to operating technologies (e.g. seismic measures, or investment projects that have environmental effects such as noise, emissions, or immissions). Naturally, we maintain ongoing communication with authorities and official bodies related to the regulatory environment and our license to operate. Responses, comments and suggestions acquired through consultations and dialogue with the opinion leaders and representatives of main interest groups are used as a valuable source of information in activity planning. In addition, we also have some special ways of engaging which are designed to shape people’s attitudes and ways of thinking about how sustainability can be promoted. At the end of 2014, MOL Group issued new internal regulations about social engagement to provide group-level guidance about principles and practices related to engagement with local communities and the process of identifying and involving stakeholders. This covers interactions with local community stakeholders, including opinion leaders, municipalities, associations, non-profit organisations and foundations during standard business operations. 80% of MOL Group member companies had already issued respective local regulations by the end of 2015. Activities deriving from the implementation of the regulation are used to create individual company/site/operation-level Social Engagement strategies and plans, and as of December 2015, these will be reported on an annual basis to the Sustainable Development Committee of the Board of Directors of MOL Group. As an element of community interaction, we also focus on managing grievances. MOL Group considers each grievance notification from a community to be significant. Both in Pakistan and in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq MOL Group has local procedures in place for grievance management. To receive and manage grievances from both internal and external stakeholders we also operate an online grievance management system through which anybody can submit an ethical notification. One of the most frequent causes of local grievance is the environmental concern of local communities. In 2015, 42 grievances related to environmental issues were received by our operational sites. Non-European Operations In international upstream operations, relationships in the industry with local communities, governments and partners alike are fundamental to fulfilling MOL Group’s mission. Maintaining a continuous flow of information is the cornerstone of any cooperative efforts between a company and the local community, and is ensured by Community Relationship Officers wherever needed. Community Relationship Officers are MOL Group employees from the indigenous population. These individuals are the primary contact points for local communities. Anyone can freely contact them any time regarding business activities, and they also survey the need for social investment activities. Community Relationship Officers also play a crucial role in selecting from requests for support by the local population, while adhering to central, corporate objectives. European Operations In the Central-Eastern European region, we are capitalizing on existing relationships with municipalities and governments. The most important operational sites of MOL Group in Europe are facilities with up to 50 years of history. Our relationship with the communities that surround our facilities is well-established and its management is part of daily operations. Slovnaft focuses on increasing awareness of local stakeholders. As part of its commitment to transparent operations (in the form of Slovnaft’s 2014 “Responsible neighbour” campaign) a survey was carried out into what disturbs the people who live around the Bratislava refinery, and what can be done in order to minimise negative impacts. As a result of this survey, a new SMS/email notification system will be implemented in 2016 to strengthen the flow of information about operations to the people in the Slovakian capital. INA is systematically working on recognising the specific needs of local communities so as to develop and expand partnershiptype relations based on mutual understanding and support. Communication to communities occurs through public debates that are regularly held in the process of environmental impact assessments and the obtaining of environmental permits. 5.2 SOCIAL INVESTMENTS Related objectives: “Develop a comprehensive and effective social investment management system, including local social investment plans, with measurable targets in each country of operation” In 2015, MOL Group supported social investment projects with 0.27%1 of its EBITDA. Donations, in-kind giving and volunteering at MOL Group [GRI EC8] Inter­ Social investments unit Hungary Romania Slovakia Croatia Italy national Total by country* Upstream Donations in cash** HUF million 675.2 176.0 177.9 168.7 1.9 601.1 1,800.8 In-kind giving HUF million 18.1 0.0 5.6 10.6 0.0 0.0 34.3 (product/services) Leverage HUF million 2,212.9 2,212.9 * including companies with approved Corporate Giving Plans **excluding the value of volunteering Social responsibility objectives are designed to improve social and environmental conditions and contribute to the long-term socioeconomic development of communities, rather than simply funding community investment projects. To achieve meaningful change, business interests are aligned both with overarching societal and environmental considerations and are in harmony with the long-term priorities of local communities. Social investment priority areas for MOL Group are the following: • Education: MOL seeks to facilitate access to basic and secondary education in areas where such infrastructure is not assured. Investing into local human capital benefits both business and society. • Healthcare: our goal is to create benefits by either granting access to healthcare services and drinking water, or promoting sports and a healthy lifestyle, depending on the specific needs of local communities. • Environmental protection: we define our own standards and supporting projects which are geared to saving traditional habitats. Diversified initiatives and projects which only require support during the start-up phase and which are later self-sustaining are preferred, especially when such initiatives are responses to global concerns. A best-in-class tool London Benchmarking Group (LBG) methodology has been adopted at a group level to manage and report on social investment. In 2015, the model was extended to international upstream company operations to measure business and community benefits and to improve the effectiveness of our corporate giving programmes. In 2015, 100% of the value of MOL Group’s social investments is covered by the LBG methodology . Non-European Operations Relationships with industry, with local communities, governments and with partners alike are fundamental to fulfilling MOL Group’s mission. In international upstream operations Community Relationship Officers select from local community requests on the basis of central objectives. MOL always strives to understand local community needs and then create tailor-made social investment action plans for each area. A common feature of these social investments is that MOL makes a contribution to supporting local public service and infrastructure, which both have a lasting impact on the lives of communities. In Pakistan (MOL Pakistan), a certain level of social investment is obligatory. Pakistan complies with and exceeds this requirement by making voluntary contributions to relevant stakeholders. Obligatory contributions as defined in contracts are mostly targeted at infrastructural development, such as check dams or water supply schemes, and also include general social welfare commitments to the value of HUF 75.5m (TAL, Margala and Margala North Blocks). In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, MOL Group’s subsidiary Kalegran supported several projects, in line with our strategic priorities. Examples include the construction of new health centre in Meerbalian village, expansion of the youth centre hall and the renovation 1 Without corporate tax optimization indicated as leverage, according to LBG methodology. 253 Notes on Sustainability Performance of a sports centre in Akre and the construction of a committee hall in the village of Shush. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, MOL Group also provided humanitarian aid to Kurdish refugees displaced internally in Iraq through local suppliers with the support of Ministry of Natural Resources and local authorities. European Operations In Central Europe, MOL Group companies are well-established brands. These companies carry out an annual corporate giving awareness tracking survey which investigates customer habits and the recognition of existing programmes to understand the needs of society. Similarly to 2014, this survey involved more than 8,000 stakeholders at a group level. According to the survey results, health care and health promotion are the most popular causes. 55% of stakeholders would donate most to support better communication about healthy lifestyles and the prevention of diseases. Second on the list is environmental protection (54%), while education is fourth (38%). Identifying and supporting talent is also supported by 30% of the population. MOL Group’s corporate giving budget is aligned with business efforts and public expectations. According to our internal data collection system, 40% of donations tracked in the LBG data collection toolkit have a focus on education and young people, while 6% are spent on improving health. MOL’s corporate giving is also connected to business interests, such as the above-mentioned nonEuropean projects in international exploration and production operations, which account for 28.4% of the total social investment budget. Other such initiatives include, for example, maintaining cooperation with our most important customers and professional organizations. LBG-related data does not contain donations related to Corporate Tax Optimisation. The social investments of MOL Group companies in Central Europe are mainly carried out through foundations which support various causes such as young talents (sports and art categories) and health care and special therapies for chronically ill children. The majority of our social investments are administered through such organizations in different proportions (Hungary: 85%, Slovakia: 51% Romania: 100%, Croatia: 60%). In Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Croatia and Italy we also support local environmental initiatives through our Green Belt Programmes. In 2016, the project will be extended to the Czech Republic as well. Volunteering The current volunteering practice of MOL Group is rich in types of activity, but partially segmented. There are numerous similar, but well-functioning initiatives. MOL Group Volunteers’ Club a group-wide platform of Corporate Volunteering was launched in May 2014 as a long-term initiative. The MOL Group Volunteers’ Club regularly organises events to express our responsibility towards local communities and improve employee engagement at the same time. Corporate volunteering by employee/country International Hungary Slovakia Croatia Romania Italy Total Upstream Employee volunteering 592 320 4,624 368 0 0 6,085 (hours) In 2015, the INA Volunteer Club undertook 36 initiatives in which 546 members participated for a total of 4,360 volunteer hours. These focused on providing ecological and humanitarian assistance and involved projects targeted at children and youth. Volunteers have a Facebook application where fans and visitors can suggest or vote for volunteering projects. Currently, the INA Volunteer Club has 737 members, an increase of 41% since 2014. For the second time, the INA Volunteer Club received a “Recognition for the contribution of the business sector to the development of volunteering”. This recognition serves as confirmation of the values that INA and INA’s volunteers promote through their activities. We have several other similar initiatives within MOL Group, such as the Green Belt volunteering system in Hungary and Italy. This also includes our city programme and collection of in-kind donations for disadvantaged families in Slovakia, and a collaboration with the “Dévai Szent Ferenc Foundation in Romania for renewal-related work. MOL Group’s target for 2016 is to prepare a mid-term strategy and develop a common corporate volunteering platform for employees to generate synergy through creating high-level guidelines and best practices. 5.3 Local suppliers and local employment Local suppliers Employing local people where we operate, as well as hiring local contractors when possible, is beneficial to the local economy as the income it generates increases the purchasing power of these communities. MOL Group understands that hiring local suppliers has multiple benefits and can also be a way of establishing a positive relationship with local communities. As a result, MOL Group contracts with such suppliers whenever it is beneficial, also taking into consideration the expectations of local governments. In Central Europe, local suppliers comprise the absolute majority of all suppliers. 89% of them are registered in the country where they are contracted and work is undertaken. This makes MOL Group a key component of the economies of these countries. Number and ratio of local suppliers* [GRI G4-EC9] Local Total Local suppliers suppliers By contracted Region/country No. No. By number value Hungary (MOL Plc. and other subsidiaries) 13,211 14,211 93% 66% Hungary (MOL Petrochemicals Plc.) 1,172 1,586 74% 47% Slovakia (SLOVNAFT a.s.) 1,950 2,497 78% 44% Croatia (INA d.d.) 1,086 1,279 85% 78% CEE / SEE REGION Total 17,419 19,573 89% 62% UPSTREAM INTERNATIONAL Total 855 1,138 75% 79% Group total 18,274 20,711 88% 64% *Locally-registered suppliers In the countries where we have International Upstream operations, local procurement is especially important because operational sites are very often situated in areas populated by low-income communities. Hiring local contractors and employees therefore strengthens the relationship MOL Group has with all the stakeholders of the region, including local governments and communities. In countries where MOL Group is only involved in exploration activities the opportunities for hiring local suppliers can be limited due to the special knowledge and technology we require. However, where MOL Group undertakes production activity as well, the proportion of local suppliers is high, especially in Russia where the involvement of local enterprises is close to 100%. Ratio of local suppliers in E&P International countries [GRI G4-EC9] Kurdistan Region of Pakistan Oman Russia Iraq Proportion of local suppliers* (to total number) 74% 59% 98% 42% *Locally-registered suppliers Having a local supply chain creates the greatest benefits to society and to the local economy, especially when locally-owned small businesses are hired as contractors. The total value of contracts signed in 2015 between MOL Group and locally registered businesses in 2015 was HUF 44 bn (EUR 141 mn) in upstream international countries (Pakistan, Oman, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and Russia). Supplier management In 2015, the development of a Supplier Qualification System (SQS) commenced. This system will be an important component of a group-level, integrated system to cover all supplier-related information from the pre-screening to the post-evaluation stage. SQS will include basic legal, ethical, financial and HSE information about suppliers and will allow automatic risk assessment to take place to facilitate the pre-screening process. As part of the strategic sustainability plan, a total of 3 supplier sustainability audits were conducted in Hungary. The companies which were visited agreed to implement corrective activities in certain areas such as implementing the code of ethics or sustainability KPIs into their managerial incentive schemes, or introducing an employee performance management system. 255 Notes on Sustainability Performance Local employment Across E&P International Operating companies, in the MEA (MOL Pakistan, Kalegran, MOL Oman), CIS (Russian OpCos – MOL Russ, Baitex, Matyushinskaya Vertical) and North Sea (MOL Norge, MOL Energy UK) countries, MOL follows local regulatory requirements and Production Sharing Agreement stipulations (where applicable) to ensure local content and expat quota ratios. In line with those regulations, the majority of employees at upstream international subsidiaries where we operate are nationals of the respective countries. In every OpCo, MOL focuses on developing its local technical and office employees and ensures expat knowledge transfer (through, e.g. mentoring, tutoring, internal training, etc.). Local senior executives (HAY 21 category and above) are employees with local citizenship, and managers (HAY 17-20 categories) are also nationals of the respective countries. Local managers in major international upstream locations [GRI G4-EC6] Country Indicator Locals Total Number of local senior executives 2 2 Russia Number of local managers 7 8 Number of local senior executives 2 4 Pakistan Number of local managers 18 29 Number of local senior executives 4 6 Overall Result Number of local managers 18 37 Indirect Economic Impact In the main countries where MOL Group has Upstream and midstream operations, the most significant indirect impact of MOL Group on the economies of these countries is through the energy it supplies. Another area in which the company can have a significant positive impact on the societies of host countries is by improving access to infrastructure and energy as a result of our operations. Development of infrastructure and improved energy access can both be directly related to our operations, or can occur based on contractual or other commitments. In 2014, MOL Pakistan provided financial aid for the construction of a new bridge. The new Khushal Garh bridge is a safer and better connection between the two main provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab in Pakistan. MOL Group also supports the building of check dams for local communities in Pakistan. These structures slow the velocity of water streams, making them more appropriate for agricultural use. Such a dam was built in Ahmadi Banda in 2014, and construction commenced in 2015 in Makori and at Serki Piala in the Hangu District with expected completion in 2016. 6. ETHICS AND GOVERNANCE General aim: Focus on responsible operations and long-term economic development ACHIEVEMENTS:   The second-highest number of ethics notifications were filed in International Upstream, proving the effective uptake of the grievance mechanism by target audiences   Ethics operations were further enhanced in 2015 with the establishment of a Group Ethics Officer position, and with the nomination of local ethics officers at every subsidiary with more than 20 FTEs   Group Ethics Council membership was renewed, with the representation of all group-level senior managers of business and functional units   A total of 14,855 hours of ethics training, eLearning courses and managerial presentations were successfully deployed in European operations in downstream business, including for our filling station staff CHALLENGES:  Deeper assessment and understanding of human rights-related risks in supply chain is required with a focus on international operations  Further improvement of ethical corporate culture and development of strong institutions to provide effective, comprehensive investigation of grievances and real remedies to stakeholders One of the most essential components of MOL Group’s operation is our commitment to ethical behaviour. In the long run we can only face the challenges of competitive market environments successfully if we accept the imperatives of moral responsibility, both as individuals and as a company. We are aware that ethics is at the core of corporate governance and that it should be integrated into our corporate strategy and operation. Our sustainability strategy mirrors this approach by linking ethics and governance issues. Accordingly, our annual report contains a new Ethics and Governance chapter and deals with both areas in a detailed subchapter. 6.1 ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE Related objective: “Implement key pillars of ethics management system (code of ethics, e-learning, managerial presentation, business partner code of ethics) in all companies and reach 100% coverage” MOL Group is determined to operate in good faith within the appropriate legal framework, obeying relevant laws, rules and regulations. We view regulatory measures as a minimum baseline, while our ethical framework goes beyond legal compliance, integrating standards which are commensurate with our stakeholders’ expectations. In order to strengthen fair market behaviour, respect fundamental human rights, fight corruption and preserve and develop our ethical values we operate a comprehensive ethics management system. Its foundation is our Code of Ethics (CoE) covering, inter alia, human rights, various transparency and integrity topics, anti-corruption, privacy, community relations, HSE and fair market behaviour. The CoE is available in 13 languages (English, Bosnian, Croatian, Polish, Hungarian, German, Italian, Russian, Romanian, Serbian, Slovakian, Slovenian and Ukrainian). 100% of all MOL Group employees receive and sign our Code of Ethics and we make efforts to integrate ethical values and expectations through our entire supply chain. The Business Partner Code of Ethics which highlights the ethical values that are of utmost importance to our supply chain – including human rights, anti-corruption and fair market behaviour – is a component of 98% of supplier contracts. 68% of joint ventures in which MOL Group has a stake of below 51% have adopted an agreed-upon version of the Code of Ethics. Significant organizational changes have been made to make our ethics management system more efficient. The MOL Group Ethics Council is now the highest-level forum dedicated to upholding Code of Ethics-related decision making. In 2015, the Council’s composition was renewed, and all group-level senior managers of business and functional units including the Chief Operating Officers (COOs) of MOL Group companies (MOL Nyrt., Slovnaft a.s.) are now members of the Ethics Council. We are also continuing the good practice of assigning to the Council an independent external Ethics Council chairperson who is a business ethics expert, and one employee representative. INA Group has been operating an Ethics Council and reporting on a quarterly basis to the MOL Group Ethics Council. Ethics Council operations were reinforced with the establishment of the Group Ethics Officer position for the Group Compliance & Ethics organization. The Group Ethics Officer is responsible for managing the ethics grievance and investigation mechanisms and for ensuring professional compliance activity and decision preparation support for the Council, under the supervision of the external Ethics Council chairperson. Local ethics operations were further enhanced in 2015 with nomination of local ethics officers at every subsidiary with more than 20 full-time employees (the previous threshold was 200 FTE). Their work was supported by a local ethics officer workshop, held for the first time in 2015. Within the ethics management system MOL Group places special emphasis on disseminating the Code of Ethics’ values and norms through ethics-related trainings. • Ethics eLearning courses – addressing all topics covered by the Code – were successfully completed by employees with Intranet access at Slovnaft Česká republika, Papoil, MOL Retail, MOL Čerpací stanice, MOL Romania, MOL Slovenija, and partly at MOL Plc. and MOL LUB Ltd. • 100% of managers and 96% of employees have attended an annual presentation and discussion delivered by direct managers on actual ethics-related achievements and ethics cases. Level 1-4 managers have published an ethics statement via the intranet to make it publicly available and to increase transparency. • In order to raise ethical awareness in retail networks, tailor-made trainings were conducted for service station operator partners and attendants in Slovakia and Hungary. Special ethics training was conducted for managers in Croatia. • Based on estimates, eLearning and ethics presentations delivered by managers and filling station training events totalled 14,855 hours. 257 Notes on Sustainability Performance Ethics risk assessment has been a key pillar of our ethics management system since 2011. In 2015, we further developed this activity with the widely applied probability / impact matrix approach and by external benchmarking of countries in which MOL Group operates (33 subsidiaries from 15 countries provided input for the risk assessment process). According to the results, the highest ethical risks in MOL Group are fraud, breaches of HSE rules, and business partner gifts, while the riskiest countries for MOL Group operations both from a corruption and from a human rights perspective are Iraq, Pakistan, Russia and the Ukraine. In order to decrease risks, several activities have commenced: • In-depth discussions about retail-related cases • Improvement of security training in Hungary • Ethics awareness-raising, including a poster campaign against harassment, discrimination and corruption which was launched in 2014 continued in 2015 at all MOL Group companies 6.2 ETHICAL CASES Receiving grievances and reports, investigating ethics-related issues, ensuring whistle-blower protection, responding to ethicsrelated questions and general decision making support is coordinated by the Group Ethics Officer on behalf of the Ethics Council. Grievances and whistle-blower reports are handled confidentially while the (web-based) grievance channel is publicly available in English and in Hungarian and anonymous reports are accepted as well. In addition, the Ethics Council operates a 24/7 hotline. The number of ethics reports and ethics investigations has increased over the last 5 years. Compared to the 88 ethics-related complaints/reports submitted in 2014, a higher number (90) were received by MOL Group and the INA Group Ethics Council in Croatia this year. This continuous increase in the number of reports concerning possible ethical misconduct indicates an improvement in the awareness of internal and external stakeholders. The proportion of ethics complaints and reports arriving from external (non-MOL Group company employee) stakeholders is also increasing (53% of the total in 2015). Summary of Ethical Cases 100 90 88 90 81 80 70 61 60 58 50 49 45 40 38 34 30 25 25 20 22* 20 14 10 10 7 4 3 0 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 All reports Investigation Ethical misconduct * Investigations which commenced in 2014 and closed in 2015 revealed an additional 6 cases of misconduct, resulting in a total of 22 case of misconduct for 2014. As of the end of 2015, 14 investigations were ongoing. External reports were primarily submitted by customers (23%), supplier’s employees (19%), former employees (14%), suppliers (10), and local communities/citizens (6%). Further reports or grievances were filed by a tender bidder, a shareholder and a journalist one each (6%). With 19% of external reports – since a whistle-blower has the option not to disclose any detail – no connection with MOL Group was indicated. Ethics reports were received from 8 countries. Hungary (33%) and Croatia (17%) – the counties with the largest MOL Group operations and also Pakistan (27%) are top of the list. The latter figure is probably connected to the weaker rule-of-law and the tendency to seek alternative forms of justice where possible. The most frequent topics of ethics complaints were harassment/poor communication (25%), fraud and theft (13%), corruption and bribery (10%), discrimination (6%), and conflicts of interest (6%). The table below 2 shows how the ethics reports can be categorised by topic. Topics of ethics-related reports in 2015 Topics Share of ethics reports in 2015 [%] Harassment / Poor communication 25 Other 28 Fraud / Theft 13 Corruption / Bribery 10 Discrimination 6 Conflict of interest 6 Unlawful termination 5 Inadequate service / Impoliteness 4 HSE Breach 3 Regarding ethical reports, in 58 cases an investigation was justified, and in 25 cases ethical misconduct was verified. (Ongoing cases: 13 in MOL; 1 in INA). Consequences for ethical misconduct included the termination of 7 employment contracts, 9 written disciplinary notices, 2 verbal disciplinary warnings and 2 fines distributed to filling station operating partners. In the remaining cases the Ethics Council ordered a customer reimbursement, anger management training, an apology, the publication of an extraordinary communiqué about certain ethical and compliance issues, and gave a process improvement recommendation to avoid further misconduct. In 2 confirmed cases of corruption employment was terminated and two suppliers were excluded. In 2015, we continued conflict of interest the contribution of a supplier’s agent was excluded from all MOL Group orders. In 2015, stakeholders sought advice from the Ethics Council in 13 instances, all of whom received satisfactory replies. The Ethics Council regularly reports about ethics-related cases to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board and annually publishes on the web the established cases of misconduct in an anonymous form to raise awareness of ethical norms. More information about the nature of such misconduct is available on our website (http://molgroup.info/en/sustainability/ethics-and-governance/ethics-andcompliance/ethical-cases). Regarding security reports, in 2015 from the total of 1,241 investigations MOL Group Security identified 562 cases of misconduct (45.2%). The increase in the number of investigations compared to last year is due to the launch of a more systematic conflict of interest investigation process in Croatia. 71.4% of misconduct cases were committed at filling stations, 13% were thefts and frauds in MOL Group companies, 8.4% involved misuse of corporate property or breaches of security rules, 4.6% involved conflicts of interest and 2.6% related to security risks that concerned business partners. As a result of the revealed conflicts of interest, the managers who exercised the employer’s rights were informed so that consequences could be determined for individuals. Within MOL Group’s filling station network, we distributed financial penalties to distributors and terminated the operational contracts/employment contracts of some station attendants. When criminal offences were committed against MOL Group companies, charges were pressed against the perpetrators. 6.3 HUMAN RIGHTS MOL Group is committed to respecting fundamental human rights, a principle which is also included in our Code of Ethics and is rolled out along the supply chain through our Business Partner Code of Ethics as a binding requirement. Furthermore, MOL Group takes responsibility for protecting and conducting due diligence processes and recognising human rights. In 2015, we continued to adopt the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the ‘Ruggie Framework’). In 2015, ethics eLearning courses – addressing, inter alia human right issues – were successfully completed by employees with intranet access at Slovnaft Česká republika, Papoil, MOL Retail, MOL Čerpací stanice, MOL Romania, MOL Slovenija, and partly at MOL Plc. and MOL Ltd. Starting from 2015, we are taking Human Rights Watch and Freedom House country evaluations into account in our risk assessments as external benchmarks. Based on these, the riskiest countries for MOL Group operations from a human rights perspective are Iraq, Pakistan, Russia and the Ukraine. A total of 30 subsidiaries in 15 countries have been subject to human rights reviews or impact assessments. 259 Notes on Sustainability Performance In 2015, we fully reinforced our public ethics whistle-blower channels, and case management was improved to create a comprehensive grievance mechanism capable of providing real remedy in the case of human rights violations. In 2015, a number of specific human rights issues and concerns were raised by internal and external stakeholders relating to topics such as personal data handling, confidential information, use of emails and the internet and relationships and unequal treatment in workplace. Grievances were received from local community inhabitants complaining of odours and pollution. Local individuals raised concerns about the enforcement of the legal right to land prospecting work. Concerned subsidiaries started to handle concerns and respond using appropriate remedial activity. To ensure the protection of human rights through the supply chain, we strive to improve our Responsible Supply Chain Management and extend the implementation of our ethics values and norms, transfer human rights-related knowledge, conduct prequalification activities, audits, and due diligence. The Business Partner Code of Ethics which highlights the ethical values that are of utmost importance in our supply chain – including human rights – is a component of 98% of supplier contracts. In order to raise ethical and human rights-related awareness in retail networks, tailor-made training was conducted for service station operator partners and attendants in Slovakia and Hungary. Further elaboration of special human rights-related training material has also started, targeting not only our employees but our suppliers and partners as well. In E&P operations in Pakistan, Iraq-Kurdistan and Russia we have delivered human rights training together with security training for 100% security personnel and contractors since 2014. Taking into account the local circumstances, public contractors are all included. Human rights-related training is provided as part of security training. In 2015, we were still assessing the viability and potential to provide soft skills training to private security contractors about various locally relevant topics. A pilot project is planned for Pakistan for 2016. MOL Group is not engaged in activities which affect indigenous people. MOL’s modus operandi ensures the safeguarding of the rights of tribal populations and indigenous people. In this spirit, we commit to gaining free prior and informed consent in the event that indigenous people should be relocated from their land. So far, no resettlements have occurred at any of our international operating locations. 6.4 TRANSPARENCY The integrated Annual Report is MOL Group’s most important sustainability-related disclosure. Several other forms of communication and channels are also used to disclose and inform internal and external stakeholders about our sustainability performance. Key sustainability performance indicators and activities have been part of “Quarterly Flash reports”, alongside key financial indicators, for more than 2 years. MOL Group’s website (www.molgroup.info/en/sustainability) contains additional information about the topics published in this report, some in more detail and in a format that better suits a larger, non-expert audience. Large subsidiaries of MOL Group publish sustainability information in different ways: • INA Group publishes integrated financial, non-financial Annual Reports. In 2015, Deloitte Croatia awarded INA Group’s integrated Annual Report 2014 the first national Green Frog Award for the best sustainability report • Every two years MOL Production publishes its sustainable development report about the three refineries: the Danube, the Tisza and the Zala. In 2015, results from 2013-2014 were published. • MOL Logistics published its first Environmental Report in 2015 • Slovnaft publishes its key sustainability performance indicators in its Annual Report • IES shares sustainability related information on its website. We consult a number of stakeholder groups about sustainability performance in general, and reporting in particular. In 2015, among other related initiatives we can highlight the following: • Similarly to previous years, the executive management of the European Workers’ Council (EWC) reviewed workforce-related information published in the MOL Group Annual Report and web pages at the preparation stage • Slovnaft carried out a community engagement campaign to inform the public about the construction phases of the LDPE4 plant (via push SMS) and surveyed the local population about the refinery’s image. The latter was the basis for strategic and targeted local community involvement activities in 2016. • INA initiated and organized in cooperation with the Croatian Chamber of Economy and Croatian Business Council for Sustainable Development a roundtable on sustainability reporting according to GRI guidelines. The goal was to exchange experiences and encourage smaller companies to report on sustainability. • MOL Hungary organized a sustainability forum during the Health Safety & Environment days held at the Tisza refinery site together with major companies from the industrial site. In countries where MOL Group is only involved in Exploration and Production operations, the energy industry as a whole may generate a significant proportion of national income (through royalties or production-sharing agreements). Consequently, MOL Group considers it fundamentally important to observe the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) principles and criteria for financial reporting. We started to support EITI at an international level in 2013 and have been cooperating with the initiative in the countries that are implementing the EITI system. MOL Group has operations or non-operated assets in several EITI compliant countries: the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Cameroon, Norway and Kazakhstan. 7. ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING 7.1 OUR APPROACH TO REPORTING Since 2008, MOL Group has been reporting its financial, governance, environmental and social performance in one integrated report. Starting in 2013, sustainability performance information has also been included in quarterly management reports. We are continuously deepening the Triple-Bottom-Line approach to corporate management with activities that further improve the integration of financial and non-financial management. The disclosure about the management approaches in the Notes on Sustainability Performance section attest to these strategic activities. Key achievements, challenges, performance data and trends relating to relevant sustainability topics for MOL Group are described throughout the report and are integrated into the descriptions of business operations and performance. A detailed account about 2015 sustainability performance is provided in the dedicated sections: Sustainability Performance and Notes on Sustainability Performance. The main target audiences of the Annual Report are shareholders, investors and sustainability analysts. The structure of the chapters is tailored to meeting their information needs and reading habits. However, further information about MOL Group’s policies, management approaches and other sustainability-related topics for all audiences is published on our website at www.molgroup.info/en/ sustainability. All sustainability performance data published in this report have been reviewed by EY. Each year, this assurance process is planned and performed according to the International Federation of Accountants’ ISAE3000 standard. Within this framework EY reviews all data under a limited scope of assurance, and for CO2 under ETS and Lost Time Injury Frequency Rates under a reasonable assurance scope. Since 2014, the assurance of sustainability performance has also been audited in accordance with the AA1000AS standard in order to strengthen our materiality process. MOL Group follows the latest G4 guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the most widely used sustainability reporting standard globally. The Annual Report’s GRI accordance level is ‘comprehensive’, which means we are reporting on all indicators related to material aspects that have been identified (see more below under Materiality Assessment). A content index for the indicators which have been reported on is uploaded to the following website: www.molgroup.info/en/sustainability/report-anddata/global-reporting-initiative-and-united-nations-global-compact-compliance-table. In addition, we use the GRI G4 ‘Oil and Gas Sector Disclosures’ guidelines and the IPIECA-API ‘Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Voluntary Sustainability Reporting’ protocol when defining the content of the report and selecting which indicators to cover. 7.2 MATERIALITY We use materiality assessment as a means of prioritising material topics in reporting, without excluding any of the relevant topics. Topics considered to be material and strategic are described in more detail, whereas other topics (which are plotted on our materiality matrix) are covered less extensively. We discuss the process of materiality analysis further at the beginning of this report. The most material topics, according to our assessment, are GHG and energy efficiency, process safety, crisis management, ethics and transparency and also occupational and process safety management. Less material topics in 2015 were suppliers, customers, human rights and biodiversity. From a GRI G4 reporting perspective, these topics are considered non-material, thus we only disclose a selection of indicators for them. 7.3 SCOPE AND BOUNDARY MOL consolidates sustainability information based on a ‘control approach’. We account for almost 100 percent of the sustainability data from operations controlled by the company, including those where MOL or one of its subsidiaries acts as operator. 261 Notes on Sustainability Performance HSE data is collected only at operations with significant potential health, safety and / or environmental impact. In 2015, there was one significant change (compared to 2014) in the scope of the companies covered: in 2014 November the steam generator located at the Duna Refinery became a consolidated and operated entity; this has considerable impact primarily on environmental and GHG data. HSE data coverage is 90.6% in proportion to revenue. In 2015, we were in the process of transitioning data collection to a dedicated management system called MARK HSE which runs on a platform provided by Enablon. MARK HSE covers environmental data, while safety-related data is collected using the so-called HSE Info system (closed as of January 2016). This process will be concluded in 2016 when all HSE data will have been collected and verified in MARK HSE. Human Resources (HR) data, including sustainability reporting-related information, is collected using the group’s SAP enterprise resource management system. The scope of HR data collection is 100% in terms of headcount and turnover. Other sustainabilityrelated data are collected for subsidiaries with a headcount of over 100 employees. Data coverage in such cases is therefore lower (90.1% in proportion to revenue in 2015). Social investment data is collected from operations and subsidiaries which have approved corporate giving plans. Such plans are elaborated based on business interests and local community interests and are segmented via a systematic stakeholder prioritization ranking method controlled by our social engagement policy. Data was collected for almost all donations activities, although only for 75.6% of operations, since not all entities have donation activities. The supply chain is considered less material according to our materiality assessment since MOL’s activities with the largest potential impact are executed within the company’s operational boundaries, as described above. Hence, the performance of MOL Group’s suppliers is included for the following indicators only: • GHG Scope 2 and 3 emissions • Contractor safety incidents, including fatalities • Spending on local suppliers 7.4 REPORTING ON JOINT VENTURES Operated joint ventures by definition fall within the scope of data reporting. In the case of joint ventures where MOL Group does not act as operator, we do not report sustainability data based on equity share. The only exceptions are for GHG emissions and HSE penalties where in performance tables equity-share-based emissions are reported from MOL Group-related joint venture companies as well. Concerning non-operated joint ventures, the performance data included in the sustainability chapter do not include quantified information since MOL Group does not have operational control over these ventures (except for the inclusion of headcount data in the case of financially-consolidated companies). However, MOL Group hereby declares that it presents any information related to the 2015 sustainability performance of these companies that is found to be material. Midstream Joint Ventures and non-operated companies: • Hungary (FGSZ): this natural gas transmission company is a 100% consolidated subsidiary, but it is not operated due to the unbundling regulations of the European Union. The key sustainability performance of FGSZ is summarized in the table below. Selected performance indicators for FGSZ Plc. 2014–2015 Indicator Unit 2014 2015 Total Direct GHG (scope-1) mn t 106.198 107.632 Total Water Withdrawals m3 9.013 12.097 Number of Spills (›1m3) 0 0 Fatalities – own employees 1 0 Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) employees 2.9 3.7 Total workforce 768 760 Donations mn HUF 28 348 Downstream Joint Ventures and non-operated companies: • Hungary (TVK Power Plant): this power plant became operated and consolidated in 2015 and has undergone significant energy efficiency improvements which are considered to affect the scope 2 emissions of MOL Group in this report. The power plant’s performance will be integrated into reports from 2016 onwards. • S lovakia (Thermal Power Plant): the operator (CMEPS) of this power plant continued to focus on waste recovery-related improvements which started in 2014. These involve the recovery of precious metals from the waste stream and the production of gypsum from desulfurization by-products. Upstream Joint Ventures and non-operated companies: • Europe (UK): HSE performance is discussed at senior meetings with JV partners. If there are any areas of concern or incidents, the lessons learned are discussed along with any remediation measures that are required. • FSU (Kazakhstan): One major activity included the revision of the Environmental Management Plan and Application for the 2015 environmental emission permit. Middle East (Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Pakistan) Joint Ventures and non-operated companies: • In Pakistan, MOL has non-operated interests in two blocks (Karak, and Ghuri). MOL operational teams (Drilling, Project, etc.) review the HSE features of all projects that are undertaken by partners during the project sanction and approval process. • In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Gulf Keystone (GKP) is the operator of the Shaikan field. Information about HSE performance is regularly received from this partner. 7.5 NOTES ON SUSTAINABILITY DATA We calculate our sustainability performance indicators (as published in this report) mainly using measurements and calculations, whereas best available estimations are used only when necessary. Sustainability data is generated and calculated taking into consideration pertinent legislation at a local level. Aggregation processes are carried out according to relevant corporate guidelines and policies. In 2015, MOL Group renewed its sustainability reporting handbook which was cascaded to the local level. Collection of data is carried out through regional divisions and local businesses as necessary. The completeness and accuracy of the data that is reported is supervised at the group level and through a dedicated sustainability assurance process where the majority of sustainability performance data are reviewed following limited assurance, while two indicators – LTIF and CO2 under ETS – go through a reasonable assurance procedure. Notes on environmental data: • MOL Group discharges waste water into surface waters or into municipal sewage systems which is treated depending on site circumstances and local regulations (usually involving mechanical and/or biologically-based treatment, but the process may extend to chemical treatment steps when needed). MOL Group does not believe that breaking down this data further according to destination and treatment method is material. Accordingly, it is not reported. • According to the information provided by contractors, waste disposal methods were classified using European Union guidelines. • Communal waste is not included in MOL Group waste figures since collectors are legally responsible for reporting the amount of waste collected, disposed and recovered. Notes on Human Capital data: • MOL Services Center, a holding of five companies, is financially consolidated as of 2015, but since in 2015 it was not operated by MOL, we did not collect HSE and HR info regarding the company. MSC will be regarded as a contractor in relevant HR indicators. Notes on employee engagement data: • Until 2010, the engagement score represented the average result of the answers expressed as a percentage. Since 2012, Aon Hewitt’s ‘Say, Stay, Strive’ model has been used. Engagement is calculated by determining each employee’s average response to the six engagement questions based on the Aon Hewitt six-point response scale. If the average rating for an employee equals or exceeds 4.5, that individual is assessed as ‘engaged’. The engagement score is the total proportion of employees who are ‘engaged’. Restatements: • Ethics and Governance: Ethics investigations started in 2014 and closed in 2015 revealed an additional 6 cases of misconduct resulting in a total of 22 misconduct cases for 2014, which we are hereby restating for 2015. • In ‘energy consumption data’, 554,061 GJ was missing from Crosco in 2014. The relevant figures have been restated in the report. • In 2015, we reported Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) only related to MOL Group’s own employees, which was 1.52 in 2014. In 2016, we decided to give a more complete picture by including contractors in this indicator, therefore we are restating the 2014 TRIR value for own employees and contractors, which is 1.50. 263 Independent Auditor's Report (Sustainability) Independent Auditor's Report (Sustainability) EY independent assurance statement to MOL management MOL Hungarian Oil and Gas (“MOL”) management is responsible for the collection and presentation of the information within its 2015 Sustainable Development Report (“the Report”).1 MOL management is also responsible for the design implementation and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the Report, so that it is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Our responsibility, in accordance with our engagement terms with MOL management, was to carry out procedures to meet the requirements for a ‘limited level’ assurance engagement on Sustainable Development data 2 in the Report (“selected data”), and to meet the requirements for a ‘reasonable level’ assurance engagement for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) CO2 and Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) data. We do not accept or assume any responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person or organisation. Any reliance any such third party may place on the Report is entirely at its own risk. Our assurance engagement has been planned and performed in accordance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Revised, Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, and to meet the requirements of a Type 1 assurance engagement as defined by AA1000AS (2008).3 The AA1000AS (2008) assurance principles of Inclusivity, Materiality and Responsiveness (collectively “the criteria”) have been used as criteria against which to evaluate the Report. We have also assessed whether the Report meets the requirements for “Comprehensive” reporting as defined by the Global Reporting Initiative G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines. Summary of work performed The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included the steps outlined below: 1. Interviewed a selection of MOL executives and senior managers to understand the current status of Sustainable Development activities and progress made during the reporting period of 1st January 2015 to 31st December 2015. 2. Reviewed selected documents relating to Sustainable Development aspects of MOL’s performance, to understand progress made across the organisation and to test the coverage of topics within the Report. 3. Reviewed MOL’s processes for determining material issues to be included in the Report. 4. Reviewed MOL’s approach to stakeholder engagement through interviews with employees with responsibility for managing engagement activities at Group and selected site level managers. 5. Reviewed the consolidation of the selected data at Group level by: • Holding interviews with specialists responsible for managing, collating, and reviewing data at corporate level. • Conducting data walk-throughs of reporting systems to assess the accuracy of calculations and assumptions, including an assessment of the effectiveness of MOL’s internal review procedures. 1 MOL Group’s Sustainable Development Report –the SD chapter of MOL Group’s Annual Report, the Sustainability section of the Management Discussion and Analysis chapter of MOL Group’s Annual Report, the content of the Sustainable Development part of the corporate website (molgroup.info/sustainability) 2 Selected data – Sustainable Development data described on page 2-3 of the Report 3 AA1000AS (2008) – The second edition of the AA1000 assurance standard from the Institute of Social and Ethical Accountability Parts A and B of the IESBA Code; and the International Standard on Quality Control 1 (ISQC1) • P erforming additional testing procedures in relation to the ETS CO2 (review of third-party verification reports) and own staff LTIF indicators (verification of data to source documents on a larger sample both at Group and site level, recalculation of the indicator) at both site and corporate level to gain reasonable assurance over these indicators. 6. Conducted site visits at four MOL locations (MOL Petrochemicals Plc, MOL Retail, SMAO, Ivanic Grad/INA Upstream) to test the application of MOL’s reporting procedures and test a sample of performance data back to source documentation for accuracy and completeness. Our site visits focused on the following indicators presented in the Report: Energy consumption (Natural gas, Other hydrocarbon, Electricity, Other indirect energy), Air emission (Carbon Dioxide, Nitrous oxides, Sulphur Dioxide, Particulate Matter, Direct GHG emission), Water (Water Withdrawal, Municipal water supplies or other water utilities, Surface Water Withdrawal, Groundwater Withdrawal, Total Water Discharge), Waste (Hazardous Waste, Non-hazardous Waste, Waste Reused / Recycled, Aqueous drilling mud and cuttings), Spills (Number and volume of spills), HSE related expenditures (Number and value of HSE related penalties), Health and safety (Number of fatalities, Lost Time Injury, Lost Time Injury Frequency, Number of worked hours), Process safety (Tier 1 and Tier 2 process safety events), Employees (Number of full-time and part-time employees, Leavers, Employee turnover rate, Average hours of training per employee), Communities (Donations). 7. Reviewed the narrative content of the Report and the presentation of the selected data to assess whether: • The coverage of issues in the Report is consistent with the outputs of MOL’s materiality process, and that the descriptions of MOL’s approaches to materiality are consistent with our observations. • The selected data presented in the Report corresponds with the information we have reviewed during the course of our work. • The Report is consistent with the requirements for “Comprehensive” reporting according to the GRI G4 Guidelines. • There is supporting evidence for 25 qualitative statements, selected on a risk basis, within the Report. Limitations of our review Except for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) CO2 and Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) data where we have carried out procedures to meet the requirements for reasonable assurance, we conducted our work to express a limited assurance conclusion over the selected data. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Our scope of work was limited to the Sustainable Development information included in the Report. The scope of our engagement was limited to the reporting period, and therefore 2015 performance only. We did not seek evidence to support the statements and claims presented within the Report except for the 25 selected qualitative claims. We did not undertake a comprehensive review of all Sustainable Development data reported by each of the sites we visited but examined selected data sources and reviewed the processes for reporting data to Group. We have not provided assurance over claims made by MOL that are statements of belief or forward looking in nature. The responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud, error and non-compliance with laws or regulations rests with MOL management. Our work should not be relied upon to disclose all such material misstatements, frauds, errors or instances of noncompliance that may exist. Our conclusions Based on the scope of our review our conclusions are outlined below: Inclusivity Has MOL been engaging with stakeholders across the business to develop its approach to Sustainable Development? • We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups which have been excluded from engagement. • We are not aware of any matters that would lead us to conclude that MOL has not applied the inclusivity principle in developing its approach to Sustainable Development. 265 Independent Auditor's Report (Sustainability) Materiality Has MOL provided a balanced representation of material issues concerning its Sustainable Development performance? • We are not aware of any material issues concerning the Sustainable Development performance of MOL which has been excluded from the Report. • Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that MOL management has not applied its processes for determining material issues to be included in the Report. Responsiveness Has MOL responded to stakeholder concerns? • We are not aware of any matters that would lead us to conclude that MOL has not applied the responsiveness principle in considering the matters to be reported. Completeness, accuracy and consistency of performance information How complete and accurate is the ‘selected Group data’ presented in the Report (outlined above in step 5 and 6 of “Summary of work performed”)? • In our opinion, the Report presents fairly, in all material respects, the ETS CO2 and own staff LTIF indicators of the Group for the year ended on December 31, 2015. We are not aware of any errors that would materially affect the other Sustainable Development data as presented in the Report. • With the exception of the exclusions identified in the Report, we are not aware of any material operated subsidiaries and joint ventures (as defined by MOL) that have been excluded from the Group level data relating to the topics above. • Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the selected data has not been collated properly at Group level. • We are not aware of any errors that would materially affect the data as presented in the Report. Does MOL have procedures in place to enable the consistent collection and reporting of data across its reporting locations? • We are not aware of any inconsistencies in the data collection approach at the locations we have visited that would materially affect the data as presented in the Report. Reporting Does the Report meet the requirements for “Comprehensive” reporting set out in the GRI G4 Guidelines? • Nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that MOL management’s assertion that the Report meets the GRI G4 requirements for “Comprehensive” reporting is not fairly stated. How plausible are the statements and claims within the Report? • We are not aware of any misstatements in the assertions made across the 25 claims selected during our review. Observations and areas for improvement Our observations and areas for improvement will be raised in a report to MOL management. Selected observations are provided below. These observations do not affect our conclusions on the Report set out earlier in this statement. • M OL implemented a new data collecting and reporting system in 2015. Whilst our procedures suggest there has been a general improvement in data quality following the transition, we have observed examples of where clarification is required to improve understanding of the new system and reporting definitions at the site level. We therefore recommend that MOL continues to work with individuals across the business, and refine its reporting guidance, to improve the understanding of the new system and reporting requirements. • We have observed that MOL has interactions with a broad range of stakeholders on Sustainable Development, but that these interactions were not always documented in a formal manner at local levels. In 2015, the Company made considerable progress in this area, policies are implemented and communicated. We consider that stakeholder issues are captured by the various subsidiaries of the Group and issues are addressed. However, we recommend that MOL adopts a more systematic and consistent approach to monitoring and recording stakeholder engagement activity at its locations to enable the sharing of information and best practice between sites. • M OL introduced guidance for reporting social investment data during 2014 based on the LBG Methodology. Whilst this has helped to improve the quality of the data compared with prior years, we still identified examples of the guidance being applied incorrectly during the course of our work. We therefore encourage MOL to develop a more thorough review of the data reported at Group level, and to provide training to the individuals that are responsible for applying the guidance. Our independence and competence With the exception of this work, we have provided no other services relating to MOL’s approach to Sustainable Development reporting throughout 2015. We have implemented measures to ensure that we are in compliance with the applicable independence and professional competence rules as articulated by the IFAC Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants and ISQC1. Our assurance team has included members from our global Climate Change and Sustainability Services Practice, which undertakes similar engagements to this with a number of significant multinational businesses. Ernst & Young Kft. Budapest, 1 April 2016 Havas István Ernst & Young Ltd. Budapest 1 April, 2016 EUROPEAN WORKS COUNCIL REVIEW In 2016, the European Works Council (EWC) of MOL Group was asked once again to review the “Notes to Sustainability Performance” Chapter of the company’s 2015 Annual Report and the sustainability information presented on the corporate website. The EWC performed the review in three separate stages: • The Council had the opportunity to comment on the structure and proposed content of the report in the initial phase of reporting • The EWC then reviewed the “Human Capital” and the “Employee relations” chapters during the process of their preparation and commented on whether the content was complete and balanced. They also completed the information provided about employee representation. Their recommendations were also incorporated into these chapters. • At the final stage of the review, EWC was provided with the full text of the report and a roundtable was organized at which EWC members discussed the report with corporate HR and SD managers. Based on the above events, the EWC formed the following opinion: • According to the members of the EWC, the disclosed information is complete and covers all material topics which are relevant to a group-level report. • The EWC agreed with the content of the report which concerns the Works Council. • According to the EWC, the published information is accurate and the statements disclosed are valid. 267 Glossary Glossary Average realised hydrocarbon price Crack Spread Total revenue realised on hydrocarbon sales per barrel Difference between product's quoted price and crude oil price.
