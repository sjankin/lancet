Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Entity obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Entity loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value.

At the end Financial assets at FVTPL are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in profit or loss includes any dividend or rates in effect at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies interest earned on the financial asset and is included in the ‘interest income’ line item. Financial assets at are retranslated at the exchange rates in effect on the date when the fair value was determined. NonFVTPL consist mainly of financial assets held for trading. monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. The Entity has not designated any asset as at FVTPL. Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 2.6.4 Derecognition of financial assets For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of WTN and VM are The Entity derecognizes a financial asset only when the contract granting the Entity the right to receive translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect on the last business day of each reporting period. cash flows from the asset expires, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates and rewards of ownership to another entity. fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates in effect on the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recorded in other comprehensive income. 2.7 Investment property Investment properties are properties held to earn rentals and/or for capital appreciation (including property under construction for such purposes). Investment properties are measured initially at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 90 INNOVESTEAM 2015 ANNUAL REPORT 91 An investment property is derecognized upon sale or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn Equity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments at from use and no future economic benefits are expected to be received from such investment property.

The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Entity’s estimate of equity instruments that will 2.8 Office furniture eventually vest, with a corresponding increase in equity.

These restrictions are classified according to their restriction period: less than 12 months and over one As a lessee, the Entity recognizes operating lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the year, considering the period of time in which such restrictions are fulfilled, whereby the short-term restricted lease term, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which cash balance was classified within current assets under cash and cash equivalents and the long-term restricted economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. cash was classified within guarantee deposits made. 2.16 Taxation 2.10 Provisions Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Provisions are recognized when the Entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, when it is probable that the Entity will be required to settle the obligation, and when a reliable estimate 2.16.1 Current tax can be made of the amount of the obligation. Current income tax (“ISR”) is recognized in the results of the year in which is incurred. The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 2.16.2 Deferred tax obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties associated with Deferred taxes are then calculated by applying the tax rate to temporary differences resulting from the obligation. When a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, comparing the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and including, if any, future benefits from tax its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows (where the effect of the time value of money is loss carryforwards and certain tax credits. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable material). temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recorded only when there is a high probability of recovery. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognized if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to 2.11 Financial liabilities the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered. 2.11.1 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (“at Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in FVTPL”) or other financial liabilities. which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.

The liability is recognized as it accrues. These benefits include mainly statutory employee profit determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such sharing (“PTU”) payable, compensated absences, such as vacation and vacation premiums, and incentives. indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 2.13 Employee benefits for termination Employee benefits for termination are recorded in the results of the year in which they are incurred. 2.14 Pagos basados en acciones Share-based payment transactions of the Entity 92 INNOVESTEAM 2015 ANNUAL REPORT 93 Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.

Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income of the controlling interest by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.

Another revised version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014 Under IFRS 16 a lessee recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is treated mainly to include a) impairment requirements for financial assets and b) limited amendments to the similarly to other non-financial assets and depreciated accordingly and the liability accrues interest. This will classification and measurement requirements by introducing a ‘fair value through other comprehensive typically produce a front-loaded expense profile (whereas operating leases under IAS 17 would typically have income’ (FVTOCI) measurement category for certain simple debt instruments. had straight-line expenses) as an assumed linear depreciation of the right-of-use asset and the decreasing interest on the liability will lead to an overall decrease of expense over the reporting period. Key requirements of IFRS 9: ·· All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the lease term, Measurement are required to be subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value. Specifically, debt discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate. and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding are generally measured at amortized cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods. Debt However, a lessee may elect to account for lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual term for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less and containing no purchase options (this election is cash flows and selling financial assets, and that have contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to made by class of underlying asset); and leases where the underlying asset has a low value when new, such as cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are personal computers or small items of office furniture (this election can be made on a lease-by-lease basis). measured at FVTOCI. All other debt investments and equity investments are measured at their fair value at the end of subsequent accounting periods. In addition, under IFRS 9, entities may make an irrevocable IFRS 16 establishes different transitional provisions, including retrospective application or the modified election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading) retrospective application where the comparative period is not restated. in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognized in net income (loss). ·· In relation to the impairment of financial assets, IFRS 9 requires an expected credit loss model, as opposed to an incurred credit loss model under IAS 39. The expected credit loss model requires an entity to account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized. 94 INNOVESTEAM 2015 ANNUAL REPORT 95 The Entity is in the process of determining the potential impacts that will derive from the adoption of this 4.
