The result is a stronger financial there is a considerable difference in scale between standing and a well-established earnings foundation. Sojitz’s assets and those of its peers. Nevertheless, Furthermore, we have established a solid presence we are optimistic. The future has just begun for in various businesses and regions. For example, Sojitz.

Watch for Sojitz to realize comparatively strong profit growth. Having covered trading companies for approximately 10 years, when I think of Sojitz, I recall their issuance of 300 billion yen in moving strike convertible bonds (MSCB) soon after I started analyzing the sector. With the MSCBs, Sojitz carried out a buyback of preferred shares and dramatically improved its financial standing. This action has led to Sojitz’s current pursuit of profit growth in Medium-term Management Plan 2017— Challenge for Growth. In the year ended March 31, 2016, trading companies incurred massive impairment losses on investments in resources and other sectors. Sojitz was no exception, taking write-downs on its energy resource investments, but was able to keep the impact relatively minor. Part of the reason for this was Sojitz’s focus on improving its financial standing. This slowed new investment, which made the company less vulnerable to impact from the downturn in resource prices and the economic slump in emerging countries. Now, the Yasuhiro Narita general trading company sector is facing deteriorating financial standings due to writeExecutive Director downs and a severe business environment. Consequently, a growing number of trading Equity Research Department Nomura Securities Co., Ltd. companies are moving to curtail new investment. My impression is that expectations for profit growth have become lower for these other companies. As new investment stalls among its peers, Sojitz has a chance to realize comparatively strong profit growth by accumulating assets in areas where it has strengths. I am watching Sojitz with expectation. 6 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 Medium-term Management Plan 2017 was higher. Remaining indispensable to the development announced in May 2015. Sojitz’s share price rallied of emerging countries, creating businesses that around this time, but subsequently declined due to solve environmental problems, and building the slump in resource prices and weakness of networks that fulfill the needs of diverse Japanese share prices. However, as of June 30, stakeholders around the world – Sojitz will enhance 2016 our stock is clearly stronger than it was three the value it has provided to date and leverage its years ago. The message of Challenge for Growth unique strengths to establish an even more secure has steadily fueled expectations, and it is now our presence and contribute to a prosperous future. duty to meet them. But our ambitions are even My expectations lie in how Sojitz will establish its “unique strengths and identity.” My greatest expectation for Sojitz lies in the “unique strengths and identity” stated in Medium-term Management Plan 2017. It would be good for the company to further enhance its uniqueness. Learning a lesson from their excessive investments in resources and other sectors over the past several years, general trading companies are now talking about transitioning from business investment to business management, and about hands-on management of the businesses they invest in. Taking a more active role in the management of such businesses would boost their ability to provide functions Group-wide while raising the profitability and corporate value of the operating companies. This approach is quite likely an advantage for a company like Sojitz, whose size makes it more maneuverable. Furthermore, my understanding of Medium-term Management Plan 2017 is that Sojitz management has shifted from laying the foundation for new growth to the next stage of initiatives for growth. Growing earnings in a deteriorating external environment is no small Jiro Iokibe Chief Analyst feat, but Sojitz’s aggressive investments may enjoy the advantage of bucking the trend Equity Research Department among larger general trading companies toward curtailing investment. Obviously, investment Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd. discipline will be vital. At the same time, what I most hope they avoid is simply being contrary to or mimicking the larger general trading companies. I believe that presenting a mediumterm growth model that leverages Sojitz’s unique identity will lead to a higher stock valuation.

(TCCC), a to be the largest chemical manufacturing base, in fertilizer manufacturing Thailand. group in Southeast Asia. 8 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 Brand Power Established amid Challenges Today, Sojitz’s fertilizer business is building unassailable value through its solid brand power. The origin of the business goes back to just after World War II, in the early 1950s. At first, importing fertilizer materials from overseas was the main business. Sojitz imported fertilizer materials to Japan and domestic fertilizer manufacturers popularized compound chemical fertilizers, contributing to Japanese agriculture. We believed that compound chemical fertilizers would become popular in Southeast Asia for increasing efficiency of agriculture and improving yields and quality of agricultural products, just as it had in Japan. Therefore, we started up new businesses in Southeast Asia by jointly establishing local bases with Japanese manufacturers to produce and sell compound chemical fertilizers. We thought that strengthening the brand was the key to proceeding with this initiative and worked to increase market share in Asia. Specifically, we concentrated on negotiations with customers, whose culture is different from Japan’s, spreading understanding among farmers who actually use fertilizer, and on maintaining and managing quality. Farmers don’t like changing the fertilizer they use because they are concerned about yields. Even so, we went to farms and explained that using the compound chemical fertilizers supplied by Sojitz would increase yields and improve quality. We took time, slowly but surely promoting the merits of using compound chemical fertilizers. In 1973, we established Thai Central Chemical Public Company, Ltd. (TCCC) as a manufacturing base in Thailand and continued activities to build trust. Business was tough. We faced one challenge after another, such as the two oil crises of the 1970s, the devaluation of the Thai baht several times from 1973 to 1984 and management crises at our partners. However, in 1995 we invested in a fertilizer manufacturing company in the Philippines and in 1998 manufacturing began at our fertilizer company in Vietnam. As a result of establishing local bases, appropriately understanding customers’ needs and steadily supplying high-quality compound chemical fertilizers, we built a solid position in the ASEAN region. Overcame the Financial Crisis of 2008 and Grew to Be One of the Core Businesses of Sojitz The situation changed dramatically with the onset of the financial crisis of 2008. With excess inventory, the fertilizer business saw its results squeezed, which had a significant impact on Sojitz overall. However, by properly understanding the situation and raising the efficiency of production and sales, we were able to adjust inventories to an appropriate level and overcome the crisis. Also, due to the brand power that we had spent time building, we had a solid customer base, so even in this difficult environment the business didn’t lose market share or customers and was therefore able to maintain steady sales volume. As a result, in addition to having one of the largest chemical fertilizer manufacturing groups in Southeast Asia with production capacity totaling 1.8 million tons for three countries, our fertilizer business has grown to be one of the core businesses underpinning Sojitz’s steady growth. Going forward, to further strengthen the foundation of this business we are considering manufacturing and sales businesses in Myanmar, Indonesia and neighboring countries with strong partners. We will further expand the fertilizer business, which represents Sojitz, as we work to solve the food problem, a global social issue.

In 1996, Sojitz, which had long seen the country’s growth potential, partnered with the Sinar Mas Group, one of Indonesia’s largest conglomerates, to acquire 3,000 hectares of land for urban development. This was the start of Deltamas City. But circumstances changed abruptly in 1997 due to the Asian currency crisis. We were forced to postpone development plans, and difficulties with financing also mounted. However, we firmly believed the project could contribute to Indonesia’s advancement, and thus worked step by step to develop basic infrastructure while riding out the hardships with a forward-looking vision. We started by constructing an interchange and developing transportation, traffic control and water supply infrastructure. While steadily building and expanding infrastructure, we also worked to attract regional government offices, universities and other institutions. We patiently endured the challenges and waited for the right opportunity to move forward. In 2010, that chance finally arrived. Indonesia’s per-capita GDP approached U.S.$3,000, annual vehicle production and sales volume approached 1 million units, and Japanese automotive parts manufacturers started considering making inroads into the Indonesian market. Moreover, in 2011, as a result of the Great East Japan Earthquake and severe flooding in Thailand, more companies started looking to Indonesia as a production base. Sojitz did not let this opportunity slip away. We accelerated industrial park lot sales and leasing mainly to Japanese automotive manufacturers by leveraging our distinctive networks as a general trading company and drawing on the cross-linked initiatives of our business divisions. With the infrastructure developed at Deltamas City, the rare supply of large lots ideal for various purposes as a strong sales feature, and Sojitz’s completion of an environment in which manufacturers entering the country could concentrate on their production operations, the industrial park attracted 86 tenant companies (of which 69 were Japanese) in just five years. Harnessing Group Strengths to Promote Comprehensive Urban Infrastructure Development While the industrial park development business is proving successful, population growth in Indonesia suggests that new opportunities await, such as for developing and managing infrastructure in urban areas. This is a good area for Sojitz as a general trading company to fully capitalize on the value generated by its multiple businesses and networks, as well as its expertise. We will strive to expand urban infrastructure as a master developer, such as by attracting shopping malls, by developing apartments for shortand long-term business travelers, Japanese restaurants, fitness facilities, and by attracting hospitals, universities and Japanese schools. Furthermore, we plan to contribute to Indonesia’s further growth by creating a safe and secure city with unprecedented value through next-generation urban functions such as crime prevention infrastructure and energysaving facilities, as well as by cultivating seedlings for trees and shrubs to be planted within Deltamas City to reduce CO2 emissions.

The framework for screening business investment proposals includes a careful examination of the overall business plan, including cash flow projections, in order to rigorously assess project feasibility. An internal rate of return (IRR) is calculated to evaluate the profitability of a business investment and ascertain whether it meets the profit target (hurdle rate). The council selects investments likely to generate returns commensurate with risk. Moreover, investment proposals are deliberated beforehand as necessary by corporate departments, which offer opinions from their specialized viewpoints. We work to enhance the value of businesses by proactively managing operating companies to strengthen their competitiveness and profitability, while remaining conscious of the social significance of their existence. As for investments already made, we conduct thorough process management including regular assessments of business viability, and make timely and appropriate decisions on whether or not to continue the business.

Trading companies always attract talent. Not just Ishikura top students, but independent people who will contribute to corporate growth. That is why I think Sojitz must further the capabilities of these individuals. At the same time, I think that Sojitz needs to do more to promote diversity. Hiring and deploying more employees with diverse expertise and backgrounds would further increase management prowess.

I came to this position in 2015 and what I am conscious of is “nurturing seeds” that will benefit the next generation in terms of business and personnel. What results does one’s own performance bring, and how do those results contribute to the next generation?

London Legal Dept. is responsible for legal affairs in Europe, Russia and NIS such as providing support to sales or administrative teams on drafting and reviewing contracts, handling insolvencies, litigation and arbitration. Legal Dept. also has a compliance function such as investigating and reporting compliance issues and providing compliance training. I have been a member of Sojitz’s Legal Dept. since joining the Company. Before I joined London Legal this year, I went abroad for studying and training and spent several years in Tokyo Legal Dept. after taking maternity leave. Due to its nature of the work, Legal Dept. often communicates with sales or administrative teams via emails. However, as we have many offices with different languages and cultures in our region, such differences might cause a conflict, miscommunication and misunderstanding in multicultural team like us. Therefore, having a close communication for instance by explaining the reasoning behind thinking is the key to avoid such conflicts.

Central and South America encompass markets with various characteristics, including markets that are fiercely competitive due to imports of completely built-up vehicles, markets where there is an automotive industry and domestic vehicles are protected, and markets with free trade agreements. Sojitz will pursue further opportunities to enter markets by choosing its methods of participation according to market characteristics. In Russia, we handle vehicles from Subaru, which has global brand value and strong sales growth, and conduct marketing and sales through a distributor established in 2000. We succeeded in increasing sales volume at a time when Russia was undergoing rapid economic growth and the automobile market was expanding strongly, and we attribute that sales growth to our steady cultivation of local dealers and efforts to build a sales and service network.

From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Sojitz received substantial orders for the 767 to replace the aging 727 and DC8. Such success, despite the intense competition for these numerous orders, gave Boeing aircraft a market share of over 90% in Japan and solidified Sojitz’s position as Boeing’s sales representative.

The investment in CADRI will give Sojitz access to these functions and expertise. Railways are said to produce only one-eighth of the carbon dioxide that automobiles emit per unit transported and are able to move bulk quantities. This efficiency has led experts to predict growth in demand for rail-based infrastructure around the world. The increase in rail transport volume and rolling stock is also expected to lead to sustained expansion of maintenance demand to extend the life of rolling stock while ensuring and enhancing safety and convenience. North America is a promising market for railway transportation, given that the region has the world’s longest network of railway lines and largest railway traffic volume, and exhibits long-term population and economic growth.

Accordingly, we have earmarked approximately ¥300.0 billion to fund investments and loans over the three-year period of Medium-term Management Plan 2017. Through these investments and loans as well as trading operations, we aim to construct earnings foundations capable of stably generating profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥50.0 billion or more, and will target profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) of ¥60.0 billion or more in the year ending March 31, 2018, the final year of the plan. 7 Basic Policy on Dividends As a basic policy, Sojitz’s top management priorities include paying stable dividends on an ongoing basis while enhancing competitiveness and shareholder value by increasing internal capital reserves and using them effectively. Under this policy, the consolidated payout ratio during Medium-term Management Plan 2017 will be approximately 25%. Sojitz decided to pay a year-end cash dividend as follows after comprehensively considering factors including results for the fiscal year and total equity. As a result, the consolidated payout based on profit for the year (attributable to owners of the Company) was 27.4%. Year-end cash dividends paid totaled ¥5,004 million. Including the interim dividend of ¥4.00 per share paid on December 1, 2015, cash dividends per share for the year ended March 31, 2016 totaled ¥8.00 per share, and dividends paid totaled ¥10,008 million. The effective date of dividends from surplus was June 17, 2016. Sojitz’s Articles of Incorporation permit the payment of interim cash dividends by the resolution of the Board of Directors as stipulated by Article 454, Paragraph 5 of the Companies Act of Japan. As a result, Sojitz’s basic policy is to pay dividends twice annually, with the interim dividend being approved by resolution of the Board of Directors and the year-end dividend being approved by the Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting.

Material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to cash-generating unit groups were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ....................................................................... 7,460 7,460 66,017 Consumer Lifestyle Business Domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business .............................................................. 8,090 8,090 71,592 The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated was calculated based on its value in use founded on the five-year forecast that was approved by management. The five-year forecast of cash flows is based on budgets reflecting past performance. In addition, the main assumption used to determine such forecast was the growth rate of gross profits through such terms, such growth rate being consistent with the forecasts of the nominal GDP growth rate or the like of the countries in which such cash-generating unit groups are situated. The discount rates before tax and ultimate growth rates which were used in calculating the value in use of the cash-generating unit groups to which significant goodwill has been allocated for the years ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, respectively, were as follows. (a) Discount rate before tax 2015 2016 Chemicals Parent company’s chemical business ............................................................................................. 6.7% 6.7% Consumer Lifestyle Business The domestic subsidiaries’ food sales business ............................................................................. 6.8% 6.8% (b) Ultimate growth rate In regards to cash flows for the terms beyond the five-year forecast period that was approved by management, the value in use is calculated with a growth rate of 0% for each such term. With respect to goodwill that has been allocated to cash-generating unit groups, the recoverable amount of such goodwill sufficiently exceeds its carrying amount. Thus, even if major assumptions are changed to a reasonable extent, the probability of such recoverable amount becoming less than the carrying amount is unlikely.

The value of these mining rights were 13,427 million yen on March 31, 2015, and 5,807 million yen (U.S.$51,389 thousand) on March 31, 2016. The value of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives as of March 31, 2016, included above was 4,957 million yen (U.S.$43,867 thousand). Such assets consisted primarily of franchise agreements. These franchise agreements were mainly acquired through business combinations and were expected to exist as long as business continues. Therefore, management considers the useful lives of these assets to be indefinite. There were no internally-generated intangible assets as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016. Amortization expenses are included in “Cost of sales” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss.

These appraisals are calculated based on either the public offering price, a sales comparison approach or discount cash flow approach. Upon an acquisition from a third party or at the time of the most recent appraisal, if there is no significant fluctuation in the index, which is believed to reflect a certain appraised value (market or assessed price) or appropriate market value, the fair value is adjusted using such appraised value or index. As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments”, fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. Investment property is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. 140 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 (2) Profit or loss relating to investment property Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Rental income from investment property .................................................................... 4,600 4,940 43,716 Expenses arising from investment property ................................................................

The Company will achieve such goals continuously by enhancing the effective rate of assets through the replacements of assets and by expanding the stable revenue base. These indices are periodically reported to and monitored by management. * Net DER = (interest bearing liabilities cash and cash equivalents time deposits) ÷ own equity (own equity = total equity amount less non-controlling interests) ** Risk assets ratio = risk asset (such asset amount calculated based on assessment of such risk in correspondence to the size of such risk) ÷ own equity Net DERs and risk assets ratios as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, respectively, were as follows. 2015 2016 Net DER ..................................................................................................................... 1.1 times 1.1 times Risk assets ratio .......................................................................................................... 0.6 times 0.6 times Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 147 (2) Number of authorized shares, issued shares and shares of treasury stocks Shares 2015 2016 Authorized: ordinary shares ......................................................................................... 2,500,000,000 2,500,000,000 Issued: ordinary shares Balance at beginning of year ...................................................................................... 1,251,499,501 1,251,499,501 Increase or decrease for the year ............................................................................... — — Balance at end of year ............................................................................................... 1,251,499,501 1,251,499,501 Treasury stock: ordinary shares Balance at beginning of year ...................................................................................... 467,298 477,089 Increase or decrease for the year ............................................................................... 9,791 7,770 Balance at end of year ............................................................................................... 477,089 484,859 In addition to the above, as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, Fuji Nihon Seito Corporation, one of its Entities subject to Equity Method, owned 200,000 shares of the Company.

Certain domestic subsidiaries have welfare pension funds and/or lump-sum payment plans that are primarily defined benefit plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans. Payments by these plans are calculated using criteria including employee rank and salary level.

(f) Expected contribution to the plan for the year ending March 31, 2017 The Group expects to contribute 2,144 million yen (U.S.$18,973 thousand) to plan assets for the year ending March 31, 2017. 156 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 3) Defined contribution plan Expenses recognized for the defined contribution plan for the years ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 were 1,624 million yen and 1,429 million yen (U.S.$12,646 thousand), respectively. 4) Multi-employer plans Certain subsidiaries participate in the “Sojitz Group Pension Fund”, which is a multi-employer plan established jointly by a group of businesses. In addition, Group subsidiary Nissho Electronics Corporation participates in the “Tokyo-to Electric Industry Employee’s Pension Fund Organization”, which is also a multi-employer plan. The contributions for each fund are calculated as a fixed percentage of the average salary or the like of participating employees. In addition, each fund ensures future solvency by revising the contribution a minimum of every five years in accordance with relevant regulations. If the funds are dissolved and liquidated, they will charge participants to cover deficits or distribute residual assets calculated by minimum funding standards based on regulations or the like. In addition, companies that elect to withdraw from the funds are subject to a charge to cover any liabilities and deficits projected to result from their withdrawal. The Sojitz Group Pension Fund is a defined benefit plan, but does not determine discrete contribution rates and proportional contributions for past service costs for each participating employer. The Group therefore accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of each participating subsidiary cannot be reasonably calculated. The Tokyo-to Electric Industry Employee’s Pension Fund Organization is a defined benefit, multi-employer plan. The Group accounts for its contributions to this fund as a post-employment benefit expense because the plan assets that correspond to the contribution of Nissho Electronics Corporation cannot be reasonably calculated. On March 31, 2016, approval was received from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare to dissolve the Sojitz Group Pension Fund. No additional expenses are expected to be incurred due to the dissolution of the fund.

(23,404) (11,384) (100,743) The Company and its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries adopt a consolidated taxation system. For the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company and some of such subsidiaries recognized tax losses and deferred tax assets for the unused tax losses carried forward only to the extent it was probable that they could be used against future taxable profit within rational estimate periods, since they could recognize taxable profit each period excluding non-ordinary factors. The taxable profit was calculated based on estimation for increase and decrease of the temporary differences and was approved by the Company’s management. As of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, the consolidated taxation group recognized deferred tax assets of 9,401 million yen and 11,380 million yen (U.S.$100,707 thousand), respectively for the tax losses carried forward. 2) Contents of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities Contents of changes in deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were as follows.

Because the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of such temporary differences, and it is probable that such temporary differences will not be reversed within the foreseeable future, the Group did not recognize deferred tax liabilities with respect to such temporary differences.

Its headquarters includes business sections that handle merchandising, trading, product manufacturing, services, project planning and management, investments and financing activities, both domestically and internationally. Such businesses are inherently exposed to various risks. The Group defines and classifies risks per risk item and manages each of them in accordance with its nature. (3) Credit risk management The Group assumes credit risk by extending credit to many domestic and foreign customers through a variety of commercial transactions. The Group mitigates such credit risk by objectively assigning credit ratings to the customers to which it extends credit based on the Company’s credit rating system. The Group also controls credit risk by setting rating-based credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis and enforcing the credit limits thus set. The Group employs other safeguards (e.g., collaterals and guarantees) as warranted by the customer’s creditworthiness. Additionally, the Group has a system for assessing receivables, in which customers are extracted based on a certain criteria, then assessed for their creditworthiness. With respect to such selected customers, the Group also checks for existence of any receivables, protection measures or the like. Through the above, the Group endeavors to more rigorously ascertain credit risk and calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts for each account receivable. Please note that the Group does not carry any excessive credit risk with respect to any specified customer. In regards to derivative transactions, the Group only deals with financial institutions with high credit ratings, as assigned by internationallyacknowledged rating agencies, so as to minimize the credit risks. The Group also periodically reviews the credit ratings of counterparties to such derivative transactions and re-evaluates credit limits so as to minimize credit risks based on non-performance by such counterparties. 1) Maximum exposure to credit risk Other than guaranteed obligations, the Group’s maximum exposure with respect to credit risks without taking into account any collaterals held or other credit enhancements is the carrying amount of financial instruments less impairment losses under the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the other hand, the Group’s maximum exposures to credit risks concerning guaranteed obligations as of March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 were 27,092 million yen and 19,986 million yen (U.S.$176,867 thousand), respectively. 2) Financial assets that are past the due date The analysis of aging of trade and other receivables that were past the due date but not impaired as of the end of the year was as follows. The amounts below include amounts expected to be collected through acquisition of security, insurance coverage or the like. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Within three months past due date .............................................................................. 17,692 12,843 113,654 Between three and six months past due date .............................................................. 2,640 1,762 15,592 Between six months and one year past due date ......................................................... 657 935 8,274 Over one year past due date ....................................................................................... 4,233 1,734 15,345 Total .................................................................................................................... 25,224 17,276 152,884 3) Financial assets of which impairment has occurred The Group establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts for each major customer by reviewing, among other matters, such customer’s financial condition and credit ratings, status of collection of receivables with respect to such customer, amendments to payment conditions, industry trends and state of affairs of the country/region in which such customer was situated. Trade and other receivables that were individually determined to be impaired as of the end of the year were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Trade and other receivables ......................................................................................... 54,703 58,880 521,061 Allowance for doubtful accounts ..................................................................................

Instead, the Group accounts for such impairment loss under the allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in allowance for doubtful accounts were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Balance at beginning of year ..................................................................................... 49,950 45,257 400,504 Increase for the year (Note)........................................................................................ 1,203 9,553 84,539 Decrease for the year (incurred and charged against the allowance) ...........................

(4) Liquidity risk management The Group raises funds through borrowings from financial institutions or issuance of bonds. Accordingly, in the event of a disruption to the financial system or financial/capital markets or a major downgrade to the Group’s credit rating by a rating agency, the Group’s fundraising may become constrained and consequently there is a possibility that the Group will not be able to carry out the payment of debt by the defined payment date. The Group has entered into long-term commitment line agreements with a total amount of U.S. $500 million in addition to an existing long-term commitment line agreement in the amount of 100 billion yen to enhance the supplementary function for securing flexibility and liquidity for fund-raising. The Group makes efforts to maintain good relationships with financial institutions, including the counterparties to these commitment line agreements. 1) Non-derivative financial liabilities The breakdown of non-derivative financial liabilities by due date was as follows. 2015 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 483,086 16,421 1,484 500,992 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 210,571 635,574 253,061 1,099,207 Total ............................................................................................ 693,657 651,996 254,545 1,600,199 2016 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 434,119 13,658 1,932 449,709 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 164,597 533,710 286,102 984,410 Total ............................................................................................ 598,716 547,368 288,034 1,434,119 2016 Thousands of U.S. dollars Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Trade and other payables .................................................................... 3,841,761 120,867 17,097 3,979,725 Bonds and borrowings ........................................................................ 1,456,610 4,723,097 2,531,876 8,711,592 Total ............................................................................................ 5,298,371 4,843,964 2,548,973 12,691,318 Other than the above, the guarantees for obligations as March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 were 27,092 million yen and 19,986 million yen (U.S.$176,867 thousand), respectively. 162 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2) Derivatives The breakdown of derivatives by due date was as follows. 2015 Millions of yen Between one and Over Within one year five years five years Total Currency-related derivatives Cash inflows .................................................................................... 322,738 14,944 — 337,683 Cash outflows .................................................................................

The Group’s basic policy is to minimize such market risks by matching assets and liabilities (e.g., long and short commodity exposures) and through hedge transactions, such as forward exchange transactions, commodity futures/forward transactions and interest rate swaps. Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 163 1) Exchange rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policy for managing, exchange rate fluctuation risk The Group engages in import and export transactions and offshore transactions, both denominated in foreign currencies, as its principal business activity. Whereas the revenues and expenditures associated with such transactions are mainly received/paid out in foreign currencies, the Group’s consolidated reporting currency is Japanese yen. The Group is, therefore, exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the yen’s value against foreign currencies. To prevent or limit losses stemming from such risk, the Group hedges its foreign currency exposure through forward exchange transactions or the like. 2. Sensitivity analysis of exchange rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, that would result from 1% appreciation of yen against each of the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. In addition, such analysis does not include the affected amounts based on translations (into Japanese yen) of financial instruments denominated in functional currency, income and expenses denominated in foreign currency and assets and liabilities of foreign operations. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Profit before tax U.S. dollar ........................................................................................................... 716 (124) (1,097) Australian dollar ...................................................................................................

(160) (162) (1,433) Australian dollar ................................................................................................... (45) 34 300 2) Interest rate fluctuation risk 1. Content of and policy for managing interest rate fluctuation risk The Group raises funds by borrowing from financial institutions and issuing bonds to acquire fixed assets, invest in securities, and extend credit (e.g., through trade receivables). Asset and liability items are categorized based on whether or not they are sensitive to interest rate changes, with the difference between the value of sensitive assets and sensitive liabilities used to determine an interest rate mismatch value. Based on this amount, the ratios of funds procured from fixed-rate sources and variable-rate sources are adjusted to better manage interest rate fluctuation risks. 2. Sensitivity analysis of interest rate fluctuation risk In regards to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amount affecting profit before tax, as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that the interest rate increases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant. Under such analysis, the amount affecting profit before tax is calculated by multiplying the net balance of the financial instruments affected by the interest rate fluctuation at the fiscal year-end by 1%. Please note that other than financial instruments with floating rates (excluding those that are considered to be financial instruments with fixed rates in substance due to interest rate swaps), the Group deals with, among others, the following financial instruments that are also affected by interest rate fluctuations: trade notes and accounts receivable; and, trade notes and accounts payable. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Profit before tax .................................................................................................... (2,280) (1,438) (12,725) 3) Commodity price fluctuation risk 1. Content of, and policies for managing, commodity price fluctuation risk As a general trading company, the Group deals in a wide range of commodities through its various businesses. As such, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk due to price fluctuations or the like. For market-traded commodities, the Group manages exposures and controls losses by setting (long and short) position limits and stop-loss levels per internal organizational unit. The Group also prescribes and enforces stop-loss rules (i.e., an internal organizational unit must promptly liquidate losing positions and be prohibited from initiating new trades for the remainder of the fiscal year if losses, including valuation losses, exceed the stop-loss level). Even with such controls, however, there is no assurance that the Group can completely avoid commodity price risk. The Group’s management performance and/or financial conditions may be adversely affected by unanticipated market movements. With respect to commodity inventories, the Group implements measures, such as monthly monitoring by business or the like, in order to control inventory levels. 164 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 2. Sensitivity analysis of commodity price fluctuation risk In regards to derivatives related to financial instruments held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting profit before tax and other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that the commodity price decreases by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

Content of, and policies for managing, stock price fluctuation risk The Group has large holdings of marketable securities and, therefore, is exposed to stock price fluctuation risk. Against such risk, the Group makes efforts to understand market prices and financial conditions or the like of issuers and, especially with respect to listed stocks, the Group reviews their portfolios on a periodic basis. 2. Sensitivity analysis of stock price fluctuation risk In regards to listed stocks held by the Group as of the end of the consolidated year, the following chart shows the amounts affecting other comprehensive income (before tax effect adjustments), as reported in the consolidated financial statements, in the case that prices of such listed stocks decrease by 1%. Such analysis is based on the assumption that other factors remain constant.

As set forth under “2 BASIS OF PRESENTATION (4) Use of estimates and judgments”, fair values are categorized into three levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques. 1) Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost Millions of yen Thousands of U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Carrying Fair Carrying Fair Carrying Fair amount value amount value amount value Financial assets Trade and other receivables Trade notes and accounts receivable ............................... 521,720 521,479 465,217 465,049 4,116,964 4,115,477 Total ......................................................................... 521,720 521,479 465,217 465,049 4,116,964 4,115,477 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables Trade notes and accounts payable .................................. 413,707 413,705 362,804 362,804 3,210,654 3,210,654 Bonds and borrowings Bonds payable (including current portion) ........................ 99,688 101,229 79,771 81,683 705,938 722,858 Long-term loans (including current portion) ...................... 835,936 857,463 775,233 795,992 6,860,469 7,044,176 Total ......................................................................... 1,349,333 1,372,398 1,217,809 1,240,481 10,777,070 10,977,707 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 165 The fair values stated above are calculated as follows. (a) Trade notes and accounts receivable Each receivable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (b) Trade notes and accounts payable Each payable is categorized by period, and its fair value is the present value of future cash flows discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to maturity and credit risk. (c) Bonds and borrowings The fair value of bonds payable is the market price when available. The fair value of long-term loans is the present value of total principal and interest discounted using an assumed interest rate on equivalent new borrowings. Financial assets and liabilities measured at amortized cost are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. 2) Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value ① Analysis of fair value by hierarchy level The following tables provide analysis by level reflecting the significance of inputs used when measuring fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position that are measured at fair value. No financial assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 2015 Millions of yen Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Recurring fair value measurements Other investments Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss ............ — 343 643 986 Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ................................................................. 120,126 — 53,678 173,805 Derivative financial assets and liabilities ................................................

(a) Other investments The fair value of listed shares is the quoted price on an exchange, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. The fair value of unlisted shares is calculated using valuation methods including discounted future cash flow, market prices of comparable companies, net asset value, and other valuation methods, and is categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3. Measuring the fair value of unlisted shares involves the use of unobservable inputs such as discount rate and valuation multiples, as well as any necessary adjustments including discounts for a lack of liquidity or a non-controlling interest. The Group’s corporate departments determine the policies and procedures for measuring the fair value of unlisted shares, and validate their approach to measuring fair value, including the valuation model, by periodically confirming issues such as the operating circumstances associated with particular equities, the availability of relevant business plans, and data from comparable public companies. (b) Derivative financial assets and liabilities Currency-related derivatives The fair values of foreign exchange transactions, spot/forward transactions, currency option transactions and currency swap transactions are calculated based on the forward exchange rate as of the closing date. Interest rate-related derivatives The fair value of interest-rate swaps is the present value of future cash flow discounted by an interest rate that reflects time to settlement and credit risk. Commodity-related derivatives The fair value of commodity futures transactions is calculated using final prices on commodities exchanges as of the fiscal year-end. The fair values of commodity forward transactions, commodity option transactions and commodity swap transactions are calculated based on the index prices publicly announced at the fiscal year-end. Commodity futures transactions are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 1. All other derivative financial assets and liabilities are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 2. ② Recurring fair value measurements categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 The increases/decreases in financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized within fair value hierarchy Level 3 were as follows.

The fair values of such financial assets at the dates of the sales transactions and the cumulative gains (before taxes) concerning such sales were as follows. Thousands of Millions of yen U.S. dollars 2015 2016 2016 Fair value at the date of sale ...................................................................................... 6,412 5,324 47,115 Cumulative gains ....................................................................................................... 861 2,521 22,309 168 Sojitz Corporation Integrated Report 2016 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 4) Reclassification to retained earnings The Group reclassifies to retained earnings cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair values of financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in either of the following cases: when an investment is disposed of; and, when there is a significant decline in the fair value. Such cumulative other comprehensive income totals (net of taxes) that were reclassified to retained earnings for the years ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016 were gains of 687 million yen and gains of 2,016 million yen (U.S.$17,840 thousand), respectively. (8) Hedge accounting 1) Types of hedge accounting (a) Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. The Group designates commodity futures and commodity forwards as hedging instruments to hedge the changes in fair values of firm commitments or inventories. With respect to a fair value hedge, gains or losses from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value are recognized as profit or loss, and gains or losses on hedged items attributable to hedged risks are also recognized as profit or loss. Gains or losses recognized as profit or loss relating to hedging instruments included net losses of 394 million yen and net gains of 45 million yen (U.S.$398 thousand) for the years ended March 31, 2015, and March 31, 2016, respectively. Gains or losses on the hedged items or less corresponded to the gains or losses on the hedging instruments. (b) Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is a hedge of exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a scheduled transaction that is most likely to occur. The Group designates interest rate swaps as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows relating to floating-rate borrowings and designates forward exchange transactions as hedging instruments to hedge the variability of cash flows concerning firm commitments in foreign currency. With respect to a cash flow hedge, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. For the years ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, accumulated amounts of other comprehensive income that were expected to be reclassified to profit or loss within one year due to cash flow hedges (before tax effect adjustments) were profit of 570 million yen and profit of 168 million yen (U.S.$1,486 thousand), respectively. (c) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations The group designates forward exchange transactions and foreign currency borrowings as hedging instruments to hedge the risk of change in exchange rate concerning net investments in foreign operations. With respect to a hedge of net investments in foreign operations, the portions of the gains or losses on the hedging instruments that are determined to be effective hedges are recognized as other comprehensive income. 2) Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting Fair values of hedging instruments by type of hedge accounting were as follows.
