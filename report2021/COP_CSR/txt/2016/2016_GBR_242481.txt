In this our fourth annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to integrate the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations.

Yours sincerely, Pritpal S Sehmi Managing Director Spirit UK Managed Services Limited, United Kingdom, COP for 2015/16 Human Rights Principles Policy and Goals Spirit UK actively supports the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. As far as we are aware, we do not carry out business with any countries or organisations where human rights fail to be respected and unacceptable methods are used e.g. exploitation, torture, politically motivated disappearances, slavery and child labour. We support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights, including: the right to life, the right to a nationality, treating employees fairly and consistently and the right to movement and residence. Spirit UK strives to ensure equality to all employees and is committed to zero tolerance of victimisation, bullying or harassment. Spirit UK’s operations are in the United Kingdom and comply with the protection offered by legislation in the UK. Our Director ensures that we protect the human rights of our employees through establishing and implementing various policies that support our company values. Implementation Every effort is made to ensure the countries where our manufacturing and procurement partners are located comply with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We evaluate all partners and suppliers against a set of defined principles, policies and guidelines. Any contraventions of human rights are documented and the responsible partner will be put on probation and given a timeframe to address and resolve the issue. Continued non-­‐compliance will result in the partner relationship being terminated. To ensure all Spirit UK employees are informed of organisational changes, staff consultations are completed. This allows employees the opportunity to influence the outcome of the changes prior to implementation. Our company handbook covers policies concerning our employee rights, compensation and responsibilities.
