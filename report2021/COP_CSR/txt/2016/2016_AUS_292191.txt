INDIGENOUS EMPLOYEES Woolworths is committed to creating opportunities and increasing Indigenous employment. This commitment is outlined in our Reconciliation Action Plan. 6 PEOPLE: encouraging diversity CONTINUED We continue to work towards closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through our people strategy, which includes: • Employment Parity Initiative: In December 2015, Woolworths entered into a contract with the Australian Federal Government under the Employment Parity Initiative. This will result in Woolworths adding 1,600 new Indigenous team members to our business over the next three years. Currently, 1.1% of our staff identify as Indigenous. Our goal is to increase this to 2% of our Store Operations team and Graduate intake. To help us get there, we are carrying out targeted recruitment and cultural awareness training in partnership with a national provider, Diversity Dimensions, and have built a state-by-state IMAGE: CEO Brad Banducci attending the launch of the workforce plan for our Supermarkets. Woolworths' Employment Parity Initiative • Supply Nation: Supply Nation is dedicated to growing diversity within the supply chain and we are working with them to engage Indigenous suppliers. For example, over the past year, we have increased our business with Message Stick Communications by 25% and with Young Guns Container Crew by 3%. We are also in our sixth year of working with tomato supplier Kalano. • Jawun Indigenous Community Secondment Program: During the year, Endeavour Drinks continued to partner with Jawun, a not-for-profit organisation that supports innovative programs of change in Indigenous communities. Their Secondment Program provides Indigenous communities with skilled Woolworths corporate employees to help in areas such as marketing and business planning. BUILDING A WORKFORCE THAT MIRRORS OUR CUSTOMER BASE Understanding our customers is critical to providing the best shopping experience. During 2015, we undertook significant work around this in our Dan Murphy’s business, with positive customer feedback. We mapped community demographics across 250 stores so managers could make better-informed decisions about product ranging and recruitment. Woolworths is rolling out a similar program across our other businesses between now and 2020. ENABLING EVERYONE TO ACHIEVE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL Woolworths has a long and proud tradition of providing employment opportunities for people at all stages of their lives by championing inclusive work practices that we continually develop. By 2020, we want all our Talent Acquisition teams to have completed unconscious bias training. This will also contribute to our goal of halving our reported bullying and discrimination statistics – an important step on our journey towards zero workplace bullying. Our core focus areas are people with a disability, age diversity and LGBTI inclusion. Disability Woolworths belongs to the Australian Network on Disability (AND), which represents corporate organisations in supporting disability employment. We are a Gold Member and sit on the AND Board. Woolworths will continue to work with AND to build our disability action plan, with a view to significantly increasing work opportunities for people with a disability. Age diversity Woolworths provides many young people in Australia and New Zealand with a great start to their careers. More than 79,000 of our team members are under the age of 25. We also value the experience of older workers, with almost 20,000 team members aged over 55 years. Our 25 Year Club, which acknowledges long service and dedication, now has more than 10,000 members. 7 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 LGBTI Woolworths recently became a member of Pride in Diversity, Australia’s national not-for-profit LOST TIME INJURY employer support program for all aspects of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex FREQUENCY RATE 7 (LGBTI) workplace inclusion.

We won the Highly Commended award for the implementation of the Univer AUSTRALIA (NSCA) AWARDS Brake Interlock System (UBIS), a joint venture between Woolworths and Univer that makes our loading docks safer. REDUCING THE RISK OF MANUAL HANDLING INJURIES 1 To address the risk of manual handling in our business, we engaged a leading ergonomist to conduct an independent review of our retail operations. The recommendations were on how to improve work design for our team members to prevent these types of injuries. In addition, the Logistics team has adapted a vacuum picker for heavy and high frequency PERFORMANCE products. This technology is presently being trialled across three distribution centres. The feedback from both front line and operations teams has been very positive. HIGHLIGHTS MAKING SERIOUS INJURIES FROM BANDSAWS A THING OF THE PAST The solution to eliminate serious injuries from bandsaws was developed by the Woolworths Meat Company team.

This work will continue throughout FY17. 3 BUSINESS CELEBRATING SAFETY REVIEW Over 100 safety and operational team members from across the country came together to further learn and be inspired about safety. Internal and external speakers presented on various topics including critical risk, mental health, manual handling, workers’ compensation and the 4 organisation’s overall safety strategy and vision. Additionally, several of our team members were recognised for demonstrating ongoing excellence in safety leadership. OTHER HEALTH AND WELLBEING INFORMATION Employee nutrition education To help Woolworths achieve our vision to become a world class retailer and a leader in nutrition and health, we have made nutrition understanding a key competency for all employees. Our ambition is to engage all our employees as healthy lifestyle advocates so that together, we can inspire a healthier Australia. To this end, in 2014 we launched the Woolworths Nutrition Academy; an easily-accessible training hub and nutrition information source for all employees. This year we ran a series of staff Lunch and Learn sessions about health and nutrition at the Woolworths Support Office. The sessions were recorded and uploaded onto our All Good employee wellbeing website. Employee Assistance Program Stress at work and home can impact our employees’ wellbeing. Through our partnership with Converge Australia, all staff have access to an Employee Assistance Program that offers a confidential counselling service. 10 PLANET: for a healthy Australia Woolworths operates in a world where consumer demand and competitive pressures are increasing. At the same time, we want to play our part in alleviating environmental pressures and mitigating climate change. Our challenge is to use natural resources even more efficiently and still meet our business goals. We will do this through innovation, collaboration and engagement. CARBON EMISSIONS – FACILITIES SOLAR PANELS ON STORES Over the last eight years, Woolworths has invested in energy efficiency improvements to meet our challenging 2015 target to reduce carbon emissions from stores, distribution centres and 4,000 offices by 40%. Our goal was to bring facilities emissions back to the baseline year of 2006/07, despite growing our business. We tackled this by focusing on energy efficiency, particularly in new and refurbished stores, which are 30% more energy efficient than those we opened in 2008. We met our goal in 2015 and maintained this achievement in 2016. A key focus area will be refrigeration in more than 1,000 stores with refrigeration systems. WASTE DIVERTED FROM LANDFILL We will increase our use of natural refrigerants as we move towards replacing HFC refrigerants with HFC-free or hybrid systems; and reduce refrigerant leakage to our target level of a 15% 11% reduction of CO2-e below 2015 levels. Innovative projects diversion increase From our continued investment into energy efficiency, we have developed a good understanding of the approaches needed to reduce energy use. We integrate energy efficiency into the way we build and refurbish stores and we roll-out efficiency improvements to existing stores. We are implementing new innovative projects to improve reporting and planning to further ENERGY USE BY NEW STORES reduce energy use. Project Enlighten, a technology-based energy efficiency project that we rolled out over 18 months 30% from early 2015, has so far saved 157,000MWh and $24 million from a capital investment of $81 million. The project invested in improving lighting, refrigeration and air conditioning. less than in 2008 11 We have now begun the next phase of our energy efficiency drive, focusing on end-to-end energy management. Project Navitas will bring together performance data from the lighting, refrigeration and air-conditioning initiatives we undertook during Project Enlighten into a single dashboard visual display system to improve our reporting and planning. We are also establishing ENERGY SAVINGS FROM PROJECT ENLIGHTEN an Energy Management Centre of Excellence. 157,000MWh Renewable energy Under Project Enlighten, we invested $2.3 million in installing more than 4,000 rooftop solar panel systems at our Supermarkets, BIG W, liquor stores and petrol sites across all mainland states and territories. During FY16, these sites generated 1,560MWh. 11 For stores in FY16 compared to those opened in 2008. 11 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 CARBON EMISSIONS – TRANSPORT OUR RESOURCE EFFICIENCY TRENDS Emissions from company cars (tonnes of CO2-e) COUNTRY 2013 2014 2015 2016 Australia 14,992 9,939 8,654 8,860 CARBON INTENSITY New Zealand 1,936 1,898 1,926 1,987 (t CO2-e/SQUARE METERS) Total 16,928 11,837 10,580 10,847 1 During 2015/16 we continued our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our company 0.81 car fleet, with emissions more than 40% below our 2007 baseline.

Our largest impact on water usage is through the Woolworths supply chain. We will continue 12 13 14 15 16 to help our largest water-using suppliers to assess their risks and opportunities and build their GROUP capacity for managing water security, environmental impacts and drought resilience. REVIEW WASTE AND RECYCLING ENERGY INTENSITY Managing waste is a key corporate responsibility focus for Woolworths.

As well as addressing these challenges in our business, we see 3.0 2.9 2.9 2.9 2.8 it as our responsibility to support the role our customers can play. BUSINESS In 2016, we invested in improving our waste data management, leading to higher accuracy REVIEW in waste data that is helping us to better measure our performance and make more informed decisions. WASTE DISPOSAL In FY16, the amount of waste we sent to landfill increased slightly by 5%. However, the volume of materials that we recycled or diverted from landfill increased by 11%. These results reflect 4 OTHER both accounting changes and our increased diversion of waste from landfill. 12 13 14 15 16 INFORMATION WASTE DISPOSED TO OR DIVERTED FROM LANDFILL 2013 2014 2015 2016 WASTE INTENSITY Materials diverted from landfill 227,314 251,244 246,659 274,930 (T/SQUARE METERS) Waste to landfill 131,069 107,011 107,429 112,265 Note: Waste to landfill data is only from Australian Supermarkets, New Zealand Supermarkets and BIG W. 34 34 WASTE AUDITS 27 26 27 During our annual audit of the waste streams for 26 Australian Woolworths Supermarkets during FY16, we found: • Plastic film increased from 0.9% to 1.37% (target is below 1%) • Volume of recyclable cardboard increased from 1.08% to 1.64% (target is below 1%) We are working on improving our results with a Resource Recovery Roadshow for stores and new training and education materials. 12 13 14 15 16 12 PLANET: for a healthy Australia CONTINUED FOOD WASTE SUPERMARKETS WITH More than half of Woolworths’ waste stream is waste food. We will continue to move towards COMMERCIAL FOOD zero food waste to landfill by increasing our stores’ access to diversion options and encouraging RECYCLING PROGRAM them to separate food waste into organics bins. We want to reduce the amount of food waste that we send to landfill every year. 584 We have introduced commercial food recycling services to 200 more stores over the past 12 months. We have also launched a new end-to-end stock-loss initiative – Faster, Fresher Food – and are continuing our ongoing program of donating food to farmers and food rescue charities such as OzHarvest, Foodbank, FareShare and SecondBite. SUPERMARKETS WITH FARMERS’ DONATION By the end of FY16, more than 95% of Woolworths Supermarkets – which account for 85% PROGRAM of Woolworths’ food waste generation – had access to at least one food waste diversion option. We will continue to expand this program to cover more stores across the Group. 752 Supermarkets – diverting food from landfill 2016 2016 AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND NUMBER % Supermarkets with commercial food recycling program 584 50% SUPERMARKETS WITH FOOD RESCUE CHARITIES Supermarkets with farmers’ donation program 752 65% PROGRAM Supermarkets with food rescue charities program 913 79% Supermarkets with at least one food recovery program 1,131 97% 913 Total all Supermarkets 1,161 ENCOURAGING SEPARATION OF ORGANIC WASTE We have designed our Hearts and Minds program to educate employees about the why, what and how of separating organic and non-organic waste. All our stores now have colour-coded bins and display materials. The training program includes a training guide for managers, interactive activities and e-learning. We are encouraging continuous learning through a customised app that is gamified and by communicating improvement overall and by store. Stores are incentivised to compete against each other in a league table. 13 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 PACKAGING STEWARDSHIP Packaging plays a key role in the retail supply chain. It protects the significant investment NEW MACRO that we and our suppliers have made in growing, processing and transporting the products ORGANICS PACKAGING on our shelves and ensures they are delivered safely to customers’ kitchens. It also plays a role in brand marketing. Own Brand packaging When we design the packaging for Woolworths’ Own Brand products, the key elements are protection, accessibility, recyclability, recycled content and brand messaging. We try to use our packaging as efficiently as possible. In August 2016, we eliminated polystyrene 1 PERFORMANCE trays from our Macro Organics supply network, using compostable or recyclable plastic trays instead. Another packaging reduction initiative is for semi-loose organic produce, where we have HIGHLIGHTS replaced trays and plastic wrap with a band around the product for identification purposes. We will continue to work with all our suppliers to actively pursue alternatives that reduce the amount of packaging or increase its recyclability. 2 GROUP Soft plastics REVIEW The soft plastic that packages many frozen products and bakery items cannot be recycled through Australia’s kerbside recycling program. 3 Woolworths partners with the REDcycle recycling program to keep it out of landfill and dispose of it responsibly. REDcycle collects the plastic from dedicated bins at the front of 100 Woolworths’ Supermarkets BUSINESS in Sydney and Melbourne and sends it to an Australian processor to make plastic park furniture. REVIEW Since we began the partnership in 2015, we have disposed of 190 tonnes of plastic this way, equivalent to 47.6 million pieces of packaging. 4 OTHER INFORMATION 14 PLANET: for a healthy Australia CONTINUED RESPONSIBLE SOURCING RSPO-CERTIFIED OWN BRAND Sourcing products that have been produced sustainably is a challenge for every retailer, FOOD PRODUCTS especially for raw materials and goods in high risk categories and from high risk countries, where we have no direct oversight of the supply chain. However, more and more of our 100% customers expect to be offered sustainably sourced product choices and supplying them is a key element in our ambition to be an industry leader in responsible sourcing. We have set ourselves the target of sourcing key raw materials and commodities that are produced sustainably and independently certified. We have also committed to promoting behaviour change in our customers by raising their awareness of sustainably sourced products. FSC-CERTIFIED OFFICE PAPER DEFORESTATION 229,000 As a member of the Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), Woolworths is a signatory to the CGF Deforestation Resolution of 2010 for achieving net zero deforestation by 2020. We have pledged reams to achieve this by ethically sourcing the relevant high-impact commodities, including palm oil, timber, pulp and paper, and packaging. We are working towards a 2020 target of sourcing these products from independently‑certified sustainable supply chains. If this is not feasible, we will consider credible offsetting schemes. Palm oil The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is a multi-stakeholder organisation comprising retailers, manufacturers, palm oil producers, traders and non-government organisations. It sets global standards for palm oil production and manages a certification scheme. In FY16, 100% of the palm oil in our Own Brand food products was RSPO-certified. Paper and timber We source all our Own Brand tissue, toilet paper and kitchen towel products from independently-certified, sustainable sources and use sustainably-produced paper for our catalogues and offices. Catalogues are a key marketing tool for Woolworths. During 2015/16, we produced almost 950 million of them across our brands in Australia and New Zealand, using 52,201 tonnes of paper. All of it came from certified sustainable sources, either through the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certifications (PEFC). Within our business, we procure more than 229,000 reams of paper for office use every year, all of it FSC-certified. Across the Group, we saw a year on year decrease in paper usage in 2015/16, continuing an overall downward trend. This is due to a number of waste reduction initiatives such as using swipe cards to encourage staff to collect their printing rather than printing and forgetting. Microbeads Microbeads are micro-plastic particles (0.1-0.5 millimetres in size) added as exfoliates to personal care products such as body wash. The particles are too small to be filtered out by many municipal wastewater treatment plants and can damage the local environment when they end up in rivers. We have been working with our suppliers to phase out microbeads in Woolworths Own Brand skin care and body wash products. In 2015, we completed the phase-out for those products that are in production. Phasing out the products that are already produced and in stock will be completed by the end of 2016. 15 WOOLWORTHS GROUP PROSPERITY: founded on trusted relationships CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 With more than 3,000 stores spread across Australia and New Zealand, Woolworths’ prosperity affects multiple stakeholders.

ETHICAL AUDIT STATUS Advantage Report PER SITE (%) During 2015/16 we continued to work closely with the Advantage Group to better understand our suppliers. We received more regular feedback and obtained additional feedback that was specific to the Woolworths Own Brand business. We are moving from annual surveys to twice-yearly surveys and developing a bi-monthly Voice of Supplier Pulse survey.

Ethical sourcing – overseas workers Critical88 High1,214  Woolworths expects all local suppliers to comply with Australian and New Zealand workplace Low526 laws and ethical standards. To remain part of the Woolworths supply chain, these laws and standards must guide suppliers’ treatment of all workers, including the seasonal migrant workers who are so essential for our produce suppliers during peak harvesting periods. We also expect our suppliers to be responsible for ensuring their suppliers and labour hire companies are legally compliant. Australia has a strong rule of law around this issue and well-established independent agencies that monitor and enforce the laws more effectively than private sector companies can. However, we acknowledge there are issues with some unscrupulous labour hire companies and accept our responsibility to work with key industry bodies and other stakeholders to help improve labour practices in our supply chain. As part of our commitment to being part of the solution, Woolworths belongs to a working group convened and led by the National Farmers’ Federation (NFF) and the Produce Marketing Association (PMA). The working group is developing a best practice scheme for agricultural employment. Our new Supplier Excellence Audit program, which we announced in April 2016, incorporates our policy for engaging and employing overseas workers. The program focuses on improving quality and product safety standards across Woolworths’ extensive global sourcing network. We conduct regular internal training sessions with staff who interact with suppliers to make sure they stay up to date with the latest workplace laws and Woolworths’ expectations. 17 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 COMMUNITY Woolworths is proud to be an important contributor to communities across Australia and DIRECT COMMUNITY New Zealand.

Countdown tracks the prices of a basket of 100 of the most commonly purchased items, including those with substantial seasonal and commodity price variations. In FY16 this basket reduced in price by 1.2%. 3 STAFF AGED 55+ Choice 15% HEARTSAFE BUSINESS Countdown is an active participant in the New Zealand HeartSAFE reformulation program. REVIEW Led by the New Zealand Heart Foundation, the program sets targets for sodium reduction LAMB, PORK, CHICKEN in high-volume, lower-cost foods. SOURCED IN NEW ZEALAND To date, we are 90% complete in six categories and are working to meet targets for four more. As well as looking at sodium, our reformulation work also aims to reduce saturated fat and, 4 100% in some categories, sugar. As a result of this work, we are removing 1.3 tonnes of salt from our private label breakfast cereals every year. OTHER FREE FRUIT FOR KIDS INFORMATION In October 2015, Countdown launched Woolworths’ Free Fruit for Kids program in all stores to encourage Kiwi kids to eat more fresh fruit. This has been a huge success; on average, Countdown supermarkets are now giving away an estimated 50,000 pieces of free fruit every week. 30 New Zealand Food continued A FOCUS ON NUTRITION SOURCED FROM We are systematically reformulating our Own Brand products in line with good health guidelines. KIWI FARMERS Countdown was one of the first large brand owners in New Zealand to commit to the Health IN FY16 (%) Star Rating system and we are working to roll out Health Star Ratings on more than 2,000 Own Brand products. So far, we have reviewed 394 products, and each now has a clearly‑displayed Health Star Rating. EMPLOYEES We are proud of our role helping young Kiwis into the workforce. At the end of FY16 we had 6,061 team members aged under 25. This year we had an increased focus on reviewing the number of team members on casual contracts. Through better management, we were able to offer some people more permanent hours and wound up contracts where there had been no contact for over six months. We celebrate diversity of ethnicity, gender and age – 543 of our team have been with us for over 25 years and 2,769 team members are aged over 55 (over 15% of our total workforce).

SOFT PLASTICS RECYCLING In July 2015, Countdown became a foundation member of the Soft Plastics Recycling Program to encourage our customers to recycle soft plastics such as bread bags and shopping bags in specially marked bins in our stores. We plan to introduce soft plastics recycling to 70% of New Zealand supermarkets over the next two years. Since an initial trial in Auckland, Countdown customers have recycled 2,434.5kg of soft plastics through our stores. Countdown Waiheke became New Zealand’s first plastic shopping bag free supermarket on 23 May 2016. Waiheke is a unique environment where rubbish has to be transported off the island. Customers are encouraged to bring their own reusable bags and we have reusable bags and new compostable bags available for purchase in-store. 31 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 PROSPERITY PEOPLE EMPLOYED JOBS AND EMPLOYMENT Countdown is one of New Zealand’s largest employers. At the end of FY16, Countdown employed 17,872 New Zealanders in our stores, distribution centres, and support offices.

Connecting customers with causes Throughout 2015/16, Countdown customers gave generously. They donated a total of more than NZ$1.3 million to causes such as Oxfam’s Cyclone Winston Appeal and The Salvation Army’s Red Shield Appeal. They also donated to the national Alzheimer’s Appeal. Countdown has supported this Appeal for more than 13 years and raised $1.5 million. Our annual Suppliers’ Charity Golf Day also raised NZ$141,000 for Alzheimer’s Auckland. Countdown Food Rescue Just like Woolworths Supermarkets in Australia, Countdown supports local people in need by donating food to food charity partners and partnering with farmers. During the year we continued to extend Countdown Food Rescue to more local food charities. This year we welcomed Food Rescue charities KiwiHarvest, Good Neighbour and Kaivolution to the program. The Foodbank Project: a New Zealand first In December 2015, Countdown and The Salvation Army launched New Zealand’s first online food donation initiative, The Foodbank Project. This enables donors to see which items are most needed by The Salvation Army’s foodbanks. The Foodbank Project was initially trialled in September 2015 and has since rolled out to Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. It is New Zealand’s only not-for-profit, self-sustaining online foodbank. So far, this initiative has provided around 1,186 food parcel items for New Zealanders in need, worth NZ$77,781. Countdown Kids’ Hospital Appeal Held from August to October 2015, this year the Countdown Kids’ Hospital Appeal raised nearly NZ$1.14 million thanks to the generosity of our customers, team and suppliers. The funds contributed to the purchase of much-needed medical equipment for 11 children’s hospital wards throughout New Zealand. Since it first began in 2007, the Countdown Kids’ Hospital Appeal has raised NZ$9.3 million. 33 WOOLWORTHS GROUP Portfolio Business – BIG W CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 In 2015/16 BIG W continued to provide Australians with great value in-store and online choices for general merchandise. As well as addressing our corporate responsibilities in employment, environment and the community, the international nature of our operations and product lines means the most material issues for BIG W are labour conditions and human rights protection in our supply chain. 1 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS PEOPLE TOTAL PEOPLE EMPLOYED EMPLOYEES 21,000 BIG W has approximately 21,000 team members across 186 national stores, three logistics distribution centres that were reintegrated into BIG W operations during the year, the 2 Sydney‑based support office and dedicated BIG W sourcing offices in Hong Kong and GROUP Bangladesh. During FY16 BIG W opened two new stores in Pacific Fair (QLD) and Hurstville REVIEW (NSW), creating approximately 200 new jobs in these communities. FEMALE EXECUTIVES GENDER & DIVERSITY 55% BIG W leads the way in department store retailing in Australia with 55% female representation at an executive leadership level, 43% at retail store management level and 68% female representation across all employees. 3 BUSINESS In addition to these achievements in gender representation, BIG W proudly supports a diverse REVIEW SOFT PLASTIC RECYCLED workplace across racial, sexual orientation, age and cultural background and has programs in place to foster a supportive environment for all team members. BIG W is a proud supporter 1M tonnes of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) employee community within 4 Woolworths Group. Many of our store and support office employees were involved in Wear it Purple Day 2016. OTHER HEALTH & SAFETY BIG W is committed to maintaining its safety lead within the retail industry. We believe the well‑being, health and safety of our team members, customers and visitors at all times is our INFORMATION most important priority. PLANET ANIMAL WELFARE BIG W’s Own Brand products are produced to high standards of animal welfare. BIG W does not use animal testing on its Own Brand products, including personal care and cosmetics. BIG W has also committed to not sell any products made from angora wool due to the animal welfare concerns of the process of fibre removal from rabbits. ENERGY EFFICIENCY BIG W store design uses energy efficient LED light fittings in the majority of the store fleet and is also committed to using LED lights in all new and refurbished stores. To further minimise energy use BIG W has air conditioning and light control timers. WATER TREATMENT BIG W ensures that all production factories have environmental treatment plants (ETP) to treat the water waste from production, particularly the by‑products from denim manufacture. ETP is a natural cleaning process that oxygenates water and reduces the acidity before being released into waterways. There is also work underway to reduce the amount of water used in production. 34 Portfolio Business – BIG W continued RECYCLING CARDBOARD RECYCLED BIG W is committed to recycling packaging materials, particularly in store operations. In FY16 BIG W recycled ~18 million tonnes of cardboard (+1.5% on FY15) and ~1 million tonnes 18M tonnes of LDPE (+3.6% on FY15). MICROBEADS BIG W supports the NSW and Australian Government initiatives to phase out the use of microbeads in certain consumer products. BIG W is committed to ensuring this takes place and is seeking confirmation from its suppliers that they do not use microbeads in their products or are otherwise committed to phasing out the use of microbeads urgently. PROSPERITY ETHICAL SOURCING The most material ethical sourcing issues for BIG W are the labour conditions and protection of human rights in our supply chain. BIG W seeks to ensure that the people who are making the products we sell are being treated fairly. BIG W follows the Woolworths Group Ethical Sourcing Policy and has an extensive Factory Audit program. Before BIG W partners with any factory, the factory is subject to a site inspection and must pass an audit which examines employment conditions, labour force, product safety, the structural integrity of the factory buildings and a geographic risk assessment. Any identified issues must be addressed before BIG W will deal with the factory. There are regular production checks to ensure factories are not subcontracting to non‑audited suppliers. BANGLADESH BIG W is a signatory and financial supporter of the Accord on Bangladesh in Fire and Building Safety, an independent agreement designed to make all garment factories in Bangladesh safe workplaces. The program involves independent safety inspections of factories, with retailers assigned to take the lead on following up on corrective actions. Our factory supplier list in Bangladesh is published on the Woolworths Group website and we are building on the information provided here to provide even greater transparency of our supply chain in the future. UZBEK COTTON BIG W has committed to not using cotton from Uzbekistan due to the systemic use of child and forced labour in harvesting cotton. Our Uzbek cotton policy is included in the specifications for our clothing and home products and BIG W suppliers have been notified. COMMUNITY BIG W has supported the BIG Heart Appeal for over 10 years. The Appeal supports the Sydney Children’s Hospital in Randwick (NSW), The Royal Children’s Hospital Foundation (QLD), The Bone Health Foundation Inc (SA), The Royal Children’s Hospital (VIC) and the Princess Margaret Hospital Foundation. In addition, BIG W is an active community member and also supports several regional charities in the domestic violence and mental health space. BIG W is currently reviewing its philanthropic commitments in 2016 as part of an overall business review to ensure mutual brand alignment, outcomes are measurable and that team engagement remains high. 35 WOOLWORTHS GROUP Portfolio Business – Hotels CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 ALH Group is a market leader, operating 330 licensed venues and 569 retail liquor outlets across Australia. We offer a diverse array of hospitality experiences, including sports bars, bistros, restaurants, cafes, retail liquor, accommodation, nightclubs, electronic gaming and wagering. Our material business issues are the responsible service of two of our core offerings – gambling and alcohol. 1 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS PEOPLE MACHINES WITH PRE‑COMMITMENT RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING FUNCTION At ALH Group, we aim to be a responsible provider of electronic gambling services. Our focus areas are setting limits, staff education and training and partnerships. 2 98% Our Hotel and Gaming Charter clearly demonstrates our commitment to responsible gambling and we have developed and implemented several related initiatives. GROUP REVIEW Voluntary pre-commitment COMMUNITY CONTRIBUTION This system is a cornerstone for our responsible gambling strategy. It allows gamblers to nominate a limit before they start using our machines. 3 $2.12M At year end, pre-commitment functionality was installed on all machines in 281 of 286 of ALH hotels that offer electronic gaming machines.

REVIEW Responsible Gambling Ambassador For seven years, we have worked with David Schwarz, a well-known former professional AFL footballer and reformed problem gambler. David is our Responsible Gambling Ambassador. He provides employee education and customer awareness about the importance of asking for 4 help if gambling becomes a problem. He is also available to discuss any gambling problems our OTHER staff or their families and friends may have. INFORMATION Self-Exclusion Program Our Self-Exclusion Program helps people who have decided to limit their access to gaming machines to implement that decision. We offer it to individuals who wish to voluntarily exclude themselves from one or more gaming venues. Under the program, that person agrees to certain obligations and forgoes some access rights. 36 Portfolio Business – Hotels continued EMPLOYEES Responsible gambling training We have devised a mandatory online responsible gambling training module for all relevant staff. The module focuses on how to approach and interact with customers who may be showing signs of problem gambling and explains how our Self-Exclusion Program operates. Responsible Service of Alcohol ALH Group believes that individuals have the right to choose to consume alcohol in licensed venues as a social activity. Our responsibilities are to deliver best practice alcohol service and to set a positive example to customers and other licensees. We do not promote any practice that may encourage the rapid or excessive consumption of alcohol, and we require our employees to encourage and promote the responsible consumption of alcohol. To prevent under‑age drinking in our venues, we require young adults to present a valid proof of age. COMMUNITY We are proud of our community involvement and that our hotels are often a community hub. ALH Group works closely with many charitable organisations and financially supports a diverse range of causes, from seriously ill children and the families of Armed Services personnel to responsible gambling support services.

This can only be achieved with the support of our people at all levels of our business. As any business should, Woolworths gives priority to issues that are material to the business and which align with our strategic pillars. The Destination Zero safety strategy and the Corporate Responsibility Strategy 2016-2020 provide the direction and focus for practices, policies and investment. GOVERNANCE, THE BOARD AND DIRECTORS Corporate governance is at the core of Woolworths’ and the Board’s approach to the enhancement of shareholder value and the protection of shareholder funds. Integral to shareholder value is protecting and enhancing our reputation, which is why the Board oversees the Company’s approach to corporate responsibility and sustainability. The Woolworths Board Sustainability Committee, which meets at least quarterly, reviews performance on issues of Safety and Health, Sustainability and Community Investment. Information on our Board of Directors and the Board Charter is at: http://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/Who_We_Are/Directors_and_Management/Board_of_Directors/ The relevant Committees are covered in: http://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/Who_We_Are/Committees_of_the_Board/ More information is in the corporate governance statement: http://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/Who_We_Are/Corporate_Governance/ RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK The continued growth and success of Woolworths depends on the ability of our Company to understand and respond to the challenges of an uncertain and changing world. As a large, dispersed and complex organisation, this uncertainty generates risk, with the potential to be a source of both opportunities and threats. By understanding and managing risk, the Company provides greater certainty and confidence for all its stakeholders. Our risk management policy is in the same location as our governance framework, referred to previously. See: http://www.woolworthslimited.com.au/icms_docs/182376_Risk_Management_Policy.pdf MATERIALITY Woolworths will soon launch the 2016-2020 Corporate Responsibility Strategy. To prepare this, we had an independent assessment conducted to identify our key material sustainability issues. The assessment was based on the AccountAbility AA1000 Assurance Standard (2008) principle of materiality and guided by their Five Part Materiality Test, to identify and prioritise issues relevant to: • Direct short-term financial impacts • Policy-related performance • Business peer-based norms • Stakeholder behaviour and concerns • Societal norms. RANK WOOLWORTHS LIMITED MATERIAL SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES 1 Supplier relationships, communication and collaboration 2 Employee conditions, wellbeing and communications 3 End-to-end reduction of waste 4 Labour rights in the supply chain 5 Low price and value for money model 6 Environmentally responsible sourcing 7 Energy and emissions 8 Understanding and responding to customer needs 9 Product quality, safety, availability and range 10 Partners in the community 45 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 During the assessment, we considered all of our business divisions and a broad range of external stakeholders, including consumers, customers, employees, government, investors, peers and suppliers. Essential information was obtained through media that included customer insights, employee surveys, strategic priorities and targets, the Advantage Report, traditional and social media reviews and industry sustainability benchmark indices. The issues were classified as either ‘Material’, of ‘High Stakeholder Interest’, of ‘High Woolworths Interest’ or none of these. The Materiality Assessment identified the following Group-wide Material Sustainability Issues in the adjacent table. The assessment also identified some divisional specific issues, which have been addressed in the report, e.g. local sourcing for supermarkets, responsible service of alcohol for Endeavour Drinks Group and responsible gaming for ALH Group. 1 SENIOR MANAGEMENT The Woolworths Group Executive Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, provides management oversight PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS of the effectiveness of the Divisions’ implementation of the Safety and Health vision, principles, policy, standards, strategy and initiatives, risk processes, resources, information, compliance and assurance. TRANSPARENCY AND REPORTING Woolworths uses the globally recognised reporting framework developed by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The GRI 2 reporting framework sets out the principles and indicators that organisations can use to measure and report their economic, 2020 environmental, and social performance. This report was prepared in accordance with the ‘core’ principles of the GRI Guidelines. STRATEGY We continue to report to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), an investor-driven disclosure initiative enabling companies to report on risk identification and mitigation processes related to climate change. We also participate in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices (DJSI), a global index that tracks the financial performance of leading sustainability-driven companies. We continue to benchmark strongly against our peers in the food and staples retailing industry. 3 DJSI 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 BUSINESS Overall score 76 77 76 77 73 REVIEW Economic dimension 79 79 82 77 74 Environmental dimension 78 80 76 76 73 Social dimension 70 73 69 77 72 ANTI-CORRUPTION 4 All our employees commit to our Code of Conduct to maintain the highest legal, moral and ethical standards in our dealings with customers, suppliers, employees and local communities.

DELOITTE’S RESPONSIBILITIES Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Subject Matter based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with Australian Standards on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000 ‘Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ (ASAE 3000), issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in order to express a conclusion whether, based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Subject Matter has not been prepared and presented in all material respects in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. That standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Subject Matter is free from material misstatement. A limited assurance engagement in accordance with ASAE 3000 involves identifying areas where a material misstatement of the Subject Matter information is likely to arise, addressing the areas identified and considering the process used to prepare the Subject Matter in the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report. A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks. ASSURANCE WORK PERFORMED In order to form our conclusion we undertook the following limited assurance procedures: • Review of Woolworths’ processes relating to stakeholder identification, engagement and responsiveness, including an assessment of stakeholder engagement outcomes and how this process and the outcomes have been presented in the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report • Review of Woolworths’ process to identify and determine material issues to be included in the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report with examination of underlying assessments and evidence on a sample basis • Interviews with a selection of Woolworths executives and senior management, including Woolworths sustainability management team concerning the overall governance structure, corporate sustainability strategy and policies used for managing and reporting sustainability performance across the business • In respect of the Selected Sustainability Indicators –– interviews with a selection of Woolworths management responsible for the Selected Sustainability Indicators to understand the compilation and review processes –– applying analytical and other review procedures including assessing relationships between the reported information and other financial and non-financial data –– examination of evidence for a small number of transactions or events –– analysing and inspecting on a sample basis, the key systems, processes and procedures and controls relating to the collation, validation, presentation and approval process of Selected Sustainability Indicators included in the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report. –– review underlying evidence on a sample basis to corroborate that the information is prepared and reported in line with the relevant reporting criteria. • Comparison of the content of Woolworths’ 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report against the criteria for a GRI self-declaration The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion providing reasonable assurance about whether the Subject Matter in the 2016 Annual report has been properly prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with Reporting Criteria. 53 WOOLWORTHS GROUP CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT 2016 INHERENT LIMITATIONS Non-financial information, including the Subject Matter may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating and sampling or estimating such information.

The Subject Matter should be read in the context of Woolworths’ Reporting Criteria as set out in the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report. LIMITATIONS OF USE This report is made solely to the directors of Woolworths in accordance with our engagement letter dated 26th July 2016r, for the purpose of providing limited assurance over Woolworths 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report. We disclaim any assumption 1 of responsibility for any reliance on this report or on the Subject Matter to which it relates, to any person other than the directors of Woolworths or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared. PERFORMANCE MATTERS RELATING TO ELECTRONIC PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS Our limited assurance engagement included web-based information that was available via web links as of the date of this 2 statement. We provide no assurance over changes to the content of the 2016 Corporate Responsibility Report after the date of this assurance statement. CONCLUSION 2020 Based on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that STRATEGY the Subject Matter has not been properly prepared and presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria for the year ended 30 June 2016. 3 BUSINESS REVIEW DELOITTE TOUCHE TOHMATSU 4 OTHER PR Dobson Partner INFORMATION Sydney, 28 October 2016 54 Store Analysis 2016 1 2015 1 2014 2013 2012 2 STORES NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER NUMBER Continuing operations Supermarkets New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory 303 292 282 271 262 Queensland 237 230 225 209 203 Victoria 242 234 224 221 214 South Australia and Northern Territory 84 82 80 78 78 Western Australia 94 92 89 88 85 Tasmania 32 31 31 30 30 Supermarkets – Australia 992 961 931 897 872 Supermarkets – New Zealand 184 177 171 166 161 Total Supermarkets 1,176 1,138 1,102 1,063 1,033 Thomas Dux 5 9 11 11 11 Freestanding Liquor 373 359 349 339 329 Attached Liquor 544 527 509 490 477 ALH Group Retail Outlets 569 557 544 526 507 Summergate 2 2 – – – Caltex/Woolworths Petrol – – 131 131 132 Woolworths Petrol – Australia 530 516 502 482 467 Total Food, Petrol and Endeavour Drinks Group 3,199 3,108 3,148 3,042 2,956 BIG W 186 184 182 178 172 EziBuy 5 5 4 – – Hotels including clubs (ALH Group) 331 330 329 326 294 Home Timber and Hardware – – 28 26 21 Masters – – 49 31 15 Total continuing operations 3,721 3,627 3,740 3,603 3,458 Discontinued operations 29,30 Home Timber and Hardware 43 44 – – – Masters 63 58 – – – Dick Smith Electronics – – – – 347 Tandy – – – – 1 106 102 – – 348 Total Group 3,827 3,729 3,740 3,603 3,806 1 On 18 January 2016, Woolworths announced that it intends to pursue an orderly prospective exit of the Home Improvement business.
