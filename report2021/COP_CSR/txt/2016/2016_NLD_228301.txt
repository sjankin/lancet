United Nations Global Compact Communication on Progress Covering Calendar Year 2015 8th April 2016 To our Stakeholders: I am pleased to confirm that once again this year AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. ( AMG ) reaffirms its support of the Ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) in the areas of Human Rights, Labor, Environment and AntiCorruption. Our Code of Business Conduct and Policy on Human Rights, both of which are available on our website, set out our commitments to act ethically and uphold the ten UNGC principles in all of our business activities. In this annual Communication on Progress, we describe our actions to continually improve the integration of the Global Compact and its principles into our business strategy, culture and daily operations. We also commit to share this information with our stakeholders using our primary channels of communication, primarily the AMG website www.amg-nv.com. Sincerely yours, Dr. Heinz C. Schimmelbusch Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer 20160408 Communication on Progress 1 HUMAN RIGHTS  Principle 1 Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group explicitly supports the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Although always an integral part of AMG, our formal commitment in this area started in 2009 with the publication of our Code of Business Conduct. This was augmented in 2011 by the publication of our Policy on Human Rights. Both of these documents can be found in the Corporate Governance section of the AMG website, and the Human Rights Policy is shown below: 20160408 Communication on Progress 2 A review of this policy in 2014 determined it to still be adequate to articulate AMG’s commitments and a further review will be made during 2016 to ensure it remains relevant to the current business climate A network of Compliance Officers under the oversight of a Chief Compliance Officer and a core Compliance team monitors the commitments made in these publications. The core Compliance team meets typically twice per year to review Compliance and Ethical issues and is supported by an independent external consultant. This consultant has assisted in the development of policies, procedures and training programs and in responding to enquiries from stakeholder groups with interests in human rights issues. Most recently this has included beginning employee surveys to gauge the workforce’s perceptions about AMGs commitments to ethical business practices and human rights and reviewing AMGs programs against the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises. In 2015 there were no reported incidents of breaches of the AMG Code of Business Conduct related to human rights abuses.  Principle 2 Make sure businesses are not complicit in human rights abuses The aim of the presence of an AMG business unit in a community is to strengthen and be part of the community, fostering sound relationships and avoiding conflicts. We respect the dignity and rights of our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate and others who might be affected by our operations and actively involving ourselves and supporting those communities. AMG also contributes through philanthropic donations to support local community needs including to schools, colleges and hospitals. AMG sustains an expanding network of Code of Business Conduct Compliance Officers based in the countries and major sites where AMG companies are operating to locally identify any potential human rights abuses. In instances where this needs to be done independently and confidentially, a Whistle Blowing policy is in force allowing any employee to come forward and report issues. The Whistleblowing policy can be accessed through the Governance section of the AMG website. The Chief Compliance Officer and their team carefully review any and all Whistleblower complaints. AMG also has a Supplier Conduct Charter, shown below, which is part of a process to ensure the standards relating to Human Rights which AMG holds itself to, are expanded to our suppliers as well. In particular, this policy states that: “AMG’s suppliers should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights and ensure they are not complicit in human rights abuses.” This Supplier Conduct Charter will be reviewed for adequacy during 2016. 20160408 Communication on Progress 3 LABOR  Principle 3 Businesses should uphold freedom of association & effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees to join, or choose not to join, legally authorized association or organizations. AMG continues to use the Global Reporting Initiative 20160408 Communication on Progress 4 (GRI) indicator LA4 (Percentage of Employees Covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements) to monitor this principle. In our 2015 Annual Report we state: “AMG respects the freedom of its individual employees and their rights to join, or to choose not to join, unions. Across the Company, 1,850 AMG employees (65%) were covered by collective bargaining agreements. 71% of AMG Critical Materials are covered by such arrangements. AMG Engineering, which includes a higher proportion of professional salaried staff, has 49% of its employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.” Additionally, we utilize indicator HR5 (Operations identified in which the right to exercise freedom of association or collective bargaining may be at significant risk, and actions taken to support these rights). In the 2015 Annual Report we state: “The Company strives to make sure it is not complicit in human rights abuses. Each AMG site is assessed during site visits and internal audits to identify if there is the possibility of freedom of association or collective bargaining being put at risk because of political or business factors. In 2015, it was found that no sites were at risk, with the exception of China, where the formation of unions remains restricted.” Further, with the development and implementation of our Supplier Conduct Charter we begin to hold our suppliers to the same standard stating: “AMG’s suppliers should uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor”  Principle 4 The elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor All AMG employees work for the company as a result of need or want. Nobody is forced to work for AMG and we prohibit the use of any forced labor, including slavery, servitude, or prison labor. This is reflected in the widespread presence of unionized labor across AMG. Currently most of the locations and environments AMG facilities are present in are stable and advanced democracies, assisting in ensuring human rights abuses of this type are not occurring. AMG has development projects which may expand the boundaries of the company into countries with more challenging environments and AMG recognizes this may bring an increased level of diligence. Again, our Supplier Conduct Charter adopted in 2014 introduces our commitment to this principal to our suppliers stating: “AMG’s suppliers should support the elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor.”  Principle 5 The effective abolition of child labor As stated in our Human Rights Policy, AMG does not employ children and strongly rejects the use of child labor, and expects our suppliers to do the same through the requirements of our Supplier Conduct Charter. AMG does actively support the creation of educational programs for young people including apprenticeships combined with formal education, particularly in the areas of science and engineering. In our annual report we utilize the Global Reporting Initiative indicator HR6 “Operations identified as having significant risk for incidents of child labor, and 20160408 Communication on Progress 5 measure taken to contribute to the elimination of child labor”. In its 2015 recent annual report AMG reported that it has reviewed 30 of its operating sites across the world to ensure that they are not at risk for employing child labor or exposing young workers to hazards. It was found that no sites posed a risk at this time. AMG is at the root of the supply chain for several of its products and is proud to be able to supply metals such as Tantalum and Tin, commodities historically fraught with human rights abuses, from mining operations with strong ethical practices and not utilizing child labor. In particular our Tantalum supply chain in Brazil is certified as Conflict Free by the Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC).  Principle 6 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation AMG’s Code of Business Conduct states that the Company views as unacceptable any form of harassment or unfair or unlawful discrimination based on race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or national origin, whether by employees, temporary employees, managers, customers, vendors or AMG companies’ visitors. At year-end 2015, AMG Critical Materials had a workforce of 2055 and AMG Engineering had 789 employees. For those facilities reporting here, including corporate staff (33), the total AMG workforce was 2844 (facilities not yet covered in this section employ a further 97 people). Geographically, these were located in Asia (358), Europe (1515), North America (530) and South America (441). A further 270 directly supervised contract workers were employed at AMG sites. AMG assesses the diversity of its workforce in terms of gender and age. The multinational, and therefore multicultural, nature of the business means that ethnic diversity is significant, but because of the difficulty in defining minority employees in such an environment, the Company does not collect data on this aspect. Of the total employees, 16% are female; 19% are under 30 years of age, 54% are between 30 and 50, and 27% are over 50. In 2015 the management board had one female and two male members, but following the resignation of the CFO, it is now 100% male. The Supervisory Board is 89% male and 11% female. One Supervisory Board member is aged 30-50 while 8 are over 50. However, AMG is continuing to work to improve the diversity of its Boards. On page 28 of our 2015 Annual Report we note: “Gender Diversity: The Supervisory Board recognizes the importance of a diverse composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board in terms of gender. Dutch regulations require the Company to pursue a policy of having at least 30% of the seats on the Supervisory Board and the Management Board be held by men and at least 30% of the seats be held by women. It is with particular regret that the Supervisory Board had to accept the resignation of Ms. Wolf when her term ended in 2015 and more recently that it had to accept the resignation of Ms. Amy Ard as CFO and Management Board member as of January 31, 2016 to pursue other professional opportunities. The company will, with increased focus, continue to take this allocation of seats into account in connection with the following actions: (1) the appointment or nomination for the appointment of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board and (2) drafting the criteria 20160408 Communication on Progress 6 for the size and composition of the Supervisory Board and the Management Board. At the end of 2015, AMG did not comply with article 2:166 of Dutch Civil Code with regard to the composition of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board will continue to look for suitable female candidates for both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board.” ENVIRONMENT  Principle 7 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges All AMG facilities have a strong awareness and knowledge of their environmental impact and the company utilizes the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) G3 guidelines to measure and report environmental impacts in a number of areas including raw material use, energy consumption, greenhouse gas generation, water use and discharge and waste generation and disposal. Collection of this data is vital to help sites focus on improving efficiencies – including reducing energy use and concurrent greenhouse gas emissions, but also reducing solid and liquid wastes and reducing water consumption. AMG is transitioning to the latest GRI guidelines G4. These environmental impacts are reported annually to our stakeholders in the Company annual report. Additionally AMG reports its greenhouse gas emissions to the Carbon disclosure Project (CDP). Many of AMG’s activities focus on technologies to address fossil fuel efficiencies and reduce greenhouse gas generation, where we believe a precautionary approach is vital given the potential adverse effects. Many of the technologies that AMG produces, which we refer to as “enabling technologies” contribute to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation and buildings sectors. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 8 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility Twelve of the larger AMG manufacturing facilities now have ISO 14001 environmental management system certification in place. Formalized management systems are seen as a key tool to maintaining focus on environmental responsibility. Additionally AMG has invested in projects including hydroelectric generation, solar generation and heat recovery systems. It is also promoting energy management initiatives to improve efficiencies, with several larger energy users, including the largest, holding ISO 50001 energy management certification. The relevant section from the Annual Report to Shareholders showing how AMG measures its environmental impact is reproduced at the end of this Communication on Progress (COP).  Principle 9 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies 20160408 Communication on Progress 7 AMG’s businesses continue to focus on environmentally friendly technologies. In 2015 AMG continued its investment in the production of titanium aluminides used in the aerospace industry. Investments in the plant in Cambridge, Ohio that produces the steel strengthening alloy ferrovanadium from byproducts of the oil refining and power generation industries, eliminating landfill, has resulted in significant capacity increase, with minimal increase in carbon footprint. Further, this technology reduces energy in the manufacturing process and by strengthening steel, significantly reduces the tonnages required in end user applications. AMG is also actively supporting the automotive industry as it moves to more fuel efficient turbo charged, low displacement engines, through heat treatment of fast moving, high temperature parts such as turbo chargers and piston heads. Similar applications have been seen in next generation aviation jet engines which contribute to the fuel efficiency of next generation aircraft and where AMG’s ceramic coating technologies further enable fuel efficiency savings. AMG continues to believe that nuclear power is required as part of the short and medium term solution to anthropogenic CO2 emissions and continue to supply products and engineering expertise to support this sector. ANTI CORRUPTION  Principle 10 Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery. In 2009 AMG introduced (and published) its Code of Business Conduct to all of its staff which sets out guiding principles in its ethics and business conduct as adopted and approved by the Company’s Management Board and Supervisory Board. The Code of Business Conduct discusses in detail the ethical conduct and business practices which AMG expects from all employees, covering area’s like conflicts of interest, anti-bribery, insider dealing, policies on corporate entertainment and acceptance of gifts, and the integrity of our record keeping and reporting. AMG also has a stand-alone policy on Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption. This is available under the Corporate Governance section of the AMG-NV website. Training in these aspects is carried out on an ongoing basis. AMG further promotes these values throughout the Company with multi lingual posters prominently displayed at operational sites to raise awareness of the Code of Business Conduct and various ethically based programs. 20160408 Communication on Progress 8 20160408 Communication on Progress 9 ATTACHMENT 1 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT SECTION FROM THE 2015 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 20160408 Communication on Progress 10 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 38 AMG THE CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY THIS SECTION PROVIDES OUR EIGHTH ANNUAL SUSTAINABILITY REPORT, WHICH EVALUATES AND COMPARES AMG’S SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE TO PREVIOUS YEARS.

Following restructuring of business units in 2015, this report 0.46 covers two segments: AMG Critical Materials and AMG Engineering. Where possible 2014 data has been restated using these segments so that trends can be identified and 2014 2015 comparisons made. AMG continues to assess the boundaries of this report based on the corporate ownership structure. All locations report their performance at the end of the fourth AMG Critical Materials quarter, and no forecast data is used. However, sales and AMG Engineering administrative offices and some smaller engineering sites AMG (typically with less than 10 employees or with environmental impacts <1% in all aspects) have been determined to be nonmaterial to the report, and therefore estimated data has been INCIDENT SEVERITY used for these in 2015. Those sites utilizing estimated data are indicated in the table on page 39. SCOPE OF THIS REPORT 0.23 0.22 0.19 AMG continues to utilize the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 0.17 G3, Mining and Metals Sector Supplement aspects in 2015 but is beginning to transition to G4. The GRI is a network-based 0.06 organization that publishes the world’s leading sustainability .02 reporting framework. AMG has applied GRI’s principle of 2014 2015 materiality from G4 to the report, which states: “The Report should cover Aspects that: • R eflect the organization’s significant economic, AMG Critical Materials AMG Engineering environmental and social impacts; or AMG • S ubstantively influence the assessments and decisions of stakeholders.”† AMG utilizes a standard template, which sites use to report their data in order to ensure consistency in the interpretation of definitions of the key indicators. The report is independently verified by GHD. The environmental key performance data for both segments are summarized in the table on page 47.

SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 41 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ENERGY USAGE (TJ) RESOURCE EFFICIENCY AND RECYCLING GRI INDICATORS EN 1 AND EN 2 The use of resources varies between AMG business units, 2,542 2,596 ranging from those that locally mine or purchase primary raw materials to produce metals, alloys, and inorganic chemicals, through those which produce metals and alloys from secondary, recycled resources, to those which provide 840 technology and engineering services. AMG resource usage data 796 comprises raw materials, associated process materials, semimanufactured goods and parts and packaging, by weight. AMG Engineering provides predominantly furnace technology 2014 2015 and engineering services, including furnace assembly operations and heat treatment services. The segment utilizes Indirect limited amounts of resources in these activities, mainly Direct complex component parts for furnaces, which are routinely measured in units rather than by mass. Therefore, unlike the chemicals and alloys business units, only limited data is available on resource mass. In 2015, AMG Engineering reported using 3,303 mt of resources, all of which were classified as primary. AMG Critical Materials uses a much more diverse range of 3,113 3,193 resources including mined ores for tantalum and graphite production, power plant wastes and spent refinery catalysts for the production of vanadium alloys, and metal salts for aluminum alloy production. The segment uses recycled iron, steel, aluminum and titanium in processes when possible. The segment utilized 1,267,100 mt of resources in 2015, of which 40,700 mt were secondary or recycled materials. In 2015, 225 199 the primary utilization of resources was by AMG Mineração (872,000 mt of mined ore) and AMG Silicon (190,000 mt of 2014 2015 quartz, coal and other raw materials) with the remaining AMG Critical Materials sites using 166,000 mt. Engineering ENERGY CONSUMPTION Critical Materials GRI INDICATORS EN 3 AND EN 4 Energy remains a major area of focus for AMG for both environmental and economic reasons. In particular, hightemperature metallurgical processes and mining operations utilized in AMG Critical Materials are energy intensive. The two most significant energy carriers are electricity and natural gas, although other fuels and energy sources are captured in the data discussed here.3 The reported energy usage for AMG Critical Materials was marginally higher in 2015 compared to 2014, increasing from 3,113 terajoules (TJ) in 2014 to 3,193 TJ in 2015. Direct energy usage was 783 TJ and indirect 2,410 TJ. The energy used by low-energy heat treatment processes utilized by AMG Engineering remains low in comparison. 3 I ndirect energy consumption does not include the energy consumed by electricity producers to generate the electricity or transmission losses. 42 AMG THE CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY The segment used 199 TJ in 2015, 11% lower than in 2014 (225 CLIMATE CHANGE TJ). Indirect energy, in the form of electricity, accounted for 187 TJ, GRI INDICATOR EN 16 while direct energy use, primarily through natural gas, was 12 TJ. AMG facilities utilize processes that are associated with both Across AMG, the split between renewable and nonrenewable direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and both indirect energy sources is difficult to determine since types are reported here. Electricity used for the generation utilities do not generally publish this information (with some of heat for metallurgical processing has been, and remains, exceptions; e.g. CEMIG in Brazil now produces this data). the most significant source of GHG emissions for AMG. This However, AMG does generate its own renewable energy. In electricity use gives rise to indirect GHG emissions of carbon 2015, AMG’s hydroelectric generating facility near São João dioxide equivalent (CO2 e), which are dependent on the nature del Rei, Brazil once again operated at a lower capacity as a of its generation. Whenever possible, emissions have been result of drought conditions and generated 7,544 GJ (2,100 calculated using up-to-date emission factors available from the MWh).

Indirect emissions are defined as those emissions solar power system generated 710 GJ (197 MWh) in 2015 and generated by sources outside of AMG’s control, but where AMG Mineração’s mine utilization of biodiesel in its truck fleet AMG ultimately uses the energy. Direct GHG emissions result contributed 146 TJ of renewable energy. primarily from the combustion of carbon-containing materials often as part of the metallurgical process, such as using coke WATER CONSUMPTION as a reductant, but also for the generation of heat, such as GRI INDICATOR EN 8 burning natural gas in a boiler. Other GHGs occurring from Water is essential to many manufacturing processes and is processes other than combustion, such as hydrofluorocarbons, used by AMG primarily for non-contact, evaporative or singleperfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride, are minimal for the pass cooling purposes, although a small number of AMG AMG business units, but are included if relevant. facilities do use wet chemical processes for the production AMG Critical Materials GHG emissions were lower in 2015 at of metal oxides and other chemicals. In addition, mining 535,000mt of CO2 e (2014, 591,000 mt). 66% of these emissions operations can utilize water from mine dewatering or for ore are attributed to indirect sources (electricity) while 34% are processing. Water utilized for cooling, process and sanitary attributed to direct sources. Emissions remain dominated usage is reported by AMG facilities. Reported water use for by the silicon metal production activities which accounts for AMG Critical Materials was essentially unchanged in 2015 at 374,000 mt of CO2e (approximately 6.3kg CO2e per kg silicon 4,739,000 cubic meters. AMG Engineering’s water consumption metal produced), 16% lower than the 7.5kg in 2014.

The reduction BIODIVERSITY primarily arises from the closure of the Berlin facility. GRI INDICATOR EN 11 AMG provides a complex mix of products and services, and it Of the 30 locations reporting for 2015, four reported land areas has become clear that year-on-year comparisons are difficult on or adjacent to their property which had high biodiversity as product mix varies. GHG intensity is therefore defined on value, sensitive habitats or were protected. These areas are: the basis of revenue rather than, for example, mt of product. river frontage in Hanau, Germany; native forest in São João Normalized to a revenue basis, AMG Critical Materials emitted del Rei, Brazil; river frontage and setback areas in Nazareno, 535,000mt, with revenue of $758 million, equivalent to 706mt Brazil; and wetlands in Ohio, United States. AMG remains CO2 e per million $ revenue. AMG Engineering generated very aware of the need to be responsible stewards of these 34,000mt CO2 e, $220 million in revenue, or 154 mt CO2 e per important areas. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 43 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GHG EMISSIONS (‘000 MT) million $ revenue. This wide range reflects the diversity of AMG but also guides focus on reduction opportunities. For AMG as a whole in 2015, GHG emissions were 569,000 mt, 453 down 10% from 631,000 mt in 2014. Revenue was $977 million, 386 giving a GHG intensity of 582 mt per million $ revenue, almost unchanged from 2014, despite the adverse effect on revenue caused by global market conditions. 178 183 EMISSIONS TO AIR GRI INDICATORS EN 19 AND EN 20 The emissions of ozone-depleting substances remain de minimis for AMG. AMG Engineering also has de minimis air 2014 2015 emissions for other pollutants, resulting from only small sources such as heating and hot water boilers. AMG Critical Indirect Material’s production facilities do have some other air Direct emissions, including SOx (628 mt), NOx (780 mt) and particulate materials (81 mt). Data is only available for regulated sources where measurements have been made. The largest particulate emissions come from silicon metal production activities. EMISSIONS TO WATER AND SPILLS GRI INDICATORS EN 21 AND EN 23 591 AMG facilities continue to maintain records of the volume of 535 aqueous effluents, including process water and non-sanitary sewer discharges to local water courses. Clean water (typically freshwater used for cooling purposes that has not been affected in the process) is included in the figures given below. Chemical analysis of the effluent is utilized to determine the total mass of primary constituents of the water emissions. 40 34 In 2015, the total water disposed to water courses by AMG Critical Materials equaled 3,629,000 cubic meters compared to 2014 2015 3,555,000 cubic meters in 2014. This slight increase is attributed to variations in production volumes and product mix. Engineering After mining activities, most of AMG Critical Material’s water is Critical Materials used for cooling purposes and therefore produces clean water discharges, some of the wet chemical processes generate aqueous waste streams. This included cooling water used by the silicon metal furnaces and mine water from dewatering pumps. In several locations, mine water is utilized for process water before final discharge. For the 8 production sites reporting industrial process water disposal, the major constituents were metals (807 kg), fluoride (5861 kg), sulfate (1033 mt) and total suspended solids (185 mt). Of the total amount, 2.33 million cubic meters of water were discharged to surface water from the mine site in Brazil. AMG Engineering utilizes minimal water for non-contact, closed-cycle cooling purposes, and the discharges are therefore clean water and not considered material to this report. The only significant water discharge of noncontact cooling water takes place at the site in Michigan, USA (37,000 cubic meters in 2015). 44 AMG THE CRITICAL MATERIALS COMPANY In 2015, there were no significant spills (defined by GRI as as the regulatory framework grows and expands across the one which would affect the Company’s financial statements world. AMG units are involved in, among others, the Vanadium as a result of the ensuing liability, or is recorded as a spill) of International Technical Committee and the International tailings or other process materials at any AMG site.

Based on the method and scope of work undertaken, and the information provided to GHD by AMG, the process undertaken by AMG provides a balanced representation of the issues concerning AMG’s sustainability performance and is an appropriate presentation of AMG’s environmental, safety, health and social performance in 2015. In our opinion, the processes for collecting and reporting sustainability-related data that AMG introduced in 2007 continue to be enhanced through better communication and awareness, and more consistent application of the environmental indices. Some challenges remain related to providing consistent and complete data in an efficient manner. It is recommended that AMG continue to focus on these challenges to improve reporting, but they do not materially affect the conclusions presented herein. JULIAN HAYWARD, P.
