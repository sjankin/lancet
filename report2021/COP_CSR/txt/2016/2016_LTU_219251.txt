As well, many new programs were added to the trainings, including cultural learning, helping to deal with our client employees at distribution centres, English language and internationally acknowledged ‘driver rights’. We’ve done a lot, but we know that improvement is a continuous process. Darius Visakavicius, Teacher at Drivers Academy, ex-driver at Girteka Logistics This year we conducted our ﬁrst group-wide employee satisfaction survey. I’m particularly happy, that it revealed a high level of appreciation for the new Girteka Logistics CSR policy. This shows that my colleagues understand the value of being socially responsible and, I believe, are ready to contribute to common goals by their daily work. Jelena Vainilaite, HR Development Division Manager LEAN is not about social responsibility, but that is what t o o k m y a t t e n t i o n t h r o u g h o u t t h e y e a r. B y implementing this new thing in garages and service centres we managed to solve many issues we had before. I especially like, that each and every employee, no matter the subordination, can express his opinion on how work must be conducted and share ideas. Tomas Stankus, Truck Service I would particularly like to highlight the fact that 2015 was a year of change for Girteka Logistics. A year marked by the introduction of our ‘Quality Year 2015’ corporate plan, as well as our new corporate philosophy, which sets out our mission, vision and values. I’m proud, that I was able to be part of this process. Kristian Kaas Mortensen, Chief Communications Oﬃcer THINK. ACT. LEAD. 7 EMPLOYEE SPEAK-UP EMPLOYEE SPEAK-UP My work includes daily communication with our existing and potential clients. And I’m really proud of Girteka Logistics, especially when we are commended for our eﬀorts and implementations we started last year. Our focus on CSR issues helped to reduced risks, prompted cost savings and opened new sales opportunities. Vilius Fatenas, Team Leader of Business Development, European Department Sometimes simple things work best. I especially like our “Pie Day” project. Together with colleagues we are baking pies and other sweets, while others taste them and donate money to Mothers’ Union, a charity foundation, helping families raising children with cancer. I’m a mother myself, so this project is really important for me. Genute Jonutiene, Labelling Specialist, Warehouses I feel that Girteka Logistics is changing for good. This year I really felt more communication and a bit diﬀerent approach. Many rules got simpler, easier to understand. And, I know it’s very simple, but I really like the new, dedicated for drivers Facebook page – I really like sharing photos from the road with other colleagues. Vadim Luchin, Driver, European Fleet We operate in a far more challenging world today than the one in which Girteka Logistics was created 20 years ago. Nevertheless, our priorities are the same as the very ﬁrst day – to build reliable services for our customers; to create rewarding and meaningful jobs for our employees; and care about the future by reducing our environmental impact.

For each area we discuss our assessments, policy and goals as well as our implementation and measurement outcomes. As this is the ﬁrst Communication on Progress for Girteka Logistics – many of the initiatives and actions are diﬃcult to measure, as they were not implemented before or were not considered as measurable. Nevertheless, we see this Communication as the foundation for our future steps and measurement of achievements. We are proud, that throughout the year our employees expressed their assent for social commitment. Regardless of whether they work, everyone at Girteka Logistics takes part in the socially supportive initiatives undertaken by the company. This creates us opportunities to achieve even more in 2016. THINK. ACT. LEAD. 9 HUMAN RIGHTS Principle 1: Businesses should support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; and Principle 2: make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses. Principles 1/2 Girteka Logistics is proactive in its commitment to employee safety. Those areas of our business most exposed to safety risks have developed tailor-made awareness information and training resources. Even so, safety must remain our key priority for the future. Whether on the road, our own sites or on those of our clients – Girteka Logistics is committed to continuous improvement. Girteka Logistics ensures that:  Employees are provided with safe, suitable and sanitary work facilities.  Employees at Girteka Logistics are protected from workplace harassment, including physical, verbal, sexual or psychological harassment, abuse or threats.  Measures are taken to eliminate ingredients, designs, defects or side-eﬀects that could harm or threaten human life and health during usage or disposal of products as well as while providing services. Regarding progress in 2015, we would like to draw attention to further areas relating to the UNCG Human Rights principles: Work safety trainings Additionally, a special digital training and testing system about work safety for administration It is Girteka Logistics policy and obligation to employees was launched on our intranet.

LEAD. 10 HUMAN RIGHTS Publishing Girteka Logistics Code of Conduct Human rights were always respected within Principles 1/2 Girteka Logistics, but almost all rules, establishing this were used internally. That’s why at the beginning of 2015 our ﬁrst formal Code of Conduct was created and published on our website www.girteka.eu. This makes it accessible for all our stakeholders as well as employees. The principles for responsible business, listed in the new Code of Conduct, are in accordance with UN Global Compact, with other internationally recognized norms of behaviour and company's corporate philosophy, embodied with our slogan WE CARE. First part of the Code – Quality Management – outlines common goals in terms of customer service and environmental consideration, providing directions for proﬁtable and sustainable growth. Second part – Standards in Girteka Logistics – states, that Girteka Logistics has established provisions covering human rights, workers' rights, compliance with legislation, the environment and anti-corruptions. All of them shall be applied in policies, decisions and activities. Code of Conduct: http://www.girteka.eu/en/corporate-responsibility-1/code-of-conduct-1 CASE STUDY: supporting awareness project Mission Siberia Charity and support fund 'Jauniems' is organizing a project for building public awareness called Mission Siberia (www.misijasibiras.lt). From the start of the project there have already been 12 youth expeditions so far that have rearranged and cleaned over 100 Lithuanian resistance, who was deported during the Soviet occupation, cemeteries in Siberia. Every year members of expeditions are travelling all around Lithuania, meeting schoolchildren and communities, telling about the project and historical impact. The idea for the project came up in 2005 when a resolution for building patriotism was approved in the Youth Organizations Assembly of Lithuania. This resolution claims that the youth of Lithuania is patriotic, but they perceive it diﬀerently than the generations before, therefore the youth does not have the opportunities to show it to the public in traditional ways and means.

LEAD. 11 HUMAN RIGHTS Employee Handbook Eﬃcient communication with employees helps Principles 1/2 them to better understand internal culture, but to get acquainted with their rights and other measures taken by the company in the ﬁeld of employee rights. That’s why last year we’ve started drafting our ﬁrst ever Employee Handbook, which will be released in April, 2016 to all Girteka Logistics employees. Employee handbook summarizes employment procedures and policies to all employees in a standardized context. The book as well includes relevant policies and beneﬁts of employment, and how employees should conduct themselves. One of the most important goals of our new Employee handbook is to address applicable legal regulations and other internationally acknowledged rules. Procedures for adhering to and reporting violations of anti-discrimination and antiharassment laws, hour and overtime regulations are covered in Employee Handbook.

Our goal for the year 2016 is not only to present those resources for our employees in the most convenient way for them, but to conduct an internal survey on the topic of Human Rights. This will allow us to measure eﬀectiveness of our eﬀorts and seek further development. Another aim for 2016 is to enhance employee partici-pation in decision making through works comities.

Aim of this project was to grant school children light reﬂectors, to make them more visible on the roads and to avoid accidents. This project was initiated by Trygg Traﬁkk and local newspaper Hitra-Frøya. As Bjørn Rønningen, editor of Hitra-Frøya newspaper said, people walking on the road without reﬂectors are often seen in the region, especially at night.
