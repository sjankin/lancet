As I look back at our sustainability journey, I feel satisied with our progress and more importantly the sense of responsibility and care for environment and society which we have been able to harvest even among ground level staff. But I know it is a dynamic process and we still have a long way to go to achieve our sustainability dreams and commitments. As a logistics company our sustainability approach is not only to manage low of goods from origin to destination in a safe, eficient and cost effective manner but also to simultaneously create social value, positively impact the environment and enhance the quality of life for the people and communities around. 2015 was a dificult year globally, both in socio-economic and geo-political terms. For GCC economies, where we have major operations, the low oil price environment has posed strategic challenges for governments, businesses and people at large. Hence some of the promises which we had made in last year’s report could not be materialized. Nevertheless, we remain committed to navigate even faster by realizing the full potential of our people, collaborating with partners, inding innovative solutions, networking with like-minded institutions, leveraging from collective wisdom and empowering our teams locally.

No matter how far down the logistics chain, companies are now expected to follow the lead of others who publish their supply chain footprint. Globally, corporations are looking more closely at transparency, traceability and sustainability in their supply chains. For Tristar, as a global integrated liquid and gas logistics provider, adhering to initiatives such as the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, in addition to our continued support of the UNGC, will be a key challenge that could be addressed through changing our procurement processes and adopting more sustainable procurement guidelines. Only by changing our internal policies can we hope to affect the way we play a part in the chain as a whole, we need to ask more questions of our suppliers and subcontractors, we need to take more consideration in our procurement and sub-contractor process to be knowledge enough to know we are making the right decision.” Karl Mason Business Development Director, Tristar Group 18 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 our driving force: cSR committee Our Corporate Social Responsibility Steering Committee (CSRSC) has been given the responsibility to implement our sustainability policy into planning our day-to-day operations while planning for the future.

However, as the editor of a logistics publication, I found to my pleasant surprise that the Tristar Group has not only been sincere, committed, engaged and involved with sustainable logistics and has invested substantially monetarily and in the inclusion of employees to raise the bar on this count. I personally attended a press conference two years ago at the Tristar Group, where several company oficials and oficials from overseas were present on hand to present, vet, explain and demonstrate their dedication to sustainability. I have seen, observed and monitored the company up close and personal and am personally convinced and can vouch for Tristar Group’s passion to sustainable logistics.” Mr. Malcolm Dias Editor, Logistics Gulf “I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for your contribution to the Arabia CSR Awards Clinic 2015.

The campaign, led by 50 managers and staff across functions, mandated one-to-one conversations with 10 drivers per person per week, to reiterate the six safety steps. An average of 65 drivers per day have been approached and reminded about the 6-S, since the introduction of the campaign in October 2015. All drivers in the UAE (Dubai, RAK, Abu Dhabi and Fujairah), Qatar, Kuwait and Oman, and all warehouse staff in Dubai (Head Ofice and Jebel Ali Industrial Area-1) were approached by select staff during 2015 under this campaign which also contributed signiicant improvement in our road safety performance than previous year.

Use of energy eficient LED lights: In South Sudan, energy savings were achieved by installing LED lighting based on invertors at three sites. At night, yard lighting uses invertors, thereby reducing diesel generator usage for 8 to10 hours per day. This strategy also helps cut down emissions, while increasing the shelf life of the generator. Ten energy eficient LED spot lights were also installed at the Guam ofice location. 46 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 Fuel Consumption Tristar UAE Corporate Head Ofice global operations, 2015 Fuel consumption at our Head Ofice increased in 2015, fuel consumption for global owing to the increased leet operations and an expanded operations in 2015, in kl inventory of fuel consumption data that includes the fueling values of Saudi Arabia and Ras Al Khaimah (an Emirate of the UAE). 865.6 SOUTH SUDAN HAITI 178 fuel consumption for uae SAUDI ARABIA 1063 Corporate Head Ofice, in KL 4918.4 UAE GUAM 67.2 Total 4918.4 Consumption of KUWAIT 1114.3 10260 KL PAKISTAN 39.2 3522.8 3380.3 3024.6 CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC 7.2 UGANDA (CAR) 300.8 197.9 QATAR 8.4 OMAN KENYA 1500 2015 2014 2013 2012 Water Consumption Our Group’s water consumption is consistently monitored in order to utilize resources in the best possible manner.

This technique reduces the usage of water, utilizes sea water for ireighting when the activation chemicals or solvents, and generates less amount of of the emergency ire pump is required. In the past, waste water.(17) Wastewater Treatment System, Head Ofice In 2015, our Jebel Ali Head Ofice installed an efluent treatment plant (ETP) for the treatment of wastewater from chemical tanker washing bays and paint booths to disposable or reusable water standards. The ETP for chemical wastewater combines chemical treatment processes with tertiary iltration systems to provide an advanced level of organic and suspended solids removal. The system also provides an advanced level of metal removal. This physio–chemical puriication process carried out with the help of advanced coagulation and locculation agents help to reduce PH, Total Dissolved Solids, the biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and other pollutants. Through the secondary treatment stage the wastewater is further subjected to biological degradation of the pollutants before it is sent for tertiary treatment for disposal or reuse. The below infographics highlights the processes in a wastewater treatment system. TREATED WATER TANKER SLUDGE DISPOSAL AS DISPOSAL AS WASHING AREA PAINT BOOTH PER DM PROCEDURE NON-HAZARDOUS TREATED WATER TANK CHEMICAL WASTE CHEMICAL WATER WATER TANK TREATMENT PLANT Waste Management A large portion of the waste that is generated as part of our daily operations include waste engine oil and used tires. We actively engage with our employees at ground level to change their behaviors and educate them about responsible waste management. In collaboration with the Emirates Environmental Group (EEG) in 2015, we have successfully conducted a recycling event and an education program in the UAE. We continue to work with the EEG on e-waste recycling and battery and mobile phone diversion among other waste types, such as aluminum cans, plastic and glass wastes. In 2015, 1,300 kg of paper waste and 15 kg of plastic/glass waste was recycled through EEG. 16 One bbl (barrel) = 159 liters 17 A volume of 475 ml (475 cm3)of water when converted into steam yields about 197,000 cm3 of steam (which would equal to about 197 liters of water). It also reduces on the usage of solvents and de-greasers required. 48 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015 Oil Spills In 2015, we have not encountered any major oil spills at the group level. In the road transportation business, we owe our success to the rigorous driver trainings, real-time GPS tracking, robust maintenance systems and using technologies such as Rollover Warning Device (RWD) for rollover prevention. In shipping, our continuous collaboration model with port authorities, leet managers, marine authority, coast guards and environmental agencies has beneited us to mitigate any emergency oil spill situation. Tire Management Tire management and safe tire disposal are key requirements at our workshop. We are constantly on the lookout to increase tire mileage as per original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommendations such as load rating, correct inlation, wheel balancing, tyre rotation and driver training to avoid harsh braking. Through these best practices, we target to increase tire mileage thus reducing used tire generation. Additionally we also perform retreading of used tires from authorized agencies to give another life to these used tires, hence reducing the number of tires to be disposed. In the UAE approximately 411 tires were retreaded by licensed agencies.

We safely dispose off the waste oil through a municipality-approved recycling company. Paper Consumption With support from our IT department, we have taken measures to reduce paper use, switching to electronic alternatives and employee communication portals. Nevertheless, our overall paper consumption has increased due to overall headcount increment.
