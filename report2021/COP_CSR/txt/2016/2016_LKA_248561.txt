At the same time, non traditional rubber producing countries increased their year-on-year rubber production, giving rise to an oversupply situation in the market. Meanwhile, from price despite many governments of producer countries stepping in to offer input subsidies, guaranteed minimum prices and even encouraging farmers to fell old rubber trees, these measures did not deliver the anticipated results and the fluctuations international rubber prices continued to slide. To add to these woes, synthetic rubber producers across the world were capitalizing on the declining crude oil prices to manufacture ever cheaper synthetic polymers using petroleum by product which can just as easily be used as a substitute for natural rubber in a vast number of industries.

Further, investments in Immature Plantations taken over by way of leases are shown in this note. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from immature to mature. The requirement of recognition of bearer biological assets at its fair value less cost to sell under LKAS 41 was superseded by the ruling issued on 02 March 2012, by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the Company has elected to measure the bearer biological assets at cost using LKAS 16 – Property Plant & Equipment. Specific borrowings have not been obtained to finance the planting expenditure. Hence, borrowing costs were not capitalised during the year under Immature Plantations (2014/15 Nil). 179 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2015/16 The addition of Rs.349 m (2014/15 Rs. 477 m) shown above includes the following costs among other costs incurred during the year in respect of Uprooting and Planting of Tea and Rubber.

The cost of immature trees is treated as approximate fair value particularly on the ground of little biological transformation has taken place and impact of the biological transformation on price is not material. When such plantations become mature, the additional investments since taken over to bring them to maturity are transferred from Immature to Mature. The fair value of managed trees was ascertained since the LKAS 41 is only applicable for managed agricultural activity in terms of the ruling issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka. The valuation was carried by Messer’s Sunil Fernando Associates, chartered valuers, using Discounted Cash Flow methods. In ascertaining the fair value of timber, a physical verification was carried out covering all the estates. 180 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2015/16 Notes to the Financial Statements Contd. 14.2.1 INFORMATION ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3) Non Financial Asset Valuation Unobservable Range of unobservable Relationship of technique inputs inputs (Probability unobservable inputs weighted average.) to fair value Consumable Managed Biological Assets DCF Discounting Rate 17.5% The higher the discount rate, the lesser the fair value Optimum rotation Lower the rotation (Maturity) 25-35 Years period, the higher the fair value Volume at rotation 25-85 cu.ft The higher the volume, the higher the fair value Price per cu.ft. Rs.450/to Rs.1,800/The higher the price per cu. ft., the higher the fair value Other key assumptions used in valuation 1. The harvesting is approved by the PMMD and Forest Department based on the forestry development plan. 2. The price adopted are net of expenditure. 3. Though the replanting is a condition precedent for harvesting, yet the cost are not taken in to consideration. The valuations, as presented in the external valuation models based on net present values, take into account the long-term exploitation of the timber plantations. Because of the inherent uncertainty associated with the valuation at fair value of the biological assets due to the volatility of the variables, their carrying value may differ from their realisable value. The Board of Directors retains their view that commodity markets are inherently volatile and that long term price projections are highly unpredictable. Hence, the sensitivity analysis regarding selling price and discount rate variations as included in this note allows every investor to reasonably challenge the financial impact of the assumptions used in the LKAS 41 against his own assumptions. 14.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis Sensitivity variation sales price Values as appearing in the Statement of Financial Position are very sensitive to price changes with regard to the average sales prices applied.

The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Group’s operations and to provide guarantees to support its operations. The Group has loan and other receivables, trade and other receivables, and cash and short-term deposits that arise directly from its operations. The Group also holds available-for-sale investments and enters into derivative transactions (Mainly Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts). Accordingly the Group has exposure to namely Credit Risk, Liquidity Risk, Currency Risk and Market Risks from its use of financial instruments. This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk. 37.1 Financial Risk Management Framework The Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s financial risk management framework which includes developing and monitoring the Group’s financial risk management policies. The Group financial risk management policies are established to identify, quantify and analyse the financial risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor financial risks and adherence to limits. Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The KVPL Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s financial risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the financial risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 37.2 Credit Risk Credit Risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivable from customers and from its financing activities including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments. 37.2.1 Trade and Other Receivables The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group’s credit policy is monitored at the Board level. The new customers are analysed individually for credit worthiness before Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. Group review includes external ratings when available and in some cases, bank references, purchases limit etc. which also subject to under review on quarterly basis. The past experience of the management is considered when revisions are made to terms and conditions. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables. 213 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2015/16 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date is Rs. 541m (2014/15 – Rs. 737 m). KVPL has a minimal credit risk of its trade receivables as the repayment is guaranteed within seven days by the Tea and Rubber auction systems. MTPL has the largest exposure to credit risk as a major portion of the trade receivables are from foreign currencies. All open account debtors are covered with export credit insurance. Settlement of other debtors are carried through banks. 37.2.2 Investments Credit risks from invested balance with the financial institutions are managed by the Board of Directors. Investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties and within credit limits assigned to them. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate financial loss through potential counterparty’s failure. The Group held short term investments of Rs. 0.177m as at 31 March 2016 (2014/15 – Rs. 40m) which represents the maximum credit exposure on these assets. 37.2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents The Group held cash at bank and in hand of Rs. 55m as at 31 March 2016 (2014/15 – Rs. 54m) which represents its maximum credit exposure on these assets. yySampath Bank PLC – A+ (lka) yyHatton National Bank PLC –AA – (lka) yyBank of Ceylon – AA+ (lka) yyCiti Bank N.A. – AAA (lka) yyHong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd – AAA(lka) yyPan Asia Banking Corporation PLC – BBB (lka) yyUnion Bank of Colombo PLC – BB+ (lka) yyDFCC Bank PLC – AA(lka) 37.3. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group’s reputation. The Group does not concentrate on a single financial institution, thereby minimising the exposure to liquidity risk through diversification of funding sources. The Group aims to fund investment activities of the individual and Group level by funding the long-term investment with long term financial sources and short term investment with short term financing. Where necessary the Group consults the Treasury Department and Strategic Business Development Unit in Parent Company for scrutinising the funding decisions. 214 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2015/16 Notes to the Financial Statements Contd.

Market prices comprise four types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk & other price risk such as equity price risk. Financial instrument affected by market risk include loans & borrowings, deposits, available for sale investment & derivative financial instruments. 215 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2015/16 37.4.1 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. The Group manages its interest rate risk by having a balanced portfolio of fixed and variable rate loans and borrowings. The Group has not engaged in any interest rate swap agreements. The Group held long term borrowings with floating interest rates of Rs. 394m (2014/15 – Rs. 447m) which represents its maximum credit exposure on these liabilities. Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of loans and borrowings affected. With all other variables held constant, the Group’s Profit Before Tax is affected through the impact on floating rate borrowings as follows: Increase/ Effect on decrease in profit before tax interest rate Rs.’000 Group 2015/16 +1% 5,612 -1% (5,612) 2014/15 +1% 5,385 -1% (5,385) Company 2015/16 +1% 5,612 -1% (5,612) 2014/15 +1% 5,385 -1% (5,385) 37.4.2 Foreign Currency Risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functional currency of the Group. The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings. These currencies primarily are USD and AUD. The Group hedges its exposure to fluctuation on the transaction of its foreign operations mainly by forward contracts. 216 Kelani Valley Plantations PLC | Annual Report 2015/16 Notes to the Financial Statements Contd. Foreign currency Sensitivity The following tables demonstrate the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the USD and AUD exchange rates, with all other variables held constant. The impact on the Group’s Profit Before Tax is due to changes in fair value of monetary assets and liabilities. Increase/ Effect on decrease in profit before tax interest rate Rs.’000 Group 2015/16 USD +5% (2,873) AUD +5% (0.24) USD -5% 2,873 AUD -5% 0.24 2014/15 USD +5% (12,686) AUD +5% 136 USD -5% 12,686 AUD -5% -136 37.4.3 Equity Price Risk The Group’s listed & unlisted equity securities are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment securities. The Group manages the equity price risk through diversification and by placing limits on individual and total equity instruments. Management of the Group monitors the mix of debt & equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market indices. Material investment within the portfolio are managed on an individual basis and all buy and sell decision are approved by the Board. Equity price risk is not material to the Financial Statements.
