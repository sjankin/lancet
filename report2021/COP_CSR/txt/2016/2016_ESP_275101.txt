(*) Data for both the Automotive (complete) and Smart innovation (Spain only) platforms As a responsible and proactive company, it evaluates potential workplace risks, establishes preventative measures and monitors the effectiveness of initiatives implemented by means of internal audits. In parallel, it provides its employees with skills training and information tailored to their workplaces and jobs. The corporate safety department audits the group factories annually, except in the Americas where the plants audit each other. These audits give rise to corrective measures which are executed at the factory level and supervised at the corporate level. Starting from the premise that every accident is a learning experience, all the accidents were investigated and duly reported following 8D methodology with a view to establishing corrective measures designed to prevent their repetition. 1.

Supplier quality and service reliability To ensure the reliability of the products and services supplied, suppliers are assessed periodically on two factors: quality and service. The frequency of these assessments is determined by each productive facility depending on its needs although they must be carried out at least annually. These periodic assessments may be complemented annually by audits. The group has defined a specific procedure for these audits which assesses and scores suppliers on the following parameters: planning, reception, training and skills, process, maintenance, inspection, packaging, storage, continuous improvement and environmental record, customer satisfaction, 1.

Through its subsidiary, Bionor, it recycles used oil to turn it into biodiesel, a complex process. In 2015, it processed 24,351 tonnes of used oil. Use of these products implies sharply reduced greenhouse gas emissions and provides a compelling alternative to the environmental damage and other dangers posed by conventional fuels.
