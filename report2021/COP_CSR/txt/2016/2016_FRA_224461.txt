Each item presented in this document is accompanied by an indication of the proportion of employees covered (as a percentage of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees at year-end). Different consolidation rules have been applied: 3 consolidated social data concern fully consolidated entities. The employee data relating to the Regional Banks are not included in this report because they are equity-accounted. 3 in the case of training data, there was a change of method in 2008. All this information is now calculated on the basis of the first 11 months of the year, December in any case not being a representative month and generally being marginal in terms of activity compared with the other months of the year; 3 unless otherwise stated, the data are presented from the employer’s viewpoint and not the beneficiary’s viewpoint. The difference relates to employees seconded by one entity to another (with no change in the employment contract) who report to their host entity from the beneficiary’s viewpoint and to their contracting entity from the employer’s viewpoint; 3 unless otherwise stated, the population under review is that of “working” employees. The notion of working implies:  a legal tie in the form of a standard fixed-term or indefinite-term employment contract (or similar abroad),  being on the payroll and in the job on the final day of the period,  working time percentage of 50% or more; 3 for environmental reporting:  the consolidated data cover one calendar year, from 1 January to December 31,  the floor space used for buildings corresponds to the gross leasable area (GLA) indicated in the lease,  energy consumption is based on the bills issued by energy suppliers,  only consumption billed directly to Group entities is taken into account. Consumption included in rental charges is not taken into account. This non-recognised share of consumption is estimated using the coverage ratio,  the CO2 emissions are calculated using the benchmark emission factors of the International Energy Agency for electricity and of the DEFRA for other factors. For transport, we used the Low Carbon Emission factors to calculate the emissions for air travel in unknown categories. The factors used for air travel do not take account of radiative forcing,  Regarding electric and electronic waste, the reported data concerns the quantities collected by the supplier of the Group ATF Gaia, those collected by CA Immobilier on buildings located in the Ile-de-France region and those from Crédit Agricole CIB UK,  Regarding the other wastes (Ordinary industrial waste and paper/carton), the reported data concerns the quantities collected by CA Immobilier for buildings located in the Ile-de-France and as well as those collected by Crédit Agricole Consumer Finance. The examples of CSR practices illustrating the document data and commentary were compiled from surveys of CSR managers, Human Resource Directors and various departments of Crédit Agricole S.A., across a broad representative sample of Crédit Agricole Group entities. As part of our ongoing policy to improve the reliability of social indicators, once again this year we asked our Statutory Auditors to conduct an in-depth examination of our published social indicators.

Independence and quality control Our independence is defined by regulatory texts, the French Code of ethics (Code de déontologie) of our profession and the requirements of article L.822-11 of the French Commercial Code. In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with the ethical requirements, French professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Statutory Auditor’s responsibility On the basis of our work, our responsibility is to:  attest that the required CSR Information is included in the management report or, in the event of non-disclosure of a part or all of the CSR Information, that an explanation is provided in accordance with the third paragraph of article R.225-105 of the French Commercial Code (Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information);  express a limited assurance conclusion that CSR Information taken as a whole, is, in all material respects, fairly presented in accordance with the Guidelines (Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information). Our work involved 9 persons and was conducted between October 2015 and February 2016 during a 20 week period. We were assisted in our work by our CSR experts. We performed our work in accordance with the French professional standards and with the order dated 13 May 2013 defining the conditions under which the independent third party performs its engagement and with ISAE 3000(2) concerning our conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information. 1. Attestation regarding the completeness of CSR Information NATURE AND SCOPE OF OUR WORK On the basis of interviews with the individuals in charge of the relevant departments, we obtained an understanding of the Company’s sustainability strategy regarding human resources and environmental impacts of its activities and its social commitments and, where applicable, any actions or programs arising from them. We compared the CSR Information presented in the management report with the list provided in article R.225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code. For any consolidated information that is not disclosed, we verified that explanations were provided in accordance with article R.225-105, paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code.

CONCLUSION Based on the work performed and given the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. 2. Conclusion on the fairness of CSR Information NATURE AND SCOPE OF OUR WORK We conducted around fifty interviews with about one hundred persons responsible for preparing the CSR Information in the departments in charge of collecting the information and, where appropriate, responsible for internal control and risk management procedures, in order to:  assess the suitability of the Guidelines in terms of their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, and taking into account industry best practices where appropriate;  verify the implementation of data-collection, compilation, processing and control process to reach completeness and consistency of the CSR Information and obtain an understanding of the internal control and risk management procedures used to prepare the CSR Information. We determined the nature and scope of our tests and procedures based on the nature and importance of the CSR Information with respect to the characteristics of the Company, the human resources and environmental challenges of its activities, its sustainability strategy and industry best practices. Regarding the CSR Information that we considered to be the most important (listed in annex):  at parent entity level, we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organisation, policies, actions), performed analytical procedures on the quantitative information and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations and the consolidation of the data. We also verified that the information was consistent and in agreement with the other information in the management report;  at the level of a representative sample of entities(1) selected by us on the basis of their activity, their contribution to the consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews to verify that procedures are properly applied, and we performed tests of details, using sampling techniques, in order to verify the calculations and reconcile the data with the supporting documents. The selected sample represents on average 35% of headcount and between 33% and 100% of quantitative environmental data disclosed. For the remaining consolidated CSR Information, we assessed its consistency based on our understanding of the company. We also assessed the relevance of explanations provided for any information that was not disclosed, either in whole or in part. We believe that the sampling methods and sample sizes used, based on our professional judgment, are sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion; a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures. Due to the use of sampling techniques and other limitations inherent to information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR Information cannot be totally eliminated. Conclusion Based on the work performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines.

This analysis has been carried out on to the nominal amount of the underlying portfolio, with no markCIB’s derivative instruments. 424 CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2015 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the consolidated financial statements / Note 10 to-market payment, the prepayment rate plays a significant part At 31 December 2015, sensitivity to the inputs used in the interest in their valuation. rate derivative models was therefore +/-€6.7 million, down slightly on 31 December 2014 (+/-€7.1 million) and at a comparable level However, although this input is not observable, the valuation model to 30 June 2015 (+/-€6.6 million). No significant change was used is extremely conservative. The valuation used is defined as observed on any of the sub-scopes. the lower of the valuation obtained using the fastest prepayment rate and that obtained using a slower than expected prepayment The main contributors are now: rate.

CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2015 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 451 6 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements STATUTORY AUDITORS’ REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS This is a free translation into English of the Statutory Auditors’ report issued in French. It is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information required specifically by French law in such reports, whether qualified or not. This information presents below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report should be read and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the year ended December 31, 2015 To the Shareholders In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your General Meeting of Shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2015, on:  the audit of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Crédit Agricole S.A.;  the justification of our assessments;  the specific verification required by law. These consolidated financial statements have been approved by Board of Directors Our role is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. I Opinion on the consolidated financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sample techniques or other methods of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Group as at December 31,2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. II Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:  Your Group accounts for impairment reserves to cover identified credit risk, which are inherent to its business activities. We have reviewed the procedures implemented by management to identify and assess these risks and to determine the amount of impairment considered necessary, and we have verified that these accounting estimates were based on documented methods that comply with the principles described in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements.  As stated in Notes 1.3 and 10.2 to the consolidated financial statements, your Group uses internal models to measure financial instruments with unobservable inputs, and to assess some fair value adjustments of financial instruments. We have reviewed the control procedures around these models, the assumptions used and the way the risks associated with such instruments are taken into consideration.  As stated in Notes 1.4 and 6.18 to the consolidated financial statements, your Group has performed impairment tests on goodwills and investments. We have reviewed the terms and conditions related to these tests, the main parameters and assumptions used, and have verified that the presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements was appropriate.  As stated in Notes 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements, your Group establishes provisions to cover the legal and tax risks to which it is exposed. We have examined the mechanism implemented by management to identify and evaluate these risks and to determine the necessary amount of provisions. We have also verified the appropriateness of the information given in Notes 2 and 6.20 to the financial statements. 452 CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2015 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory auditors’ report on the consolidated financial statements  As part of its consolidated financial statements preparation process, your Group has made other accounting estimates, as explained in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements, in particular regarding the valuation and impairment of non-consolidated equity securities, the pension and future employee benefits engagements, reserves for operational risks, reserves for legal risks, insurance company technical reserves and deferred taxes assets. We have reviewed the methods and assumptions used and ensured that the accounting estimates are appropriately documented in conformity with the principles described in Note 1.3 of the consolidated financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III Specific verification As required by law, we have also verified in accordance with professional standards applicable in France the information presented in the Group’s management report. We have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.

It is provided solely for the convenience of English speaking users. The Statutory Auditors’ report includes information required specifically by French law in such reports, whether qualified or not. This information presents below the opinion on the consolidated financial statements and includes an explanatory paragraph discussing the auditors’ assessments of certain significant accounting and auditing matters. These assessments were considered for the purpose of issuing an audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and not to provide separate assurance on individual account captions or on information taken outside of the consolidated financial statements. This report should be read and construed in accordance with French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France. For the year ended December 31, 2015 To the Shareholders In compliance with the assignment entrusted to us by your General Meeting of Shareholders, we hereby report to you, for the year ended December 31, 2015, on:  the audit of the accompanying financial statements of Crédit Agricole S.A.  the justification of our assessments;  the specific verifications and information required by law. These financial statements have been approved by Board of Directors. Our role is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. I Opinion on the financial statements We conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France; those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures, using sample techniques or other methodes of selection, to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at December 31,2015 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles. II Justification of our assessments In accordance with the requirements of article L.823-9 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we bring to your attention the following matters:  As stated in Note 2.2.5 to the financial statements, equity investments, other long-term investments and investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are measured at their value in use. As part of our assessment of these estimates, we have examined the elements used in determining the value in use for the main operations.  As stated in Notes 2.6 and 15 to the financial statements, your Company establishes provisions to cover the legal and tax risks to which it is exposed. We have examined the mechanism implemented by management to identify and evaluate these risks and to 7 determine the necessary amount of provisions. We have also verified the appropriateness of the information given in Note 15 to the financial statements.  As part of its financial statements preparation process, your Company has made accounting estimates, in particular regarding the valuation of loans and advances granted and the pension and future employees’ benefits provisions. We have examined the assumptions used and verified that these accounting estimates are based on documented methods that comply with the principles set forth in Note 2 to the financial statements. These assessments were made as part of our audit of the financial statements, taken as a whole, and therefore contributed to the opinion we formed which is expressed in the first part of this report. III Specific verifications and information We have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by French law. We have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information provided in the management report of the Board of Directors, and in the documents addressed to the shareholders with respect to the financial position and the financial statements. Concerning the information provided in accordance with the requirements of Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de Commerce) related to compensations and benefits received by the Directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified its consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your Company from companies controlling your Company or controlled by it. Based on this work, we attest the accuracy and fair presentation of this information. In accordance with French law, we have verified that the required information concerning the purchase of investments and controlling interests and the identity of the shareholders or holders of the voting rights has been properly disclosed in the management report.

This agreement is valid for the duration of one year after the termination of his work contract.

Therefore, the Board auhtorized the collective agreement in which CA CIB agrees to cover all penalties. 10.

Gaillard, Kerrien, Ouvrier-Buffet, and Roveyaz, Chairman of the Board of Directors or Directors of your Company and Chairmen of the Board of Directors or Directors or Chief Executive Officers or Managers of the Companies mentioned above. Nature and purpose Your Company launched a project aiming at simplifying and clarifying the capital structure of the Group and reinforcing its level of capital. This project starts with the reclassification of the equity stake held by your Company in the capital of the Regional Banks, through Cooperative Investment Certificates (CIC) and Cooperative Partnership Certificates (CPC), through Certificats Coopératifs d’Investissement (CCI) and Certificats Coopératifs d’Associés (CCA). The Board of Directors of your Company (16 February 2016), of each of the Regional Banks (15 February 2016) and of SAS Rue La Boétie (16 February 2016), as well as the manager of Sacam Mutualisation, have authorized the signing of a Letter of Intent, describing guiding principles of this simplification and detailing the state of discussions between parties. The Boards of Directors of the Regional Banks and of your Company approved the signing of the document after receiving counsel from their respective independent experts regarding the fairness of the project’s financial terms, both for your Company and for the Regional Banks. The CCI/CCA issued by the Regional Banks and held by your Company will be transferred to Sacam Mutualisation, an entity entirely held by the Regional Banks. Conditions The transaction is estimated at €18 billion for the share of these assets, allowing for usual adjustments depending on the transaction date. This valuation represents 17.2 times the contribution of the Regional Banks to the Group net income, and to 1.05 times their Equity as of 31 December 2015. Motivation for the convention for the Company Your Board justified the convention in the following manner: By signing the Letter of Intent, the Company is allowed to begin the process of consulting the competent authorities and offices before, if applicable, signing final agreements. 2.

The original agreement, signed by your Company and the Regional on 16 December 2011 and modified on 19 December 2013, notably guarantees your Company against any decrease in the equity-accounted value of the CCI/CCA stake held by your Company in the Regional Banks. This guarantee, upheld by the Regional Banks, exists in order to prevent the requalification of these assets on a prudential level. The simplification process described above, which includes the disposal of the CCI/CCA held by your Company, will void the Switch guarantee agreement regarding the CCI/CCA (authorized by the Board of Directors on 16 December 2011 and approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 22 May 2012). The Switch agreement covering the equity-accounted value of the Insurance activities (addendum to the Switch guarantee agreement authorized by the Board of Directors on 19 December 2013 and approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders of 21 May 2014) remains in place. By the terms of this agreement, the voiding of the Switch CCI/CCA could have occurred as early as the announcement of the planned operation due to the change in accounting methods of the CCI and CCA in the consolidated accounts of your Company. They will no longer be equity-accounted on that date. Therefore, the Board of Directors of your Company has authorized the signing of an addendum to this agreement in order to maintain the Switch CCI/CCA until the effective execution of the operation. Conditions The guarantees mentioned above, pledged by the Regional Banks for the Switch CCI/CCA mechanism amount to €4,808.2 million and their cash deposit to €1,621.2 million. Motivation for the convention and agreement for the Company Your Board justified the convention in the following manner: The addendum to the agreement exists to maintain the entirety of the Switch guarantee mechanisms until the eventual execution of the planned transaction, despite of the announcement which could have immediately voided the part of the Switch agreement pertaining to the CCI/CCA. Agreements and commitments previously approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders In accordance with Article R. 225-30 of the French commercial code (Code de commerce), we have been advised that the implementation of the following agreements and commitments which were approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders in prior years continued during the year. 1.

By the amendment signed on 19 December 2013, your Company and the Regional Banks decided to extend the guarantee base granted by the Regional Banks to your Company on 23 December 2011 to your Company’s equity investment in Crédit Agricole Assurances (CAA). This scheme allows the transfer of the regulatory requirements related to the shares held by your Company in the Regional Banks (CCI/CCA) and in Crédit Agricole Assurances (CAA). The guarantees transfer to the Regional Banks the risk of a decrease in the equity-accounted value of shares held by your Company in Regional Banks (CCI/CCA) and in Crédit Agricole Assurances (CAA), which is accounted for using the equity method. The guarantees are backed by security deposits, which will be used over the long term to replenish the cash repaid for the hybrid capital securities “T3CJ” and the shareholder advance and provide additional long-term funds. The security deposits are calibrated to show the capital savings generated by your Company. CRÉDIT AGRICOLE S.A. 2015 REGISTRATION DOCUMENT 533 8 GENERAL INFORMATION Statutory Auditors’ special report on related party agreements and commitments In the event of a decrease in the equity-accounted value, the Regional Banks bear the loss in value for up to the maximum amount covered, with a return-to-better-fortune clause. If the guarantees are used, the corresponding compensation is deducted by your Company from the security deposits, which are in turn replenished by the Regional Banks in line with new regulatory requirements. The new guarantees were effective on 2 January 2014. The maturity of the total guarantees is 1 March 2027. Conditions On 30 June 2015 a decrease in the global value of equity investments covered by the mechanism was observed. The guarantee mechanism was therefore called into play for a value of €173 million. On 30 September 2015, the increase in the global value of equity investments covered by the mechanism triggered the better fortunes clause, cancelling out the impacts observed on June 30. On 31 December 2015, the guarantee pledged by the Regional Banks mentioned above amounts to €6,111.5 million and their cash deposit to €2,063.7 million. Furthermore, the remuneration paid or due by your company to these Regional Banks for 2015 financial year amounts to €192.8 million. 3. WITH CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CIB (CA CIB) Persons concerned MM. Brassac, Roveyaz, Veverka, Chifflet, Hocher and Mathieu, Directors or executive corporate officers of your Company and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer or Directors of Crédit Agricole CIB. Nature and purpose Following the merging of the corporate and investment banking businesses of Crédit Agricole and Crédit Lyonnais, Crédit Lyonnais made a partial asset transfer to Crédit Agricole Indosuez (which became Calyon and then Crédit Agricole CIB). In view of the above transaction, it was deemed necessary to increase CA CIB’s shareholders’ equity. During its meeting on 9 March 2004, the Board of Directors authorized your Company to carry out a series of transactions aimed at increasing CA CIB’s shareholders equity by a total amount of up to €3 billion. Conditions In accordance with this authorization, your Company notably subscribed to an issue of deeply subordinated notes for an amount of US$1,730 million in 2004. Since 2014, these deeply subordinated notes were partially repaid and the residual nominal amount as of 31 December 2015 is US$ 470 million. An amount of US$10.5 million in interest with respect to these notes have been or will be received by your Company for 2015 financial year. 4. WITH CRÉDIT AGRICOLE CIB, LCL AND WITH THE REGIONAL BANKS OF ALSACE-VOSGES, VAL DE FRANCE, LANGUEDOC, FRANCHE-COMTÉ, ALPES PROVENCE, PROVENCE CÔTE D’AZUR, AND ANJOU ET MAINE Persons concerned MM. Sander, Lefebvre, Mrs Flachaire, Delorme, Pouzet, de Laage, Bouin, and Gaillard for the financial guarantee agreement and its amendment, MM. Brassac, Roveyaz, Veverka, Chifflet, Hocher, Thibault and Mathieu for the entire agreements, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Directors or executive corporate officers of your Company and Chairmen of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officers or Directors of the Companies mentioned above Nature and purpose To increase or secure the short-term liquidity reserves, that can be used in the refinancing operations of the Eurosystem, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on 18 December 2012, authorized the creation of a “Fonds Commun de Titrisation” (FCT Securitization Fund), allowing the issuance of AAA rated senior bonds, for a total amount of €10 billion, secured by receivables from individuals on residential mortgage loans and owned by Group entities (Regional Banks and LCL). In this context, the Board authorized the completion by your Company of program documents subject to related party agreements and commitments procedures. The related party agreements and commitments procedures have been signed in April 2013 and this FCT (named “Evergreen HL1”) has issued for a total amount of €10 billion in April 2013. Conditions No issuance was executed in 2015. On 31 December 2015, the total amount of the FCT issuances is €10 billion.
