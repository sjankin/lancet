Saft produces two types of batteries: • non-rechargeable (primary) batteries — The active materials in non-rechargeable batteries are irreversibly converted during the chemical reaction that produces energy. Saft’s principal primary battery technologies are lithium-based; • rechargeable (secondary) batteries — These batteries can be charged and discharged repeatedly. The achievable number of recharge cycles is an important competitive factor. Saft’s main rechargeable battery technologies are nickel and lithium-ion (Li-ion). These advanced technologies offer better and more reliable performance, especially under extreme conditions, and have a longer life, reducing the frequency with which they must be maintained and/or replaced and therefore cutting costs for customers. Saft’s main battery technologies are: • nickel-based — This is a key technology for stationary back-up power batteries. Advanced nickel-based batteries accounted for approximately 48% of the Saft’s consolidated revenues in 2015; 4 • primary lithium — Non-rechargeable lithium batteries offer high end-storage and performance capabilities over a large range of formats. They accounted for SAFT | COP 2016 approximately 32% of Saft’s consolidated expected to be a €5 to €7 billion market by revenues in 2015; 2020. The market is dominated by lead-acid batteries, nickel and lithium-ion technology • lithium-ion — Li-ion is a rechargeable only capturing 5 to 10% of the market today lithium technology that is being increasingly but the penetration of the lithium-ion used in advanced applications such as in technology is expected to increase to 15-20% the defence, marine, and transportation by 2020. Saft is the leading supplier of nickelmarkets. Li-ion technology-based batteries based batteries for that market and is one of accounted for approximately 17% of Saft’s the main suppliers of lithium-ion batteries to the consolidated revenues in 2015; telecommunication networks market. • other technologies — Silver-based Growth in this market is generally driven by technologies are used to manufacture levels of capital expenditure in the batteries for missiles and torpedoes.

Finally, since 2000, this service is gradually deployed in emerging markets. This initiative is based on continuously larger network of logistics partners, which act as free points of collection for users of these products, and also based on recycling plants that extract metals and plastics and ensure their reuse in industrial sectors. Saft requires from all recycling partners, European as non-European, to comply with the objectives of recycling efficiency demanded by the European directive, thus guaranteeing a high level of environmental performance to all its customers, regardless their geographical location. In addition, this program has been extended to ensure the collection of primary lithium batteries in European countries where Saft has a Producer status. This network – see the http://www.saftbatteries.com website for details – enables users of those products to ensure, at lower cost, a correct end of life with respect to environment, while ensuring good management of natural resources. It also enables Saft to comply with the obligation for 17 recovery and recycling imposed by the Directive 2006/66/EC since 2008 to producers of batteries and accumulators located in European Union countries.

To be successful, the Saft Group must anticipate the needs of its clients and invest in new generation technologies, and it has a responsibility to develop the talent needed to sustainably support its growth. The Group pursues a strategy to differentiate itself through innovation and adopt a policy that considers each creative initiative as a source of economic performance in the high technology sector. Present on five continents, Saft’s multicultural dimension is founded on a policy that promotes mobility and diversity. The frequent professional mobility that takes place in the Company each year is proof of our active career management. A MEASURED ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT While the products manufactured by the Group improve the environmental performance of its customers, the Group itself must however make sure that its environmental impacts are known and minimised. In this regard, the Saft Group has created an environment charter that guides its action in several areas: • to acknowledge its legal obligations to insure regulatory compliance of its industrial sites; • to identify the environmental challenges, quantify them and reduce the impacts in an environmentally responsible manner in the design, provisioning, manufacturing operations and end-of-life management of its products; • to develop an environmental management system that promotes best practices internally and externally by proposing solutions to its clients that help them better control the impacts of their Saft products. A COMPANY THAT TAKES PART IN ITS SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT Within the Group, the health and safety of employees and subcontractors are a priority. Saft faces its industrial challenges by remaining a quality employer and a supplier with high professional standards. In all of its operations throughout its activities, Saft adheres to the values of integrity and respect for fundamental rights. The Group therefore does not tolerate any violation of human rights or the rights 19 of children, nor any serious breach in health and safety, nor fraud or corruption in any of its subsidiaries and suppliers.

It Over the years, the Group has progressively is also tasked with identifying any planned new introduced a policy of collecting and 20 environmental regulations in advance so that recycling its spent batteries and in particular its they can be incorporated into practical action nickel-based range. The policy originated at plans in a timely manner. All new employees Saft’s Oskarshamn plant in Sweden, which built received a training dedicated to a recycling unit originally established for the environmental protection. recycling of production scrap. During the SAFT | COP 2016 1980s, the Swedish subsidiary started offering free recycling of spent batteries generated by Swedish industrial end users. This recycling service was progressively extended to customers located in other Northern Europe. Then, during the 1990s, it became a full-fledged policy which was gradually extended to all customers located in the European Union and in North America. To this end, the Group established a network of voluntary bring-back points in a position to collect spent batteries from industrial end users, to sort them and re-dispatch them to specialized recycling facilities. More recently, efforts have been devoted to identifying bring-back points within the new Member States of the European Union as well as in more distant countries, such as Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia and South Africa, and several other African countries. Today, on the Group focuses on the development of this recycling service in emerging economies where efficient waste management infrastructures are being gradually implemented. As a result of this policy and network of partner that the Group has established, the vast majority of the Group’s customers now have the option of dropping their spent batteries off at a designated bring-back point, from which the waste can be dispatched to an authorised recycler, in compliance with the rules governing cross-border waste transportation. In 2006, a European Union directive (2006/66/EC) was adopted by the EU Council and Parliament with a view to regulating the design and end of life of batteries marketed in the European Union. This directive establishes some design limitations as well as an extended producer responsibility regarding the end of life and the recycling of spent batteries. Thanks to the deployment of this take back policy over many years, a simple adaptation was sufficient to ensure compliance with 2006/66/EC directive and its obligations on collection, treatment and recycling of batteries. More recently, this take back policy has evolved to cover different battery chemistries put on the market by the Group. Finally, the design requirements mandated by 21 this directive have been implemented by the Group: capacity labelling, marking with a crossed-out wheeled bin symbol and indicating the presence of certain substances.

We checked that the CSR Information covers the consolidated scope, which includes the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of article L.233-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the companies that it controls within the meaning of article L.233-3 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), subject to the limits set forth in the methodological note presented in the management report (Part 3.5 of Saft Registration Document). Based on our work, and taking into account the limitations mentioned above, we attest that the required CSR Information has been disclosed in the management report. II. FAIRNESS REPORT WITH RESPECT TO CSR INFORMATION Nature and scope of procedures We conducted the interviews that we deemed necessary with thirty persons responsible for the preparation of CSR Information from the departments in charge of the process of gathering information and, where appropriate, responsible of the internal control and risk management to: • assess the appropriateness of the Reporting Criteria in terms of relevance, completeness, neutrality, clarity and reliability, by taking into consideration, when relevant, the sector’s best practices; • verify the set-up within the Group of a process to collect, compile, process and check the CSR Information with regard to its completeness and consistency. We familiarized ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the compilation of the CSR Information. We determined the nature and extent of tests and controls depending on the nature and importance of CSR Information in relation to the characteristics of the Company, the social and environmental issues of its operations, its strategic priorities in relation to sustainable development, and the Industry best practices. Concerning the CSR information that we considered to be most significant (2): • at Group level, we consulted source documents and conducted interviews to corroborate the qualitative information (organization, policies, actions); we implemented analytical procedures on the quantitative and verified, on the basis of sampling techniques, the calculations and consolidation of the information and we verified its consistency with the other information contained in the management report; • at the level of a representative sample of entities (1) selected based on their activity, their contribution to consolidated indicators, their location and a risk analysis, we conducted interviews (1) ISAE 3000 – Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical information. (2) Global headcount and breakdown by gender and by geographical area, Pyramids by age and seniority, Number of recruitments, Number of dismissals, resignations, and end of fixed-term contracts, Turnover rate, Flow-in inter-site mobilities, Flow-out inter-site mobilities, Intra-site 38 mobilities, Absenteeism rate, Number of collective agreements signed, Number of employees trained in safety, Number of work accidents, Frequency rate, Severity rate, Number of training hours, Number of people trained, Percentage of people trained, Number of training actions, Quantity of cadmium in the air, Quantity of cadmium in the water, Quantity of hazardous wastes generated, Quantity of hazardous wastes recovered, Quantity of non-hazardous wastes generated, Quantity of non-hazardous wastes recovered, Total waste generated, Number of ISO 14 001 certified sites, Total water consumption, Electricity consumption, Gas consumption, Steam consumption, Total energy usage. SAFT | COP 2016 to verify the proper application of procedures and conducted substantive tests, using sampling basis, to verify the calculations performed and reconciled data with supporting evidence. The selected sites contribution to Group data equals to 67% of headcount and between 28% to 100% of the quantitative environmental information tested. Regarding the other CSR consolidated Information, we assessed its fairness and consistency based on our knowledge of the Group Finally, we assessed the relevance of the explanations relating to, where necessary, the omission of certain information. We deem that the sampling methods and sample sizes we have learned by exercising our professional judgment allow us to formulate a conclusion providing limited assurance; a higher level of assurance would have required more extensive work. Because of the use of sampling techniques, and because of other limits inherent to any information and internal control systems, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement in the CSR Information cannot be completely eliminated. Conclusion Based on our work, we did not identify any material misstatements that would lead us to believe that the CSR Information, taken as a whole, has not been fairly presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria. III. REASONABLE ASSURANCE REPORT ON SELECTED CSR INFORMATION Nature and scope of procedures Regarding information selected by the Group and identified by the symbol , we conducted similar work as described in paragraph 2 above for CSR information that we consider to be most significant but of greater depth, especially regarding the number of tests. The selected sites contribution to Group data equals to 67% of headcount and between 47% to 100% of the quantitative environmental information identified by the symbol . We deem this work allows us to express a reasonable assurance on the information selected by the Company and identified by the symbol . Conclusion In our opinion, the Information selected by the Group and identified by the symbol  was prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria.
