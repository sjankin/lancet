The Henner Group also intends to continue the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism (AML-CFT). As part of the AML-CFT procedures, it establishes the link between corruption and money laundering. It is important to note that any money from corruption is to be considered “dirty” money. The money is said to be laundered in order to be reincorporated into the legal economy before being invested or spent. The Henner Group is also looking at implementing a system to identify politically exposed persons (PPE). Owing to their political, legal or administrative position, PPEs are inherently exposed to corruption and must be monitored closely to identify the origin and destination of any money received or paid.           15 In 2015, the number of cases of suspected fraud detected by the Henner Group increased significantly for the same reasons: More than 6,650 cases abroad, and 230 cases in France. Henner has stepped up its verification of reimbursement claims, while the number of external alerts has increased, both of which have contributed to the increase. It is also worth noting that in line with the Solvency 2 directive and recommendations of the French Prudential Supervisory Authority (ACPR), the Henner Group has introduced measures to fight against money laundering and the funding of terrorism. 16 HENNER SAS, an insurance broker and administrator with capital of €8,212,500 Nanterre Company Register No. 323 377 739 intra-community VAT No. FR 48323377739 , ORIAS Insurance broker No. 07 002 039 Governed by the ACPR (Prudential and Resolution Control Authority) – ISO 9001 certified company by Bureau Veritas Certification Head offices located at 14 boulevard du Général Leclerc, 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine, France www.henner.com
