Two lines of business At Corbion we distinguish between two lines of business, each with a different set of characteristics: Biobased Ingredients and Biobased Innovations. These business units are supported companywide by globally managed R&D, operations, and business support functions. Biobased Ingredients The Biobased Ingredients business unit focuses on our core business: ingredients for Food and Biochemicals. Food We deliver distinctive emulsification, acidification, and fortification functionality; allowing our customers to produce affordable, convenient, safe, and better-for-you food and beverages. Our expertise in preservation allows our customers to keep food safe and fresh, while preventing food waste and extending shelf life. We are also helping our customers to meet consumer demands for foods with simpler ingredients and fewer additives. In no other industry is the word “local” more important than in food – where the look, feel, taste, and even smell of a product must be tailored to the demands of a specific demographic group. We also know that no customer and no market are the same. Whether the market is meat, bakery, beverage, confectionery, or dairy our global presence, supply chain, reach, and perspective allow us to think globally but act locally. Biochemicals Our biobased chemicals offer improved functional performance, production efficiency, and safety. Manufactured from renewable resources, and using the most advanced and resource efficient fermentation processes, they provide a sustainable alternative to fossil-based chemicals for customers operating across a wide spectrum of industries, including medical biomaterials, plastics, pharma, electronics, home and personal care, agriculture, coatings, adhesives, solvents, and animal health. We are constantly exploring opportunities to bring the benefits of our products and solutions to other industries. Biobased Innovations Our Biobased Innovations business unit creates new biotechnology business platforms. By using our own core technology, stand-alone or by combining it with our partners’ technologies, we will drive growth via a disciplined stage-gate investment approach. Our PLA (poly lactic acid) / lactide business is part of this business unit. Our high performance PLA resin can be used to make a degradable bioplastic for a wide range of applications, ranging from food packaging to touchscreen computers and durable automotive components. Biobased Innovations also comprises the succinic acid joint venture with BASF (Succinity), as well as our longer-term development projects such as FDCA, a potential replacement for purified terephthalic acid (PTA). 6 CORBION ANNUAL REPORT 2015 MESSAGE FROM THE CEO Message from the CEO Members of the Executive Committee Marc den Hartog, EVP Operations, Eddy van Rhede van der Kloot, CFO, Tjerk de Ruiter, CEO, Johan van der Hel, EVP Human Resources, Andy Muller, EVP Biobased Ingredients. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Message from the CEO 7 For Corbion, 2015 was all about the execution of our “Disciplined Value Creation” strategy, which we started to roll out end of October 2014. We are still in the early phases of implementing our of plant capacity in May 2015 and completing the strategy, but it has been encouraging to see how much pre-engineering for this plant. An important step for progress we have made in the past year. Corbion on the road to building a bioplastics business The “Disciplined Value Creation” strategy has a strong and becoming a PLA producer. At the same time focus on cash flows, returns on investments, and we successfully produced PLA out of alternative profitability. To enhance value creation we will use feedstocks using our gypsum-free lactic acid a differentiated management and capital allocation technology. It is exciting to see how much progress approach for our two business units Biobased we have made and how we succeed in leveraging our Ingredients and Biobased Innovations. It gives us a clear technology to produce succinic acid and hopefully in framework for making choices and decisions. the future other molecules like FDCA as well. In Biobased Ingredients one of the decisions was In 2015 we have added a sustainability framework to to strengthen the position of our Food business in our “Disciplined Value Creation” strategy.

Biobased Ingredients Strategic Biobased Innovations Strengthen the core choices Selective drive for growth Strengthen • Bakery & Meat North America • Chemicals, Pharma, Electronics Invest to defend our position • Poly lactic acid (PLA) • Meat South-East Asia & Brazil Grow • Succinic acid • Confectionery Invest for growth • Gypsum-free process • Medical Biomaterials • Alternative feedstock • Dairy • Beverages Explore • 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid • Animal health Invest selectively (FDCA) • Coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers (CASE) Biobased Ingredients: Strengthen the core Our Biobased Ingredients business is the core of our company. Our aim is to create sustainable value for our customers by supplying functional ingredients and safe performance chemicals building on our existing technology platforms, with profitable growth for Corbion. We will strengthen our core by focusing on our key customers within selected markets and target those markets through differentiated approaches. In 2015 we focused our efforts on addressing specific market needs using our core capabilities, which led to further insights into where we can grow with our value propositions and improve our productivity. We will continue to refine and improve service levels in our various customer segments with the focus on increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Food Our Food business segment follows a strategy aimed at reinforcing our leading market positions in Bakery (which includes Bread and Sweet Baked Goods) and Meat in North America, driving growth in segments such as Meat in emerging markets and Confectionery, and exploring selected opportunities in Dairy and Beverages. We will accomplish this by leveraging our core technologies (lactic acid, emulsifiers, functional blends) and capabilities in structural and antimicrobial control. In 2015 we successfully introduced new dough conditioning solutions for the Bakery segment and launched a series of clean label products for the North American Meat industry. The European patent we received for our unique coating technology applied in sugar confectionery, strengthens our position as an industry expert. Following the egg shortage in the US market due to the avian flu, we have expanded our egg replacer portfolio for Sweet Baked Goods combining market insight with our product and application know how. In response to new regulation by the US Food and Drug Administration we introduced our Ensemble Non-PHO emulsifier portfolio. In April we acquired the lactic acid business from Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) strengthening our position in the North American lactic acid market. This is a good example of how we strengthen our business with bolt-on acquisitions. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our strategy 11 Biochemicals In Biochemicals we focus on enhancing customer value and loyalty in markets we actively select. In Chemicals, Electronics, Home and Personal Care, and Pharmaceuticals we aim to strengthen our positions in specific actives and solvents. We obtained supplier status under the Biocidal Products Regulation for our Spanish plant, thus strengthening our position in Home and Personal Care. With two plants now approved (Spain and the Netherlands) we can meet the growing needs from our home and personal care customers for natural solutions. We intend to further grow our presence in Medical Biomaterials, especially in orthopedic and drug delivery applications through our specialty polymers. The start-up of our new factory in Tucker, GA, US and the joint venture with MedinCell for the supply of PEG (polyethylene glycol) and PLA (poly lactic acid) based co-polymers in the field of controlled release drug delivery will further enhance our position in Medical Biomaterials. We are exploring opportunities in CASE (coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers) where we, in cooperation with Perstorp have developed a co-polymer based on our lactide technology that delivers superior benefits in adhesives, on top of reducing the carbon footprint and increasing the biobased content and product safety. Next to that we have strengthened our position in the Asian Pharma market through the acquisition of the Malladi lactic acid business in India, which creates a new platform for growth in the region. Productivity improvement program “Streamline” In order to deliver structural productivity improvements in all our processes, we have initiated the “Streamline” program to align the organization with the portfolio choices, simplify our business processes, optimize our manufacturing footprint, and drive competence development in commerce (enhanced customer loyalty), operations (world-class operations), innovation (accelerated innovation), and people (leadership and engagement). In all of these areas we have conducted projects in 2015, including the implementation of CRM, the optimization of our sales and operations planning, the alignment of our innovation programs with customer opportunities, and the set-up of talent review and succession planning programs. The majority of the targeted € 20 million in savings from our productivity improvement program have been achieved in 2015, rather than in 2016, which underscores our focus on execution and our disciplined approach. The consolidation of our two US powder plants (integration of Kansas Avenue into our Totowa plant) is still underway and will be completed in 2016. Biobased Innovations: Selective drive for growth Our Biobased Innovations business unit builds new biotechnology business platforms, using our capabilities in fermentation and downstream processing and our in-depth knowledge of the lactic acid molecule. We have a portfolio of large growth opportunities which require high investments, the exact timing of which is difficult to predict. In this business unit we will drive growth via a disciplined capital investment approach, de-risking via upfront commercial commitments, market development, and/or partnering, and a strict stage-gate process. As part of our strategy we are making the next step in the bioplastics value chain by becoming a PLA producer. In May 2015, we secured upfront customer commitment by signed letters of intent for one-third of the volume of a 75 kTpa PLA polymerization plant. Meanwhile, we have tested, validated, and started to sell pre-marketing volumes of PLA. Making these pre-marketing resins available will accelerate market acceptance of PLA and will allow Corbion to get deeper insight into the various product-market combinations. The pre-engineering for this plant has been completed and market needs and required technology are confirmed. We have entered the basic-engineering phase and expect to start the construction later in 2016, with a target start up in 2018. 12 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our strategy To ensure a long-term sustainable lactic acid technology we completed the demonstration phase of our gypsum-free process in the past year. This has given us the confidence that this process will work on an industrial scale and has provided us with new insights into how to further reduce the operating cost of the process. In 2015 we also succeeded in producing high-grade lactic acid from alternative feedstocks as a basis for PLA resin. Alternative or second-generation feedstocks are lignocellulosic biomass or woody crops, agricultural residues, or waste, such as bagasse, corn stover, and wheat straw. Corbion is the first company in the world to have made PLA from alternative feedstocks, optimizing the lactic acid fermentation process to fit the special characteristics of the biomass. In the future, these alternative feedstocks can have a major impact on the biochemical and bioplastics industries and, combined with our gypsum-free technology bring us a step closer to produce organic acids with superior resource and land use efficiency. We have developed a proprietary process to produce 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from renewable resources. In 2015 we demonstrated our capability to produce the polymer PEF, based on FDCA. We have also proven the excellent barrier properties of the derived polymer compared to PET. In 2016 we are scaling up the FDCA process at pilot scale as next step in our development process. Together with BASF, Corbion operates the joint venture Succinity for the production and sales of biobased succinic acid. In 2014, the proprietary process for the production of biobased succinic acid was demonstrated. For 2015 two major goals were set: further optimizing the current process and producing sufficient quantities of succinic acid to meet customer demand. Both targets have been met. The main focus in the coming period will be the further development of the technology and ensuring the availability of cost-competitive biobased succinic acid in line with market growth. Improved financial performance Our “Disciplined Value Creation” strategy is starting to pay off, resulting in an overall better financial performance in 2015. Our business unit Biobased Ingredients showed full-year sales growth at the upper end of the guidance range of 2-4%. The Food business segment ended up above the guidance range of 1-3% for the full year. In business segment Biochemicals, due to the more difficult comparison and a significant reduction in feed acidifiers, we ended up below the guidance range of 5-8%. In Biobased Innovations our disciplined stage gate approach and good sales development of our PLA/lactide portfolio kept the EBITDA loss well below our projected maximum.

CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance 17 Results Net sales Net sales in 2015 increased by 19.2% to € 918.3 million (2014: € 770.1 million) driven by currencies (13.5%), organic growth (4.6%), and acquisitions (1.1%). Exchange rate movements impacted the sales figures positively by € 104.0 million, mainly driven by a stronger US dollar. The acquisition impact is related to our acquisition of the Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) lactic acid business, effective as of 31 March 2015. Organic growth in the Biobased Ingredients business unit of 3.3% was for a large part driven by the Food business segment. In Food, volume growth was the main driver of the 3.7% organic growth. In the Biochemicals business segment, price/mix increased by 2.6% due to growing Medical Biomaterials sales and a lower contribution of feed acidifiers. Volume growth in Biochemicals was negative, due to a decrease in feed acidifiers and petrochemical-related segments. Growth in Biobased Innovations was mostly driven by lactide and PLA sales.

Fixed costs were negatively impacted by absorption impact, higher variable incentive compensation, and currency effects. Raw materials Compared to 2014, carbohydrates made up a smaller percentage of our overall raw material spend in 2015 due to reducing sugar and corn prices. The price of soy bean oil was lower than in 2014, resulting in a lower fats and oils percentage of net sales. The increase in percentage in other raw materials is mainly caused by higher egg and folic acid prices.

Biobased Ingredients saw its EBITDA increase by 27.9% driven by currencies and organic growth (due to volume growth and positive price/mix effect). “Streamline” contributed € 15.0 million to the EBITDA growth. The EBITDA increase in Biobased Innovations was mainly driven by higher sales.

Bakery sales (52% of Food sales) increased as a small recovery in volumes was supported by price increases following an increase in raw material prices (e.g. egg powder and folic acid). This performance was in line with the North American bakery market, which increased slightly in 2015. The final stage of our “Streamline” program, the consolidation of our powder blending plants in Kansas and New Jersey, has not been completed yet. The consolidated production volumes in the New Jersey plant have not been at a satisfactory level yet, requiring us to postpone the closure of the Kansas plant until later into 2016. However, in line with guidance, we do not 20 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance expect this to impact the realization of the € 20 million “Streamline” savings on a run-rate basis before year-end. Meat sales (24% of Food sales) increased significantly in 2015 with growth being supported by all regions. North America, responsible for more than half of Meat sales, performed better than initially expected as customer switching to low-cost-in-use (LCiU) solutions, which has a negative impact on volumes sold, was limited. Growth in emerging markets, most notably Latin America, was strong. In Beverages, Confectionery, and Dairy (combined 24% of Food sales), growth in 2015 was slightly negative mainly as a result of difficult market conditions and the adverse impact of the incident at the Grandview production site.

Medical Biomaterials, Pharma, and Electronics continued to perform well over the year. Central costs Millions of euros 2015 2014 EBITDA (19.7) (24.4) EBITDA excluding one-off items (19.7) (22.5) Central costs improved versus last year, partly due to “Streamline” benefits.

In order to further accelerate market adoption of PLA, we have begun to test, validate, and sell pre-marketing volumes of PLA. In May 2015 we reached an important milestone for the construction of a new 75 kTpa plant, having secured upfront customer commitment for at least one-third of plant capacity. Early 2016 we CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance 21 also successfully concluded the pre-engineering phase of the project. Subsequently we decided to proceed with the PLA investment in Thailand. The lower EBITDA loss in 2015 compared to last year was mostly due to the strong organic sales growth in lactide/PLA, particularly in high-valueadd, high-heat-stable applications. R&D expenses in Biobased Innovations increased in 2015 compared to 2014, the incremental spending having been mostly allocated to PLA. Depreciation and amortization Depreciation and amortization amounted to € 45.9 million (2014: € 44.1 million). Operating result Operating result excluding one-off items increased by € 39.0 million, or 60.0%, to € 104.5 million in 2015 (2014: € 65.5 million). One-off items One-off items in 2015 were a positive amount of € 4.1 million in operating result, most of which was related to the incident at the Grandview production site in March 2015. One-off gains exceeded one-off costs as the included insurance proceeds are recognized in the income statement, rather than being capitalized as to the related capital expenditures. Financial income and charges Net financial charges decreased by € 3.6 million to € 5.8 million in 2015 as 2014 included an impairment of an equity investment. Taxes The tax charge on our operations in 2015 amounted to € 22.0 million (21.6% of profit before tax). Excluding one-off items, the effective tax rate would have been 24.1%. Going forward, an effective tax rate in the range of 25-30% is expected. Statement of financial position Capital employed including goodwill increased, compared to year-end 2014, by € 47 million to € 549.9 million at year-end 2015. The movements in 2015 were: Millions of euros Capital expenditure on (in)tangible fixed assets 67.5 Depreciation / amortization / impairment of (in)tangible fixed assets -47.6 Disposal of fixed assets -5.4 Change in operating working capital -1.0 Change in provisions and other working capital 19.5 Tax positions -0.8 Exchange rate differences 15.5 Other -0.7 Total movement in capital employed including goodwill 47.0 Major capital expenditure projects in 2015 were the investments in the production line reconstruction after the Grandview incident, the construction of an acid powder production line, investments in our US emulsifiers plant to eliminate partially hydrogenated oils from our products, and investments in our Totowa plant to facilitate the consolidation of our Kansas plant production. Operating working capital increased by € 7.5 million to € 160.2 million. This increase is due to a currency effect of € 8.5 million. Excluding this currency effect, operating working capital would have decreased by € 1.0 million. 22 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance Shareholders’ equity decreased by € 20.9 million to € 487.8 million. The movements were: • The positive result after taxes of € 80.2 million. • A decrease of € 50.0 million related to the share buyback. • A decrease of € 58.4 million related to the dividend for financial year 2014 and the extraordinary cash dividend. • Positive exchange rate differences of € 9.0 million due to the translation of equity denominated in currencies other than the euro. • Share-based remuneration costs charged to the result of € 1.2 million. • Positive movement of € 2.9 million in the hedge reserve. • Negative effects of defined benefit plan and tax effects of € 5.8 million. At year-end 2015 the ratio between statement of financial position total and equity was 1:0.6 (year-end 2014: 1:0.6). Cash flow/financing Cash flow from operating activities increased versus 2014 by € 43.5 million to € 110.3 million. This is the balance of the higher operational cash flow before movements in working capital of € 60.7 million, a negative impact of the movement in working capital and provisions of € 1.9 million, and higher taxes and interest paid of € 15.3 million. Cash flow from investment activities decreased versus 2014 by € 18.9 million to € 55.1 million. Capital expenditures accounted for most (€ 60.1 million) of this cash outflow, partly compensated by cash inflow from divestment of tangible fixed assets. Free cash flow defined as cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from investment activities increased by € 62.4 million to € 55.2 million. The net debt position at the end of 2015 was € 62.1 million, an increase of € 67.9 million compared to year-end 2014 € 5.8 million net cash position, mainly due to capital expenditures, the extraordinary cash dividend payout and the share buyback, partly compensated by the positive cash flow from operating activities. At the end of 2015, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA was 0.4x (end of 2014: -0.1x). The interest cover for 2015 was 25.5x (end of 2014: 23.8x). We continue to stay well within the limits of our financing covenants. Reservation and dividend policy Corbion’s reservation policy is aimed at creating and retaining sufficient financial capacity and flexibility to realize our strategic objectives while maintaining healthy balance sheet ratios. Corbion intends to add or charge the profit or loss to the company reserves after payment of the statutory dividend on financing preference shares and after deduction of the proposed dividend on common shares. Events such as financing requirements, acquisitions, divestments, reorganizations, or other strategic considerations can lead to adjustments in the reservation and the reservation policy. As regards Corbion’s dividend policy, the amount of dividend on common shares and the type of dividend that the company will pay to its shareholders depend on the financial results of the company, the market environment, the outlook, and other relevant factors. The current dividend policy is to pay out 35-45% of net profit adjusted for one-off items. Periodically Corbion will review its debt position in relation to the investment plans, and decide upon potential further distributions. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance 23 Dividend and share buyback proposal Upon adoption of the financial statements, holders of financing preference shares will receive the statutory dividend. A proposal to distribute a regular dividend of € 0.43 per common share will be submitted for approval to the General Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on 12 May 2016. This is 35% of our net profit excluding one-off items. Shareholders will receive this dividend, charged to the Corbion reserves, in cash. In addition to the regular dividend on common shares, € 25 million is proposed to be distributed as an additional cash dividend of € 0.42 per common share, at the same time as the regular dividend. The proposed additional dividend on common shares will also be submitted for approval to the General Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on 12 May 2016. Corbion also plans to distribute € 50 million to shareholders in 2016 through a share buyback program to be commenced in March 2016 and to be completed before the end of 2016. Outlook 2016 We remain confident about our indicated 2015-2018 guidance range. Even though market conditions could become more difficult in 2016, our global exposure is geared towards mature markets, which should dampen the impact of a slowdown. For the Food business segment we expect a continued steady sales growth pattern, while the Biochemicals business segment is expected to show improved sales growth from the second quarter onwards. We expect our “Streamline” program to reach its target annual savings level of € 20 million on a run-rate basis before the end of 2016. Volatility in Biobased Innovations EBITDA will remain high due to irregular product and sales order patterns and spend phasing of our major innovation initiatives. 24 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance Sustainability performance Employee engagement Strategies and structures do not work…. People do! Therefore we want to create an excellent place to work, where our employees can unleash their potential, passion, pride, and talent to drive sustainable growth for Corbion. We do this by supporting our people in the best way possible guided by the following principles: • Attract, deploy, and develop people on the basis of the talent and leadership required for current and future jobs. • Encourage and support opportunities for further business and personal growth, and offer challenging career opportunities. • Reward performance using an international-market-competitive remuneration framework. • Provide a working environment where our engaged workforce can unleash their potential, passion, pride, and talent. The updated strategy called for a redesign of our organizational model and a further simplification of the structures to increase effectiveness and accountability. In line with this we streamlined our organization, resulting in the loss of some 200 jobs across the company equaling more than 10% of the existing workforce. This streamlining process entailed considerable changes for all our employees in ways of working and reporting lines. Strong engaging leadership guidance and support has been crucial for our transition. To support this transition we have introduced a new performance management system and fully embedded the regular review and succession planning of talent throughout the business. We have defined four key Corbion behaviors (set clear direction, make the difference, focus on customers, and deliver through teamwork) to support us in enhancing engagement and empowerment. A key success factor will be the achievement of the right level of engagement of all employees and the creation of a culture focused on execution and innovation. An annual cycle has been launched comprising an engagement survey, action planning and survey based “pulse checks”. In 2015 a first survey has taken place with a staff response rate of 80%. Early 2016, we will be conducting a second survey, giving a first indication of the progress made so far and setting the course and direction of our engagement effort for the rest of the year. Responsible sourcing A significant part of the environmental and social impact in our value chain is upstream of our own operations. To safeguard an overall positive environmental and social impact of our biobased products, we therefore need to ensure our supply chain is sourced in a responsible way. In 2015 we aligned our responsible sourcing strategy with the updated Corbion strategy. We will tackle our raw materials with the largest business impact and the highest sustainability risks first. Based on a risk assessment, we have determined the following priority crops: sugar cane, soy, corn, wheat, and palm. Together these crops represent about 90% of our agriculturalderived raw materials by quantity. We have defined generic mandatory requirements for all of our raw materials, as specified in our supplier code. We have updated our supplier code this year and are now requesting our suppliers to sign it for confirmation. We are currently working on the integration of sustainability criteria into our supplier risk assessment, and will include sustainability criteria in the evaluation of new suppliers from 2016 onwards. Our target for 2016 is to develop specific policies for our priority raw materials, which will focus on continuous improvement towards the implementation of the relevant sustainability standard for each of these raw materials such as Bonsucro (for sugar cane) and RSPO (for palm oil). CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance 25 Resource-efficient operations We want to produce our products in the most efficient way possible. Minimizing the use of raw materials and energy has always been a priority, both from environmental and cost perspective. In our more than 80 years history, we have continuously improved our yield and reduced our use of energy, and we will continue to do so. Our new “Zero waste” ambition focuses on the reduction of waste by closing resource loops and on the valorization of all our by-products, to maximize the value that we generate from the resources that we consume. This ambition contributes to the shift from a linear economy, based on a “take-make-dispose” system to a circular economy that is waste-free and regenerative by design. Our resource-efficiency KPIs measure the performance of all of our operations on energy usage, water consumption, waste generation, and emissions. All of our sites focus on continuous improvement of these KPIs and each year, specific improvement projects are carried out. Energy • Our energy usage per ton of production decreased significantly (7%) to 5.33 GJ/T. Overall energy usage decreased only slightly to 2.58 GJx10^6, due to an increased production volume. • At our site in Montmeló (Spain), we carried out a project to increase the efficiency of the boilers, resulting in a significant reduction in the consumption of natural gas. • Our new research center in the Netherlands (Gorinchem) is partially powered by solar cells installed on the roof. Emissions We report our emissions in carbon equivalents from cradle to gate in accordance with the Green House Gas Protocol. This includes scope I emissions from direct production (for natural gas and fuel oil), scope II emissions from purchased energy (for electricity and purchased steam), and scope III emissions related to purchased goods and services, fuel and energy-related activities, upstream transportation, business travel, capital goods, and employee commuting. • Total scope I emissions per ton of production decreased by 7% to 0.19 T CO2 equiv /T. Overall scope I emissions remained stable at 92 kT CO2 equiv. • Total scope II emissions per ton of production decreased by 9% to 0.18 T CO2 equiv /T. Overall scope II emissions decreased to 89 kT CO2 equiv. • Total scope III emissions per ton of production decreased by 4% to 1.17 T CO2 equiv /T. Overall scope III emissions increased to 565 kT CO2 equiv., due to the increased production volume in 2015. Water • Our water consumption per ton of production increased by 3% to 0.92 m3x10^3/T. Overall water consumption increased to 448 m3x10^3. This increase is due to the increased use of our gypsum-free demonstration plant in Gorinchem, which is not yet optimized for water usage. • We have significantly reduced the use of both municipal and ground water at our site in Montmeló (Spain). Waste • Total waste generated per ton of production remained stable at 0.034 T/T. Overall waste production increased to 16.5 kT, due to an increased production volume. • Hazardous waste per ton of production increased to 0.0015 T/T. Overall hazardous waste increased to 0.73 kT. This increase is due to the increased use of our gypsum-free demonstration plant in Gorinchem. Due to inefficiencies during testing and its batch-wise operation, this demonstration plant generates a small amount of hazardous waste. • The recycling program at our site in East-Rutherford, which was started in 2013, resulted in a 69% reduction in waste sent to landfill. This was achieved by the implementation of cardboard recycling and by re-use of scrap waste for feed production. 26 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance By-products In our manufacturing processes, we generate several side streams to remove impurities and obtain a high-quality product. Many of these side streams contain valuable components and we have been able to find outlets for most of them. An example is gypsum, a by-product in our lactic acid production process. Gypsum has many industrial applications, amongst others, in building and construction, as mineral filler, as oxidizing agent, and in agriculture. A significant amount of the gypsum that we produce is used in agricultural applications and in the cement industry, replacing the use of mined, virgin gypsum. • Overall generation of by-products remained stable at 402 kT. • Total landfilled by-product increased to 211 kT. Due to quality issues, not all of our gypsum could be re-used, and had to be sent to landfill instead. • In 2016, process adjustments to improve gypsum quality will be tested in a pilot trial.

CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance 27 Sustainable solutions It is our ambition to provide our customers with performance solutions based on renewable resources that enable them to reduce their environmental impact. Corbion’s products for the Food and Biochemical industries provide our customers not only with functional, but also sustainability benefits. Our solutions for shelf-life extension can optimize distribution and reduce food waste, both resulting in a reduction of related greenhouse gas emissions. Our PLA bioplastics are 100% biobased, with a low carbon footprint and are more resource efficient through low carbohydrate usage In 2015 we have identified the success factors that are critical to realizing this ambition. Insight into the environmental impact of our solutions is obviously a pre-requisite, and we assess this as part of our innovation process. This year, we have performed qualitative assessments for all product and process development projects that entered our innovation funnel. Quantitative assessments, including a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), have been performed for a number of specific projects and are typically done at a later stage in the funnel, when the product and process design is fixed and more detailed information is available. This information is also shared with potential customers, for instance to show them how our solutions can help them to reduce their carbon footprint. In 2016 we will extend our sustainability assessment to application development, while continuing assessments of our existing commercial products. Sustainability foundations To realize our sustainability ambitions, a strong foundation is required, which we have built over many years. Health and safety, human rights, quality and product safety, and customer satisfaction are qualifiers of our business. Health and safety We are committed to providing a safe work environment for our employees and other stakeholders. First and foremost, all of Corbion’s facilities comply with the applicable laws and regulations in the countries and communities where we operate. Because of the importance of our employees’ wellbeing, we have adopted two Corbion safety tenants: • Every employee returns home each and every day injury free. • No job is so urgent or important it cannot be done safely. We believe in a “Zero (accidents) is Possible” culture and at the work place we strive to minimize “At-Risk” behaviors and ensure adherence to all safety policies and procedures. Despite our efforts, we have experienced a significant incident with the explosion in our US Grandview manufacturing facility on 11 March 2015, due to which three employees were taken to the hospital. Our LTI or Lost Time Injury rate per 200,000 hours worked has as a result turned out at 1.9 compared to 0.5 in 2014. The LDR or Lost Day Rate rose from 12 to 56.8. Our employee absentee rate was 1.8% overall compared to 1.9% in 2014. We record and investigate all incidents, including those with contractors, by determining the root cause and implementing prevention measures. We deploy Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS) management systems, such as ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. Human rights We support the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the key conventions of the International Labor Organization. We are a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact and integrate these principles into our business activities. Our Code of Business Conduct covers amongst others child and forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association. All our sites are assessed through Sedex and regularly audited (Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit). Through our supplier code, we expect our suppliers to respect human rights in their operations. 28 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our performance Quality We are committed to delivering quality solutions that safely meet our customer expectations and fulfilling our customer promise through quality and manufacturing systems and processes. In 2015 the main actions included: • Ensuring compliance and certifications to meet our customer needs and benchmarking ourselves against industry-adopted standards: ISO 9001, GFSI (BRC, FSCC22000), GMP+, GMP Pharma, FDA Pharma, Halal, Kosher, non GMO. All these certifications are present at Corbion. Depending on which markets a given site is supplying, a different set of certifications is applied to meet customer requirements. In all cases these certifications have been obtained. These certifications imply many customer audits mainly by our pharmaceutical customers and our large food clients. In all cases the observations made during the audits were followed up. • Enforcing a qualitative and swift feedback loop to customer complaints. In our customer complaint process, we have embedded the following agreements (against which we measure ourselves): Reaction to any customer complaint within 2 working days (acknowledgement of receipt) Effectuation of a root cause analysis within 14 working days for all complaints Root cause analysis report to the customer and corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) put in place within 28 working days. We have been able to meet these timelines in most cases for products made in house. However, for the part of our production which is outsourced, the extra step in the process makes it challenging to meet these timelines. In 2015, the main quality defect still related to transport delays and damages. Our internal quality systems and quality control have been successful in that deliveries of products out of specifications have been an absolute rarity in 2015. Delivery To successfully accomplish the delivery of our solutions and services to our customers and meet their needs, we operate from a demand-driven perspective. The measure of our success is our ability to deliver the “perfect order” to the customer. We measure on-time in-full (OTIF) order shipment as a performance indicator for customer satisfaction. In 2015 we have seen a decrease in our OTIF to 93.8% (2014: 98.6%), largely due to the incident in our Grandview facility. Our first time right (FTR) metric was at 99.6% in 2015. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance 29 Our governance Corporate governance Corbion recognizes the importance of good corporate governance and the principles contained within the Dutch corporate governance code (the “Code”), namely, that a company is a long-term partnership between various parties related to the company. Our management bears overall responsibility for balancing the interests of these parties, mostly with the aim of ensuring continuity of the company. At the same time, Corbion aims to create long-term value for its shareholders. Corbion is committed to embedding the Code principles within the company, thereby abiding by the core concepts of good business practices, integrity, openness, and transparent and well-supervised management. The full text of the Code can be viewed at: www.commissiecorporategovernance.nl. Compliance with the Code With the exception of the deviations outlined in the paragraphs below, Corbion endorses and adheres to the principles and best practices of the Code. Important changes in the corporate governance structure are presented to the General Shareholders’ Meeting for discussion. Our corporate governance policy, including the relevant regulations and reports, can be consulted on the Corbion website. Deviations from the Code Corbion departs from the provisions of the Code with regard to the possible financing of income tax on vested shares under the share plan by selling part of the vested shares. With respect to best practice provision II.2.5 of the Code, Corbion applies share ownership requirements instead of holding restrictions. The Supervisory Board believes that a mandatory share ownership leads to a more sustainable build-up and alignment of the interests of the Board members and the shareholders. As long as a member of the Board of Management does not comply with the share ownership requirements, vested shares received under share plans will be kept in a restricted account and cannot be traded. Regarding its composition, the Supervisory Board always tries to strike the right balance between expertise and experience. A certain degree of age and gender variation may be instrumental in achieving the desired balance in the composition of the Board. In this respect, the profile of Corbion’s Supervisory Board deviates from best practice provision III.3.1 of the Code. The required expertise and experience, as well as the availability of the right candidates, are decisive when proposing candidates for (re)appointment. Corbion pays close attention to diversity including gender diversity in the profiles of new Board of Management and Supervisory Board members in accordance with Section 2:166 Subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, it currently does not strictly follow the recommendation for an explicit target on gender diversity and has not formulated concrete targets in this respect. There are two other aspects in which Corbion departs from the Code. The members of the Supervisory Board and the Board of Management are appointed by the General Shareholders’ Meeting on the basis of nominations by the Supervisory Board. The Corbion Articles of 30 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance Association state that the General Shareholders’ Meeting can overrule any such nomination by an absolute majority of the votes cast, provided the said majority represents at least one third of the issued capital. In contrast with the Code, no second meeting will be convened if there is no quorum, as a second meeting is not required by law. The General Shareholders’ Meeting may decide to suspend or dismiss a member of the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board by an absolute majority of the votes cast, provided the said majority represents at least one third of the issued capital. This quorum requirement does not apply if the proposal for suspension or dismissal is submitted by the Supervisory Board. In contrast with the Code, no second meeting will be convened if there is no quorum, as a second meeting is not required by law. Corporate governance statement The information and statement pursuant to the Decree to determine additional regulations regarding the content of the Report of the Board of Management (Vaststellingsbesluit nadere voorschriften inhoud bestuursverslag), have been published on Corbion’s website, www.corbion.com (Investor Relations, Corporate Governance). Structure Corbion nv is an international holding company as described by Section 153, Subsection 3 under b, of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The “large company” regime therefore does not apply to Corbion nv. Corporate governance relates to the management and supervision of the company, accountability, and the influence of stakeholders on decision-making. The Board of Management is entrusted with the management of the company. As per 1 January 2015, certain key officers have been appointed to manage the company together with the Board of Management. The members of the Board of Management and these key officers together constitute the Executive Committee. Under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer, the members of the Executive Committee share responsibility for developing objectives and the strategy, determining the risk profile, and implementing strategic and operational policies. The Board of Management has ultimate responsibility for the company’s management and the external reporting and is answerable to shareholders of the company at the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting. The independent Supervisory Board oversees and advises the Board of Management. From among its members, the Supervisory Board has appointed an Audit Committee, a Nomination Committee, a Remuneration Committee, and a Science and Technology Committee. The Board of Management fulfills its duties by promoting the interests of Corbion and its businesses. These interests are understood as the interests of all stakeholders, including customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers, and business and financial partners. Corbion is aware of its corporate and social responsibilities and is deeply committed to protecting the interests of the community. Corbion works on the principle that corporate management should consistently develop and implement corporate policies taking into account the long-term and continuity perspective. Corbion endorses the importance of clear accountability for its policies and the results thereof. Common shares in Corbion are listed on the Euronext Stock Exchange in Amsterdam. The financing preference shares are not listed. No restrictions apply to the transfer of shares. If a shareholder or group of shareholders acquires 30% or more of the share capital, the said shareholder or group of shareholders is required by law to make an offer for the entire outstanding capital. Shareholders have voting rights in proportion to the number of shares held. The annual General Shareholders’ Meeting will be held within six months of the close of the CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance 31 financial year. At this meeting, the Report of the Board of Management and Financial statements drawn up by the Board of Management will be presented for adoption, amongst other things. If requests are received from shareholders who individually or collectively represent at least 1% of the issued capital to place items on the General Shareholders’ Meeting agenda, these will be honored provided they are submitted to Corbion at least 45 days prior to the date of the meeting. Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meetings will be held as often as the Board of Management and Supervisory Board deem necessary. An Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting will also be held if one or more shareholders who collectively represent at least 10% of the issued capital submit a written request to this effect to the Board of Management or the Supervisory Board enclosing a detailed list of agenda items. If neither the Board of Management nor the Supervisory Board – which have equal powers in this matter – respond in such a way that this Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting can be convened within six weeks of the request, the applicants are at liberty to convene the meeting themselves and appoint a Chairman. With the exception of cases in which a larger majority is required by law or the Articles of Association, decisions at the General Shareholders’ Meeting will be taken by an absolute majority of the votes cast. Decisions to amend the Articles of Association and/or dissolve the company may only be taken at a General Shareholders’ Meeting in which at least two-thirds of the issued capital is represented and by a majority of at least three-quarters of the votes cast, unless the proposal has been submitted by all incumbent members of the Board of Management with the collective approval of all incumbent members of the Supervisory Board, in which case the decision may be taken by an absolute majority of votes, regardless of the represented capital. Risk management Risk management and internal control Corbion, with its worldwide operations in various markets and jurisdictions, needs to ensure a timely identification and effective management of all significant risks inherent to the execution of its strategy and realization of its objectives. Corbion is committed to the preservation of its reputation, assets, competitive edge, and profits through enterprise-wide risk management (ERM). ERM is the process of systematically identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and treating risks that may impact the achievement of corporate objectives. The Board of Management is responsible for the design, implementation, and operation of Corbion’s risk management and internal control system. We have defined a governance model that identifies clear reporting and accountability structures in line with the Dutch corporate governance code. Risk appetite Our risk appetite is the amount of risk we are willing to accept to achieve our strategic goals. This requires adequate risk understanding and awareness and insight in their magnitude within the company. The level of risk appetite is set by the Board of Management. For areas that are close to or exceeding our risk appetite, involvement of both senior management and Board of Management will be required. Our risk appetite can be summarized as follows: Risk category Risk appetite Strategic/market risk Moderate to high: balancing risks and rewards to achieve our growth, innovation, and sustainability objectives Operational risk Low: safety issues Moderate: other areas with a focus on improving operational and functional excellence 32 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance Risk category Risk appetite Financial/compliance risk Low: full compliance with legal and regulatory reporting (including financial reporting) The impact on EBITDA in millions of euros of a 1% change in net sales, costs, profit, and currency changes and is reflected as follows: Change Approx. EBITDA impact (Millions of euros) Net sales +1% / 1% +/4.0 Gross profit +1% / -1% +/3.0 Operating costs (= Selling expenses + R&D costs + G&A expenses) +1% / -1% +/1.5 USD +1% / -1% +/1.0 YEN +1% / -1% +/0.2 Risk management approach Our approach to risk management aims to achieve a reasonable level of assurance, in line with the Enterprise Risk Management framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO – ERM). Our approach aims to embed risk awareness and risk management at all levels of Corbion to ensure risk decisions are taken and evaluated consciously and properly. Our risk management approach covers strategic/market, operational, and financial/compliance risks, which can be illustrated as follows: Global control framework Strategic/Market Operational Financial/Compliance Entity-wide controls To embed risk awareness, constant management attention and communication coupled with risk management workshops are essential to identify critical risks for all our business activities. Awareness, identification of risks, and action plans to mitigate these risks are at the heart of our risk management program. The progress in risk mitigation is discussed on an ongoing basis between business management and Board of Management. Key risk areas Below a summary is provided of the main risks that have been identified for Corbion, including possible impact and mitigation measures taken to address them. We make a distinction between Corbion-specific risks and risks of a more generic nature, which are also applicable to Corbion. There may be other risks which are currently unknown to Corbion, or currently believed not to be material, but which could ultimately have a major impact on Corbion’s business, objectives, revenues, income, assets, liquidity, or capital resources. For more information related to credit, liquidity, and cash flow risks see Note 24 of the financial statements.

Various examples of policies and procedures can be found below. The entity-wide controls are not limited to those outlined in this section. Legal and regulatory review Local management is responsible for compliance with laws and regulations. The Legal Department is consulted by local management on an ongoing basis. Every six months, local management reports the main open legal issues exceeding € 100,000 to Corporate Legal and Corporate Finance. Letter of Representation Every six months, managing directors and finance directors of each reporting entity or, where applicable, other senior staff, provide a Letter of Representation to the Board of Management. This letter represents compliance with financial reporting and internal controls. Business Conduct Program Guided by the principles of the UN Global Compact and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, our Code of Business Conduct describes principles with respect to personal and business conduct, asset protection, employment standards, and environmental protection and sets out the expected standard of behavior of all Corbion employees. This Code serves as an umbrella for underlying policies which cover in more detail areas such as competition law, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, and insider trading. Corbion has a network of regional Business Conduct Coordinators who support embedding of the Code of Business Conduct and the underlying policies in the local operations. Besides this, they function as a local point of contact for management and staff. All Corbion employees need to follow annually a mandatory training (either through e-learning or class room training) with respect to the Code of Business Conduct. A breach of the Code of Business Conduct can lead to disciplinary actions, including termination of employment. Under the Corbion Speak Up Policy, Corbion employees are able to report (potential) violations of the Code of Business Conduct to their manager or a Business Conduct Coordinator. Next to that, the Corbion Speak Up Line, which is available 24/7 and operated by an independent service provider, allows employees to report issues anonymously. In 2015, four complaints with respect to the Code of Business Conduct were reported. Appropriate measures have been taken by management. Tax principles Corbion considers paying taxes an important part of our corporate social responsibility. Based on this, and derived from our Code of Business Conduct as part of our corporate governance structure, we have adopted the following tax principles. These tax principles deal with all different types of taxes which we are obliged to report and pay in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including taxes on profits, value added taxes, wage taxes, duties, and various other taxes. Business rationale/transfer pricing Corbion’s tax strategy follows from and is aligned with the business strategy and objectives. Consequently, we aim to pay the appropriate amount of tax depending on where value is created CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance 37 in each of the jurisdictions we operate in, following the normal course of commercial activity, and in accordance with domestic and international rules and standards. All our intercompany transfer pricing and policies are based on the “arm’s length principle”. Compliance We act at all times in accordance with all applicable laws in which we are guided by the relevant local and international standards. Compliance is monitored within a global tax control framework. Corbion complies with its statutory obligations and aims to file all required tax-relevant information with the appropriate tax authorities in a timely, transparent, and complete manner. Tax-related disclosures are made in accordance with the relevant domestic regulations, as well as applicable reporting requirements under IFRS. Relationship with tax authorities We seek to develop mutually respectful relationships with the various national tax authorities based on trust and transparency. To accomplish this we aim for an open and constructive dialog with the various tax authorities on the basis of disclosure of all relevant facts and circumstances. In the Netherlands we concluded a so-called tax covenant (“horizontal monitoring”) with the Dutch tax authorities. Such covenant entails that the tax authorities can rely on Corbion to provide upfront disclosure of all relevant information, while it allows Corbion to get upfront confirmation of applicable tax treatment. Tax governance Within the governance framework, the conduct of the group’s tax affairs and the management of tax risks are delegated to Corbion’s tax department with support and assistance from the corporate and local finance departments. The Audit Committee supervises the activities of the Board of Management with respect to the tax governance framework. Global control framework Business planning, budgeting, and management review Based on Corbion’s strategy and plans, targets are set for the annual budget. After determining the budgets, targets are rolled out to the responsibility areas (business units, operations, etc.) within Corbion. Quarterly updated estimates are made based on a forecast until the end of the year. Forecasts are specifically discussed between responsibility area leaders and the Board of Management. The Board of Management monitors business performance on a monthly and quarterly basis using a defined set of key performance indicators and reviews of actual results versus budgets, quarterly estimates, and the previous year. Local operating companies are visited frequently. Operational management meets at least once a month to discuss the strategy and related risks, the actual performance versus budget, and other significant matters in their respective areas. Financial control framework As Corbion operates worldwide, it is committed to maintaining high-quality, reliable financial reporting, and a good control environment. All reporting entities assess operational effectiveness of their financial closing and reporting processes, at mid-year and end-of-year, confirming compliance with the relevant guidelines and IFRS. Together with the Letters of Representation, this ensures the integrity of our financial reporting. During 2015 our main entities performed an assessment of the effectiveness of their key financial process controls. The assessments have been audited by internal audit and used as a starting point by external auditors. Improvement recommendations based on audit findings are followed up by local management, the status of which is being monitored regularly by the Board of Management. 38 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance Insurance Insurance is an integral part of our risk management approach as it is an instrument to manage the financial consequences of certain specific risks. The choice to obtain external insurance cover depends on the cost efficiency of the instrument. The coverage of insurances is monitored and benchmarked regularly. Internal audit Internal audit supports the organization in accomplishing its objectives by providing a systematic, disciplined approach for the evaluation and improvement of the effectiveness of its internal control and governance processes. The Internal Audit Charter is approved by the Board of Management and the Audit Committee annually. The objective of internal audit is to provide a broad range of audit services designed to assist the Board of Management in controlling the business operations. It provides independent, risk-based objective assurance and consulting services designed to add value to the organization. Internal audit evaluates risks and ensures that the controls in place are adequate to mitigate the risks identified by management. Besides the assurance role, internal audit also adds value to the business through tailor-made operational audits, identifying best practices, and recommending improvement opportunities to management. Internal audit at Corbion is based on a co-sourcing model where an external professional provides the Senior Director Internal Audit with specialized knowledge and capacity flexibility. Audit results are reported to the Board of Management and the Audit Committee. External audit Our external financial audit engagement ensures that all main entities are audited by the external auditor either for statutory and/or group purposes. The focus of the external auditor’s work is the financial reporting with the objective of providing a reasonable basis for the audit opinion on the fairness of the presentation of the financial position of the company. In control statement Corbion’s risk management and internal control systems are designed to identify in a timely manner the risks inherent to our strategic, operational, and financial business objectives and to determine appropriate risk responses as described above. Risk management and actions taken in the year under review were reported to and discussed by the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee. Internal representations received from management, regular management and business reviews, evaluations of the design and implementation of our risk management and internal control systems, and Audit Committee reviews are an integral part of the company’s risk management approach. It should be noted that the above does not imply that these systems and procedures provide certainty as to the realization of strategic, operational, and financial business objectives, nor that they can prevent all misstatements, inaccuracies, errors, fraud, and non-compliance with laws and regulations. On the basis thereof, the Board of Management believes to the best of its knowledge that the internal risk management and control systems with respect to the financial reporting have adequately performed in 2015 and that these systems provide a reasonable level of assurance against inaccuracies of material importance in the financial reporting. There are no indications that the systems would not be adequate in 2016. All in all, the Board of Management is of the opinion that it has fulfilled the best practice provision II.1.4 of the Dutch corporate governance code with due observance of the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Commission. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Our governance 39 Responsibility statement To the best of our knowledge the Financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and earnings of Corbion and its consolidated companies. Further, to the best of our knowledge the Report of the Board of Management gives a true and fair view of the position of Corbion as at the balance sheet date, and of the development during the financial year of Corbion and its group companies included in the Financial statements, together with a description of principal risks Corbion faces. The members of the Board of Management have signed the Financial statements pursuant to their statutory obligations under Section 101 Subsection 2 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and Section 25c Subsection 2 sub c of Chapter 5 of the Financial Markets Supervision Act (Wet op het financieel toezicht). Amsterdam, the Netherlands, 1 March 2016 Board of Management Corbion nv Tjerk de Ruiter, CEO Eddy van Rhede van der Kloot, CFO 40 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board Report of the Supervisory Board Overview 2015 2015 was an important year for Corbion in which we embarked on our strategy “Disciplined Value Creation”. As of 1 January 2015, an Executive Committee was established to enhance the execution of our strategy and to be better positioned to drive a common agenda across Corbion and set clear priorities. Corbion also made the next step in becoming a PLA producer, as we reached a major milestone for the construction of a new 75 kT PLA polymerization plant, having secured upfront customer commitment for one-third of plant capacity. Small acquisitions and joint ventures were concluded in the US (acquisition of the lactic acid business of ADM), India (acquisition of the lactic acid business of Malladi Specialties), and Europe (a 50/50 joint venture with MedinCell for the supply of PEG (polyethylene glycol) and PLA (poly lactic acid) based copolymers in the field of controlled release drug delivery) which fit well in our strategy. From a financial perspective, 2015 was a very good year. On 30 September 2015 Corbion successfully completed its € 50 million share buyback program that commenced on 2 March 2015. The share buyback program was part of Corbion’s commitment to return € 100 million to shareholders in 2015 through a € 50 million additional cash dividend and a € 50 million share buyback program. On 23 September 2015 Corbion announced that Sven Thormählen, CTO, had decided for personal reasons to step down as member of Corbion’s Board of Management and leave the company with immediate effect. The Supervisory Board would like to thank him for his professional technology-skills-based innovation contributions to Corbion. Tjerk de Ruiter, CEO of Corbion temporarily covers the tasks and responsibilities of CTO. The Supervisory Board would like to thank the Board of Management and all Corbion employees around the world for their dedication, loyalty, and hard work in 2015. Meetings of the Supervisory Board During the reporting year the Supervisory Board held six regular meetings with the Board of Management and three conference-call meetings. The discussions at these meetings covered frequently recurring topics, such as the updated strategy, the Corbion portfolio, developments in financial results, business developments in the business units and operating companies, trends in the markets where Corbion operates, key investments, group risks, internal risk management and control systems, the outcome of the Board of Management evaluation of the set-up and operation of these systems, corporate governance, corporate social responsibility, organizational and people readiness, succession planning, the organizational top structure, acquisitions and divestments, the Financial statements, the Report of the Board of Management, the external auditor rotation, and the succession of the CTO. The Supervisory Board has engaged external advisors to support them in their tasks and monitoring activities. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board 41 Prior to its regular meetings with the Board of Management the Supervisory Board also met in the absence of the Board of Management to discuss, amongst others, developments in the financial results, the new proposed remuneration policy for the Board of Management, and the profile, composition, and performance of the Board of Management. The Supervisory Board engaged an external expert to carry out the evaluation of the performance of the Supervisory Board, its committees, and that of its members. This was done by means of in-depth interviews with all Supervisory Board members; also the Board of Management provided input. A report of the evaluation including observations and recommendations was discussed by the Supervisory Board. The outcome of the self-evaluation was that the Supervisory Board as a team is functioning well and that the composition of the Supervisory Board is appropriate. Focus areas for improvement were, amongst others, the diversity of the Supervisory Board and the permanent education of the Supervisory Board members. Priorities for 2016 include monitoring the further development of the updated strategy, discussing the strategies regarding the new product and innovation pipeline currently under development, and attention for the longer term succession planning of Board members. Attendance at the in-person meetings held in 2015 was 100%. Attendance at the conferencecall meetings was almost 100%; in one instance two members were not able to attend and they provided input in advance and designated another Supervisory Board member to proxy for them. The Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board regularly met with the CEO, either in person or by phone. Also in this very intensive and important year for Corbion, all Supervisory Board members were able to make themselves sufficiently available to give adequate attention to the needs of Corbion. Members of the Supervisory Board regularly met with the business leaders and members of corporate staff. Composition of the Supervisory Board Mr. W. Spinner stepped down at the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting of 22 May 2015, after eleven years of distinguished service to the company, in various Supervisory Board membership roles. The Supervisory Board has benefited immensely from his extensive management experience and (bio)chemical industry knowledge. Mr. J.P. de Kreij was re-appointed as member of the Supervisory Board and Mrs. M.E. Doherty was appointed as a member. As per 22 May 2015, Mr. M.F.J.P. Vrijsen took over the role as Chairman and Mr. R.H.P. Markham took up the role of Vice-Chairman. Regarding its composition the Supervisory Board always tries to strike the right balance between expertise and experience. A certain degree of age and gender variation may be instrumental in achieving the desired balance in the composition of the Board. Required expertise and experience as well as the availability and diversity of the right candidates will be decisive when proposing candidates for (re)appointment. In the judgment of the Supervisory Board all its members are independent as required by the Dutch corporate governance code. 42 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board Committees of the Supervisory Board Audit Committee The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. R. Pieterse (Chairman), Mr. J.P. de Kreij, Mr. W. Spinner (until 22 May 2015), and Mrs. M.E. Doherty (as from 22 May 2015).

CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board 43 Financial statements, 1 January 2015 31 December 2015 The Financial statements prepared by the Board of Management for the financial year 2015 have been audited and certified by Deloitte Accountants B.V. The auditor’s findings on the Financial statements have been discussed with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board has accepted the Financial statements and recommends that they be adopted by the General Shareholders’ Meeting. The members of the Supervisory Board have signed the Financial statements pursuant to their statutory obligation under Section 101 Subsection 2 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Remuneration policy and report Remuneration policy and its implementation in 2015 To ensure Corbion’s development as a successful biobased ingredients and biotechnology company, the objective of the remuneration policy for the Board of Management is to create competitive remuneration packages and employment conditions, which align the interests of the Board of Management with the strategic direction and horizon of the company, with a strong emphasis on performance-related pay. The policy described in this section, and as applied in 2015, was approved by the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting (AGM) in 2015. Remuneration reference levels The total compensation levels (base salary, short-term incentive, long-term incentive, and pay mix) are based on a combined reference group of European biotechnology companies and Dutch general industry companies (AMX and smaller AEX). Every two years a reference check will be performed to align the total compensation levels with market levels, for the first time in 2017. The reference groups may be adjusted at that moment in time, as determined by the Supervisory Board and as disclosed on the company’s website. Within these two reference groups, Corbion qualifies around the median in terms of market capitalization, revenue, and number of employees. Base salary Members of the Board of Management are entitled to a base salary. Based on median market data the base salary for the CEO will be set between € 500,000 and € 600,000. For other Board members base pay is set between € 300,000 and € 400,000. The Supervisory Board will review these ranges every two years and adjust them if the median market data justifies any such adjustment. The individual pay of the Board members will be determined by the Supervisory Board within the boundaries of the aforementioned ranges (from time to time). There are no automatic annual increases in the base salary levels. In 2015, the annual base salary for Mr. De Ruiter amounted to € 525,000 and for Mr. Van Rhede van der Kloot € 350,000. Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP) Members of the Board of Management are entitled to a short-term incentive. The STIP rewards operational execution and is aimed at strengthening and growing the Corbion business. It is determined by two financial targets: EBITDA and earnings per share (EPS) (both as defined in the policy). EBITDA will account for 70% of the total STIP; the remaining 30% of the STIP will be determined by EPS. Meeting the annual performance targets will result in a STIP payout at target level. A range of 30% around each performance target (or such lower percentage as determined by the Supervisory Board) is set annually to determine the actual payout. The performance targets are applied in an additive method, meaning that both targets are measured independently. The STIP payout target level is set at 50% of base salary for the CEO, and 40% for other Board members. Payout is linear to the performance range and is set at a maximum 44 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board of 1.5 times the STIP target and 0.5 for performance at the threshold level respectively. For performance below the threshold, payout is zero. For 2015, the Supervisory Board applied the range of 30% for actual payout as follows: the threshold level was set at 85% and the maximum level at 115% for each target. The maximum levels for both financial targets have been achieved in the reporting year. This has led to a payout of 150% of the at-target STIP for both Mr. De Ruiter and Mr. Van Rhede van der Kloot. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) The long-term incentive for the Board of Management is aimed at longer-term value creation in line with shareholders’ interests, measured over a performance period of three calendar years. To ensure that short-term performance also leads to sustainable long-term value creation, the LTIP measurement is fully aligned with the STIP: EBITDA and EPS account for 60% respectively 20% of the LTIP. In addition, 20% of the LTIP is determined by relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) as compared to a specific TSR peer group. Each year members of the Board of Management are entitled to a conditional grant of Corbion shares. The CEO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 100% of base salary. The other Board members are entitled to a conditional share grant value of 80% of base salary. The total number of conditionally granted shares is determined by dividing the “at target” amount applicable for the respective Board member (as a percentage of base salary) by the share price. The share price is defined as the average closing price of the Corbion share during the last full calendar quarter preceding the conditional grant of shares. Meeting the performance target(s) will result in an LTIP payout at target level. A range of 50% around the performance target(s) (or such lower percentage as determined by the Supervisory Board) is set for the EBITDA and EPS performance to determine the actual payout. For TSR performance, threshold payout is set at meeting the eighth position in the peer group. Target payout is achieved at the fourth or fifth position in the peer group and maximum payout is achieved at reaching the first or second position in the peer group. The following table illustrates the ranking and the corresponding vesting percentage. Ranking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9-16 Percentage of performance shares vesting that are linked to the TSR metric 150% 150% 125% 100% 100% 75% 50% 50% 0% Based on independent analysis by a leading bank in the Netherlands the TSR performance of Corbion versus the TSR peer group will be assessed after the three-year performance period. The TSR peer group currently consists of the following companies: BioAmber Inc., Chr Hansen Holding A/S, Dupont Inc., Evonik Industries AG, Givaudan SA, Global Bioenergies SA, Innophos Holdings Inc., International Flavors & Fragrances Inc., Kerry Group PLC, Koninklijke DSM NV, Naturex SA, Novozymes A/S, Solazyme Inc., Symrise AG, and Tate & Lyle PLC. The Supervisory Board periodically assesses if the companies in this TSR peer group still qualify for inclusion. The Supervisory Board may also decide to replace companies in the peer group before the start of a new performance period. For each of the abovementioned LTIP metrics, achievement of “at target” performance will lead to 100% vesting of the conditionally granted shares. If the minimum performance targets are met, 0.5 times the conditionally granted shares will vest. Below the minimum performance targets there is no vesting. The maximum vesting of shares will be capped at 1.5 times the CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board 45 conditionally granted shares. Between threshold and maximum a linear scale (straight-line interpolation) shall apply to the number of conditionally granted shares that will vest. The number of performance shares conditionally granted to Mr. De Ruiter in 2015 (possible vesting in 2018) is 32,051 representing a value of € 525,000 at the time of granting. The number of performance shares conditionally granted to Mr. Van Rhede van der Kloot in 2015 (possible vesting in 2018) amounts to 17,094 representing a value of € 280,000 at the time of granting. Share ownership The Board of Management is obliged to gradually build up – in a time period of four years from appointment – a portfolio of Corbion shares that they are not allowed to sell during their Board membership with the company. The minimum share ownership for the CEO is 200% of base salary and for the other Board members 150% of base salary. The value of the Board members’ share ownership is measured yearly using the share price at the vesting date of the LTIP shares. Share ownership requirements remain equally valid during twelve months after a Board term ends, for whatever reason. This mandatory share ownership applies instead of a lock-up period for the vested shares received under the LTIP (as suggested in provision II.2.5 of the Dutch corporate governance code). As long as the Board member does not comply with the share ownership requirements, vested LTIP shares will be kept in a restricted account and cannot be traded. Benefits allowance As a consequence of the use of executive assignment agreements, the company does not provide (social) benefits such as a company car, individual retirement, and medical or life insurance to Board members. That is why each Board member is provided with a benefit allowance. This is a fixed annual amount of € 200,000 for a CEO with an international background and € 100,000 for other Board members, to cover the cost of these expenses. Corbion does not grant loans to members of the Board of Management. There are no outstanding loans. Other compensation Mr. De Ruiter is entitled to a one-off time-restricted performance share award equivalent to a target value of € 2 million in Corbion shares to vest over three years, as of 1 January 2015 (this award was granted in 2014 and amended in 2015 by the AGM). The award bridges part of the compensation gap between the United States and the Netherlands. The award encourages delivering a growing, increasingly profitable, and sustainable business portfolio. The award vests only if a minimum target (EBITDA growth, as defined in the share award) is achieved each year. If performance falls below target, no shares will vest. For at-target or above-target performance, the target number of shares (representing a value of one-third of the aggregate amount of € 2 million) will vest. The Supervisory Board has set long-term innovation milestones which allow for an additional vesting of up to 25% of the total number of shares. At the end of the three-year performance period, the Supervisory Board will determine whether these long-term innovation milestones have been met. The award is subject to the general share ownership requirement of two times the annual base salary; as long as Mr. De Ruiter does not comply with these share ownership requirements, vested shares under this share award will be kept in a restricted account and cannot be traded. For 2015, the minimum target was achieved leading to the vesting of 39,897 shares to Mr. De Ruiter in 2016. 46 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Report of the Supervisory Board Executive assignment agreements Members of the Board of Management are appointed for a period of four years and may be reappointed by the General Shareholders’ Meeting. All Board members have executive assignment agreements (overeenkomsten van opdracht) for four years. The notice period is six months. Severance payments are limited to one annual base salary and one annual benefits allowance. The members of the Board of Management may accept a maximum of two paid or unpaid positions on an outside supervisory board or any other such (advisory) position, provided they obtain the prior approval from the Supervisory Board. Remuneration for the Board of Management The total annual remuneration for the Board of Management in 2015 amounted to € 1,773 million including STIP over 2015 (2014: € 1,426 million). The table below shows the amounts which the respective Board member (i) received/was entitled to in 2015 (base salary, STIP, benefits allowance, relocation costs) and (ii) received/was entitled to in 2015 by way of vesting (LTIP, special share award).

Vrijsen CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Sustainability statements 49 Sustainability statements Sustainability framework In 2015 we have complemented our “Disciplined Value Creation” strategy with a sustainability framework, which outlines our key sustainability priorities and ambitions. This framework is based on extensive discussions with internal and external stakeholders and a materiality assessment. Employee engagement forms the core of our sustainability framework as our employees are our most important asset and motivated employees, proud to work for Corbion, are critical to achieve our overall strategy and to advance sustainability. Our key initiatives are responsible sourcing, resource-efficient operations, and sustainable solutions, covering our entire value chain. Innovation, transparency and stakeholder engagement are critical enablers ensuring that we make visible progress on the key initiatives and that these initiatives continue to be aligned with stakeholder expectations.

A materiality analysis is about the identification of key issues that are important to our stakeholders and our strategy. The materiality matrix visualizes the results of this analysis, by plotting the relevant social, environmental, governance and economic issues as a function of their importance to stakeholders (vertical axis) and Corbion’s strategy (horizontal axis).

We increased the number of issues in the evaluation, to get a more specific picture of their relative importance. To determine the relevance of these issues to our stakeholders, we conducted interviews with representatives of each stakeholder group (see fig. 2) to understand their expectations. Generally, our stakeholders really appreciated this opportunity to share their views and recommendations. We will continue this dialog to keep our assessment up to date and to signal emerging issues in time. Combined with our internal assessment of the importance of the issues to our strategy, this resulted in the identification of six material themes, which are the six themes in the upper right quadrant of the matrix. These six themes have a high impact on our strategy and are considered important by all of our key stakeholders. As in our previous matrix, which was developed in 2013, sustainable supply chain, resource efficiency, and renewable resources continue to be material themes. Innovation, transparency, and product environmental impact were not included in our previous materiality assessment. The materiality determination process (fig.1) 1 Long and shortlist of themes: we have compiled a long list of relevant sustainability themes based on GRI indicators, benchmarking and stakeholder input. This list was consolidated into a short list of 31 themes. 2 Determining importance to the Corbion strategy: the importance of each theme to the Corbion strategy was determined through discussions with the Executive Committee. 3 Stakeholder dialogs: the importance of each theme to our stakeholders was determined on the basis of stakeholder interviews. 4 Stakeholder weighing: the stakeholder input was weighted according to the impact that Corbion has on each stakeholder group and the impact that each stakeholder group has on Corbion. 5 Calculating materiality matrix: the resulting internal and external scores were plotted in a matrix and discussed with the Executive Committee to select the material themes. Key stakeholder groups (fig. 2) Our key stakeholders have been identified on the basis of two questions: 1. On which stakeholders does Corbion have a significant impact? 2. Which stakeholders have a significant impact on Corbion?

Accountability for managing sustainability initiatives and delivering against targets lies with the relevant businesses and functions. Reporting policy Our sustainability reporting is based on the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). For this report, the core option of the GRI G4 guidelines has been used. As recommended by the GRI G4 guidelines, the selection of topics is based on a materiality assessment (see Materiality). Additionally, we report on a number of themes such as occupational health and safety, quality, product safety, and customer statisfaction, which we consider qualifiers of our business. The scope of the environmental data includes Corbion’s manufacturing sites. Offices and R&D laboratories are not included, except for our central R&D laboratories and offices located at our Gorinchem manufacturing site. The scope of the social data is similar to that of the Consolidated financial statements. Data is collected from various reporting systems, each of which have associated approval and verification processes. We strive to continuously improve the data collection process and the reliability of the data. Significant changes that impact comparability 54 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Sustainability statements are explained in footnotes. We realize that some of the reported information depends on assumptions and is therefore less reliable, however we are confident that the information provides a solid picture of our progress in the various areas. The sustainability sections of this report have not been reviewed by external auditors. We intend to implement this in the future, to further increase the reliability of the data that we report.

Accounting information General Corbion is the global market leader in lactic acid, lactic acid derivatives, and lactides, and a leading company in emulsifiers, functional enzyme blends, minerals, and vitamins. The company delivers high-performance biobased products made from renewable resources and applied in global markets such as bakery, meat, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, home and personal care, packaging, automotive, coatings, and adhesives. Its products have a differentiating functionality in all kinds of consumer products worldwide. Corbion is based in Amsterdam, the Netherlands and listed on Euronext Amsterdam. The consolidated financial statements drawn up by the Board of Management have been approved by the Supervisory Board on 1 March 2016. They will be presented to the General Shareholders’ Meeting for adoption on 12 May 2016. The Supervisory Board will give a preliminary recommendation regarding the consolidated financial statements to the General Shareholders’ Meeting. In compliance with Section 2:402 of the Dutch Civil Code the income statement of Corbion nv is presented in a summarized form as it is incorporated in the consolidated financial statements. Overview of prior period adjustments Change in presentation Certain prior year comparatives have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s statement of financial position presentation. The reclassifications have been made to enable users of the financial statements to make a direct reconciliation to Corbion’s operating working capital definition. The reclassifications are not material for the financial statement and are mainly caused by further refinement of the accounts involved in order to increase insight, understandability and comparability. In the 2014 statement of financial position, this affected the following accounts:: Millions of euros 2014 as previously Reclassification 2014 after reported reclassifications Trade receivables 103.9 (9.0) 94.9 Other receivables 9.0 9.0 Trade payables 57.0 13.6 70.6 Other non-interest-bearing current liabilities 66.9 (10.3) 56.6 Income tax payables (previously: tax liabilities) 5.9 (3.3) 2.6 Reported amounts Unless stated otherwise all amounts in the financial statements are reported in millions of euros.

Accounting principles Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Corbion nv have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted by the European Union. With the exception of financial instruments, the financial statements in general have been prepared on the basis of the historical cost principle. New and amended standards adopted by the group In 2015, Corbion applied all the new and amended standards and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC), if and insofar as these applied to Corbion and were effective as at 1 January 2015. The main effective changes applied by Corbion at 1 January 2015 are: Annual improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle and 2011-2013 Cycle Corbion applied the amendments to IFRSs included in the Annual improvements to IFRSs 20102012 Cycle and 2011-2013 Cycle for the first time in the current year. The application of the amendments had no impact on the disclosures or amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accounting standards and interpretations not yet adopted None of the new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations not yet effective, have been applied by Corbion. The main effective changes after 1 January 2016 are: IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 9 (2014) issued in July 2014 replaces most of the guidance in IAS 39. IFRS 9 will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, subject to endorsement in certain territories. Corbion is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 9. IFRS 15 Revenue from contracts with customers IFRS 15 establishes a comprehensive framework for determining whether, how much, and when revenue is recognized. It replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes. IFRS 15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with early adoption permitted. Corbion is assessing the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 15. 68 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16, published in January 2016, establishes a revised framework for determining whether a lease is recognised on the (consolidated) statement of financial position. It replaces existing guidance on leases, including IAS 17. IFRS 16 is effective on or after 1 January 2019, with early adoption permitted. Corbion will assess the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements resulting from the application of IFRS 16. Corbion anticipates that the application of all other new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations currently known for future periods will have no significant impact on the Corbion financial statements. Consolidation The consolidation includes the financial data of Corbion nv and its group companies (together “Corbion”). All inter-company receivables, debts, and transactions have been eliminated. Group companies are companies in which Corbion nv exercises control. The results of acquisitions and divestments are recognized from the moment that control is obtained or transferred. Control is achieved when Corbion: • has power over the investee; • is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and • has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. Corbion reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above. Foreign currency The consolidated financial statements are in euros. The euro is Corbion nv’s functional and presentation currency. The functional currency is the currency of the primary environment where the group company operates and may therefore differ from one company to another. Transactions in other than the functional currency are translated at the exchange rates that apply on the transaction date. Any monetary assets and liabilities resulting from such transactions are translated at the exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Any exchange rate differences are recognized in the income statement or deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. The assets and liabilities of consolidated foreign group companies and the long-term foreigncurrency loans, which have been taken out to finance these subsidiaries, are converted into euros on the balance sheet date, taking taxes into account. The subsequent currency translation differences are incorporated in the translation reserve in equity. The results of the foreign group companies are translated into euros on the basis of average exchange rates. The difference between net profit on the basis of average exchange rates and net profit on the basis of the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date is incorporated in the translation reserve in equity. The same applies to exchange rate differences arising from borrowings and other financial instruments if they hedge the currency risk related to the net investments. If a foreign operation is divested or scaled down the associated cumulative currency translation differences are recognized as result in the income statement. Property, plant, and equipment Land, buildings, machines, installations, and other operating assets are valued at the acquisition price or the cost of production, subject to straight-line depreciation calculated over the estimated economic life and the estimated residual value. The cost of production includes the cost of materials and direct labor and an attributable part of the indirect costs. Land is not depreciated. Grants are deducted from the acquisition price or the production costs of the assets to which the grant relates. Property, plant, and equipment are tested for impairment if CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 69 there are indications for this. Impairment is the amount by which the book value of the property, plant, and equipment exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of (a) value in use and (b) fair value less cost to sell. Intangible fixed assets Goodwill Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is valued at cost less impairment. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually – or more often if there are indications for impairment. Impairment is the amount by which the book value of the goodwill of a cash-generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, being the higher of (a) value in use and (b) fair value less cost to sell. The value in use is the present value of the cash flows which the unit is expected to generate. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. If impairment is incurred, the impairment is charged to the income statement. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods. When an entity or activity is sold or closed down the goodwill allocated to the entity or activity is included in the calculations for the result of the sale. Customer base The customer base comprises the part of the paid acquisition sum which, upon acquisition, is allocated to the value of the acquired customer base. It is valued at fair value as at the acquisition date and amortized using a straight-line method over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from the customer base are recognized in selling expenses. The value of the customer base is tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Brands and licenses Brands and licenses comprise the part of the paid acquisition sum which is allocated to the value of the acquired trademarks and product licenses. Brands and licenses are valued at fair value as at the acquisition date and are subject to straight-line amortization calculated over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from brands and licenses are recognized in selling expenses. The value of the brands and licenses is tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Research and development costs Research and development costs comprise the part of the paid acquisition sum which is allocated to the value of the acquired research and development costs. These costs are valued at fair value as at the acquisition date. Own research costs are not capitalized, but charged to the income statement. Own development costs are capitalized if the appropriate criteria are met. Research and development costs are valued at cost and amortized using a straightline method over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from research and development costs are recognized in research and development costs. The value of the development costs is tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. 70 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Non-compete agreements Non-compete agreements comprise the part of the paid acquisition sum which is allocated to the value of the acquired non-compete agreements. Non-compete agreements are valued at fair value as at the acquisition date and are subject to straight-line amortization calculated over the estimated economic life. Amortization charges arising from non-compete agreements are recognized in selling expenses. The value of the non-compete agreements is tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Other intangible fixed assets Other intangible fixed assets consist primarily of capitalized or acquired third-party software and licenses. Other intangible fixed assets are valued at historical cost if capitalized or at fair value if acquired and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life. Software and licenses amortization charges are recognized in general and administrative expenses. Emission rights are not recognized in the statement of financial position as cost is zero. The value of the other intangible fixed assets is tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Financial fixed assets Loans, receivables, and other Loans and receivables are financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market (generally with a duration of more than one year). Such assets are initially recognized at fair value plus any directly related attributable costs. Subsequently they are valued at amortized costs using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Available-for-sale assets are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Fair value changes on available-for-sale assets are recognized directly in equity, through the statement of changes in equity, except for interest on available-for-sale assets, impairment losses, and foreign exchange gains or losses. Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. A joint venture is a contractual agreement under which two or more parties conduct an economic activity and unanimous approval is required for financial and operating policies. An associate is an entity over which the company has significant influence but no control, generally involving an equity shareholding between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Deferred taxes Deferred taxes concern tax loss carry forward and liabilities and assets arising from temporary differences between the tax bases and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements of (in-)tangible fixed assets, inventories, and provisions. Deferred taxes are determined using tax rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax is realized or the deferred tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognized if and insofar that is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference and tax loss carry forward can be utilized. Tax assets and liabilities are netted when there is a legal right and the intention to offset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities with the same term and relating to the same fiscal unities are offset against each other. Inventories Inventories of raw materials, consumables, technical materials, and packaging are stated at the lower of cost (first in, first out) and net realizable value. Inventories of work in progress and finished products are stated at the lower of production cost and net realizable value. Total CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 71 cost of production includes payroll costs and materials and an attributable part of the indirect production costs. A valuation adjustment is deducted for non-marketable inventories. Receivables Receivables are valued on the basis of the amortized cost using the effective interest rate method less provisions deemed necessary for non-collectability. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in bank, cash in hand, current deposits, money market funds, and highly liquid treasury bonds with original maturities of no more than three months. Bank overdrafts are presented as current interest-bearing liabilities. Equity Common shares and financing preference shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of common shares and share options are recognized as an equity deduction, net of tax. The price paid for repurchased shares (treasury shares) is deducted from equity until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Dividend to be distributed to the holders of common shares is recognized as a liability upon approval of the profit appropriation by the annual General Shareholders’ Meeting. Corbion runs a share plan for the Board of Management and Senior Management and a sharebased plan for Senior Management. The fair value of the right to shares on the date of allocation is recognized in the income statement as payroll costs over the vesting period. Liabilities arising from share-based plans with payment in shares are included in equity and valued only initially. Liabilities arising from share-based plans with payment in cash are included in provisions and revalued every period. Provisions Pension and early retirement schemes Defined contribution plan is a post employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate pension plan or insurance company and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions. For defined retirement benefit plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurements, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable), and the return on plan assets (excluding interest) are reflected immediately in the statement of financial position with a charge or credit recognized in other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recognized in other comprehensive income is reflected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassified to profit or loss. Past service costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period of a plan amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability or asset. Defined benefit costs are categorized as follows: • Service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements) • Net interest expense or income • Remeasurements The first two components of defined benefit costs are presented in profit or loss. Curtailment gains and losses are accounted for as past service costs. The retirement benefit obligation in the consolidated statement of financial position represents the actual deficit or surplus in the defined benefit plans. Any surplus resulting from this 72 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements calculation is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans. A liability for a termination benefit is recognized at the earlier of when the entity can no longer withdraw the offer of the termination benefit and when the entity recognizes any related restructuring costs. Other long-term employee benefit commitments The other long-term employee commitments relate mainly to anniversary commitments, past service commitments, conditional incentive plans, and health insurance. The commitments arising from these benefits are accounted for similarly as defined benefit pension plans. Reorganization, restructuring, and other These provisions relate to a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the amount of which is uncertain but which can be estimated reliably and of which it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources is required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flow at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments of time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. A provision for reorganization is recognized after Corbion has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. A provision for a legal claim is recognized if a reliable estimate can be made of the expected outcome of the claim, measuring the claim as a weighting of all possible outcomes against their probabilities. A provision for an onerous contract is recognized when the expected benefits to be derived from the contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of fulfilling its terms and conditions. Liabilities Interest-bearing liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and subsequently at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Upon sale or settlement of interest-bearing liabilities any profits or losses are directly recognized in the income statement. Leases Lease agreements in which the lessor transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of the ownership of an asset to the lessee are classified as financial leases. All assets and liabilities of a financial lease are capitalized at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease agreements that do not meet the conditions for a financial lease are classified as operational leases. Payments made are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. Segment reporting An operating segment is a component that engages in business activities from which it earns revenues and incurs expenses. All operating segments are reviewed regularly by the Board of Management to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess its performance for which discrete financial information is available. Net sales Net sales comprises the proceeds of goods delivered to third parties less discounts and value-added tax. Net sale of goods is recognized when Corbion has transferred the actual risks and rewards of ownership of the goods to the buyer, when the amount of the proceeds can be reliably measured, and when it is probable that the economic benefits of the sale will flow to Corbion. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 73 Costs of raw materials, packaging, and consumables Costs of raw materials and consumables relate to the cost of consumption of raw materials, consumables, and packaging materials. Cost of raw materials and consumables are recognized in the income statement when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods sold have been transferred to a party outside the group. These costs include the purchase price of all raw material and all directly attributable costs. Production costs Production costs are the costs relating to production operations. Warehousing and distribution costs Warehousing and distribution costs relate to the costs of warehousing and transport, including transport insurance. Selling expenses Selling expenses relate to the costs of marketing and sales. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses relate to the costs of administration, management, and IT. Financial income and charges Financial income comprises interest income on cash and cash equivalents and interest income on loans to other parties. Interest income is recognized in the period to which it relates, using the effective interest method. Financial charges comprise interest expenses and exchange rate differences on borrowings, finance lease expenses, impairments on available-for-sale assets, and other financial expenses. All borrowing costs are recognized in the income statement using the effective interest method. Taxes Tax on the result is calculated on the basis of the result before taxes, taking account of untaxed profit elements, nonand part-deductible costs, and fiscal facilities. The prevailing nominal tax rates are applied. Non-recoverable withholding taxes on foreign dividends are taken into account. Taxes in the income statement for the year comprise current and deferred taxes. Taxes are recognized in the income statement unless they relate to items directly recognized in equity. Current tax is the expected tax rate payable on the taxable income for the year, using statutory tax rates at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Financial instruments and hedge activities Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and commodity price risk. Derivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value. The gains or losses on the remeasurement to fair value are immediately recognized in the income statement. However where derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, recognition depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Fair value hedge Fair value hedges hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment. Changes in the fair value of a hedging derivative are recognized in the income statement. Changes in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged are recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and are also recognized in the income statement. 74 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Cash flow hedge Cash flow hedges hedge possible fluctuations in cash flows which can be attributed to a certain currency, interest rate, or commodity price risk associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable expected future transaction. The effective part of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments which are designated and classified as cash flow hedge is recognized in equity. Gains or losses from the non-effective part are directly recognized in the income statement. If a hedging instrument expires, is sold, or if the instrument can no longer be qualified as a hedging instrument, the cumulative gains or losses remain in equity until the expected future transaction is recognized in the income statement. If the expected future transaction is no longer probable the cumulative result is transferred immediately from equity to the income statement. Net investment hedge Hedges for net investments in foreign operations are handled in a similar way as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses from the hedging instrument which can be attributed to the effective part of the hedge are recognized in equity; any gains or losses which cannot be attributed to the effective part are directly recognized as financial income or charges in the income statement. Cumulative gains or losses in equity are recognized in the income statement as soon as the foreign operation is partly divested or sold. When entering into a hedge Corbion documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged position, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for entering into the various hedging transactions. At inception and on an ongoing basis Corbion documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged positions effectively. Discontinued operations and non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. For this to be the case, the asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale must be highly probable. A discontinued operation is a component that either has been disposed of, or that is classified as held for sale, and: (i) represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or (ii) is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Discontinued operations are stated on the basis of the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Discontinued operations are presented separately in the income statement and cash flow statement. In accordance with IFRS 5, fixed assets related to discontinued operations will no longer be depreciated and amortized after the classification as held for sale. Cash flow statement The consolidated cash flow statement is drawn up using the indirect method. The items in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of the financial position have been adjusted for changes that do not impact cash inflow and outflow in the reporting year. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at the average foreign exchange rates unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case cash flows are translated at the rate on the dates of the transactions. Working capital consists of inventories and receivables minus non-interest-bearing current liabilities, excluding payable dividend, interest, and income tax. The interest-bearing debts consist of non-current and current liabilities. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 75 Critical accounting estimates and judgments Corbion makes use of accounting estimates and judgments. Described below are the estimates and judgments as at the balance sheet date that carry a substantial risk of a material adjustment to the book value of assets and liabilities in the next financial year. Acquisitions Corbion has a process in place to identify all assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible fixed assets. The judgments made in identifying all acquired assets, determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the results of operations. Estimated fair values are based on information available around the acquisition date and on expectations and assumptions of anticipated discounted cash flows that have been assessed as reasonable by Corbion. Goodwill impairment Every year, Corbion tests the goodwill based on the higher of fair value less cost to sell and the value in use method. The value-in-use is calculated on the basis of estimates and judgments of the expected cash flows which are discounted on a WACC basis. For a description of the main estimates, valuation assumptions, and a sensitivity analysis of the applied assumptions see Note 11. Valuation and impairment testing (in)tangible fixed assets (In)tangible fixed assets are tested for sustained impairment if there is an indication of possible impairment. A key factor is the recoverable amount which is calculated on the basis of estimates and assumptions of anticipated discounted cash flows, on the one hand, and an estimate of the fair value less costs to sell, on the other. Pension and early retirement schemes Actuarial calculations are used to determine provisions for group personnel arrangements and net receivables or obligations from group pension plans. These calculations use assumptions in respect of future developments in salary, mortality, staff turnover, return on investments et cetera. Changes to these estimates and assumptions can lead to actuarial gains or losses which are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. For more information on the applied assumptions see Note 20. Taxes Corbion is subject to various tax systems across the world. Estimates and judgments are used to determine the tax items in the financial statements. Interpretation differences in tax liabilities are also taken into account. For more information on taxes see Note 21. 76 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 3. Consolidated income statement before one-off items The consolidated income statement for financial years 2015 and 2014 before one-off items (non-IFRS financial measures) can be presented as follows. 2015 2014 Before One-off Total Before One-off Total one-off items one-off items items items Net sales 918.3 918.3 770.1 770.1 Costs of raw materials and consumables -471.4 -471.4 -388.3 -388.3 Production costs -140.7 4.0 -136.7 -120.7 -39.5 -160.2 Warehousing and distribution costs -48.3 -48.3 -42.8 -42.8 Gross profit 257.9 4.0 261.9 218.3 -39.5 178.8 Selling expenses -63.9 0.1 -63.8 -58.9 -5.8 -64.7 Research and development costs -32.7 -32.7 -32.0 -3.9 -35.9 General and administrative expenses -56.8 -56.8 -61.9 -3.4 -65.3 Operating result 104.5 4.1 108.6 65.5 -52.6 12.9 Less: depreciation/amortization/impairment (in)tangible fixed assets 45.8 1.8 47.6 44.1 37.8 81.9 EBITDA 150.3 5.9 156.2 109.6 -14.8 94.8 Depreciation/amortization/impairment (in)tangible fixed assets -45.8 -1.8 -47.6 -44.1 -37.8 -81.9 Operating result 104.5 4.1 108.6 65.5 -52.6 12.9 Financial income 0.1 0.1 Financial charges -5.8 -5.8 -6.4 -3.1 -9.5 Results from joint ventures and associates -0.6 -0.6 -1.6 -1.6 Result before taxes 98.1 4.1 102.2 57.6 -55.7 1.9 Taxes -23.6 1.6 -22.0 -17.4 -2.8 -20.2 Result after taxes 74.5 5.7 80.2 40.2 -58.5 -18.3 One-off items may occur up to and including results after taxes. One-off items relate to material non-recurring items in the income statement that are exceptional by nature and are not related to the normal course of business. These exceptional items include amongst others write down of inventories to net realizable value, reversals of write downs, impairments, reversals of impairments, additions to and releases from provisions for restructuring and reorganization, results on assets sold, gains on the sale of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, and any other provision being formed or released. The company considers events exceptional (one-off) when the aggregate amount of the events per line item of the income statement exceeds a threshold of € 0.5 million. In 2014, a total of € 58.5 million one-off items were recorded, including the following major items: 1. Impairments of € 20.2 million, all non-cash items, related to the closure of our Kansas Avenue powder blending plant (€ 8.2 million). Furthermore, impairments were recognized for preengineering costs due to a scope change of an envisaged expansion of the lactic acid plant in Thailand (€ 7.9 million), and other (€ 4.1 million). 2. Partial, non-cash, impairment of our Thailand based lactide plant of € 17.5 million. 3. Reorganization charge of € 12.1 million mostly related to “Streamline”, our productivity improvement program. 4. In 2014 agreement was reached with respect to the contractual obligations towards the former Board of Management, amounting to € 2.8 million. 5. An impairment on the financial expense line of € 3.1 million which relates to an equity investment in an entity. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 77 6. The relatively high tax charge on exceptional items is partially caused by the reversal of deferred tax assets, further to a review by management on the recoverability of such deferred tax assets. In 2015, a total of € 5.7 million one-off items were recorded: 1. One-off insurance gains of € 10.4 million related to Grandview incident in March 2015. 2. Cost incurred € 5.4 million related to the explosion at the Grandview manufacturing facility of which an impairment of tangible fixed assets of € 1.1 million. 3. A one-off gain of € 0.7 million as a result of a release of the reorganization provision related to “Streamline”. 4. One-off costs of € 0.8 million incurred related to the closure of the Kansas Avenue powder blending plant. 5. Furthermore, an impairment was recognized of € 0.8 million due to an obsolete production line in the Netherlands. 6. Tax effects on the above items of € 1.7 million. 7. Net positive tax effects of € 3.3 million related to the divestment of the Bakery Supplies businesses in 2013. 4. Segment information For its strategic decision-making process Corbion distinguishes between Biobased Ingredients and Biobased Innovations. For IFRS segmentation purposes Biobased Ingredients has been segmented into two further businesses, Food and Biochemicals. The unallocated part of total operations mainly comprises central activities. In the Food segment, our food ingredients portfolio keeps food safe and fresh, from creation to consumption, and as such, reduces food waste. It ranges from preservation ingredients to microbial spoilage prevention and ingredients that keep food fresh and tasty throughout shelf life. The combined use of industry knowledge and scientific creativity enables us to offer industry-leading biobased technology and sustainability gains. Our future-focused thinking impacts every industry ranging from baking, meat, and dairy to confectionery and beverage. In the Biochemicals segment, our biobased chemicals derived from renewable resources such as sugar or starch, are a sustainable alternative to fossil-based chemicals in various applications, including cleaning detergents, hand soap, coatings, and animal feed. Offering improved performance and multiple benefits, our biobased solutions are versatile and, at the same time, provide lower cost in use with enhanced environmental credentials. Our Biobased Innovations business unit creates new business platforms to help advance biotechnology developments. Our PLA/lactide business and the succinic-acid joint venture with BASF (Succinity) are part of this unit. Our longer-term development projects, such as our gypsum-free fermentation technology, lactic acid based on second-generation biomass, and FDCA are also included in this business unit. We will drive for growth via a disciplined stagegate investment approach using our own core technology platforms, acquired or licensed technologies, and partnerships to improve our chance of success. Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arm’s length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties. 78 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Segment information by business area Food Biochemicals Biobased Unallocated Corbion Innovations (central activities) total operations 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 Income statement information Net sales 687.8 573.5 208.1 186.4 22.4 10.2 918.3 770.1 Operating result 109.9 66.5 34.0 24.4 -14.9 -52.2 -20.4 -25.8 108.6 12.9 One-off items included in operating result -4.4 17.7 0.3 2.7 30.3 1.9 -4.1 52.6 Operating result excluding one-off items 105.5 84.2 34.3 27.1 -14.9 -21.9 -20.4 -23.9 104.5 65.5 Alternative non-IFRS performance measures EBITDA 135.1 97.2 45.5 36.2 -4.7 -14.2 -19.7 -24.4 156.2 94.8 One-off items included in EBITDA -5.9 8.3 2.0 2.6 1.9 -5.9 14.8 EBITDA excluding one-off items 129.2 105.5 45.5 38.2 -4.7 -11.6 -19.7 -22.5 150.3 109.6 Ratios alternative non-IFRS performance measures EBITDA margin % 19.6 16.9 21.9 19.4 17.0 12.3 EBITDA margin % excluding one-off items 18.8 18.4 21.9 20.5 16.4 14.2 Corbion generates almost all of its revenues from the sale of goods. Information on the use of alternative non-IFRS performance measures In the above table and elsewhere in the financial statements a number of non-IFRS performance measures is presented. Management is of the opinion that these so-called alternative performance measures might be useful for the readers of these financial statements. Corbion management uses these performance measures to make financial, operational, and strategic decisions and evaluate performance of the segments. The alternative performance measures can be calculated as follows: • EBITDA is the operating result before depreciation, amortization, and impairment of (in)tangible fixed assets • EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by net sales x 100 Segment information by geographical region Net sales Non-current assets 2015 2014 2015 2014 The Netherlands 108.1 97.5 148.3 140.4 Rest of Europe 66.7 63.7 33.0 36.5 North America 591.3 483.3 185.4 148.7 Other countries 152.2 125.6 87.2 95.9 Corbion total operations 918.3 770.1 453.9 421.5 The above information is based on the geographical location of the assets.

In 2014, the following impairments were recorded: • An impairment of our Thailand-based lactide plant (part of the Biobased Innovations segment) based on a reassessment of volume development and timing (recorded partly in the Buildings category and partly in the Machinery and equipment category) of THB 702 million (€ 17.6 million). In this (value-in-use) impairment calculation, the terminal value assumes no growth. The pre-tax discount rate used is 13.1%. The net present value of the projected cash flows underlying the impairment calculation is sensitive to aforementioned assumptions, especially the volume development. In case the assumed volume development would accelerate (delay) by 1 year this would have a positive (negative) impact of approximately € 10 million on the calculated net present value. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 83 • The “Streamline” program resulted in several assets being impaired, the most significant being the impairment of the Kansas Avenue plant of € 8.2 million in the Food segment, which is expected to be closed in 2015. The recoverable amount of the building is based on the fair value less costs to sell, supported by an external valuation. Furthermore, impairments were recognized for pre-engineering costs due to a scope change of an envisaged expansion of the lactic acid plant in Thailand (€ 7.9 million) and obsolescence of certain assets in the US Blair plant (€ 1.5 million). The “Other” movement relates to a transfer of assets from tangible fixed assets to intangible fixed assets. In 2015, the following impairments were recorded: • An impairment of tangible fixed assets of € 1.1 million related to the explosion of the Grandview manufacturing facility (part of the Food segment). • An impairment was recognized of € 0.8 million due to an obsolete production line in the Netherlands. 84 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 11.

The Food and Biochemicals operating segments represent the levels to which company goodwill is allocated for the purposes of impairment testing. The Biobased Innovations segment does not contain any goodwill. Main reasons for this approach are: • It represents a non-arbitrary, reasonable, and consistent basis for the allocation of goodwill. • The allocation is in line with the expected synergies at the time of an acquisition with benefits for more than one entity. • The allocation represents the lowest level where goodwill is monitored by the Board of Management, while not being larger than the operating segments. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 85 Breakdown of the book value of the goodwill by segment As at As at 31-12-2015 31-12-2014 Food 62.1 56.0 Biochemicals 2.2 2.2 Total operations 64.3 58.2 The recoverable amount of both segments is determined using a value-in-use method. The main assumptions used are derived from the financial and business plans for 2016 which have been approved by the Board of Management. From 2017 onwards a stable growth of 1% is taken into account in combination with a relatively constant cost structure. The future cash flows are discounted on the basis of the WACC before tax. Overview of the WACC used As at 31-12-2015 As at 31-12-2014 pre-tax post-tax pre-tax post-tax Food 9.8% 6.9% 10.1% 7.1% Biochemicals 10.2% 7.7% 10.0% 7.9% In addition, sensitivity analyses have been carried out in respect of the assumptions using: • A terminal value growth of 0% • A discount rate of +1% Both assumptions applicable at the same time would not lead to any impairment. Given the above assumptions and the outcome of analyses, the Board of Management has concluded that the value in use of both segments is not lower than the book value of the segments including goodwill. Impairment testing other intangible fixed assets In 2014, impairments of in total € 2.5 million were recognized for intangible fixed assets. In the Biobased Innovations segment an impairment was recorded for the project for the development of an alternative microorganism (€ 1.4 million). Further the related intangible assets, as part of the impairment of the lactide plant, were impaired. As a result of the strategy update preengineering costs were impaired due to a scope change of an envisaged expansion of the lactic acid production plant in Thailand. In 2015, no impairments were recorded for intangible fixed assets. The “Other” movement relates to transfers of assets from tangible fixed assets to intangible fixed assets. 86 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 12.

Pensions Corbion sponsors defined benefit pension plans in the US and UK. Both plans are closed schemes and based on final pay. Further, Corbion sponsors a legal severance payment plan in Thailand. All plans have been established in accordance with the legal requirements of the countries involved. The defined benefit plans are administered by a separate fund that is legally separated from the entity. The board of the pension fund is composed of an equal number of representatives from both employers and (former) employees. The plans typically expose the group to actuarial risks such as investment risk, interest rate risk, and longevity risk. • Investment risk The present value of the defined benefit plan liability is calculated using a discount rate determined by reference to high-quality corporate bond yields; if the return on plan assets is below this rate, it will create a plan deficit. Currently the plans have a relatively balanced investment in mainly equity securities and debt instruments. • Interest risk A decrease in the bond interest rate will increase the plan liability; however, this will be partly offset by an increase in the return on the plan’s debt investments. • Longevity risk The present value of the defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality of plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of the plan participants will increase the plan’s liability. The defined benefit obligation as per year-end consisted for the vast majority of the UK plan and is summarized below: • The Normal Retirement Age (NRA) is 65; however, Section 1 members are able to take their benefits in respect of pre 1 October 2003 service unreduced from age 60. • Pensions in deferment increase in line with statutory revaluation with the exception of pre 1 October 2003 benefits for Section 1 members, which have an underpin linked to the level of pension increases in payment (which are linked to Retail Price Index (RPI)). • Pensions in payment increase in line with RPI capped at 5% for benefits in respect of pre 1 January 2006 service and RPI capped at 2.5% for benefits in respect of post 31 December 2005 service. The UK pension scheme is in a deficit situation. For this plan a recovery plan has been agreed in 2013 for which Corbion will contribute additional funding payments of GBP 1.1 million per year (commencing in 2013) with an increase of 5% per year payable until 2021 or until the scheme is no longer in a deficit situation. The strategic investment policy of the scheme can be summarized as follows: • A strategic asset mix comprising 50% in return-seeking assets and 50% in matching (bondtype) assets. • The return-seeking asset portfolio comprises a mix of equity investments and diversified growth funds. • Interest rate and inflation risk is managed through the use of liability-driven investments and corporate bonds of an appropriate duration. • Currency risk is managed by implementing a 50% currency hedge on the global equity holding. The average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2015 is 24.5 years.

Deferred members over the age of 55 were offered a transfer value to a personal pension, which was then converted into an immediate pension with no pension increase. As a result of the transfer, the liabilities and assets of the scheme were reduced. The actual return on plan assets was € 1.9 million positive (2014: € 6.8 million positive). The investment strategy is based on the composition of the obligations of the pension schemes. Based on Asset Liability Management models analyses have been performed on a regular basis to define the investment portfolio. At year-end the asset allocation was as follows. Asset categories of plan assets 2015 2014 Quoted equity securities 24.5 34.9 Unquoted equity securities Quoted debt securities 37.4 22.9 Other 10.9 8.4 Total assets 72.8 66.2 The main weighted average actuarial assumptions 2015 2014 Discount rate 3.8% 3.7% Salary growth rate Pension growth rate 2.5% 3.0% CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 95 Sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in the weighted principal assumptions Change in Increase in Decrease in assumption assumption assumption Discount rate 0.50% (8.5) 9.6 Salary growth rate 0.50% Pension growth rate 0.50% 5.6 (6.0) The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognized within the consolidated statement of financial position. The expected contributions to the defined benefit pension plans in the coming year amount to € 2.2 million. 21.

Financial risk management and financial instruments Risk management framework Corbion’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency, interest, commodity, liquidity, capital, and credit risk. The treasury department identifies and manages these risks. Treasury operates within a framework of policies and procedures which have been approved by the Board of Management. The treasury policy may change on an annual basis in light of market circumstances and market volatility. Corbion uses derivatives solely for the purpose of hedging exposures mainly related to commodity, currency and interest rate risk arising from the company’s sources of finance and business. Corbion has a Treasury and a Commodity Risk Management Committee meeting periodically to review treasury and commodity activities and compliances with both policies. Currency risk Corbion is active on the international market, which means that it is exposed to risks arising from currency fluctuations, particularly in the US dollar, Brazilian real, Japanese yen, and Thai baht. Foreign currency exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognized assets and liabilities, and net investments in foreign operations. Translation risks Corbion is subject to foreign exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of its foreign subsidiaries income, assets, and liabilities into euros in the consolidated financial statements. To protect the value of future foreign cash flows, Corbion partially mitigates the foreign exchange exposure by applying natural hedging, meaning capital employed in foreign operations is financed using the country’s currency in order to avoid fluctuations due to translation effects. US translation effects of the operating result are partially hedged by the interest paid on the US dollar loan. Currency fluctuations particularly in the US dollar can have a material effect on Corbion’s income statement. Corbion’s policy is to hedge material currency translation exposures above specific limits as defined for each currency.

Corbion’s exposure to exchange rate movements in commercial operations is mainly related to EUR/ USD, THB/YEN, and EUR/YEN. Corbion uses forward currency contracts and currency swaps in order to hedge risks arising from purchase and sales deals and/or commitments from current purchase and sales contracts. Transactions that are highly probable are hedged and included in cash flow hedge accounting. Other reasonably probable transactions are partially hedged. For practical reasons a specific limit is defined for each currency. Hedge accounting is being applied to these contracts, so any unrealized fluctuations in the fair value are deferred in the hedge reserve of equity until the underlying hedged transaction is recognized in the result. All forward currency contracts expire within a year. Sensitivity analysis to changes in exchange rates of financial instruments A 10% weakening of the euro against the Japanese yen would have decreased the equity by € 1.0 million, with no significant impact on the net result. Interest rate risk Corbion’s interest rate risk arises primarily from its debt. Corbion has an interest rate policy aimed at reducing volatility in its interest expense and maintaining a target percentage of its debt in fixed rate instruments. Currently Corbion’s interest rate exposure has been fully fixed (4.18% on average) for all of Corbion’s long-term debt (€ 154.2 million) for a period of on average 8.2 years. Sensitivity analysis to changes in market interest rate Assuming the same mix of variable and fixed interest rate instruments, an interest rate increase by 50 basis points compared to the rates on 31 December 2015 with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase of € 0 in the net result and € 0 in equity. Commodity risk Corbion uses commodity derivative contracts to reduce the risk of price fluctuations of the main commodities used, being oils, gas, corn, and sugar. Corbion entered into commodity derivative contracts to hedge the variable price risk of the main commodities used. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of € 0.1 million as at 31 December 2015 (31 December 2014: liability of € 3.3 million). Hedge accounting is applied for the major part of these commodity derivative contracts. All commodity derivative contracts expire within a year. Sensitivity analysis If the purchase price of the involved commodities would increase by 10%, net result and equity would be impacted by € 0.2 million. 100 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk of Corbion not being able to obtain sufficient financial means to meet its obligations in time. Corbion actively manages liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of committed borrowing capacity. Corbion manages cash flow based on cash flow analysis for the next 12 months. The committed credit facilities at Corbion’s long-term disposal amounted to € 300 million as at 31 December 2015. As at that date nothing had been drawn. Corbion also has a private placement of $ 167 million with American institutional investors. To provide insight into the liquidity risk the table below shows the contractual terms of the financial obligations (converted at balance sheet date), including interest paid. The table below analyzes Corbion’s financial obligations which will be settled on a net basis, according to relevant expiration dates, based on the remaining period from the balance sheet date to the contractual expiration date. The amounts shown are contractual non-discounted cash flows.

Corbion’s credit risk mainly arises from loans granted, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and derivative financial instruments. For first 3 items the maximum credit risk equals the book value (see Notes 13, 15, and 16), in respect of derivatives it equals the fair value. Corbion spreads its liquidity investments across a group of high rated financial institutions applying credit limits per institution. Outstanding receivables are monitored by the business. Appropriate allowances have been made for any credit risk that has been identified. It is therefore unlikely that significant losses will arise in relation to receivables that have not been provided for. CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 101 Capital risk management Corbion manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Corbion group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximizing return to stakeholders through the optimization of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of Corbion consists of net debt (interest-bearing debts as detailed in Notes 22 and 23 offset by cash and cash equivalents as detailed in Note 16). 2015 2014 Private placement 153.4 104.6 Financial lease commitments 0.1 Other debts 0.8 0.9 Cash and cash equivalents -92.1 -111.4 Net debt 62.1 -5.8 The Corbion treasury committee reviews the capital structure of Corbion on a quarterly basis. As part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The main covenants for the credit facility and the US private placement are: • The ratio of net debt position divided by EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and impairment of (in)tangible fixed assets, and excluding one-off items and cash dividend of joint ventures received) may not exceed the factor 3.5 (2014: 3.5). • A minimum interest cover (EBITDA divided by net interest income and charges) of 3.5 (2014: 3.5). These external conditions were met in 2015 as well as in 2014. Corbion target a net debt/ EBITDA ratio of 1.5x over the investment cycle. A net debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0x is set as a peak management threshold level. Ratios at year-end 2015 2014 Net debt position/EBITDA 0.4 -0.1 Interest cover 25.5 23.8 Financial instruments Valuation of financial instruments Corbion measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements: • Level 1: Fair value measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. • Level 2: Fair value measurements based on inputs other than level 1 quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). • Level 3: Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 102 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Breakdown valuation of financial instruments 31 December 2015 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Derivatives Foreign exchange contracts -0.3 -0.3 Commodity swaps/collars 0.1 0.1 Total -0.2 -0.2 Breakdown fair values financial instruments 31 December 2015 Balance Fair value sheet value Financial fixed assets Loans, receivables, and other 1.5 1.5 Receivables Trade receivables 96.9 96.9 Other receivables 13.4 13.4 Accruals and deferred income 2.2 2.2 Cash Cash other 92.1 92.1 Interest-bearing liabilities Private placement (net investment hedge) -153.4 -156.6 Other debts -0.8 -0.8 Non-interest-bearing liabilities Trade payables -69.7 -69.7 Other payables -59.1 -59.1 Derivatives Foreign exchange contracts -0.3 -0.3 Commodity swaps/collars 0.1 0.1 Total -77.1 -80.3 Fair values are determined as follows • The fair value of financial fixed assets does not significantly deviate from the book value. • The fair value of receivables equals the book value because of their short-term character. • Cash and cash equivalents are measured at nominal value which, given the short-term and risk-free character, corresponds to the fair value. • Market quotations are used to determine the fair value of debt owed to private parties, credit institutions, and other debts. As there are no market quotations for most of the loans the fair value of shortand long-term loans is determined by discounting the future cash flows at the yield curve applicable as at 31 December. • Given the short-term character, the fair value of non-interest-bearing liabilities equals the book value. • Currency and interest derivatives are measured on the basis of the present value of future cash flows over the remaining term of the contracts, using the bank interest rate (such as Euribor) as at the reporting date for the remaining term of the contracts. The present value in CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 103 foreign currencies is converted using the exchange rate applicable as at the reporting date. • Commodity derivatives are measured on the basis of the present value of future cash flows, using market quotations or own variable market price estimations of the involved commodity as at the reporting date. Derivatives Hedge transactions The negative amount of € 2.6 million in hedge reserve (see Note 18) relates to the hedging of risks arising from future purchase and sales deals and/or commitments from current purchase and sales contracts amounting to € 42.7 million. The amount of € 32.4 million in translation reserve (see Note 18) relates to currency fluctuations in respect of the net investments in foreign operations less the currency fluctuations of the corresponding net investment hedges. In case of divestment of a net investment in a foreign operation, the corresponding net impact of the currency fluctuations is moved from the translation reserve to the income statement. In the past year no cash flow hedges were terminated due to changes to the expected future transaction. No ineffective parts were recorded in respect of the net investment hedge and cash flow hedge.

CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 107 26. Share-based compensation Share-based remuneration arrangements: Board of Management A share plan is in place for the Board of Management. Two current and two former members of the Board of Management have a total of 401,306 unvested share rights in the company as at 31 December 2015 (2014: 422,079 ). The nominal amount of the shares which are claimable under unvested share rights equals € 100,327 per that date. 2012-2014 program Each year members of the Board of Management are entitled to a conditional grant of Corbion shares. There are two target levels for this incentive. One applies to the CEO and one to CFO. The CEO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 60% of his base salary. The CFO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 50% of his base salary. The total number of conditionally granted shares is determined by dividing the “at target” amount applicable for the respective Board member (as a percentage of base salary) by the (undiscounted) fair value average stock price over the month prior to the date of grant (April of any year). The performance criterion for the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) is Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over a three-year performance period. After vesting and share delivery, the Board members according to the plan rules, are required to keep the shares in a blocked account for another two years. The total lockup period therefore is five years. For further details refer to the Remuneration policy and report in the Report of the Supervisory Board. 2015 program A revised program was introduced in 2015, as part of the new remuneration policy agreed by the AGM on 22 May 2015, aimed at longer-term value creation in line with shareholders’ interests, measured over a performance period of three calendar years. To ensure that short-term performance also leads to sustainable long-term value creation, the LTIP measurement is fully aligned with the STIP: 60% of the LTIP is dependent on EBITDA and 20% of the LTIP depends on the Earning Per Share (EPS). In addition, 20% of the LTIP depends on relative TSR as compared to a specific TSR peer group. Each year members of the Board of Management are entitled to a conditional grant of Corbion shares. There are two target levels for this incentive: one applies to the CEO and one to the CFO. The CEO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 100% of his base salary. The CFO is entitled to a conditional share grant value of 80% of the base salary. The total number of conditionally granted shares is determined by dividing the “at target” amount applicable for the respective Board member (as a percentage of base salary) by the share price. The share price is defined as the average closing price of the Corbion share during the last full calendar quarter preceding the conditional grant of shares. At the beginning of the performance period, targets for the LTIP are set by the Supervisory Board for the three-year performance period as follows: 1. A target based on EBITDA, a threshold (minimum) and a range around the performance target to determine the actual payout for 60% of the LTIP. 2. A target based on EPS, a threshold (minimum) and a range around the performance target to determine the actual payout for 20% of the LTIP. 3. The TSR performance is benchmarked against the TSR performance of Corbion’s TSR peer group and the relative ranking determines the actual pay-out for 20% of the LTIP. Meeting the performance target(s) results in an LTIP payout at target level. A range of 50% around the performance target(s) (or such lower percentage as determined by the Supervisory Board) is set for the EBITDA and EPS performance to determine the actual payout. There is no pay out below the low end of the range and no additional upside above the top end of the range. For the TSR performance, threshold pay out is set at meeting the eighth position in the peer group (consisting of sixteen companies). Target payout is achieved at the fourth and fifth position in the peer group and maximum payout is achieved at reaching the first and second position in the peer group. 108 CORBION REPORT OF THE BOARD OF MANAGEMENT 2015 Notes to the consolidated financial statements One-off time-restricted performance share award CEO At the time of his appointment in 2014, Mr. De Ruiter was granted a one-off time-restricted performance share award equivalent to a target value of € 2 million in Corbion shares to vest over four years. This award bridges part of the compensation gap between the United States and the Netherlands. The award encourages delivering a growing, increasingly profitable, and sustainable business portfolio. The value of one conditional share will be equal to the average share price of five days preceding the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting (AGM), no discounts are applied. The award vests in four equal parts per year, only if a minimum Corbion growth rate is achieved each year. Delivering predetermined long-term (4-year) innovation milestones allows for an additional vesting of up to 25% of the total number of shares in year 4. This means that the actual number of shares that vest, will range between 0% and 125% of the grant value. The value of the vested shares depends on the performance delivered and the share price development. In 2015, the plan was partially adjusted to be fully aligned with the updated strategy and consequently with the new remuneration policy. The performance period has been aligned with the regular long-term incentive plan, starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2017. Further, EBITDA growth has been introduced as annual performance metric (instead of sales growth) to be set at the beginning of each year by the Supervisory Board. Finally, the award is now subject to the general share ownership requirement of two times the annual base salary as defined in the new remuneration policy: as long as the CEO does not comply with these share ownership requirements, vested shares under this share award will be kept in a restricted account and cannot be traded (instead of a holding restriction for vested shares of one year after end of term of appointment).

Off-balance sheet financial rights and commitments Financial commitments As at 31 December 2015 the nominal value of future commitments from operational lease contracts for property, plant, and equipment was € 12.9 million (2014: € 13.2 million), € 4.4 million of which expires within one year, € 8.1 million between 1 and 5 years, and € 0.4 million after 5 years. Capital commitments The capital expenditure commitments not yet incurred amounted to € 2.9 million for (in)tangible assets as at 31 December 2015 (2014: € 2.2 million). Contingent commitments Guarantees Third-party guarantees amounted to € 3.4 million as at 31 December 2015 (2014: € 10.8 million). No significant future losses are expected from these guarantees. Other As the existing structure did not reflect the actual structural, management, and product-line organization of our business, the legal structure of our company was reorganized in 2012. The reorganization was complex involving several entities in various jurisdictions, and therefore could have tax consequences. Prior to carrying out the reorganization, we obtained appropriate outside professional advice confirming a limited tax risk associated with the reorganization.
