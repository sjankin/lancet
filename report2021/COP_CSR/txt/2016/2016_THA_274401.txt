Amidst 2015 economic slowdown, the Company remained committed to its missions: delivering safe and high-quality food products to more than three billion consumers in 40 countries together with creating values for stakeholders. Supply Chain Sustainability Management became our top priority in 2015. In addition to the ongoing efforts to ensure sustainability in the fishmeal supply chain, working in collaboration with our business partners, customers, government agencies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) since 2012 to eradicate illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU Fishing), as well as human trafficking, the Company has initiated a traceability system to cover the entire supply chain of corn used as raw materials for animal feed production. We have also promoted sustainable practices along the supply chain of other animal feed raw materials, food ingredients and condiments, and food packaging that are directly associated with the food quality and safety. Furthermore, the Company relentlessly pursued the development of innovations and improvement of existing products for new alternatives with better health benefits, such as food products that reduce risks for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), nutritious food products vital for children’s growth and development, as well as fresh and hygienic food products. We have also collaborated with hospitals, and domestic and international academic institutes on research projects to develop food products for patients suffering from various health conditions and people with specific dietary needs. Faced with the greatest environmental challenge of our times – climate change – we strive to enhance operational efficiency and mitigate the environmental impacts of our operations, in the production process and product development. We aimed to reduce our energy consumption and waste generation per production ton by 3 percent and to cut water use per production ton by 2.3 percent. We also targeted resource consumption in the production PARTNERSHIP FOR MUTUAL GROWTH 13 of packaging materials, with a reduction of more than 200 tons of plastics and paper materials used in food product packaging. On biodiversity protection, we have worked in integration with government agencies and civil societies, covering more than 2,000 rai of mangrove forest conservation and rehabilitation. These strategic sites were located in 5 provinces: Chumphon, Samut Sakhon, Rayong, Phangnga, and Songkhla. In Chumphon and Samut Sakhon, in particular, it was found that the mangrove forest plots replanted since 2014 had survival rates of 85 percent and 65 percent respectively. Our continued efforts to drive the sustainability agenda throughout the Company’s operations paid off in 2015 with a proud achievement. With a role in leading a company of the Thai people towards demonstrating its abilities on the global stage, we are prestigiously recognized as one among five companies from over 31 participating companies in the FOA Food Products for the membership of Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for the 2015 DJSI Emerging Markets. Also in this past year, we were accepted as a member of United Nations Global Compact: UNGC, with 10 principles covering 4 key areas: human rights, labor practices, the environment, and the anti-corruption. On behalf of the Board of Directors, executives, and all employees, we would like to express our gratitude to our shareholders, customers, communities, business partners, non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and all stakeholders, who have supported us and provided us with valuable comments and recommendations for our sustainability practices.

Each risk is determined based on both external factors, such as factors at the national and industry level, and internal factors that are relevant to the Company, such as factors that affects CPF’s supply chain (primary activities) and factors that affects the Company’s support functions (supporting activities). We also utilize other risk management tools such as risk correlation to understand the effect of a single event and determine where to deploy systematic responses to risks. However, the Company recognizes that the business expansion and the rapid changes we are facing result in a shift in risk landscape. We continually develop an effective and up-to-date risk management system so that we could foresee emerging risks that would have a long term impact on our business and could preemptively manage those risks effectively.

Undeniably, they are the consequences of human activities, be it from households, agriculture, transportation, tourism and services, and industrial sectors. The challenges have implications on our livelihoods, food security and the nation’s economic development. The World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2016 presents that water crises are becoming a global threat and will exacerbate in the next ten years. The World Bank’s Thailand Environment MonitorIntegrated Water Resources Management: A Way Forward published in 2011 projected that Thailand, an agriculture dependent country, would be more vulnerable to higher demand for water that would increase by 35 percent within 20 years. These environmental challenges have placed agriculture and food industry in an unavoidable difficult situation because natural resources are primary input for food production and critical to drive other activities, not to mention the influence of climate on the quantity and quality of agricultural produce. Management Approach The Company acknowledges that environmental challenges, climate change in particular, can have impacts on business continuity. Hence, we continue to improve, adapt, and develop our management approach in process and product so as to reduce environmental impacts from business activities. Our important work includes the followings: • Process Management We place high emphasis on taking a holistic approach in managing energy, water, effluent, waste, and air pollution with the application of the 4Rs Principle: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Replenish. We strictly adhere to CPF Safety Health Environment and Energy Standard (CPF SHE&En Standard) and applicable laws and regulations. In 2015, the Company completed the revision of CPF SHE&En Standard with the application of international guidelines such as Global Water Tool, Local Water Tool, and GHG Reporting in addition to the compliance with ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001. At the same time, we started the expansion of environmental reporting scope to the operations abroad and set the milestone to increase reporting coverage to all business operations around the world within 2017. The CPF SHE&En Standard is certified by third-party and second-party audits that meet international standards. Likewise, we set environmental targets to measure energy, water and waste performances as follows: PARTNERSHIP FOR MUTUAL GROWTH 79 Target SHE&En Indicators Unit 2015 Target % Decrease from 2014 Total Energy Consumption MJ/ton 1,335 3.0% Total Electricity Consumption MJ/ton 600 3.7% Total Water Consumption M3/ton 50 2.3% Total Waste Kg/ton 60 3.0% 2015 Performance Energy: The Company’s total energy consumption was 10.38 million gigajoules or 1,394 megajoules per ton which was higher than the target due to the change in energy composition to support process modification. However, we remain determined to conserve energy and improve energy efficiency through continuing over 21 projects, resulting in the reduction in energy consumption by 12 million megajoules per year.

In the meantime, we engaged with communities to learn process. about their concerns regarding water use. The water risk assessment helped us understand water situation around the operations. For example, we could identify the operations located in water-stressed areas that have the risk of competing with households or agriculture for water consumption. Therefore, the Company could engage the communities in water management planning more effectively. In conducting water assessment, we employed international tools such as Global Water Tool and Local Water Tool to analyze and formulate plan to mitigate water-related risks on communities. Effluent: The Company discharged water by 81.88 million cubic meters which 34.59 In 2015 the Company reuses treated water million for cubic meters the non-production was lower than the previous year. We place tremendous importance on and take process. highest responsibility in treating wastewater according to environmental standards. Our management starts from the source. We have in place high efficiency wastewater or treatment system, and monitor water quality prior to discharge to ensure regulatory compliance. Besides, we continuously improve our management approach to add economic value, for example, treating wastewater in order to produce and utilize biogas. Waste: The Company generated 0.44 million tons of waste, the amount similar to 34.59 that of the previous year. We manage our waste by minimizing waste generation at the source and during the production process, and monitoring waste performance of all operations. We continue adding value to waste from production process through several initiatives, for example, using chicken and duck manure as organic fertilizer, producing biogas for electricity generation from swine manure, generating methane 13.45% million cubic meters of total water from waste water to reduce fuel oil consumption, and producing biodiesel from used consumption or vegetable oils.

Terms of engagement Lloyd’s Register Quality Assurance Ltd. (LRQA) was commissioned by Charoen Pokphand Foods Public Company Limited (CPF) to provide independent assurance on its ‘Sustainability Report 2015’ (“the report”) against the assurance criteria below to a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier using ‘LRQA’s verification approach’. LRQA’s verification procedure is based on current best practise and uses the principles of AA1000AS (2008) inclusivity, materiality, responsiveness and reliability of performance data and processes defined in ISAE3000. Our assurance engagement covered CPF’s and their subsidiaries’ operations and activities in Thailand and specifically the following requirements:  Confirming that the Report is in accordance with:  GRI G4’s reporting guidelines and core option  GRI G4’s Food Processing Sector Disclosure  Evaluating the accuracy and reliability of data and information for only the selected indicators listed below:  G4-EN3 (Energy consumption within the organization)  G4-EN5 (Energy intensity)  G4-EN8 (Total water withdrawal by source)  G4-EN22 (Total water discharge by quality and destination)  G4-EN23 (Total weight of waste by type and disposal method)  G4-LA6 (Type of injury and rates of injury, occupational diseases, lost days, and absenteeism, and total number of work-related fatalities, by region and by gender)-our assurance engagement of this indicator does not include occupational diseases of CPF’s independent contractors.  G4-LA9 (Average hours of training per year per employee by gender, and by employee category)  G4-LA10 (Programs for skills management and lifelong learning that support the continued employability of employees and assist them in managing career endings). Our assurance engagement excluded the data and information of CPF’s operations and activities outside of Thailand and its associated and jointly-controlled entities both in Thailand and overseas. Our assurance engagement also excluded the safety, occupational health and environmental (SHE) indicators of its head offices, other offices and other business units apart from feed, farm, food processing, whole sale and food outlets and restaurant in Thailand. Our engagement of SHE indicators for restaurant in Thailand also excluded CP Kitchen and CP Food World. LRQA’s responsibility is only to CPF. LRQA disclaims any liability or responsibility to others as explained in the end footnote. CPF’s responsibility is for collecting, aggregating, analysing and presenting all the data and information within the Report and for maintaining effective internal controls over the systems from which the Report is derived. Ultimately, the Report has been approved by, and remains the responsibility of CPF. LRQA’s Opinion Based on LRQA’s approach nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to believe that CPF has not:  Met the requirements above  Disclosed accurate and reliable performance data and information as no errors or omissions were detected within the selected indicators  Covered all the issues that are important to the stakeholders and readers of this Report. The opinion expressed is formed on the basis of a limited level of assurance and at the materiality of the professional judgement of the verifier. Note: The extent of evidence-gathering for a limited assurance engagement is less than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Limited assurance engagements focus on aggregated data rather than physically checking source data at sites.  102 SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2015  LRQA’s approach LRQA’s assurance engagements are carried out in accordance with our verification procedure. The following tasks though were undertaken as part of the evidence gathering process for this assurance engagement:  Assessing CPF’s approach to stakeholder engagement to confirm that issues raised by stakeholders were captured correctly. We did this through reviewing documents and associated records.  Reviewing CPF’s process for identifying and determining material issues to confirm that the right issues were included in their Report. We did this by benchmarking reports written by CPF and its peers to ensure that sector specific issues were included for comparability. We also tested the filters used in determining material issues to evaluate whether CPF makes informed business decisions that may create opportunities that contribute towards sustainable development.  Auditing CPF’s data management systems to confirm that there were no significant errors, omissions or misstatements in the Report. We did this by reviewing the effectiveness of data handling procedures, instructions and systems, including those for internal verification. We also spoke with those key people responsible for compiling the data and drafting the Report.  Visiting sites of Khok Udom Swine Farm – Prachinburi Province, RY3 Shrimp Farm – Rayong Province, Baan Bueng Feed Mill -Chonburi Province, Pho-Ngam Broiler Farm – Saraburi Province, Prachinburi1 Swine Farm – Prachinburi Province, and Chachoengsao Food Processing Factory – Chachoengsao Province to sample evidence for the selected indicators to confirm their reliability. LRQA did not verify the data back to its original sources, nor did it assess the accuracy and completeness of the data reported by individual locations. Observations Further observations and findings, made during the assurance engagement, are:  Stakeholder inclusivity: We are not aware of any key stakeholder groups that have been excluded from CPF’s stakeholder engagement process. The Report content, as well as CPF’s visions for addressing sustainability development, has then been informed by the views and expectations of these stakeholders.  Materiality: We are not aware of any material issues concerning CPF’s sustainability performance that have been excluded from the Report. It should be noted that CPF has processes for identifying and determining their material aspects; the evaluation process considers factors such as stakeholder concerns, potential impact to economic, social and environment by consideration of global trend, media analysis, business risk and issues addressed by peers. These aspects have then been prioritised and influenced CPF’s performance disclosures and that these criteria are not biased to CPF’s management.  Responsiveness: CPF and its subsidiaries in Thailand have processes for responding to concerns from various stakeholder groups. We believe that these communication processes are effective in explaining CPF’s aim in contributing towards sustainable development. However, even though it was noted that one of its peer’s concern on animal welfare was not captured effectively by CPF’s direct stakeholder engagement activities, CPF has disclosed its management approach on this issue. We believe, however, that future reports should explicitly provide more information about CPF’s management approaches relevant to animal welfare performance by disclosing material sector specific indicators in accordance with the GRI G4’s Food Processing Sector Disclosure.  Reliability: Data management systems are considered to be properly defined and centralized for the data and information collection and calculation associated with the selected indicators. CPF also has processes for internal data verification to ensure the quality of its reported data and information. We believe that a systematic and periodic implementation of this internal verification at facility level would help prevent errors being identified at corporate level. We also believe that the accuracy of the indicators for BOD and Nitrogen load of water discharge will improve by increasing the frequency of analysis.  Comparability: The reported information is considered to be presented in a manner that enables stakeholders to analyse changes in CPF’s performance over time. However, we believe that future Reports should not only present the total performance for these SHE indicators but also separately according to each CPF business type (i.e. Feed, Farm, Food, Restaurant, Retail and Food outlets); this will further support performance analysis against other organizations in similar sectors.  PARTNERSHIP FOR MUTUAL GROWTH 103  LRQA’s competence and independence LRQA ensures the selection of appropriately qualified individuals based on their qualifications, training and experience. The outcome of all verification and certification assessments is then internally reviewed by senior management to ensure that the approach applied is rigorous and transparent. LRQA has not provided any kind of services except this sustainability report verification to CPF. The verification assessments, is the only work undertaken by LRQA for CPF and as such does not compromise our independence or impartiality.
