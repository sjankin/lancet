Full support of the UN Global Compact Since 2005 E.ON has been committed to upholding the ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact. With more than 8,600 participants from over 162 countries, the Global Compact is the world’s largest sustainability initiative. Basis for company policies and standards As a signatory to the UN Global Compact we affirm our commitment to respect human rights, uphold labour and environmental protection standards, and fight against corruption. We use the ten principles to develop our own standards and guidelines. At the same time we align the work program for our sustainability management, internal compliance systems and the prequalification of new suppliers with this framework. As a result of our participation in national and international Global Compact networks – for instance, in Germany and Sweden – we strengthen collaboration across industries. Reporting on the principles of the Global Compact Our commitment to the Global Compact includes reporting on the annual progress in implementing the ten principles (Communication on Progress – COP).
