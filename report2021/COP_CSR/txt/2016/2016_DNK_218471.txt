CPH evaluates the carrying amounts in order to assess whether events have occurred that require an adjustment of these amounts because they are not expected to be recoverable. In the estimation of the runways' useful lives, CPH has chosen to divide the system into three elements: foundation, surface and technical installations. CPH's assessment is that each unit has a different useful life. The runway surfaces have shorter lives than the foundation due to immediate wear. Useful life expectancy is 10 years. This assessment is supported by historical replacement of runway surface and planning for future replacement. Technical installations related to the runways are estimated to have a useful life of 15 years. It is assessed that technical installations do not have the same useful life as other technical installations taking into account the security measures. In assessing the recoverable amount, CPH takes into account significant indicators of potential impairment such as purchase and sales prices, and general market conditions. 85 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S NOTES Note 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2015 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools and equipment under DKK million equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 7,112.9 6,840.8 1,656.3 527.8 16,137.8 Additions 1,039.5 1,039.5 Disposals (10.5) (120.5) (73.6) (204.6) Transferred 239.8 445.0 112.5 (797.3) Accumulated cost at 31 December 7,342.2 7,165.3 1,695.2 770.0 16,972.7 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,675.8 3,371.1 1,163.4 7,210.3 Depreciation 179.0 263.1 121.7 563.8 Depreciation on disposals (13.2) (118.0) (73.4) (204.6) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 2,841.6 3,516.2 1,211.7 7,569.5 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,500.6 3,649.1 483.5 770.0 9,403.2 * CPH properties have been mortgaged for a total of DKK 507.7 million (2014: DKK 600.5 million). 86 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S NOTES Note 11 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 2014 Land and Plant and Other fixtures Property, plant and Total buildings* machinery and fittings, tools and equipment under DKK million equipment construction Cost Accumulated cost at 1 January 7,149.1 6,716.3 1,571.4 287.4 15,724.2 Additions 815.3 815.3 Disposals (153.3) (205.1) (43.3) (401.7) Transferred 117.1 329.6 128.2 (574.9) Accumulated cost at 31 December 7,112.9 6,840.8 1,656.3 527.8 16,137.8 Depreciation Accumulated depreciation at 1 January 2,650.8 3,321.6 1,082.4 7,054.8 Depreciation 178.2 254.6 124.1 556.9 Depreciation on disposals (153.2) (205.1) (43.1) (401.4) Accumulated depreciation at 31 December 2,675.8 3,371.1 1,163.4 7,210.3 Carrying amount at 31 December 4,437.1 3,469.7 492.9 527.8 8,927.5 * See previous page for information. 87 CO N S O L I DAT E D F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S NOTES Note 12 TRADE RECEIVABLES The year's movements are recognised in the income statement under External costs .

The water is analysed for BOD, COD, N, P, fuel, heavy metals, glycol, ammonium and formic acid. It is the year’s rainfall on CPH’s land that determines how much surface water is discharged into the Øresund. This means there can be large variations in the amounts from To minimise the discharge of oil components via the surface water system, approximately year to year. 143 oil separators have been set up in the airport area. A fixed procedure of regular sounding and emptying ensures optimal removal of oil in order to avoid it from ending in The number of recorded oil spills fell significantly year on year, and the total volume also the surface water system. decreased. As these spills represent unintended events, there may be relatively large fluctuations from year to year. The volume of surface water discharged into the Øresund is measured at the largest outlet and is calculated based on areas and precipitation data for the other outlets. Oil and fuel spills: The number of oil and fuel spills is calculated as the number of reports filed by CPH’s internal organisation or the fuel delivery companies. Calculation of the volume of spills is subject to some uncertainty, as it is rarely possible to measure the exact volume of a spill. 126 CO N S O L I DAT E D N O N F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S (S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N FO R M AT I O N – N OT AU D I T E D) NOTES Note Note 32 RUNWAY DE-ICING 33 AIRCRAFT DE-ICING Accounting policies Accounting policies The consumption of runway and taxiway de-icers is calculated on the basis of the volumes Copenhagen Airport is at its highest alert level during the winter season.
