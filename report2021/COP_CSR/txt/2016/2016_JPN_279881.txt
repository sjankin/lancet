Here, the increased use of motor vehicles accompanying economic growth has overloaded the area’s road infrastructure, resulting in traffic congestion that is already the world’s worst and worsening with each passing year. The first attempt to resolve this chronic congestion will be the Jakarta Mass Rapid Transit 、 (MRT) North-South Line, a corridor 23.8 km long. A joint venture (JV) led by Shimizu is undertaking excavation work on parts of this line, which includes a 5.9 km underground segment in the city center.

Independent Assurance Report Mr. Kazuyuki Inoue President Masahiko Tsukahara Representative Director SHIMIZU CORPORATION Kenji Sawami Executive Officer Ernst & Young Sustainability Co., Ltd. Tokyo We, Ernst & Young Sustainability Co., Ltd., have been commissioned by SHIMIZU CORPORATION (hereafter “the Company”) to provide limited assurance on the Key Sustainability Performance Indicators (hereafter “the Indicators”) of the Company for the year ended March 31,2016 included in the Company’ s Ecological Mission 2030-2050 section of the Shimizu Corporate Repor t 2016 (hereafter “the Repor t”). The scope of our work was limited to assurance over the information marked with the symbol in the Report. 1. The Company’ s Responsibilities The Company is responsible for preparing the Indicators in accordance with the Company’ s own criteria determined in consideration of Japanese Environmental Laws. The criteria represent Data in 2016, 2.Ecological Missions 2030-2050, 2.1. Estimation Standards (http://www.shimz.co.jp/csr/environment/repor t/pdf/data_2016.pdf) of the Repor t.

Our Independence and Quality Control We have complied with the independence requirements defined in the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by Environmental Award, Group II the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants in March 2013, which is based on the fundamental principles of integrity, objectiveness, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior. In addition, as a member of Er nst & Young ShinNihon LLC, our parent company, we maintain a comprehensive quality control system, including documented policies and procedures for compliance with ethical rules, professional standards, and applicable laws and regulations in accordance with the International Standard on Quality Control 1 issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in April 2009. 3. Our Responsibilities Our responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion on the Indicators included in the Report based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained. We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information, issued by the Inter national Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in December 2013, Practical Guidelines for the Assurance of Sustainability Information, revised in December 2014 by the Japanese Association of Assurance Organizations for Sustainability Information and, in respect of GHG emissions, the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3410, Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements, issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board in June Inspecting evidence for forms and data 2012.

As a result, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is not as that obtained if Musashi University Ekoda Campus we had performed a reasonable assurance engagement. 4.
