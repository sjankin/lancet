Scientists have studied this and determined that the giraffe’s tough, non-elastic skin works like the anti-gravity suits worn by astronauts, preventing the stagnation of blood in their lower extremities. That inspired scientists at 3M to create a compression system to help treat a painful human medical condition called venous leg ulcers, which are caused by uncontrolled high pressure in the veins of the lower leg. Venous leg ulcers are extremely common in the United States and affect between 500,000 to two million people annually. Scientists at 3M figured out that the giraffe’s thick and tight skin functions like nature’s best compression bandage, and they created a material that reproduces the properties of this skin to help humans. They took the elastic wraps we use when we sprain our ankles or wrists, and modified the material to engineer a leading two-layer compression system that mimics the skin of a giraffe. 3M 2016 Sustainability Report Health and Safety | 103 3M WORLDWIDE – BY REGION Lost Time Trends 3M Worldwide – By Region Lost Time Trends 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 Lost Time IR 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Asia Pacific Canada Europe MEA Latin America United States Worldwide 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Asia Pacific 0.42 0.11 0.18 0.12 0.08 0.03 0.04 Canada 0.15 0.10 0.18 0.27 0.13 0.13 0.14 Europe/ MEA 0.57 0.51 0.62 0.62 0.43 0.35 0.44 Latin America 0.26 0.42 0.29 0.32 0.16 0.55 0.37 United States 0.55 0.46 0.42 0.46 0.48 0.44 0.4 Worldwide 0.5 0.36 0.38 0.39 0.34 0.36 0.32 3M 2016 Sustainability Report Health and Safety | 104 3M WORLDWIDE – BY REGION Recordable Trends 3M Worldwide – By Region Recordable Trends 3.5 3.0 2.5 2.0 Recordable IR 1.5 1.0 .5 0 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Asia Pacific Canada Europe MEA Latin America United States Worldwide 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Asia Pacific 0.62 0.46 0.49 0.44 0.35 0.41 0.34 Canada 0.49 0.48 0.75 1.08 0.98 0.86 0.82 Europe/ MEA 0.77 0.75 1.08 1.11 0.95 0.92 0.7 Latin America 0.56 0.55 0.67 0.55 0.67 0.93 0.64 United States 2.64 2.90 2.3 2.3 2.34 2.3 2.12 Worldwide 1.53 1.56 1.46 1.42 1.41 1.45 1.22 3M 2016 Sustainability Report Health and Safety | 105 3M WORLDWIDE Recordable Incident Rates by Cause 3M Worldwide – By Incident Type Recordable Trends 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Ergonomic Contact with object/equipment Slip, trip, fall Exposure, chemical Miscellaneous Noise exposure Transportation accident Exposure, biological agent Physical agent exposure 3M 2016 Sustainability Report Education and Development | 106 Global Challenges Education and Development 3M works hard to create a better world for everyone; our sustainability approach revolves around education Approach and development within global communities and our G4 An inclusive culture at 3M is built on our Human workforce.

This Assu urance State ement applie es to the related information include ed within the scope of work desccribed below w. The intend ded users of the assurancce statement are the sta akeholders off 3M. The overall aim of this proce ess is to provvide assurance to 3M’s stakeholders s on the accuracy, relia ability and obbjectivity of th he informatio on included inn the Reportt as describe ed in the scoppe of workk. The asssurance process also evaluated 3M’s 3 manag gement of sustainabilitty in acco ordance with h the principlees of inclusivvity, materialiity and respo onsiveness. The information that was asssured and itss presentatio on in the Rep port are the sole s responsibility he managem of th ment of 3M. Bureau B Verittas was not involved in th he drafting of the Report. Our solee responsibilitty was to pro ovide independent assura ance on its content. c Sco ope of work k 3M rrequested Bu ureau Veritas to include in its indepen ndent assura ance the folloowing:  Data inccluded in the e Report for the calendarr year 2015 reporting pe eriod as showwn in the attacched Summa ary of Assure ed Informatioon;  Approprriateness and robustnesss of underlying reportin ng systems and processses, used to collect, analyyze and revie ew the data subject to the assurance e process; annd  Evaluation of the Report R in acccordance w with the Assu urance Stan ndard AA100 00AS (2008)1 Type 2 assurance.

Review of 3M data and information systems for collection, aggregation, analysis and internal verification and review. The work was planned and carried out to provide a moderate level of assurance and we believe it provides a sound basis for our conclusions. Our findings On the basis of our methodology and the activities described above:  Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information within the scope of our verification is not materially correct.  Nothing has come to our attention to indicate that the reviewed information is not a fair representation of the actual environmental and health and safety data for calendar year 2015.  It is our opinion that 3M has established appropriate systems for the collection, aggregation and analysis of quantitative data, including energy use, direct and indirect GHG emissions, water consumption, waste quantities and disposition, injury and illness rate, lost day rate, severity rate and number of environmental violations. A summary of data within the scope of assurance for 2015 is attached. Adherence to the AA1000 Accountability Principles Based on the work undertaken during this assurance process, we are of the opinion that 3M adheres to the Accountability Principles of inclusivity, materiality and responsiveness as discussed below. Inclusivity Based on discussions with 3M, their processes appear to be inclusive of stakeholders. For example, 3M commissioned a third party provider to assist with stakeholder mapping and engagement. One of the goals of the work was to identify and prioritize stakeholders based on a range of criteria including the organization’s perceived level of influence, willingness to engage and the potential benefits of engagement. Subsequently, interviews were conducted and a quantitative survey was done with internal and external stakeholders. 3M has developed a list of external stakeholders that includes about 2,000 contacts. Materiality 3M commissioned a materiality assessment as described in their 2015 Sustainability Report. The 2015 Sustainability Report explained the materiality assessment which considered the importance of issues to both internal and external stakeholders. The results of the materiality assessment were used to develop the 2025 goals that are presented in the 2016 Sustainability Report. Responsiveness Some examples of how 3M responds to stakeholder regarding sustainability issues are through conference calls regarding the Sustainability Report, participation in investor calls, and responding to comments received through 3M.com. In response to shareholder interest, 3M presented their sustainability report and goals during the 2015 annual meeting. Key Observations for 2015  3M’s commitment to continuous improvement in environmental performance was evident from the development and implementation of Water Conservation Plans. Also goals have been set for additional planning in water scarce areas.  The commitment to decrease potential greenhouse gas emissions is shown through the improvements to air emission controls that specifically have decreased emissions of high global warming potential compounds.  C Community involvement and giving is evidenced d by develop pment and im mplementatio on of Stakeholder Engagemen S nt Plans. 3M provide es community support through Vissiting Wizards, and many other engage W ements in thet commun nity. Corporately, the 3M F Foundation provides p fund ding to a variety recipients.  S Systems for collecting c and compiling data appear to be succes ssful for developing the Report, although some op R f improvem pportunities for ment were ob bserved at th he site level.
